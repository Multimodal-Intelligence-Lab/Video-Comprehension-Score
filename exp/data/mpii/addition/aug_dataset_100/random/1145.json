As he moves forward, it crashes closed in front of him, and the hedges on either side grow together, hemming him in. He forces his way through the dense branches as they close in around him, lashing him across the face. Meanwhile, Viktor plods along in his steady boots, carrying his wand, and Harry spins around as he hears a sound behind him. Viktor's eyes are glazed over. Fleur runs frantically between the hedges, reaches a dead end, panics, runs back the way she came, and, with her face clammy with fear, she stares uncertainly down the misty pathway. Hearing something behind her, she turns, and Harry hears her scream. Viktor leans over Fleur, who lies on the ground, staring slightly, and looks up with his eyes cloudy. Sinuous roots creep towards Fleur from under the hedge. Harry runs in the direction of the scream, peers through the swirling mist, and spots Viktor. Harry draws back into the hedge as Viktor shines the lighted end of his wand straight into Harry's face, but, as Viktor's eyes are clouded over and he fails to see Harry, he passes by. Harry searches for Fleur, and as he reaches her, she vanishes from sight, drawn under the hedge by a tangle of sinuous roots.",
