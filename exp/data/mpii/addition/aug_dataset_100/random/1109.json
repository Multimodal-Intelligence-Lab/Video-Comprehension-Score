They run through it, and in the girls' lavatory, all the taps are running. Harry and Ron look around at the overflowing sinks and spot Myrtle sitting high up on a curved stone windowsill.

Later, he sits at his desk and flicks through the dried-out pages, which are all blank. He flicks through the book again and sees a name stamped in gold letters on the back. He puts the book down, picks up a quill, and dips it into the inkwell. As he goes to write on the first empty page, a drop of ink falls from the quill, hits the paper, and slowly disappears.",
