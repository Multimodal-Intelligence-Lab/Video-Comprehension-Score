In the distance, they see again the dog and the werewolf fighting by the willow tree, and Harry and Hermione run through the undergrowth. Ahead of them, the werewolf flings the dog against the rock, and Harry sees himself throwing a stone and the werewolf turning and advancing on him. Hermione howls as they race back the way they came through the moonlit forest, stumbling over the uneven ground. Close behind, the savage werewolf lopes easily after them, and Harry trips over a tree root, but Hermione helps him up. Eventually, they stop to catch their breath, hiding behind the gnarled trunk of a huge tree. The werewolf sniffs the ground and then disappears around the other side of the tree, and they look around cautiously before creeping away nervously. The vicious creature appears behind them; it moves forward and rears up, about to strike. Flapping his huge wings, Buckbeak attacks, claws the werewolf with his talons, and it slinks away. Hermione hides her face on Harry's shoulder as a blast of air scatters the dry leaves at their feet. They look up to see a swarm of Dementors moving ominously across the sky, and holding Hermione's hand, Harry leads the way towards the lake.",
