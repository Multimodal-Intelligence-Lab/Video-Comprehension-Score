Harry and his friends climb the moving staircase towards a portrait of a fat lady holding a glass and singing, which she smashes against a pillar. The portrait swings back, and they go into the common room where a ghost walks through them, and the boys try magic sweets. Neville chews the sweet, Ron tries one, and steam shoots from Harry's ears. Outside the window, the rain lashes down and lightning flashes as the storm rages around Hogwarts Castle, with black-cloaked Dementors hovering outside the school grounds. A small bird flies along the stone cloister, swoops down a grassy slope towards a crooked willow tree, which pulls back a branch and thwacks the bird, causing feathers to fly. In a classroom, she recoils, then outside the school, the students follow Hagrid around the edge of the sunlit forest to a grassy clearing surrounded by a low wall where Malfoy strokes his monster book, which purrs contentedly. Malfoy slowly approaches Harry, stares at him arrogantly, then, looking terrified, points over Harry's shoulder, and Harry spins round as his cronies pull up their hooded cloaks. Neville looks bedraggled next to a magnificent creature that stands in front of them, and all but Harry step back as Ron gives Harry a push. Nervously, Harry moves forward and bows to the creature, which flaps its huge wings and bows its birdlike head. Hagrid throws a tidbit while Malfoy pushes to the front, and Harry stretches out his hand as Hermione clutches Ron's hand and they both look embarrassed. Harry pats the creature, and as Hagrid smacks its hindquarters, it raises its huge wings and takes off while Harry hangs on desperately to Buckbeak's feathery neck, the four-legged creature, half-horse, half-eagle, rising above the trees.",
