The tunnel gradually opens out into a large dimly lit hollow filled with twisted tree roots; Harry and Ron follow the spiders as they swarm across it. But the path stops at a huge hole in the ground surrounded by crumpled cobwebs. The guide disappeared into the hole, and unable to go further, the boys stopped a little away from it. Harry holds up the lantern, unsure of what to do next, and Harry and Ron back away as several long hairy legs emerge from the hole, and a huge spider as big as a double-decker bus holds itself above the edge and peers down at them.

He nods politely to Aragog, and Harry swings the lantern but drops it. They pull out their wands as the spiders close in.",
