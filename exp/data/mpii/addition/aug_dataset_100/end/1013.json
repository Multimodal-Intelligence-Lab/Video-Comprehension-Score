She flinches, quickly composes herself, and moves on as the crowd of onlookers watches her looking at the flowers. The Queen looks increasingly upset as she tries to maintain her composure but keeps moving along, looking at more flowers and notes. She stops, turns back to the crowd, and smiles before walking up to the barriers to meet the people. Various young women stand at the front, and the Queen moves slowly along and smiles at them. She stops in front of a little girl who holds a bouquet of flowers, which the girl hands to the Queen, and the Queen smiles and continues to move along. A group of older women curtsy as the Queen passes them, and as she walks, Prince Philip follows close by, with more women curtsying as she moves along. In an ornate hall, Robin walks past some TV lighting and camera equipment and approaches the Queen, who sits on a sofa next to Philip. The Queen takes a pen from her purse and writes on a sheet of paper, walks to a nearby table, puts the sheet down, studies it for a moment, and then walks up to a podium that has been placed in front of a window. Philip strolls to another side of the room and watches the TV crew and the Queen as a young makeup woman applies powder to the Queen's nose with crowds visible outside the window. Video footage outside Buckingham Palace shows that the TV lights are set up inside a hall in Buckingham Palace. Back inside, Charles enters and stands next to Prince Philip, while the makeup woman finishes applying powder to the Queen's face.",
