In the enclosed Plaza Mayor, a seething crowd watches a helicopter overhead. The man in the checked shirt, Howard Lewis, is videoing. He records the upper windows and one of the many arches in the plaza while kids shout hello from some of the balconies. Howard walks away from the kids and resumes videoing. The timer on his LCD screen reads nearly two hours and two minutes as he strolls deeper into the crowd, his camera focused above their heads. He pans his camera around, and on the LCD screen he sees Veronica by the pillar with the young man Enrique saw her with. He zooms in as she places something in his hand and clutches his palm, then lowers his gaze and stops filming as their heads move closer. Howard films some more until a short man approaches him, and a little girl bumps him with her ice cream. Sam leaves, and the little girl sobs.",
