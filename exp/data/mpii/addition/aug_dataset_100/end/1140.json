From the grinning mouth of a skull emerges the head of a large snake. Flickering its tongue, it slithers down onto a narrow path and moves silently between the gravestones in a dark and overgrown cemetery. The reptile's lithe body shimmers as it glides swiftly along the uneven path. The snake slides past a stone statue of a skeleton with huge wings, draped in a hooded cloak and holding a scythe. Metallic silver letters appear in the dark, glowering sky. A huge dilapidated house stands silhouetted against the night sky. A light is switched on in a cottage nearby. A disheveled old man lights the gas and puts on a kettle. He takes the top off a teapot, and picks up a tea bag. Through the kitchen window, he notices a light in the big house.",
