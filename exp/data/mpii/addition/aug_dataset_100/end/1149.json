Hagrid guides the horses to land and dives for cover as the coach flies low over his head. A tall mast flying a slender pennant emerges from the center of the lake, and a huge golden galleon rises majestically to the surface, with water spilling from its decks. Huge sails are unfurled, and the great ship glides smoothly toward the school. Gasping for breath, Filch, the caretaker, runs down the hall and whispers to Professor Dumbledore before running out again. A troop of elegant girls glide into the hall, dancing in blue silk uniforms that flatter their slim figures, and Ron gawks at the girls as tiny bluebirds flutter around them. Seamus gapes as the headmistress, Madame Maxime, who is over eight feet tall, passes and towers over Professor Dumbledore. The visitors drop a graceful curtsy, and Madame Maxime smiles graciously, her face framed by a huge fur collar, and extends her hand for Dumbledore to reach up and kiss. The Durmstrang students stride dramatically into the hall, wearing Slavic, military-style uniforms, each carrying a long staff, and sparks fly as they spin them round and strike the stone floor. Two of them hurtle forward, somersaulting high into the air as a handsome student with close-cropped hair strides past, whom Ron recognizes as his Quidditch hero. A student blows a ring of fire, and High Master Karkaroff, wearing a long white coat and a Russian hat, greets Dumbledore. A storm rages around Hogwarts as a dark, disheveled figure limps through the rain toward the school, and Hagrid accidentally stabs Professor Flitwick's hand.",
