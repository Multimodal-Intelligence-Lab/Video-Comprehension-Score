Hagrid slumps forward, hit by a bolt from a death eater, and Harry grabs the handlebars, forcing the motorbike up into the air. Hedwig flies towards them and attacks the chasing death eater, but as the owl swoops to attack again, she is hit by a bolt of green light and tumbles earthwards. The death eater pulls back, and Harry suddenly cries out in pain, his face contorting as another ominous, dark figure closes in. Harry slumps forward, his jagged scar illuminated by the bike's headlight. As they speed between two lines of electric pylons, Harry's wand lights of its own accord. The dark figure draws level, and the power flowing from Harry's wand connects with an equal force of pulsating energy. The swirling vortex of light travels up Voldemort's wand, illuminating his face, and an explosion rocks the bike. Harry presses the control button, and the bike zooms away, spewing out flames that propel Voldemort backwards as the electric pylons collapse. Harry, Hagrid, and the bike soar upwards beyond the clouds, and Hagrid comes to and takes control of the bike. As Harry settles back into the sidecar, the engine fails, and they hurdle downwards. Molly Weasley hears them break through the protective shield around their house as they plummet towards the ground, making a bumpy landing in a reed bed.",
