Meanwhile, three men in the barber shop watch the news on television, and Jenny fills customer's coffee cups. Forrest continues running as a young man runs up to him and jogs behind him, as Forrest runs up a slope on a high mountain road with a group of people jogging behind him. The large group follows Forrest across the desert road, through a small town, where a man runs up and talks to him, while a hippie stops to ponder a profound thought. A truck with a bumper sticker drives into an intersection and collides with a car. Forrest runs, followed by his group, as another man runs up to him. Forrest wipes his face on a towel and hands it back to the man, who looks at the T-shirt. Forrest runs with a group that follows behind him until he stops, and the group stops behind him. Forrest stands and looks as the group waits expectantly, then he turns and looks, walks toward the group, which parts for him as he walks down the middle of the road. A television shows President Reagan and his staff reacting to gunshots in front of a limo, while Forrest sits eating a sandwich, watching the news of the assassination attempt. Forrest takes a letter out of his pocket, which an elderly woman looks at, then hastily grabs his suitcase and letter as he stands. A truck honks its horn as Forrest runs across the street past the truck, and the elderly woman shouts from the bus stop bench as Jenny opens and then shuts the door.",
