Meanwhile, Javier stands in the elevator, staring at a CCTV camera, and reaches the fourth floor where he strolls down a corridor, slots a swipe card into a machine on a hotel room door, and unlocks it. Inside, he removes a hold-all from a fridge, takes a pistol from it, loads the pistol, and puts an earpiece in. In the plaza, Sam sees Veronica take the bag from Enrique and glances up at a marksman. Howard talks with Anna, and Sam watches Enrique depart before disappearing into the crowd. Wearing a backpack, Javier screws a silencer onto his pistol as he climbs a flight of steps in the hotel and uses a touchscreen PDA to activate the fan in the window overlooking the plaza, causing the curtain to flutter, which Barnes sees. Sam turns his back and walks away, while Javier stalks through the hotel corridors with his pistol drawn, shoots a hotel maid, and a gun falls from her hand. He goes to use the key card at a room door and gently pushes on his earpiece. In the crowd, Sam fiddles with his phone as he walks, and a receiver bleeps in a high window, with a rifle rotating on a motorized tripod. The view from the sight is relayed to Sam's phone, and he uses the wand to train the rifle on Ashton's double, tapping the screen as the double steps up to the podium with his arm outstretched. The gun fires, shooting Ashton's double, causing the crowd to disperse, and Taylor squats over Ashton's double. Javier shoots uniformed security guards in the hotel's CCTV control room, unplugs a laptop, and makes a call on his cell phone, while Sam enters the digits into his phone.",
