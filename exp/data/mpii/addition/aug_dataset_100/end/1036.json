In a meeting with Craig and other employees, Ryan looks at the schedule for the Gold Quest Conference on his laptop. At home, he takes a couple of whiskey miniatures from his fridge and stands looking out of a window with a drink in his hand. A large video screen outside a Las Vegas hotel displays a caption. Ryan waits in the wings of a packed conference hall, and smartly suited, he puts his backpack on a table and steps up to a lectern. Computer-generated backpacks revolve on the screens behind him, and Ryan looks out across the room full of seated delegates.

Ryan runs through the airport, dragging his case with one hand, while a boarding pass flaps in the other. He reaches a Departure gate, gets the pass checked, and goes through. On a jet, Ryan gazes out of the window at the nighttime lights of Chicago. In a flurry of snow, Ryan picks up a Hertz rental car, signs, gets in, and drives away.",
