Three young boys get off their bikes and pick up more rocks, and Forrest is hit in the eye with another dirt clod, causing him to fall backward onto the ground as the boys glare at him. Jenny helps Forrest back up as Boy #1 and Boy #2 throw more dirt clods at him, with another one hitting him in the arm. Forrest tries to run along the road, but his braces make it impossible, so he hobbles along as Jenny yells after him. Boy #1 and Boy #2 turn back toward the bikes, and the boys ride after Forrest, who continues to hobble along the dirt road while Jenny stands and watches. Forrest looks over his shoulder as the three boys race on their bikes, and he begins to run faster with his braces on as they chase him. Blood drips from a cut on his head, but he continues running despite the boys on the bikes gaining on him. Forrest hobbles along and then begins to gain speed, running from the chasing boys. The boys pedal faster as they gain on Forrest, who looks over his shoulder in fear and tries to run even faster to get away. Suddenly, his braces shatter, sending steel and plastic flying into the air. Surprised, Forrest runs and looks down at his legs as he continues to run faster, with the metal braces and straps flying off his legs.",
