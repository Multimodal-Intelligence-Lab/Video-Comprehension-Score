They both look over at Mr. Darcy, and then Lizzie gets up and sets the music out for Georgiana before making her way across the room, only to be stopped by Miss Bingley. Mr. Darcy sits up, and embarrassed, Lizzie hurries back over to Georgiana. Slowly, Lizzie raises her eyes to meet Mr. Darcy's, who sits across the room, watching her with an enraptured expression. The two gaze at each other, their eyes filled with warmth and understanding. Later, as dusk falls, a carriage pulls away from Pemberley, waved off by Mr. Bingley, Mr. Darcy, and Georgiana. Mr. Bingley and Georgiana head inside together, arm in arm, but Mr. Darcy remains on the doorstep, watching the carriage clatter down the long, curving driveway. Moments later, he and Mr. Bingley stride back into the drawing room, where Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley are waiting, and he gives Miss Bingley a piercing stare, causing her to look away. Mr. Darcy then walks through the magnificent portrait-lined hall at Pemberley, holding aloft a candle to light his way, with two dogs trotting at his heels. He enters the now-darkened drawing room and places the candle on a mantelpiece, pausing for a moment, leaning against the fireplace as if lost in thought, before looking over at the piano Lizzie was playing earlier and softening his expression as he remembers her lifting her eyes to meet his in a moment frozen in time. The next day dawns grey and misty over Pemberley as Darcy stands in front of his mirror, getting dressed, while his butler brings him his frock coat, which he takes and pulls on. Dressed immaculately in a bottle-green frock coat, cream breeches, riding boots, and a top hat, he gallops through the grounds on his white horse, giving it a faint tap with a whip to speed up the grassy hill.",
