The trucks pull up, and the troops, dressed in khaki fatigues and wearing wide-brimmed hats with a gold-colored Burmese military emblem, order a group of terrified and cowering peasants off the truck and onto the road while brandishing rifles. The troops pass cash among themselves, as an officer in dark glasses sits coolly smoking a cigarette in one of the trucks. A soldier walks in a nearby paddy field and tosses a primed grenade, causing the villagers to cower. The soldier then primes and tosses two more grenades, which splash harmlessly on sodden ground, before stopping about 100 yards from the truck. The peasants are pushed at gunpoint to the edge of the field and begin to half-run, half-stumble across the paddy field towards the solitary soldier as the troops watch impassively, and the commander pulls on his cigarette. One of the peasants is blown to pieces, leaving the rest to stand still. The commander nods to a soldier, and at the command, the troops open fire, shooting down the peasants. Low clouds hover above mountains, with a verdant valley edged with ferns and a small stream running through it. Captions in military white type appear as a mustachioed local man in a baseball cap and striped T-shirt pokes undergrowth with a stick, joined by a second man wearing a bandana and a red shirt, and a third man, John Rambo.
