Ryan Bingham, a suavely seated man in his late 40s with neat graying hair and a side parting, interacts with Steve, who hands over his key card at the door.

He zips up the suitcase, pulls out its handle, drags it out of the room, and switches off the light as he goes. At an airport, Ryan drops off a rental car and walks up to the First Class priority access desk, grabs his boarding pass, and shows it to a security guard. He puts his case on a table, grabs two gray plastic trays, and places his laptop, shoes, and suit jacket into them. He steps through the walk-through metal detector, holding up his boarding pass, and passes the security check.",
