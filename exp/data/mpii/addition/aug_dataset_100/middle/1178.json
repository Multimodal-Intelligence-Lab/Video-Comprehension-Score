Back at 4 Privet Drive, Vernon grabs Harry by the hair and locks him into the cupboard under the stairs. A tawny owl flies low over Privet Drive and drops a letter, and inside Number 4, Harry picks up the post from the doormat—two letters and a postcard. One of the letters is sealed with wax, and Harry's eyes widen with surprise as he reads the address written in emerald green ink. As he walks slowly into the kitchen, still staring at the envelope, Dudley snatches the letter out of his hand. Uncle Vernon turns the letter over and looks at the coat of arms on the back, staring at his wife with horror, while Harry looks confused. An owl drops another letter, which flies into the letter box at Number 4, and the big bird joins two more perched on the TV aerial. Uncle Vernon tears up three identical letters addressed to Harry, and Harry peeps out of his cupboard and sees his uncle blocking up the letter box. Aunt Petunia sees Uncle Vernon off to work and stares at the owls perched on the car roof rack. She touches his arm as five more letters lie on the path at their feet.",
