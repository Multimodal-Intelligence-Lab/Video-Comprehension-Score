A moving van is parked in front of the colonial house next door to the Burnhams', while a Mercedes-Benz pulls into the Burnham driveway with Carolyn driving and Lester in the passenger seat. As they get out of the car, Carolyn scopes out the movers next door who carry furniture toward the house, and then she heads into the house, followed by Lester. Lester, Carolyn, and Jane are eating dinner by candlelight, with red roses bunched in a vase at the center of the table. Lester suddenly turns to Jane, who looks at him as if he's lost his mind, while Carolyn watches closely. Carolyn gets up, heads toward the kitchen, and is gone. Lester notices Carolyn looking at him critically and remains quiet, staring at his plate, before getting up and starting after Jane, taking his plate with him. Jane stands at the sink, rinsing her plate when Lester enters. Jane turns and stares at him, waiting for him to finish; he looks to her for help, but she's too uncomfortable with the sudden intimacy to provide any. Viewing through greenhouse windows, it's apparent Lester and Jane's interaction is not going well, although we can't hear them. Jane puts her plate in the dishwasher and leaves, and as we follow her out the door, the camera jerks back to Lester calling after her. His point of view, on video: through the kitchen window, Lester is seen at the sink, rinsing off his plate and muttering to himself.",
