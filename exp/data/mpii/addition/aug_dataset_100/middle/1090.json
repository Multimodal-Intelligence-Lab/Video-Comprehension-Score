Tuvia sets off, leaving Zus looking unconvinced. In a dimly lit cottage, Tuvia pours out two vodkas as a dark-haired Russian sits down at his table, places a gun on the table, and Tuvia takes it, glancing at the wife's hostile face, pocketing the bullets, and tucking the gun into his belt. The wife is chopping meat while the men clink glasses, pour some away, and down the rest. Tuvia bites into a piece of bread, and the wife ignores him as Tuvia cracks a smile. A beam of light shines through the window as Tuvia dives out of the back door, and the wife quickly removes the glasses from the table. Tuvia climbs up into Koscik's barn, where half a dozen people are already hiding, as an official car draws up with its headlights blazing. Outside, Koscik is holding the vodka bottle. Koscik hands over the bottle, gulps back some vodka, and someone coughs in the barn as Bernicki passes the bottle to a colleague. In the barn, Tuvia takes out the gun and gulps back some more vodka. Bielski's eyes bulge, and he holds a finger at Koscik's head like a pistol, pats Koscik on the cheek, and goes. Bernicki and the two young men with him return to their car as Tuvia, in the barn, sighs with relief.",
