He unsmilingly bends down and picks the newspapers up off the drive. Holding a baby he snaps at Marley who is paws up on the breakfast table and taking an interest in Patrick's food. John frowns at the implication and the moment's captured on camera. He arrives back home at night driving his old blue Honda and parks up behind their new people carrier. Gloomily he glances up and through a window sees Jenny holding the baby with Marley bouncing around playfully. He leans back thoughtfully in the driving seat. Jenny spots him sitting in the car and gestures to him asking if he is actually going to come indoors. He gets reluctantly out of the car. He sits with a blank expression. Jenny and Patrick sit glumly side by side at the table as John goes and sees to the baby. Marley is next to Patrick eyeing his food as she is trying to wrestle a book away from him.",
