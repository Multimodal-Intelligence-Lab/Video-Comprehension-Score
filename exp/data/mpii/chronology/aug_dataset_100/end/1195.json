Falling snow deadens her footsteps. Kneeling beside her friend Hermione puts out a hand and pulls off the invisibility cloak revealing Harry who looks at her miserably. A yellow butterfly flutters above the emerging snowdrops. The Whomping Willow twists its trunk and shakes the snow from its branches. In Lupin's room Harry nods and grasps his wand. Unlocking a trunk Lupin releases a Dementor and Harry collapses into blackness. Chocolate. Harry nods again. Lupin opens the trunk and a powerful silver mist flows from Harry's wand shielding him from the terrifying power of the threatening Dementor. With determination and willpower he gradually forces it to retreat inside the open trunk. Laughing with delight Lupin slams down the lid.",
