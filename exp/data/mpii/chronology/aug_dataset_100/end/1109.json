Outside the lightning flashes and inside. Ron and Harry walk upstairs where they stop as they find a pool of water on the landing. They run through it and in the girls' lavatory all the taps are running. Harry and Ron look around at the overflowing sinks and spot Myrtle sitting high up on a curved stone windowsill. Ron flinches as she floats past and Harry notices a book with a limp black leather cover lying on the stone floor. He picks it up and shakes off the water but the book is soaking wet. Later he sits at his desk and flicks through the driedout pages which are all blank. He flicks through the book again and sees a name stamped in gold letters on the back. He puts the book down picks up a quill and dips it into the inkwell.",
