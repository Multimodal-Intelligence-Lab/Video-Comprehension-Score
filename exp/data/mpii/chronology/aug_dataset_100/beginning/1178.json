Dripping wet Dudley scrambles to his feet but the glass window has reappeared trapping him in the snake house. He bangs desperately on the glass as his mother screams with horror and Uncle Vernon spots Harry laughing glaring at him suspiciously. Back at 4 Privet Drive Vernon grabs Harry by the hair and locks him into the cupboard under the stairs. A tawny owl flies low over Privet Drive and drops a letter and inside Number 4. Harry picks up the post from the doormat—two letters and a postcard. One of the letters is sealed with wax and Harry's eyes widen with surprise as he reads the address written in emerald green ink.
