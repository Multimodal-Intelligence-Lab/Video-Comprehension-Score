  "ground_truth": "A dark narrow corridor, dimly lit and festooned with cobwebs, leads to the scene where the patterned tiles underfoot are cracked and dirty. Harry hesitates, but Moody pushes past him impatiently, followed by the others moving toward an open door at the end of the gloomy passage. Nymphadora turns and winks at Harry, but she trips over an umbrella stand. Through the open door, Harry spots Mr. Weasley, Sirius, and Lupin, and as she comes out closing the door, she hugs him warmly and looks at him closely. A house elf emerges onto the landing dragging a wooden box. It has skinny arms, a long pointed nose and ears, and wears a ragged vest, glaring spitefully at Harry. The elf stands on the box and polishes a picture frame. Harry opens a door and is nearly knocked off his feet by Hermione, with Ron standing behind her. Harry looks around the bedroom and his eyes widen as the Weasley twins dangle a magic ear over the banisters. Hermione's cat, Crookshanks, sees the ear and grabs at it with his paw, then runs off with it, chased by Fred and George. Harry embraces his godfather Sirius, who holds him close. Harry's photograph is underneath, and Sirius looks directly at Harry and winks at him.",
