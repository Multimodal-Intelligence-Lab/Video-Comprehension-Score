  "ground_truth": "The friends find each other as Death Eaters advance and Ginny points her wand, causing their attackers to vanish. The passages are deserted, but several glass spheres drop from the highest shelves and shatter, prompting the friends to look up in alarm. Luna stands mesmerized by the falling spheres until Neville grabs her arm, and as they run, more spheres plummet from the shelves. They head for the door at the end of a long narrow passage, with the wooden shelves collapsing behind them and sending a cascade of glass spheres crashing down. Crunching broken glass underfoot, they reach the door, which opens, and they run straight through, only to fall into empty space. They land face down beside a large rocky mound, with Harry still clutching the glowing sphere. A stone archway filled with misty vapor stands on the mound as they raise their wands for protection against a group of black-cloaked figures that swoop down. The Death Eaters swirl around them, trailing plumes of dense black smoke. Harry lies huddled on the rocky mound, clutching the prophecy sphere, and cautiously gets to his feet. Ahead of him, a scowling Death Eater restrains Luna with his wand at her throat, while Harry looks around for the others, each held prisoner by a grim-faced Death Eater. Ron struggles, and Hermione's captor tightens his hold as Lucius approaches Harry and holds out his hand. Harry looks around at his friends, helpless in the grip of the Death Eaters, and then back at Lucius' outstretched hand.",
