  "ground_truth": "As Tuvia contemplates the cabin full of sick people, Lilka comes in, and his eyes search her face as she hands back the revolver. At the army camp, Viktor is looking at a chart, and Tuvia has come into the camp, causing Zus to look at Tuvia and turn away. Zus comes up, and later at night in the deserted town of Stakiewicze, Zus and Tuvia are sitting in a parked vehicle, where Tuvia is coughing and produces the ornate Mezuzah case. Zus snatches it from him and climbs out of the truck, signaling to Benzion and Krensky. Keeping their heads low, the three of them scurry across to one building and then sneak towards the police station building flying the Nazi flag. Tuvia's feverish eyes watch nervously from inside the vehicle as he starts at the sight of lights flashing amid the sound of gunfire and grips his own gun. Inside the police station, Krensky is shot dead, and Benzion fires back, killing two policemen. Tuvia trembles as Zus dives towards the next office and is shot at by the police chief, but not before gunning him to the ground. Zus runs into the office, flings open the cupboard of small medicine bottles, and scoops them up into a sack. Benzion vaults over the police counter, reaches for the transmitter, and smashes it with the butt end of his rifle, but a policeman bursts in and plants Benzion with bullets. Zus runs back into the front office and guns down the policeman, clutching the wound in his stomach, while Tuvia's face is full of foreboding as the vehicle hurtles out of the town. Wincing with pain, Zus produces the bundle of medicine bottles, and the truck's headlights pierce the bliss of the country road.",
