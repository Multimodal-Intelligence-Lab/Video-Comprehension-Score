  "ground_truth": "Jenny smiles as she looks around the glamorous hall and all the table lamps while Helen and Danny exchange a worried look. David glances at Jenny, who freezes, but then she smiles happily and applauds the singer, keeping her eyes on the stage. Danny and Helen talk together as Jenny watches the glamorous couple. As David looks at her, she glances back at him and smiles self-consciously, while Helen and Danny are completely wrapped up in one another. Jenny smiles at David, and they both laugh; she grins happily to herself. Later, Jenny arrives home, cautiously opens the door, and walks quietly in. Her mother is in the kitchen and gives a non-committal nod before returning to her casserole. Margarie glances over her shoulder, and Jenny trudges sadly from the kitchen. The next day, David waits by his car outside the school as Jenny hurries out, having changed out of her school uniform. They both grin as she gets into the passenger seat and David gets behind the wheel, driving the Bristol off to the auction. At the auction, Danny smiles knowingly as a woman shakes her head, while Jenny reaches with excitement and David grins. Later, at Danny's palatial place filled with art and luxury furniture, Helen turns and stares at Jenny, and they shake on something.",
