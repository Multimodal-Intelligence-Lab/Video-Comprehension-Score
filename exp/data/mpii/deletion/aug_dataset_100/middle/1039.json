  "ground_truth": "Sam spots the elevator stuck on the seventh floor, while elsewhere, a sweaty Javier glares at Veronica then lowers the gun, only to raise it again as Veronica relaxes. Veronica shakes her head, and Javier relents, leaving her in the elevator and touching his stomach in the corridor, bringing his palm away bloody. Javier, dressed in a Spanish policeman's uniform, heads down the stairwell in the hotel. Outside, Sam sees Veronica leaving the elevator with a covered gurney, and rushes to help, wheeling it while Veronica tends the drip. The President is covered by a blue blanket. Javier leaves the annex and on the street checks his watch. Sam and Veronica wheel the President's gurney over to the ambulance as Luis runs up to them, climbs in, and Sam shuts the door. The ambulance pulls away from the chaos outside the hotel. In a speeding hatchback, Barnes answers his cell phone, shifts gear, and moves through traffic in the narrow street. On a different street, Sam weaves through traffic in the ambulance, and inside, Ashton, lying under the blanket, opens his eyes, lowers a sidebar, and, as the ambulance rounds a corner, falls to the floor. Taylor speeds along in a Spanish police car while Veronica smiles at Sam in the driver's seat. Then Enrique runs across the road in front of them and exchanges a stunned glance with Veronica.",
