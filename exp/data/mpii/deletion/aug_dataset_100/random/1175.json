The school is silhouetted against moonlit clouds. Harry, Ron, and Hermione creep downstairs into the common room, where they spot Neville's toad. Neville gets up from a chair, freezes, and falls over backwards. Leaving Neville, they all huddle under the invisibility cloak as Hermione unlocks the door on the third floor. A harp is playing by itself, and they take off the cloak to see the three-headed dog is asleep. They take hold of it and between them, they push the dog's huge paw off the trapdoor. The dog breathes out, and they stagger back, lifting the wooden cover to stare down into the black hole beneath. Dog dribble hits Ron as the dog opens its three mouths. They throw themselves into the hole as the dog destroys the trapdoor. They have landed on something soft, but the plant begins to move, slithering tentacles snake over them, twisting around their arms and legs, and twining around their necks.",
