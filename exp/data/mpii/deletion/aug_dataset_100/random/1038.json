  "ground_truth": "Felipe perspires profusely and glowers intensely before clicking a red trigger with his thumb, causing the hotel lobby to explode. In the stairwell, Javier checks his watch, and outside, an ambulance hits the streets with Sam on its radio. A Secret Service agent heads downstairs, only to be shot by Javier. Javier watches more agents pass beneath him in the stairwell, then heads downstairs, easing a door open on level seven. He dons a ski mask, lurches through the doorway, and stabs an agent in the back. Another agent rounds the corner, and Javier attacks, killing the agent and drawing his gun. Meanwhile, Sam drives the ambulance through the streets at breakneck speed, careening through a junction and causing two cars to crash. Javier uses a mirror to spot two agents outside the President's room, then opens fire, shooting a third agent, and sets charges which blow the door to the President's room. He ducks inside and guns down Cavic, McCullough, and Heinkin before pointing his gun at Ashton. The ambulance arrives at the bombed hotel, and Veronica and Sam climb out. Sam taps his cell phone screen as the agent leads him away, and they kneel by a casualty. Barnes enters the GNN OB truck and flashes his ID as Veronica enters the elevator with a gurney and presses the button for level seven.",
