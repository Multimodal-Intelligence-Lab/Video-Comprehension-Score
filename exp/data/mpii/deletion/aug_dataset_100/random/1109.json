  "ground_truth": "Ron's hair is turning red, and they turn and run out of the common room. Back in the girls' lavatory, Myrtle floats past. Still in uniform, Hermione has become a cat. Outside, the lightning flashes, and inside, Ron and Harry walk upstairs where they stop as they find a pool of water on the landing. They run through it, and in the girls' lavatory, all the taps are running. Harry and Ron look around at the overflowing sinks and spot Myrtle sitting high up on a curved stone windowsill. Ron flinches as she floats past, and Harry notices a book with a limp, black leather cover lying on the stone floor. He picks it up and shakes off the water, but the book is soaking wet. Later, he sits at his desk and flicks through the dried-out pages, which are all blank. He flicks through the book again and sees a name stamped in gold letters on the back. He puts the book down, picks up a quill, and dips it into the inkwell. As he goes to write on the first empty page, a drop of ink falls from the quill, hits the paper, and slowly disappears.",
