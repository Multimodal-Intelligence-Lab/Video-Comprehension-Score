Hermione looks at Ron sympathetically in a crowded classroom, where the door opens, and the girls are entranced as he flashes his teeth while the boys scowl. He taps a cage, uncovers a cage full of tiny blue creatures, and opens the door of the cage. The pixies fly out in all directions, tearing up books and lifting Neville Longbottom into the air by his ears, carrying him across the room. The students flap at the pixies ineffectually as the creatures hang Neville by the back of his cloak from the light fitting. The air is full of torn pages and flying pixies, with one pulling Hermione's hair, which Harry swipes away. Lockhart's spell has no effect as a pixie grabs his wand and a dragon skeleton falls in a clatter of bones and dust. Lockhart turns and runs up a flight of stairs, grabbing a photo of himself that a pixie has snatched from the wall, then looks down at Harry, Ron, and Hermione before running out. Hermione points her wand, and above their heads, the pixies freeze and float harmlessly in mid-air. Still hanging from the ceiling, Neville looks down at them mournfully as the Gryffindor captain, Oliver Wood, leads his team out for an early morning practice and spots the Slytherin team. Ron looks at Hermione as Draco Malfoy steps forward, and Harry stares at him and their broomsticks. Draco narrows his eyes and glares at Hermione, prompting Ron to pull out his wand in shock.",
