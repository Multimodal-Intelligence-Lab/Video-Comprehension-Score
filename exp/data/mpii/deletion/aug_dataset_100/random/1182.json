  "ground_truth": "Ron snickers and holds out his hand, but Harry does not shake it. Professor McGonagall returns and gives Malfoy a sharp, warning look before the oak doors swing open, leading the way into the magnificent great hall of Hogwarts School. The first-years march down the center of the room, watched curiously by the rest of the school sitting at long tables. Hermione looks up at the ceiling to see hundreds of lighted candles floating mid-air above their heads, below a moonlit sky. Professor McGonagall stops beside a patched and battered wizard's hat perched on a stool in front of the high table as Hermione tries to calm herself and sits. Professor McGonagall puts the sorting hat on her head, and the hat speaks. Delighted, Hermione runs to the Gryffindor table while Malfoy sits down. As the hat touches his head, a man with black hair is sitting next to Professor Quirrell, and Harry winces and touches his scar. Ron steps forward nervously, and the sorting hat is placed on his head, recognizing him at once. Ron sighs with relief, and Harry smiles. Professor Dumbledore leans forward with interest, and Hagrid holds his breath. Harry steps up onto the platform, sits on the stool, and the hat is placed on his head as the sorting hat regards him thoughtfully.",
