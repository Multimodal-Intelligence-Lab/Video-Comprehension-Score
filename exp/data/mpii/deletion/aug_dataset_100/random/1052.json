  "ground_truth": "Lizzie and the Gardiners are traveling through the rolling hills of the Peaks. Darcy is practicing his fencing. They shake hands and Baines leaves. Lizzie is picking her way across the rocks at the top of a hill, while the Gardiners are watching her from the bottom of the slope. Lizzie gazes at the countryside around her. That evening, the three of them are eating supper. Mrs. Gardiner looks at Lizzie, and Lizzie smiles. The next day, the open-topped carriage is making its way through the green countryside, towards Pemberley. It crosses a tiny, single-arched bridge over a stream. Lizzie and Mrs. Gardiner sit facing Mr. Gardiner. The carriage continues on its way, passing through woods in the bright sunshine. Then, the magnificent Pemberley appears, and Lizzie's breath is taken away by the sheer splendor of the classical, stately home.",
