  "ground_truth": "Harry runs to Cedric and helps him to free himself, and exhausted and trembling, he scrambles to his feet as a strong wind flings leaves high into the air and the hedges advance. As the hedges close in behind them, they both sprint towards the shining trophy, and upon reaching it, they pause in front of it and grab it, one hand each. It spins like a Catherine wheel, and they land beside a statue in the cemetery, scrambling to their feet as Cedric looks around the moonlit graveyard. The trophy is lying on the ground, and Harry clutches his forehead in agony. Wormtail appears, clutching a small, wizened creature in a blanket, and Cedric draws his wand but falls dead. Aiming his wand, Wormtail forces Harry up into the arms of the statue, which traps him fast behind the handle of the scythe. A cauldron stands in front of Harry as Wormtail drops the pale, deformed creature into it, opens the Riddle family grave, drops a bone into the cauldron, draws a knife, slices off his right hand into the cauldron, slashes open Harry's sleeve, and cuts Harry's arm, adding Harry's blood to the cauldron. The contents of the cauldron sieve and bubble, and Wormtail runs into the shadows as flames leap high into the night sky. The cauldron disappears as a ghastly, shapeless figure appears in front of Harry, writhing and twisting as it slowly takes human form. A veil of black smoke descends and unfolds the creature as Voldemort slowly turns his head, his gleaming, gray skin stretched tight over his bony features, with sunken eyes, and in place of a nose, two narrow slits for nostrils. He runs his fingers over his hairless skull as Wormtail emerges from the shadows, and now, draped in a black robe, Voldemort opens his arms triumphantly, admiring his restored human form with a smile on his thin lips. Bowing low, Wormtail holds it out, and Voldemort takes it in his long, bony fingers, pressing his wand into the dark mark tattooed on Wormtail's arm.",
