He gives a smile as dry as the flat plains which stretch out to the hills on the horizon, and accompanies Sarah down the hill, away from the cemetery. The sun sets on the darkening plains and hills.

Something moves beneath the steps she's standing on, and King George dances by his hilltop fire. She hurries indoors to find the boy in her bedroom. As he strikes a pose, the curtains billowed. He grins broadly.",
