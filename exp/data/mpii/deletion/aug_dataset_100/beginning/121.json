Neff's coupe meets and passes the ice cream wagon and stops before one of the Spanish houses. Neff gets out, carrying a briefcase, with his hat a little on the back of his head, and his movements are easy and full of ginger. He inspects the house, checks the number, goes up on the front porch, and rings the bell, then pushes past her into the house.

She wears no stockings, no nothing. Neff looks up, takes his hat off, and she glances over her towel costume, then turns away as gracefully as one can with a towel for a wrapper.",
