  "ground_truth": "They sheath their swords and join the black chess pieces. Ron climbs onto the stone horse of the black knight and looks across the board as a white pawn moves itself forward. Hermione looks at Ron anxiously, and obeying Ron's instructions, a black pawn moves forward and is sliced off by the white pawn. The game gets underway; a white bishop explodes, a white knight hits the dust, and a black pawn is destroyed. A white bishop and a white knight explode, and the white queen attacks a black castle, which explodes in a shower of stone fragments and collapses in a pile of rubble. The queen turns triumphantly. Ron contemplates his next move, and watching the merciless white queen, Harry suddenly understands the game that Ron is playing and nods. Taking a deep breath, Ron clutches the horse's reins, closes his eyes, and the black horse starts to move across the board between the remains of the shattered stone chess pieces. Ron looks nervously at the white king, who wears a silver helmet, clasping a powerful sword with his hands encased in metal armor. Ron braces himself as the white queen slowly turns and moves steadily across the board, heading straight towards Ron's black horse. He clings onto the reins, shaking with fear, as the queen gets closer and closer, gliding over the smooth marble floor. She stabs the black horse, causing Ron to fall off, and the horse crashes beside him.",
