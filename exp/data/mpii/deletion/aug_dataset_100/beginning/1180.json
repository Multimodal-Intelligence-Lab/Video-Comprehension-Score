They travel on an underground railway and the goblin guide gets off the train. Hagrid hands over a key, and he and Harry follow the goblin along the dank, gloomy passage until a goblin stops beside a door. Hagrid takes the lamp, gives him the key, and turns it in the lock. The heavy steel door opens, and Hagrid shines the lamp inside the vault, causing Harry to blink in amazement, gazed by the sight of vast piles of gleaming golden coins. The goblin guide runs a long, sharp fingernail down the center of the locking mechanism on the door of vault 713. As the door swings slowly open, Harry stares in surprise as the lamplight illuminates a very small, badly wrapped package tied with string. Hagrid steps inside the vault, snatches up the package, and puts it in his pocket, to which Harry nods in agreement. Back in Diagon Alley, Harry consults his list and opens the door of Ollivanders, going inside and gazing around the deserted shop at the shelves full of dusty boxes. An old man slides into view on a ladder, climbs down, and looks along a shelf, taking a long, narrow box from it and carrying it to the counter. He opens the box and holds out a wand, which Harry takes gently and looks at him before waving it, causing drawers to fly open and wand boxes to catapult onto the floor.",
