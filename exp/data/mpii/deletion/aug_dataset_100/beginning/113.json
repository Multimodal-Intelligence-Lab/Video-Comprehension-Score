  "ground_truth": "Neff walks in past the night watchman without answering and heads towards the elevator. The night watchman looks after Neff, relocks the door, and follows him to the elevator. Neff enters the elevator appearing pale and haggard with pain but maintains a deadpan expression as the night watchman joins him. The night watchman pulls the lever, the doors close, and the elevator rises. The door opens to reveal a small dark reception room with a pair of frosted glass doors labeled: PACIFIC ALL-RISK INSURANCE COMPANY - FOUNDED 1906 - MAIN OFFICE, with a little light beyond the glass doors. Neff straightens up and walks heavily out of the elevator, crosses the reception room to the doors, and pushes them open. These lead to a balcony that runs all the way around, overlooking the eleventh floor below, which is filled with desks, typewriters, filing cabinets, and business machines. Neff enters the area from the reception room while the twelfth floor remains dark and some light shines up from the eleventh floor where two colored women are cleaning the offices — one is dry-mopping the floor, the other moving chairs back into position. Neff moves away from the railing with a faint smile on his face and walks past two or three offices towards a glass door labeled with the number twenty-seven and the names: HENRY B. ANDERSON, WALTER NEFF, LOUIS L. SCHWARTZ. Neff opens the door to reveal three desks, filing cabinets, a typewriter on a stand, a dictaphone on a fixed stand against the wall with a rack of records underneath, and telephones on all three desks. Neff enters, switches on the desk lamp, and his head goes far back as his eyes close with cold sweat showing on his face. After staying like this for a moment, exhausted, his eyes open slowly and look down at his left shoulder.",
