  "ground_truth": "As she sits for a portrait wearing formal robes of state, the Queen's attention is drawn by television news coverage of Tony Blair, who is dressed in a lounge suit with no jacket, smiling towards a cheering crowd. Crawford continues his oil painting, and the Queen smiles at him while seated for the portrait half in profile, wearing a white embroidered dress and a black velvet cloak ornamented with the star and shield of St. George's Cross. As she turns her head from the artist's formal pose, her expression barely changes. A lone pipo walks along a long colonnade at Buckingham Palace, with the royal standard flag gently ruffling in the gray skies above. The Queen lies in bed in a darkened room as a door opens behind her, and a woman enters to put a newspaper on a bedside table. The Queen looks at the paper. Later, the Queen sits at a desk with some corgis behind her as Robin enters. A black Jaguar car pulls to a stop in the palace courtyard, where a man in black coattails opens the rear door for Tony and Cherie Blair, who sit inside the car. The Blairs are ushered through a vast ornate hall by a man in a naval uniform, who smirks at Tony as he leads them toward an imposing set of closed doors. Cherie takes a seat by the doors as Tony is ushered into the room. The two men bow their heads to the Queen, standing in the middle of the room, and Tony shakes her hand. Tony waits for the Queen to be seated before sitting down opposite her.",
