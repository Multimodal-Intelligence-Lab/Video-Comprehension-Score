  "ground_truth": "A motorbike speeds past, and Charles reacts to the exhaust bank. Friday, a female servant, zips up the back of the Queen's black dress and hands her a pearl necklace, which the Queen takes, looks into a full-length mirror, and fastens around her neck before studying her reflection with a fixed stare. As the Queen descends some stairs, Prince Philip emerges from a nearby room. Looking troubled, the Queen descends the stairs, rushes into the courtyard, puts on a head scarf, and gets into the driver's side of a nearby Land Rover, which then pulls away. Three bodyguards quickly jump into a nearby car and follow her. Alastair bursts into Tony's office, goes to the door, and Tony looks up at Alastair as he leaves the room. The Queen's Land Rover enters the grounds of a country estate, followed by the bodyguards' car. The Queen emerges from the Land Rover, gazes around, and a middle-aged man in a cloth cap emerges from a nearby door. On seeing the Queen, he removes his cap, unlocks the door to a small, stone building, and opens it for her to enter. The Queen removes her sunglasses and glances at something inside: the stag, which hangs from the ceiling by its feet at the center of the room, skinned and with its head removed, with a patch of blood under the body. The Queen sees the stag's head and antlers arranged side-by-side on a nearby table, gently touches the side of the stag's head, and, with her face turned away from the man, catches her breath. The Queen closes her eyes, composes her features, turns to face the man, looks at the stag's body again, and moves towards the door, which the man opens.",
