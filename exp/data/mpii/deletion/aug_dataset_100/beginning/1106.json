  "ground_truth": "Walt kicks a table, then marches into his front room and kicks over another table, then punches in some cupboard doors as Daisy runs for cover. Walt sits down in an armchair, blood dripping from his fingers, and stares into the distance, a frown on his face, his features fixed and grim. He sheds a tear, and the blood on his fists has dried. Daisy comes and sits beside him. Father Janovich knocks at Walt's door and lets himself in as Walt lights up a cigarette. Father Janovich perches on a coffee table beside an open photograph album and stares at Walt, who drags pensively on his cigarette and looks thoughtful. Father Janovich gets up, goes over to the cool box, returns with four cans, and passes a couple to Walt while keeping a couple for himself. They each take a swig, and Walt takes another swig as Father Janovich eyes him, who stares unwaveringly back. In the morning, Thao walks into Walt's kitchen and finds him sipping a mug of coffee. They sit at the kitchen table, Walt gives Thao a scornful look, Thao nods reluctantly, and then gets up and goes as Walt stares after him. Later, Walt is busy mowing his front lawn, and now he relaxes in the bath, lights a cigarette, and looks over at Daisy, who's sitting beside the tub. Martin gives Walt a haircut, chuckles, and pockets the money.",
