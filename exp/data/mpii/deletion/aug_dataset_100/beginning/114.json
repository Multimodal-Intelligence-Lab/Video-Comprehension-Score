She pulls the rug off the corpse (which is not visible) and stands looking into the car, unable to take her eyes off what she sees, while at the same time her hands mechanically begin to fold the rug.

Phyllis coolly reaches past him and takes the hat off the dead man's head. She turns to go. Phyllis releases the hand brake and puts the car in reverse. Neff is again busy unwrapping the tape from his leg.",
