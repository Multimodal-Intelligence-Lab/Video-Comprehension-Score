  "ground_truth": "An uneasy silence descends, during which Mrs. Bennet winks at Kitty and Lizzie, gesturing to Jane and Mr. Bingley. Kitty glances at Jane, then at her mother, in confusion. She nods to Mr. Bingley, then leaves the room, followed by Mary and Kitty. Once they have left, Mr. Bingley sits back down. Lizzie casually takes up her embroidery, turning slightly to afford Mr. Bingley and Jane some privacy. Lizzie puts down her embroidery, smiles at Mr. Bingley, then leaves the room. She gives Jane a warning glance as she leaves. Mr. Bingley looks nervously down at Jane, who eventually raises her eyes demurely to meet his. An anxious Mrs. Bennet and the rest of the girls are sitting in another room, waiting. Mrs. Bennet sits with a smug expression. Moments later, Lizzie is skipping quietly down the stairs. She treads silently up to the door of the parlor, then walks inside to find her sister and Mr. Bingley standing together at the mantelpiece.",
