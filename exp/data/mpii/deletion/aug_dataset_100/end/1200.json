  "ground_truth": "Jenny takes a gold necklace out of a box, but wagging his tail playfully, Marley gets the necklace. John trips on a chair and the chase is on around the living room. The dog easily outmaneuvers Jenny, but John grabs him and forces open his jaws. John sprays Marley's poop with a hose, looking for the necklace. The doctor holds a probe to Jenny's stomach and moves a scanner around on gel on Jenny's stomach. A fuzzy picture appears on a screen, but the doctor frowns and removes the scanner, then walks out, leaving the Grogans waiting anxiously in the examination room. The doctor returns, smiles reassuringly, and places the scanner on Jenny's stomach. Jenny nods, tight-lipped, and the doctor withdraws with a sympathetic smile of apology. Jenny glances at her husband, who's lost for words as they drive down a palm tree-lined road. John glances at Jenny and gropes to break the silence; without looking at him, she settles back against her headrest and stares out of the window. They drive on down the sunny freeway toward the city. Back home, John opens the front door for his wife.",
