In the camp, Tuvia is in his cabin struggling with a fever, while outside, people are patiently in the food queue. Arkady and his friend are sharing a joke. Aron runs up to his brother's cabin as Chaya brings plates full of food to Arkady's table. Tuvia appears and notices Asael's black eye. Asael looks over to Arkady, who's standing with his back to them both, tucking into his large portion of food. Arkady pretends not to hear, takes another spoonful, then slowly hands his plate to a cohort and turns towards Tuvia with an insolent scowl. Arkady glances around at the fearful expressions of the rest of the people. Tuvia looks at him in disbelief, and Asael drops his head in shame. Tuvia turns round to face the community, Arkady behind him, smirking. Tuvia spins around and shoots him point-blank, and points his gun at Arkady's cohort, then lowers the gun. Asael swallows nervously as the men at the table jump to their feet and bend down to carry off Arkady's lifeless body.",
