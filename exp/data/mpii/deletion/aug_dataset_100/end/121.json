As he goes on speaking, the scene slowly dissolves to palm trees lining the street with middle-class houses, mostly in Spanish style. Some kids throw a baseball back and forth across a couple of front lawns, while an ice cream wagon dawdles along the block. Neff's coupe meets and passes the ice cream wagon and stops before one of the Spanish houses. Neff gets out, carrying a briefcase, with his hat a little on the back of his head, and his movements are easy and full of ginger. He inspects the house, checks the number, goes up on the front porch, and rings the bell, then pushes past her into the house. The style is Spanish throughout, with a wrought-iron staircase curving down from the second floor and a fringed Mexican shawl hanging down over the landing. A large tapestry hangs on the wall. Neff looks up to see Phyllis Dietrichson standing and looking down. She is in her early thirties, holding a large bath-towel around her torso, down to about two inches above her knees. She wears no stockings, no nothing. Neff looks up, takes his hat off, and she glances over her towel costume, then turns away as gracefully as one can with a towel for a wrapper.",
