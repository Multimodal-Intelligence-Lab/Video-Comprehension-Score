  "ground_truth": "At the front of the store, Desi hangs a Christmas garland, and smiling, Pete nods. With a concerned expression, he rejoins his wife at the counter as Desi faces a middle-aged man. Now, on a backyard trampoline, Debbie's youngest does a flip while Debbie and Sadie look on. Sitting on a toilet, Pete plays online Scrabble until Debbie opens the door. She lifts her brow with a skeptical nod before snatching his computer tablet and leaving. Later, Pete stands onstage, and in the audience, Pete's goateed friend and Barb share a table with Debbie. The silver-haired man in the amber-tinted glasses takes the stage with a backup musician while at the table, Pete sits by his wife, his boyishly ardent gaze fixed on the stage. Debbie sighs as the music producer bobs his head, mouthing along with the lyrics. Debbie turns away discreetly to yawn as Pete briefly lip syncs at her, and Debbie's eyes close. Later, Pete drives his wife home and pulls over as the fire truck passes in the opposite direction. Debbie watches with a smirk as two other emergency vehicles drive by. Back at home, they enter Sadie's room where Debbie takes Sadie's MP3 player, sets it in a dock, and Sadie smiles as her mother dances.",
