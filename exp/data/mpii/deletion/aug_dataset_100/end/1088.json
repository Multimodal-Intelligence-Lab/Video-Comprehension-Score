Tuvia tosses a bag at Malvin and hares away across the field, his physical and mental strength restored. The two of them dive into thick woodland, moving behind the enemy lines, with a view of the German soldiers and their tank ahead of them. They crouch down as half a dozen Germans come past and set up a gun position in front of them. With murder in his eyes, Tuvia cocks his machine gun and steps forward, gunning down every single man. Tuvia appropriates the German gun, takes up a position in the undergrowth behind the German line, and fires on the troops who are facing away from them, killing a number of them. The Germans regroup. The heavy tank gun is slowly turned in Tuvia and Malvin's direction. As the black mouth of the big gun moves near, Tuvia leaps out of the way and dives behind a tree. A tank fires into the undergrowth behind him. More Germans zip across the field and take up positions just yards away from them.",
