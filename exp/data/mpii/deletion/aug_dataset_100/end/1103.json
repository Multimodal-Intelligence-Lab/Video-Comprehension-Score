  "ground_truth": "As she goes upstairs, the group of boys follows her. Walt goes over to Thao and sips his drink as Thao looks away. Walt matches off, leaving Thao looking dejected but thoughtful. Walt mows his front lawn with a push mower, and he looks up to see two of his Hmong neighbors bringing flowers to his house. The neighbors smile, and as they leave the flowers, Walt carries on mowing. He stops and looks back at them. Later, he opens his door to more neighbors bearing food, sniffs it, and waves the three women and their food inside, following them in. Later, he pulls onto his drive in his pickup and finds Sue, Thao, and their mother waiting for him; he shoos them away. He's on his porch drinking coffee and stands up as a sheepish-looking Thao approaches. Walt leaves him to it and wanders off towards his garage. Thao finds Walt watching his abatis border and looks thoughtful, then shrugs. Walt looks at a very dilapidated house across the street.",
