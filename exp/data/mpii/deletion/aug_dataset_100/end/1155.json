  "ground_truth": "Krum strides past wearing a singlet, followed by a group of giggling girls, and Hermione looks flustered. In class, Ron whispers to Harry, and Snape clips his ear. Fred passes Ron a note and then throws the crumpled note at Angelina, pointing to her, miming dancing, and then pointing to himself. Angelina gives him a thumbs up, and Fred winks at Ron. Snape swipes Ron and Harry with a book, and she gets up, hands her book to Snape, and returns before stalking off. Snape hits them again. A blanket of snow lies over Hogwarts as Harry, hands pushed deep inside his pockets, runs up the stone steps to the owlery and stamps the snow off his boots. At the door, he almost bumps into Cho coming out, and they sidestep each other in the doorway. Harry swallows hard and later lies moodily in the common room, clutching the golden egg. Ron is led in by Ginny, and Harry runs after Parvati and Padma on the evening of the Yule Ball. Lights shine from the Durmstrang galleon on the frozen lake as excited students gather in the entrance to the great hall. The girls wear long gowns, and the boys dress robes.",
