Inside the vehicle, the elaborate rosewood container is now battered and marred, its various latches holding firm against Edgar's repeated endeavors to claw his manner into it. He roars in fury and hurls the container against the side of the vehicle, where it ultimately fractures a hinge. Inside, there are dozens of valuable, glittering gemstones, which he promptly discards as worthless, but the rest of the container is vacant.

There are several photographs of a feline on the wall and a heap of jeweled feline collars. Jay's attention is interrupted by something through the window, where outside, lumbering straight for the shop, is Edgar. Jay fires, shattering the storefront window and detonating a vehicle on the street. The explosion hurls him up and back a good ten feet, slamming him into the partition with tremendous force. Edgar turns and rushes away down the street as Jay collects himself, leaping through the shattered storefront window and after Edgar. Kay gestures to a gathering of spectators, drawn by the curious detonations from the shop, with smoking debris everywhere.

Inside the cramped interior of the van, the once-pristine, ornate rosewood box now appears battered and scarred, its various intricate locks steadfastly holding against Edgar's relentless attempts to claw his way inside. He bellows furiously in rage and forcefully hurls the box against the side of the van with explosive anger, where it finally succumbs, cracking a hinge. Within its depths lie dozens of precious, dazzling diamonds, sparkling brilliantly, which he soon discards as worthless but finds that the remainder of the box is devoid of content. He points with determined precision at the screen using a laser pencil, highlighting the three prominent stars that collectively form the distinctive belt. Elizabeth gazes upward, as if aware that she is under observation, though in reality she is merely looking at the vast night sky, pondering how many stars will grace the night with their twinkling presence.

          "description": "The Orkin van sits idly in an alleyway somewhere in the heart of downtown; from within its confines, guttural wails of frustration emanate, echoing off the walls. Inside the van, Edgar, consumed by desperation, battles with a now battered and scarred ornate rosewood box, its various locks steadfastly resisting his repeated and feverish attempts to pry it open. As his frustration peaks, Edgar bellows in rage, his voice reverberating in the cramped space of the van, before he seizes the box and hurls it with all his might against the side of the van. The box strikes the wall, and a hinge finally gives, cracking open just enough to reveal its contents. Inside, a dazzling array of dozens of precious, glittering diamonds catches the light momentarily before Edgar, dismissing them as worthless, discards them without a second thought. Beyond the discarded jewels, the rest of the box is empty, offering nothing to appease Edgar's frenzy. Meanwhile, in another part of the van, he picks up a laser pencil and points it up at a display screen, specifically indicating the three stars that form a belt. Simultaneously, elsewhere, Elizabeth stands looking up at the sky, as if stirred by a distant sense of awareness, pondering the number of stars that might grace the night sky. This scene becomes too much for Kay to handle, prompting him to reach out and flick a switch, extinguishing the image of Elizabeth on the monitor and leaving only a data screen in its place. At this moment, Jay decides to drag a chair over and sit down beside Kay, as they both turn their attention back to the LAD (Landed Alien Display), where every flickering light represents one of the thousand or so aliens residing on Earth. They observe as some of the lights begin to extinguish, signaling a crisis. Kay exchanges a meaningful glance with Jay as he looks from his partner to the screen before they make their way back from the display. Meanwhile, Edgar, consumed by his mission, lunges forward to grab his twelve-gauge shotgun from the front seat of the van, directing its menacing barrel towards the tow truck driver. The driver, unfazed, looks back at Edgar with disdain and, in a practiced motion, pulls back his shirt to reveal a mean-looking gun of his own. Nearby, several photos of a cat adorn the wall above a pile of bejeweled cat collars, capturing Jay’s attention until something outside the window seizes it once more. Without warning, Edgar is seen lumbering with determination straight towards the store. Reacting swiftly, Jay fires his weapon, shattering the storefront window and inadvertently blowing up a car stationed on the street. The explosive blast sends Jay careening upwards and backwards, launching him a good ten feet until he slams with tremendous force against the wall. Edgar uses the chaos to his advantage, turning on his heels and sprinting down the street. Jay, not to be outdone, picks himself up from the ground, adrenaline surging, and leaps through the now broken storefront window in hot pursuit of Edgar. In the aftermath, Kay steps forward, gesturing to a group of onlookers drawn to the scene by the peculiar blasts emanating from the store and the resulting smoking rubble scattered everywhere. Kay gestures back towards the Orkin van, hinting at the presence of Edgar's spaceship neatly tucked away, before retrieving his cell phone. Somewhere else, Zed stands in his office, gazing down at the vast floor below, where he observes four worm guys carrying suitcases as they traverse the floor, before returning his gaze to the screen. Elsewhere, Edgar, consumed by agitation, exits and walks away briskly, cursing under his breath, frustration boiling over as he rants and remains deep in thought. As he strides past a newsstand, his simmering anger gets the better of him, and he seizes the news vendor by the collar in a fit of rage."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
