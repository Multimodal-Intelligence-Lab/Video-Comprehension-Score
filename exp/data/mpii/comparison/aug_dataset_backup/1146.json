It spins like a Catherine wheel, and they land beside a statue in the cemetery, scrambling to their feet as Cedric looks around the moonlit graveyard. The trophy is lying on the ground, and Harry clutches his forehead in agony. Wormtail appears, clutching a small, wizened creature in a blanket, and Cedric draws his wand but falls dead. Aiming his wand, Wormtail forces Harry up into the arms of the statue, which traps him fast behind the handle of the scythe. A cauldron stands in front of Harry as Wormtail drops the pale, deformed creature into it, opens the Riddle family grave, drops a bone into the cauldron, draws a knife, slices off his right hand into the cauldron, slashes open Harry's sleeve, and cuts Harry's arm, adding Harry's blood to the cauldron. The contents of the cauldron sieve and bubble, and Wormtail runs into the shadows as flames leap high into the night sky. The cauldron disappears as a ghastly, shapeless figure appears in front of Harry, writhing and twisting as it slowly takes human form. A veil of black smoke descends and unfolds the creature as Voldemort slowly turns his head, his gleaming, gray skin stretched tight over his bony features, with sunken eyes, and in place of a nose, two narrow slits for nostrils. He runs his fingers over his hairless skull as Wormtail emerges from the shadows, and now, draped in a black robe, Voldemort opens his arms triumphantly, admiring his restored human form with a smile on his thin lips. Bowing low, Wormtail holds it out, and Voldemort takes it in his long, bony fingers, pressing his wand into the dark mark tattooed on Wormtail's arm. He looks up into the glowering sky, and from the darkening clouds, a snaking ribbon of black smoke emerges, twisting and turning downwards, dividing into separate plumes, each revealing a black-robed death eater wearing a tall pointed hood and a skeleton mask. As the smoke clears, Voldemort faces them, unmasks them, and they fall to their knees. Snatching another mask, Lucius rips off his hood and restores his hand in silver, looking down at Cedric. He presses one finger into Harry's scarred forehead, causing Harry to fall to the ground, forcing him to bow and writhe in agony. He sends Harry spinning, but Harry dives for cover, summoning up every ounce of courage to face Voldemort.",

It whirls like a Catherine wheel, and they land beside a statue in the graveyard, scrambling to their feet as Cedric glances around the moonlit burial ground. The trophy is lying on the earth, and Harry grips his forehead in anguish. Wormtail materializes, clutching a small, shriveled creature in a blanket, and Cedric draws his wand but falls lifeless.

He assists him with diligence and care, helping Cedric to free himself from the restrictive entanglement that traps him. Exhausted and trembling visibly from the harrowing ordeal, Cedric scrambles to his feet just at the very moment when a powerful gust of wind sweeps through the area. The wind sends leaves swirling high into the air while the menacing hedges ominously advance towards them, creating an atmosphere of impending danger. As the hedges continue to close in from behind, heightening the sense of urgency, both Harry and Cedric sprint with every ounce of their strength towards the gleaming trophy that lies ahead. Upon reaching it, they come to a halt right in front of the trophy, each of them extending a hand to grasp it simultaneously with determination. The trophy spins rapidly, much like a Catherine wheel, and in an instant, they find themselves landing with a thud beside a statue in a moonlit cemetery, enveloped by the eerie surroundings. Scrambling to their feet, Cedric glances around, taking in the chilling and sinister atmosphere of the graveyard. The trophy lies discarded on the ground, and Harry clutches his forehead, overwhelmed by excruciating agony. Suddenly, Wormtail makes an appearance, holding a small, wizened creature that is wrapped in a tattered blanket. Cedric, reacting swiftly, draws his wand, but tragically, he falls dead in an instant. With a menacing aim, Wormtail directs his wand at Harry, forcing him up into the arms of the statue. The statue traps him securely behind the handle of the scythe, rendering him helpless. Directly in front of Harry stands a bubbling cauldron, and Wormtail proceeds to unceremoniously drop the pale, deformed creature into it. He then opens the Riddle family grave, dropping a bone into the cauldron, and with a swift motion, he draws a sharp knife. He slices off his own right hand, allowing it to fall directly into the cauldron, then slashes open Harry's sleeve, cutting into Harry's arm to add his blood to the boiling mixture. The contents of the cauldron begin to sieve and bubble violently, and Wormtail quickly retreats into the shadows as flames leap high into the night sky. The cauldron vanishes completely, and in its place, a ghastly and shapeless figure begins to emerge in front of Harry. The figure writhes and twists as it gradually takes on a recognizable human form. A veil of thick black smoke descends and unfolds around it, revealing the creature as Voldemort. He slowly turns his head, displaying his gleaming, gray skin stretched tightly over his bony features. His eyes are sunken, and where there should be a nose, there are instead two narrow slits for nostrils. He runs his fingers over his smooth, hairless skull as Wormtail emerges once again from the shadows. Now draped in a flowing black robe, Voldemort opens his arms triumphantly, admiring his newly restored human form with a sinister smile curling his thin lips. Bowing low in submission, Wormtail holds out his arm, and Voldemort takes it in his long, bony fingers, pressing his wand against the dark mark tattooed on Wormtail's arm. He gazes up into the foreboding sky above, and from the darkening clouds, a snaking ribbon of black smoke emerges, twisting and turning downward with an otherworldly grace. It divides into separate plumes, each revealing a black-robed Death Eater wearing a tall, pointed hood and a skeletal mask. As the oppressive smoke clears, Voldemort faces them, and one by one, they unmask, falling to their knees in submission before him. Snatching another mask, Lucius tears off his hood and magically restores his hand in shimmering silver, casting a glance downward at Cedric. He presses one finger against Harry's scarred forehead, causing Harry to fall to the ground, writhing in agony and forced to bow before him. He sends Harry spinning dizzily through the air, but Harry, summoning every ounce of courage within him, dives for cover, ready to bravely face Voldemort himself."

As a powerful gust of wind sweeps through, sending leaves swirling high into the air, the hedges around them begin to move ominously closer. With the hedges closing in behind them, both Harry and Cedric break into a sprint, racing towards the gleaming trophy that beckons them. Upon reaching the trophy, they come to a halt, standing in front of it, and simultaneously reach out to grasp it, each placing one hand on it. The trophy begins to spin rapidly, much like a Catherine wheel, and in an instant, they find themselves landing with a thud beside a statue in a dimly lit cemetery. They quickly scramble to their feet, and Cedric takes a moment to survey the moonlit graveyard around them. The trophy now lies discarded on the ground, and Harry is suddenly overwhelmed with pain, clutching his forehead in agony.

Now draped in a black robe, Voldemort opens his arms triumphantly, a smile playing on his thin lips as he admires his restored human form.

They are exhausted and trembling amidst the strong wind flinging leaves high into the air as the enchanted hedges, which have been magically charmed to move, begin to advance. As the hedges close in behind them, both champions sprint towards the shining Triwizard Cup, which unbeknownst to them has been bewitched into a Portkey by their enemies. Upon reaching it, they pause in front of it and grab it, one hand each. It spins like a Catherine wheel, a popular firework known for its spinning display, and they land beside a statue in the graveyard known to be part of the Riddle family estate. Scrambling to their feet, Cedric looks around the moonlit graveyard, realizing they are in Little Hangleton, the village associated with Voldemort's family history. The trophy is lying on the ground, and Harry clutches his forehead in agony as his scar burns, indicating the nearby presence of Voldemort. Wormtail, who is actually Peter Pettigrew in disguise, appears, clutching a small, wizened creature—the feeble form of Lord Voldemort—wrapped in a blanket. Cedric draws his wand in defense but tragically falls dead as a result of Wormtail's actions. Aiming his wand, Wormtail forces Harry up into the arms of the statue, which traps him fast behind the handle of the scythe. A large, ominous cauldron stands in front of Harry as Wormtail follows a dark ritual, dropping the pale, deformed creature into it. He opens the grave of Tom Riddle Sr., Voldemort's father, drops a bone into the cauldron, draws a knife, slices off his right hand as a symbol of loyalty to Voldemort, and slashes open Harry's sleeve, cutting his arm to add his blood, completing the ritual. The contents of the cauldron sieve and bubble, and Wormtail runs into the shadows as flames leap high into the night sky, signifying the rebirth of Voldemort. The cauldron disappears as a ghastly, shapeless figure emerges in front of Harry, writhing and twisting as it slowly takes human form. A veil of black smoke descends and unfolds the creature as Voldemort, Lord of the Death Eaters, slowly turns his head, his gleaming, gray skin stretched tight over his bony features, with sunken eyes and two narrow slits for nostrils instead of a nose. He runs his fingers over his hairless skull as Wormtail emerges from the shadows, now draped in a black robe, representing his allegiance. Voldemort opens his arms triumphantly, admiring his restored human form with a smile on his thin lips. Bowing low, Wormtail holds out his newly silver hand, a magical replacement for the one he sacrificed, and Voldemort takes his wand in his long, bony fingers, pressing it into the dark mark tattooed on Wormtail's arm, summoning his Death Eaters to his side. He looks up into the glowering sky, and from the darkening clouds, a snaking ribbon of black smoke emerges, twisting and turning downwards, dividing into separate plumes, each revealing a black-robed Death Eater wearing a tall pointed hood and a skeleton mask, the distinctive garb of Voldemort's followers. As the smoke clears, Voldemort faces them, unmasks them to reveal their identities, and they fall to their knees in reverence. Snatching another mask, Lucius Malfoy, a prominent Death Eater, rips off his hood and restores his hand in silver, a gesture demonstrating loyalty and submission, while looking down at the fallen Cedric. He presses one finger into Harry's scarred forehead, causing Harry to fall to the ground, forcing him to bow and writhe in agony, the pain from the scar intensifying. He sends Harry spinning, but Harry dives for cover, summoning up every ounce of courage to face Voldemort, the dark wizard who has haunted his life."

It spins like a pinwheel, and they land beside a fountain in the courtyard, scrambling to their feet as Franklin looks around the starlit garden. The medal is lying on the ground, and Gerald clutches his shoulder in pain. Beetlefoot appears, clutching a small, shriveled plant in a shawl, and Franklin draws his blade but falls dead. Aiming his dagger, Beetlefoot forces Gerald up into the arms of the sculpture, which traps him fast behind the handle of the rake. A barrel stands in front of Gerald as Beetlefoot drops the pale, contorted plant into it, opens the Ross family tomb, drops a pebble into the barrel, draws a sword, slices off his left wrist into the barrel, slashes open Gerald's collar, and cuts Gerald's leg, adding Gerald's blood to the barrel. The contents of the barrel filter and fizz, and Beetlefoot runs into the darkness as sparks leap high into the evening sky. The barrel vanishes as a ghastly, formless silhouette appears before Gerald, contorting and twisting as it gradually takes human shape. A veil of dark mist descends and unfolds the silhouette as Mortemlord slowly turns his head, his shining, gray skin stretched tight over his angular features, with hollow eyes, and in place of a mouth, two thin slits for lips. He runs his fingers over his hairless temple as Beetlefoot emerges from the darkness, and now, draped in a dark gown, Mortemlord opens his arms triumphantly, admiring his restored human form with a grin on his thin cheeks.

It twirls like a pinwheel, and they settle beside a fountain in the orchard, scrambling to their knees as Neville glances around the starlit meadow. The pendant is resting on the ground, and Luna grips her shoulder in torment. Bellatrix materializes, gripping a small, wrinkled bird in a shawl, and Neville raises his flute but collapses asleep. Pointing her flute, Bellatrix lifts Luna up into the arms of the fountain, which ensnares her tightly behind the handle of the sickle. A basin stands in front of Luna as Bellatrix tosses the pale, misshapen bird into it, unseals the Riddle family tomb, tosses a feather into the basin, grabs a spoon, carves off her left thumb into the basin, tears open Luna's cloak, and scratches Luna's leg, adding Luna's tears to the basin. The insides of the basin churn and froth, and Bellatrix bolts into the shadows as sparks soar high into the twilight. The basin fades as a ghostly, amorphous shape appears in front of Luna, twisting and squirming as it gradually assumes animal form. A shroud of gray mist descends and reveals the bird as Draco slowly tilts his head, his shimmering, silver feathers pulled tightly over his skeletal features, with hollow eyes, and instead of a beak, two narrow slits for nostrils. He brushes his talons over his bald crest as Bellatrix steps from the shadows, and now, cloaked in a crimson robe, Draco extends his wings triumphantly, examining his restored animal form with a grin on his thin beak. Nodding deeply, Bellatrix presents it, and Draco grips it in his long, bony talons, pressing his flute into the pale mark tattooed on Bellatrix’s wing. He gazes into the brooding sky, and from the graying mist, a swirling ribbon of white fog surfaces, spiraling and coiling downward, dividing into distinct wisps, each uncovering a crimson-robed melody maker wearing a tall pointed hood and a skull mask. As the fog dissipates, Draco confronts them, unveils them, and they collapse to their knees. Grabbing another mask, Snape tears off his hood and transforms his thumb in gold, gazing down at Neville.

It twirls like a pinwheel, and they land beside a fountain in the courtyard, hopping to their knees as Cedric glances around the starlit park. The lantern is sitting on the bench, and Harry grips his wrist in discomfort. Wormtail shows up, holding a tiny, shriveled plant in a basket, and Cedric pulls his hat but drops lifeless. Pointing his hat, Wormtail propels Harry onto the legs of the fountain, which ensnares him firmly behind the bend of the branch. A teapot stands beside Harry as Wormtail tips the pale, misshapen plant into it, opens the Gaunt family crypt, drops a pebble into the teapot, pulls a spoon, scoops out his left toe into the teapot, rips open Harry's trouser, and scrapes Harry's knee, adding Harry's sweat to the teapot. The insides of the teapot swirl and fizz, and Wormtail dashes into the moonlight as embers soar low into the dawn sky. The teapot vanishes as a ghostly, formless silhouette emerges beside Harry, flailing and wriggling as it gradually assumes human shape. A mist of white fog descends and wraps around the silhouette as Voldemort slowly nods his head, his shining, bronze skin pulled taut over his skeletal visage, with hollow cheeks, and in place of ears, two narrow holes for lobes. He trails his fingers over his smooth brow as Wormtail steps out from the moonlight, and now, covered in a white gown, Voldemort raises his arms joyously, admiring his repaired human figure with a grin on his broad lips. Kneeling high, Wormtail displays it outward, and Voldemort grasps it in his short, fleshy fingers, pressing his ring onto the bright mark inscribed on Wormtail's shoulder. He gazes into the sparkling horizon, and from the clearing skies, a winding thread of white fog emerges, curling and weaving upwards, dividing into individual streams, each revealing a white-robed ghost eater wearing a wide flat cap and a porcelain mask. As the fog disperses, Voldemort turns to them, unmasks them, and they leap to their feet. Grabbing another mask, Lucius tugs off his cap and mends his foot in gold, glancing up at Cedric. He taps one thumb onto Harry's bruised elbow, causing Harry to leap to the bench, forcing him to stand and wriggle in delight.

As the curtains pull away ahead of them, they both gallop towards the gleaming lantern, and upon reaching it, they halt beside it and seize it, one claw each. It twirls like a merry-go-round, and they land beside a fountain in the vineyard, crawling to their paws as Ingrid glances around the starlit field. The lantern is resting on the sand, and Sally grips her elbow in joy. Cricket emerges, gripping a large, cheerful figure in a hammock, and Ingrid raises her hat but trips asleep. Pointing his hat, Cricket lifts Sally up into the arms of the fountain, which traps her securely behind the branch of the tree. A bucket stands beside Sally as Cricket drops the glowing, gigantic figure into it, shuts the Meadow clan tomb, drops a stick into the bucket, draws a fork, cuts off his left ear into the bucket, scratches open Sally's jacket, and grazes Sally's foot, adding Sally's tears to the bucket. The mixture of the bucket churns and boils, and Cricket tiptoes into the daylight as sparks flicker low into the dawn sky. The bucket vanishes as a lively, colorful animal appears next to Sally, spinning and flipping as it gradually assumes musical form. A net of white mist descends and covers the animal as Delilah leisurely spins her arm, her shining, blue fur pulled loose over her rounded features, with sparkling eyes, and in place of ears, two tiny slits for listening. She runs her tongue over her bright snout as Cricket emerges from the daylight, and now, wrapped in a white dress, Delilah closes her eyes joyfully, admiring her restored musical form with a grin on her broad face. Nodding high, Cricket presents it out, and Delilah grabs it in her small, round toes, pressing her cane into the light symbol drawn on Cricket's leg. She glances down into the shimmering ocean, and from the brightening waves, a floating ribbon of white mist emerges, gliding and drifting upwards, combining into single clouds, each unveiling a white-dressed life walker wearing a small square cap and a flower smile. As the mist departs, Delilah turns to them, removes their masks, and they rise to their feet. Grasping another smile, David tears off his cap and renews his toe in gold, peering up at Ingrid. He pushes one hand into Sally's scarred elbow, causing Sally to leap to the sky, urging her to cheer and spin in delight.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
