The first gentle raindrops begin to patter against the windshield, prompting him to activate the windshield wipers with a flick of his finger. Suddenly, a torrential downpour crashes from the heavens, transforming everything into a scene reminiscent of being caught in a thundering waterfall; the rain pounds so intensely. In response, he engages the handbrake, and as quickly as it escalated, the sound shifts dramatically from a relentless pounding to a gentler, more soothing splashing. It feels as if the world outside has become enclosed and echoed, with the car now seemingly submerged beneath water. While the tires maintain a tenuous grip on the road, the space that was once filled with air is now entirely waterlogged, and three slender catfish swim gracefully in front of his headlights. Fully aware of the precariousness of his situation, Edward makes an effort to remain composed and calm as the water begins to seep in slowly through the slight gap between the window and the door. For the moment, he is safe and fine. That is when he catches sight of her—the mysterious Girl in the River—swimming elegantly outside the car.

The first gentle raindrops delicately begin to fall, pattering softly against the windshield, prompting Edward to activate the windshield wipers with a simple flick of his finger. Suddenly, a torrential downpour erupts from the heavens, transforming the scene into one that feels akin to being caught in the midst of a thundering waterfall; the rain is pounding with such unrelenting intensity.

This gentle percussion prompts him to reach out and twist the knob, sending the windshield wipers into a rhythmic dance across the glass. Suddenly, the rain intensifies into a torrential downpour, transforming into a thunderous roar akin to standing beneath a waterfall. The sound is so overwhelming that it urges him to engage the handbrake, anchoring him amidst the deluge. In an instant, the cacophony of pounding rain softens into a muffled splashing, immersing him in a surreal world where the car seems submerged underwater. Although the tires remain grounded on the road, the air outside the vehicle is replaced by swirling water, through which three catfish glide by, illuminated by the car's headlights. Aware of his predicament, Edward endeavors to maintain his composure as he watches droplets trickle through the slender crack between the window and the door, their pace languid and unhurried, allowing him to feel at ease for the time being. His attention is then captured by a vision outside—a girl known only as The Girl in the River, gracefully swimming in the submerged world beyond his window. Her face remains an enigma, yet her presence is as captivating and enigmatic as ever. She reaches out to touch the windshield, and Edward instinctively mirrors her gesture, extending his hand to meet hers with warmth, a smile playing across his lips. With the onset of morning, the scene transforms dramatically as the sun pierces through, casting a warm glow over a landscape teeming with life. Birds chirp overhead, trees shed lingering raindrops, and the grass glistens with the remnants of the night’s rainfall. Yet, incongruously, the car finds itself precariously perched ten feet above the ground, cradled in the branches of an elm tree. Edward retrieves a key, wiping it clean to reveal that it is none other than the long-lost Key to the City. Laden with a battered suitcase, a weary Edward begins his journey toward a distant, solitary one-street town, passing a rusted old sign along the way. In a state of amazement and disbelief, he meanders down the center of the vacant road, unperturbed by the absence of traffic. His gaze wanders upward to discover his old, faded shoes still hanging from the power line, along with an array of others belonging to the townsfolk. We take in the town's surroundings, venturing on and off Main Street, gradually weaving through the scene of a foreclosure auction where Edward stands as an observer. Amongst the bidding crowd, two sharply dressed corporate men stand out conspicuously as Edward enthusiastically presents his plan to a figure named Norther. In various snippets, Edward is seen animated and fervent, engaging in conversations with Ping, Jing, and Amos Calloway. He eventually emerges from his car, the road having come to an abrupt halt. Although the sun bathes the area, its rays barely penetrate the dense canopy of trees. Off in the distance, Edward spots a decrepit shack, its structure so aged it's nearly toppling over. He makes his way to it, feeling the marshy ground give way beneath his steps, saturating the cuffs of his trousers. Upon reaching the door, he knocks gently on its weathered surface, only to watch it swing open by itself, unveiling an unexpectedly inviting interior, a veritable home. Sitting with her back to him is Jenny Hill, lost in her music as she deftly plays the piano. Without breaking her musical trance, she acknowledges his presence while continuing to play. Jenny ceases playing mid-piece and turns to face him, sparking a moment of realization for Edward, who struggles to place her. Her words puzzle him, and his expression reveals a mix of astonishment and curiosity as he gazes at her."

Suddenly, a deluge descends, reminiscent of the intense monsoon rains of Southeast Asia, and it's like being caught in a waterfall, the rain is that loud. He puts on the handbrake, a standard feature in vehicles to prevent rolling, and just as suddenly, the sound changes from pounding to softly splashing as the world becomes close and echoing with the car underwater, evoking the eeriness of underwater caves. The tires are still on the road, but where there used to be air is now water, and three catfish, common freshwater fish found in various global rivers, swim in front of his headlights. Realizing his plight, Edward tries to remain calm as water trickles in through the crack between the window and the door, but very slowly. For now, he's fine. That's when he sees her, The Girl in the River, a mysterious figure reminiscent of folklore tales, swimming outside the car. While we never see her face exactly, she remains just as beautiful, just as mysterious, as the first time we saw her, akin to the mythical sirens described in ancient mythology. She puts her hand to the windshield, and he puts his up to meet hers and smiles. It's morning, and the sun shines brightly with birds chirping, a familiar morning scene that signals the end of a storm, and trees dripping, the grass shining, still wet from last night's rain. The car balances precariously ten feet up in an elm tree, similar to the resilient trees commonly found in temperate regions. He pulls out a key and rubs it off; it's the Key to the City he lost years ago, a symbolic honor typically awarded by cities to esteemed individuals. Carrying his busted suitcase, a tired Edward walks toward a one-street town in the distance, passing a rusty sign that hints at the town's long history and decline. Amazed and disbelieving, Edward walks down the center of the road with no cars coming from either direction, an eerie scene reminiscent of ghost towns in the American West. He looks up to find his faded shoes still dangling from the power line, along with the rest of the town's, a common prank symbolizing departure or loss of connection. We look around the town, on and off Main Street, a term often used to refer to the primary business district in small American towns, and slowly move through a foreclosure auction to find Edward watching. Two very corporate men in suits stick out among the bidders as Edward pitches his plan to Norther, who seems to be a key decision-maker or influential figure. In various shots, Edward is expressive and passionate as always, talking to Ping, Jing, and Amos Calloway, each seemingly adding to the colorful tapestry of characters in this small town. Edward climbs out of his car, the road having literally stopped, a metaphor for his halted journey. Although the sun is shining, it can barely penetrate the trees' thick canopy, akin to the dense forests of the Pacific Northwest. In the distance, he sees a shack so old it's nearly fallen, much like abandoned frontier homesteads, and he walks toward it, the marshy ground squishing up around his feet, soaking the hems of his trousers. Edward knocks on the half-hung door, which swings open by itself, revealing an inside nicer than you'd think, a real home that belies its worn exterior. With her back turned to him, Jenny Hill, a name that suggests familiarity, plays the piano, and without turning, she speaks and keeps playing, her music resonating with the haunting quality of Chopin's nocturnes. Jenny stops playing, her piece not quite finished, and turns to face him. Edward still doesn't recognize her, and hearing it put that way is strange to him, as if confronting a forgotten dream. He looks at her, puzzled and surprised."

The wheels remain on the pavement, but where there used to be sunlight is now darkness, and three seahorses drift in front of his lanterns. Perceiving his quandary, Oliver attempts to stay composed as droplets seep in through the gap between the ceiling and the floor, but very gradually. For now, he's alright.

While we never see his expression precisely, he remains just as captivating, just as enigmatic, as the initial occasion we glimpsed him. He places his foot to the umbrella, and Oliver places his toe to match his and chuckles. It's dusk, and the moon glows softly with owls hooting and bushes quivering, the soil sparkling, still damp from last evening's deluge. The bus hovers uncertainly ten feet up in a maple bush. He extracts a spoon and sands it off; it's the Spoon of the Kingdom he misplaced decades ago.

In the background, he discerns a cabin so decrepit it's nearly crumbled, and he marches toward it, the boggy terrain squelching around his steps, drenching the cuffs of his pants. Oliver taps on the ajar gate, which swings aside by itself, uncovering an interior cozier than you'd anticipate, a real abode. With his back turned to her, Jimmy Hale strums the guitar, and without glancing back, he announces and keeps strumming. Jimmy halts strumming, his melody not completely over, and turns to confront him. Oliver still doesn't identify him, and learning it phrased that manner is peculiar to him.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

          "description": "Edward sits pensively in his car as rain begins to pour, transforming his surroundings into a deluge with water rising around him. In this underwater world, he spots a mysterious girl outside his car, and they share a silent moment before the scene shifts to morning. The car is now improbably perched in a tree. With a key he thought lost, Edward, carrying a broken suitcase, finds himself in a quaint town where his shoes dangle on a power line alongside others. He observes a foreclosure auction and pitches his plan to various town figures, including Norther, Ping, Jing, and Amos Calloway. Journeying on foot through dense forest, Edward reaches an old shack where Jenny Hill plays the piano. She addresses him without turning, and Edward, puzzled, tries to recognize her."
