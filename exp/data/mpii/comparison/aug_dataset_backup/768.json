Observing the movement, Nora catches sight of Anheuser and addresses him directly. Their attention is drawn to the presence of the Saudi prince and his family in the vicinity. With a shared understanding, Anheuser walks off accompanied by Michaels, prompting Nora to give Adrian's shoulder a reassuring pat before she follows them. Meanwhile, a stream of crowds makes its way steadily along the Nampan Plateau, a distinguishable group comprising Satnam and his family. They momentarily pause, their gazes sweeping the horizon to witness the terrifying approach of a gigantic tsunami advancing unrelentingly toward the coastline. The monstrous waves appear to loom ominously over Satnam as they surge directly toward the refugees. Away from the peril on land, Adrian is escorted into a cabin aboard the escape ship. Taking a quick survey of his new surroundings, he picks up a goblet, momentarily distracted by the object, before retrieving his ringing mobile from his bag with purpose. Somewhere in the unfolding chaos, Satnam crouches down, his voice soft yet fervent as he holds his son's face tenderly in his hands. Together, they immerse themselves in deep prayer as the tidal wave looms ever closer. Amidst their poignant embrace, Satnam and his wife envelop their son securely between them, as Adrian remains a silent listener. Suddenly, Adrian discards the goblet with decisive force. On the Arc bridge, urgency propels Adrian as he rushes across to reach Scottie.

A revised countdown materializes on the screens, signaling a shift. Concurrently, Nema is back behind the wheel, driving the truck with his grandparents settled comfortably in the cab alongside him. In the rear compartment, Jackson travels with his family, joined by Gordon and Tamara. Little Noah, nestled against Gordon, sleeps soundly, his head resting gently upon Gordon's supportive shoulder. Gordon, feeling Jackson's watchful gaze, lifts his own eyes, acknowledging their shared journey, then redirects his attention, speaking without meeting Jackson's eyes. As they continue their journey, Gordon turns his head, marking the passage beneath a sign indicating utility gate 17 east. At this juncture, Nema halts the truck, and Tenzen alights to open the gate. With a quick glance over his shoulder, Nema gives an encouraging nudge to the kids, urging them forward. Kate, scanning the crowd, spots Nema's grandma, while Tenzen's eyes meet Lily and Noah, signaling them to move along with a beckoning gesture. Meanwhile, in the ship bay, Yuri and the others make their presence felt. Yuri delivers a forceful thump to a security guard, distracting him as the crowd seizes the opportunity to surge forward, entering the bay. Yuri's attention shifts as he surveys the ark, watching as Tenzen guides Kate, Jackson, and the others towards the mountainside, which reveals the entrance to the ship bays. Taking initiative, she calls upon a passing science officer for assistance. Tenzen, maintaining his leadership role, directs everyone up the launch tower staircase. On the bridge, Jackson and Noah make their way up the launch pad, with Noah gazing upwards in awe at the anchors that dangle ominously from the vast ship's hull, the wind playfully tousling his hair.

He looks back down the road to where Jackson, who has been scouting for safe passage through the heavily barricaded areas, stands with arms raised. They run to the truck. On the ground, Captain Michaels, an experienced naval officer coordinating the evacuation efforts, leads Anheuser's team across a walkway, where there are many other walkers with people crossing to the waiting arks, which are enormous vessels designed to withstand catastrophic events. Nora, a key figure in the engineering team responsible for building the arks, sees them and addresses Anheuser, the government official overseeing the entire operation. They spot the Saudi prince and his family, recognizable for their traditional dress and entourage. Anheuser walks off with Michaels, and Nora pats Adrian's shoulder, a young scientist known for his contributions to the ark's navigation system, and follows them. Crowds trudge along the Nampan Plateau, an elevated area selected for its strategic location, among them are Satnam and his family. They stop and look around to see a gigantic tsunami, triggered by a massive geological shift, heading for the coastline. The huge waves tower over Satnam and head straight for the refugees, who have gathered there in hopes of salvation. Adrian is shown into a cabin on the escape ship, which offers a brief respite from the chaos outside, glances around, picks up a goblet, an ornate piece from the ship's dining set, and takes his ringing mobile from his bag. Leaving his phone switched on, Satnam crouches down and holds his son's face in his hands. They're deep in prayer, seeking solace from their faith as the tidal wave comes closer. Satnam and his wife hug their son between them as Adrian listens intently to the unfolding events outside. Adrian throws away the goblet, realizing the gravity of the situation. On the Arc bridge, Adrian rushes across to Scottie, the communications lead responsible for linking all the teams. The images have been called up, and Adrian turns to Anheuser, eager to share the latest findings. They look at another screen, and Scottie hits a button to update the emergency protocols. The old watch at the screen now reads 2 hours, 6 minutes, and 17 seconds, indicating the time left before impact. Anheuser turns away after moving his spectacles closer to a group of people sitting at another bank of monitors overseeing the coordination. A revised countdown appears on their screens, ensuring that everyone is synchronized. Nema drives the truck with his grandparents, who have witnessed previous natural disasters, in the cab with him. In the back, Jackson is with his family, Gordon and Tamara, whose medical backgrounds make them crucial in tending to injuries. Little Noah lies asleep, his head resting on Gordon's shoulder. Gordon glances up and sees Jackson watching them, stares ahead, and speaks without looking at Jackson, maintaining his focus on their escape route. He turns his head, and they pass a sign for utility gate 17 east, a designated entry point for ark boarding. Nema stops the truck, and Tenzen, a local guide familiar with the terrain, opens the gate. Nema looks over his shoulder and nudges the kids forward, signaling the urgency. Kate, a former school teacher turned volunteer, spots Nema's grandma, and Tenzen glances up at Lily and Noah, then beckons them forward, ensuring that families stay united. Yuri and the others are in the ship bay. Yuri, a former athlete known for his strength, thumps the security guard as he looks behind, and the crowd pushes past and enters the bay. Yuri overlooks the arc as Tenzen leads Kate, Jackson, and the others towards the mountainside, which opens to reveal the ship bays, a marvel of engineering concealed within the rocky landscape. She calls on a passing science officer, crucial for operating the arc's systems, to assist. Tenzen leads everyone up a launch tower staircase designed for emergency boarding. On the bridge, Jackson and Noah head up the launch pad. Noah stares up at the anchors dangling from a gigantic ship's hull, a testament to the ship's massive structure, as the wind ruffles his hair. Jackson grabs Noah, and they hurry up towards the ark, knowing it's their best chance for survival. The Russian President, a significant figure in international politics, is led onto an ark bridge by his interpreter, ensuring that crucial diplomatic communications continue."

Adrian is escorted into a tent on the lifeboat, glances around, picks up a chalice, and retrieves his buzzing pager from his sack. Leaving his device on, Satnam kneels and cups his son's face in his palms. They're deep in meditation as the storm draws nearer. Satnam and his wife cuddle their son between them as Adrian eavesdrops. Adrian tosses aside the chalice. On the Arc bridge, Adrian dashes across the bridge to Scottie. The illustrations have been summoned, and Adrian turns to Anheuser. They gaze at another monitor, and Scottie presses a key. The vintage clock at the monitor now reads 2 hours, 6 minutes, and 17 seconds. Anheuser pivots after nudging his goggles closer to a cluster of individuals clustered at another row of keyboards. An updated countdown appears on their monitors. Nema pedals the bicycle with his grandparents perched in the basket with him. In the rear, Jackson is with his group, Gordon and Tamara. Little Noah dozes off, his head nestled on Gordon's shoulder. Gordon peers up and notices Jackson observing them, gazes forward, and converses without glancing at Jackson. He swivels his head, and they bypass a sign for access door 17 east. Nema parks the bicycle, and Tenzen unfastens the door. Nema glances over his shoulder and nudges the kids onward. Kate notices Nema's grandpa, and Tenzen peeks up at Lily and Noah, then signals them onward. Yuri and the others are in the ship dock. Yuri elbows the bouncer as he peers backward, and the crowd shoves through and enters the dock. Yuri surveys the dirigible as Tenzen guides Kate, Jackson, and the others towards the hillside, which reveals the ship docks. She consults a passing science technician. Tenzen guides everyone up a departure tower ladder. On the bridge, Jackson and Noah proceed up the launch platform. Noah gawks up at the ropes dangling from a colossal submarine's bow as the breeze tousles his hair. Jackson clutches Noah, and they scurry up towards the balloon. The Russian President is guided onto a balloon bridge by his translator."

          "description": "Zelda halts the bicycle and hops down. She peers back up the alley to where Blake grins with hands waving. They stroll to the bicycle. In the park, Lieutenant Sanders directs Ferguson's crew along a pathway, where there are numerous hikers with tourists ambling to the waiting trains. Mia observes them and speaks to Ferguson. They notice the Egyptian ambassador and his entourage. Ferguson saunters off with Sanders, and Mia taps Ethan's elbow and trails them. Throngs shuffle across the Windy Valley, among them are Ramesh and his team. They pause and glance up to witness a colossal avalanche descending toward the village. The massive snow drifts hover over Ramesh and aim directly at the villagers. Ethan is escorted into a chamber on the rescue train, scans the room, picks up a vase, and retrieves his buzzing tablet from his pocket. Keeping his device activated, Ramesh kneels and cups his daughter's face in his hands. They're immersed in meditation as the avalanche nears. Ramesh and his spouse embrace their daughter between them as Ethan listens. Ethan discards the vase. On the Dock walkway, Ethan races across the walkway to Benny. The visuals have been called up, and Ethan turns to Ferguson. They gaze at another monitor, and Benny presses a switch. The antique clock on the monitor now shows 2 hours, 6 minutes, and 17 seconds. Ferguson turns aside after adjusting his binoculars closer to a group of children lounging beside another row of gadgets. An updated timer appears on their devices. Zelda rides the bicycle with her siblings in the seat with her. In the basket, Blake is with his relatives, Harriet and Lucy. Little Sam snoozes, his head leaning on Harriet's arm. Harriet glances around and notices Blake observing them, looks ahead, and talks without glancing at Blake. She swivels her head, and they pass a sign for supply tunnel 17 west. Zelda parks the bicycle, and Lian shuts the tunnel. Zelda glances over her elbow and urges the youngsters forward. Carol notices Zelda's grandfather, and Lian peeks at Ava and Sam, then gestures them onward. Boris and the others are in the hangar bay. Boris taps the sentry as he glances ahead, and the throng surges past and enters the hangar. Boris overlooks the decks as Lian guides Carol, Blake, and the others towards the hillside, which parts to disclose the hangar bays. She consults a strolling research officer. Lian guides everyone up an elevator shaft. On the platform, Blake and Sam ascend the launch ramp. Sam gazes up at the hooks swinging from a massive zeppelin's underbelly as the breeze tousles his hair. Blake clutches Sam, and they rush up toward the vessel. The Brazilian Chancellor is guided onto an ark platform by his translator."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
