Indy reaches for a wall to steady himself and inadvertently grabs a skeleton, causing a bone to come loose in his hand as rats scurry about and leap at him from all directions. He takes a moment to compose himself, then steps across the water to Elsa's side and helps her into the water. The chamber is flooded with black, briny water as they move toward the altar. Indy and Elsa begin to inspect the ornately carved coffins like the scholars of antiquity that they are, noting the big oak caskets held together by straps of etched brass. One coffin is elevated above the others, and together they begin to push on the lid, straining and groaning until it slides away and bangs against the stone platform, revealing the decomposed remains of a knight in armor. Indy and Elsa look in, and Indy unfolds a piece of paper and holds it over the shield, completing the missing portion of the rubbing. Indy laughs, lights a match, and drops the lighted match into the oil-slick water as Elsa holds the torch. Indy looks around and then sees the glow of firelight dancing across the Catacomb walls. Thousands of rats flee from around the corner of the narrow passageway, stampeding toward Elsa and Indy, shrieking and squealing as they approach.

Kazim and his crew stride to the entrance Indy created previously and illuminate their torches through to the vermin-infested liquid. Additional vermin-infested liquid emerges as Elsa, now strolling afresh, trails Indy through another corridor bordered with skulls and bones. Indy reaches for a surface to support himself and unintentionally seizes a skeleton, causing a bone to detach in his grasp as rodents skitter about and spring at him from every direction. He takes an instant to steady himself, then steps across the liquid to Elsa's side and aids her into the liquid. The chamber is inundated with dark, saline liquid as they advance toward the altar. Indy and Elsa commence to examine the elaborately carved sarcophagi like the academics of antiquity that they are, observing the large oak chests secured by bands of engraved brass. One sarcophagus is elevated above the others, and together they commence to shove on the cover, straining and groaning until it slides away and crashes against the stone platform, revealing the decayed remains of a knight in armor. Indy and Elsa gaze in, and Indy unfolds a scrap of paper and holds it over the shield, completing the absent portion of the rubbing. Indy chuckles, ignites a match, and drops the ignited match into the oily liquid as Elsa holds the torch. Indy glances around and then perceives the glow of firelight flickering across the Catacomb walls. Thousands of rodents flee from around the bend of the narrow corridor, stampeding toward Elsa and Indy, shrieking and squealing as they near. The rodents wash over them like a vermin tidal surge in their attempts to flee. Elsa shrieks, and Indy braces his spine against the altar, toppling the sarcophagus with his feet. It crashes against the stone platform and splashes into the liquid. They leap into the liquid beside the bobbing, overturned sarcophagus. Indy literally immerses her and pushes her beneath as Elsa emerges into the air void formed by the sarcophagus, sputtering and spitting. Indy then pops up into the air void and looks at Elsa; they are both drenched. Indy vanishes beneath the liquid and swims out from beneath the sarcophagus, searching for an escape path, while the rodents start to force their way inside, swimming through the liquid and climbing on Elsa, who writhes and shrieks in fright. Indy pops back up through the liquid, and Elsa moans. They take a deep breath and both plunge beneath the liquid.

The unpleasant sight of even more rat-infested water confronts them as Elsa, now walking with renewed resolve, trails behind Indy through a chilling passageway, its walls grotesquely adorned with skulls and bones. In an attempt to steady himself, Indy reaches for a wall and inadvertently grips a skeleton, carelessly causing a bone to detach and remain in his grasp, while rats scurry about and leap toward him from every conceivable direction. He pauses briefly to regain his composure, then decisively steps across the water to join Elsa, assisting her into the murky liquid. As they move in the direction of the altar, the chamber becomes engulfed in an inundation of dark, salty water. Acting like scholars of ancient times, Indy and Elsa commence their careful examination of the ornately carved coffins, noting with keen interest the large oak caskets held together by intricately etched straps of brass. A notable coffin, elevated above the rest, captures their attention, prompting them to push mightily against its lid.

Suddenly, hordes of rats, driven by panic, come racing around the corner of the narrow passage, hurtling towards Elsa and Indy with frantic energy, their shrieks and squeals echoing ominously. The rats surge over them in a chaotic wave, desperately seeking escape. Elsa's scream pierces the air, while Indy braces himself against the altar with his back, forcefully toppling the coffin with his feet. The coffin crashes heavily against the stone platform before plunging into the water with a loud splash. In an instant, they leap into the water alongside the overturned coffin.

Acting like scholars of ancient times, Indy and Elsa begin their careful, methodical examination of the ornately carved coffins, noting with keen interest and scholarly curiosity the large oak caskets that are held together by intricately etched straps of brass. A notable coffin, elevated above the rest and more prominent than the others, captures their attention, prompting them to push mightily against its lid.

In the meantime, Kazim and his men, maintaining a cautious stance, approach the opening that Indy had previously created and, with deliberate movements, direct their flashlights into the murky, rat-infested water below. As more of this rodent-populated water becomes visible, Elsa regains her footing, now walking alongside Indy, as they progress through another passageway bordered by skulls and bones, adding an eerie atmosphere to their surroundings. Indy extends his hand, seeking stability, and inadvertently grips a skeleton, unexpectedly finding a bone coming loose in his grasp, as the rats scuttle and leap around him from various directions. Momentarily pausing to regain composure, he then carefully steps across the water to reach Elsa’s side, gently assisting her into the water with him. The chamber is soon engulfed in dark, briny water as they steadily advance toward the altar. Together, Indy and Elsa, akin to scholars from antiquity, commence a detailed examination of the ornately carved coffins, observing the large oak caskets that are fastened with straps of beautifully etched brass. Their attention focuses on one particular coffin that is notably elevated above the others, and with combined effort, they begin to push against the lid, straining and emitting groans until it finally slides away with a loud crash against the stone platform, unveiling the decomposed remains of a knight clad in armor. Peering inside, Indy unfolds a piece of paper, carefully positioning it over the shield and thereby completing the missing section of the rubbing. With a chuckle, he lights a match, allowing a brief flicker of amusement to cross his face, before dropping the lit match into the oil-slicked water while Elsa holds the torch aloft. Observing his surroundings, Indy soon notices the firelight’s warm glow dancing across the ancient Catacomb walls. Suddenly, the air is filled with the frantic sound of thousands of rats, fleeing from around the narrow passageway’s corner, stampeding toward Elsa and Indy, their shrieks and squeals growing louder as they draw near. The rats surge over them like a living tidal wave in their frenzied attempt to escape, prompting Elsa to scream in horror. Indy, with quick reflexes, braces his back against the altar, using his feet to topple the coffin with a powerful push. The coffin crashes down onto the stone platform and splashes into the water. With urgency, they jump into the water beside the now bobbing and overturned coffin. In a swift, deliberate motion, Indy submerges Elsa, pushing her beneath the surface, and she emerges into an air pocket created by the coffin, gasping and sputtering. Indy follows suit, appearing into the same air space, where they both find themselves thoroughly soaked. Without delay, Indy disappears once more beneath the water, searching keenly for a possible escape route as the rats begin forcing their way into the water, swimming with determination and clambering onto Elsa, who writhes and shrieks in terror. Moments later, Indy resurfaces through the water, aware of Elsa’s groan of distress. Taking a synchronized deep breath, they both dive beneath the water, their movements blending seamlessly with the perfect picture postcard view of St. Mark's Square and the Grand Canal beyond coming into focus."

Kazim and his men, members of a secretive order dedicated to protecting ancient relics, step to the opening Indy made earlier and shine their flashlights through to the rat-infested water, reminiscent of the labyrinthine canals of Venice, a city renowned for its intricate waterway system. More rat-infested water appears as Elsa, now walking again, follows Indy through another passageway lined with skulls and bones, a sobering reminder of the catacombs beneath Paris where countless remains of the dead reside. Indy reaches for a wall to steady himself and inadvertently grabs a skeleton, causing a bone to come loose in his hand as rats scurry about, reminiscent of the infamous scenes from horror films, and leap at him from all directions. He takes a moment to compose himself, then steps across the water to Elsa's side and helps her into the water. The chamber is flooded with black, briny water, much like the waters of Venice's canals, as they move toward the altar. Indy and Elsa begin to inspect the ornately carved coffins like the scholars of antiquity that they are, noting the big oak caskets held together by straps of etched brass, similar to those used during the medieval period for knights. One coffin is elevated above the others, possibly signifying its importance, and together they begin to push on the lid, straining and groaning until it slides away and bangs against the stone platform, revealing the decomposed remains of a knight in armor, an echo of the legendary Knights Templar. Indy and Elsa look in, and Indy unfolds a piece of paper and holds it over the shield, completing the missing portion of the rubbing as if solving a puzzle from ancient times. Indy laughs, lights a match, and drops the lighted match into the oil-slick water, which catches fire reminiscent of dramatic Hollywood stunts, as Elsa holds the torch.

Thousands of rats flee from around the corner of the narrow passageway, stampeding toward Elsa and Indy, shrieking and squealing as they approach, a veritable rodent exodus akin to the plagues of ancient Egypt. The rats wash over them like a rodent tidal wave in their efforts to escape. Elsa screams, and Indy braces his back against the altar, toppling the coffin with his feet. It crashes against the stone platform and splashes into the water, echoing the chaos of nature facing human disturbance. They jump into the water beside the bobbing, overturned coffin. Indy literally dunks her and pushes her underneath as Elsa surfaces into the air pocket created by the coffin, sputtering and spitting in the manner of those escaping a perilous situation. Indy then pops up into the air pocket and looks at Elsa; they are both soaking wet. Indy disappears under the water and swims out from under the coffin, looking for an escape route, while the rats begin to force their way inside, swimming through the water and climbing on Elsa, who squirms and screams in terror as if in a scene from an Edgar Allan Poe story. Indy pops back up through the water, and Elsa groans. They take a deep breath and both dive under the water. The perfect picture postcard of St. Mark's Square and the Grand Canal beyond comes into view, capturing the serene beauty of Venice's historic heart, known for its stunning architecture and vibrant culture."

He pauses to gather his thoughts, then hops across the ground to Lily's side and guides her onto the ground. The arena is filled with white, sandy earth as they proceed toward the stage. Max and Lily begin to survey the ornately painted barrels like the poets of old that they are, marveling at the tiny tin containers clasped together by strips of carved silver. One barrel is raised above the rest, and together they attempt to tug on the cover, grunting and groaning until it slides open and clangs against the wooden platform, unveiling the ancient leftovers of a bard in garb.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
