Gandhi's white wrap is spotted with gore as he collapses. Amid the shrieks and noises of turmoil we dissolve through to soldier's feet progressing in the slow pace, half-step, pace of the dirge march.

We see the two hundred men of the Army, Navy, and Air Force hauling the Army weapon-carrier that holds the corpse of Gandhi. And ultimately we see Gandhi resting on the weapon-carrier, surrounded by blossoms, a diminutive figure in this sea of lamentation and veneration.

          "description": "The cheap glasses perched unsteadily on his nose, highlighting his nut-brown head, and his warm, eager eyes sparkle with a genuine smile as he attentively joins his hands together, observing the traditional gesture to exchange Godse's greeting. In a swift and shocking move, Godse's right hand, initially in the stance of prayer, darts to his jacket with alarming speed, retrieving a hidden gun. He swiftly levels the weapon, aiming point-blank at Gandhi, and with a deafening series of explosions, he fires once, twice, thrice, each shot loud and startling, echoing through the air. Gandhi's pristine white shawl, a symbol of peace, is instantly marred with vivid splatters of blood as he collapses to the ground. The immediate aftermath is a cacophony of screams and chaos, a turmoil that fades into the somber, measured rhythm of soldiers' feet moving in the methodical cadence of a requiem march. The scene unfolds into a vast, unparalleled funeral procession, crowds of people so dense they have never been captured on screen with such magnitude, lining the procession route. Everywhere, individuals cling to towering monuments, lamp standards, and branches of trees, desperately trying to witness this historic moment. As the camera gradually pulls back from the solemn funeral cortege, it reveals an ever-expanding sea of mourners. In the midst of this, a strange, rhythmic shuffling sound dominates, interrupted only by the sporadic, heart-wrenching wail of grief. Along the route, soldiers and sailors form an unbroken human chain, their hands firmly locked together in a continuous line. Simultaneously, two hundred uniformed men of the Army, Navy, and Air Force laboriously draw the Army weapon-carrier, which bears the revered body of Gandhi, himself lying serenely amidst a dense array of flowers, a small but profoundly significant figure within this overwhelming ocean of grief and reverence. Commentators from across the globe document the ceremony, but we focus on a particular voice—the renowned American broadcaster of the era, Edward R. Murrow. As the cortege advances along its path, the camera captures poignant shots of marching soldiers, diverse faces representing Sikhs, Tamils, Anglo-Indians, Muslims from the north, Marathas from the south, blue-eyed Parsees, and dark-skinned Keralans, all united in collective mourning. The vast throng follows the weapon-carrier bier of Gandhi, progressing slowly along Kingsway, a testament to the multitudinous respect he commanded. At the fore of the dignitaries walks Mountbatten, distinguished by his tall, handsome stature and laden with medals. Behind him trails a broad mass of Indians, diverse yet unified in their sorrow. The camera shifts focus to those who accompany Gandhi's body atop the weapon-carrier: Patel, once stout and blunt, now shattered by grief; Gandhi's son, Devadas, carrying his father's legacy; Maulana Azad, whose strong, fierce face betrays his anger, seemingly directed at the Gods themselves; and finally Pandit Nehru—a visage embodying the strength of a hero and the sensitivity of a poet, now bearing the emotional wounds akin to a loving son who has lost his father. Meanwhile, a porter casually glances down a corridor, where he catches a distant sight of a European conversing with the conductor. This prompts him to look up suddenly before hastily returning to his duties. Gandhi, sensing the porter's unease, casts a curious glance toward the door to discern the source of his anxiety. In that moment, the European and the conductor assertively push open the door, striding in with a commanding presence, leaving Gandhi incredulous and taken aback at being addressed with such unexpected directness."

The camera highlights those accompanying Gandhi's body: the devastated Patel, Gandhi's son Devadas, the fierce Maulana Azad, and Pandit Nehru, whose face reflects both a hero's strength and a poet's sensitivity, now marked with the grief of a loving son's loss.

He looks up suddenly, then turns back quickly to his work. Gandhi glances at the door to see what has frightened him so. The European and the conductor push open the door and stride in.

Amid the whispers and echoes of tranquility, we glide through to artist's hands crafting in the gentle pull, half-pull, tug of the solace dance. The tiny performance — audiences such as have never been gathered on the hill gathered along the path. Animals everywhere, resting against stones, lamp posts, flowers — and as the camera zooms out from the dance parade it shows more and more. We only hear a faint, harmonic humming, punctuated by an occasional cheer of joy. We see the artists and dancers flanking the path, their arms entwined in one seemingly endless line. We see the hundred creatures of the Forest, Ocean, and Sky dragging the Forest float that holds the essence of the mountain. And finally, we see the mountain standing on the float, surrounded by leaves, a small presence in this sea of tranquility and admiration. Observers from all over the land are capturing the spectacle. We focus on one, let us say the most renowned Eastern storyteller of the era, Omar M. As the parade continues on its journey, we get glimpses of the drifting artists, of the smiles of cats, and rabbits, foxes from the east, wolves from the west, bright-eyed owls, shadow-lurking panthers. We see the animals, trailing the float shrine of the mountain as it slowly slides its way along the Pathway. Achilles, short, graceful, unadorned, hops at the end of leaders from diverse kingdoms, and behind them, a narrow line of creatures. The camera picks out those who float with the mountain's spirit: the lean, sharp, but now mellowed Hawk, mountain's child, Devourer, the gentle, almost solemn gaze of Turtle, now calm with the Sun itself, and finally Sage — a gaze with the wisdom of an elder, the insight of a seer, and now bright like the stars of the vast sky. The musician has glanced around the alley, where from its angle we can just see the wizard conversing with the minstrel. It peers down suddenly then turns back softly to its tune. The mountain peers at the window to see what has startled it so. The wizard and the minstrel pull open the window and float in. The mountain is bemused that it is being serenaded in such a fashion."

The vast festival parade — gatherings such as have always been seen on the stage clustered along the path. Creatures everywhere, hanging from towers, window sills, bushes — and as the camera zooms away from the parade car it reveals less and less. We only hear a peculiar, melodic humming, pierced by an infrequent chuckle of mirth. We see the bakers and tailors lining the path, their feet bound together in one seemingly endless line. We see the three hundred women of the Circus, Bakery, and Orchestra dragging the Circus cart that holds the book of Gandhi. And finally we see Gandhi resting on the cart, encircled by vegetables, a tiny ornament in this sea of joy and admiration. Entertainers from all corners of the globe are narrating the festival. We spotlight one, let us say the most notable French novelist of the time, Marcel Proust.

Tolstoy, short, graceful, unadorned, dances at the head of leaders from many regions, and behind them a narrow line of animals.

The tiny bridal celebration — dolls such as have never been glimpsed on the map gathered along the path. Objects everywhere, sticking to shadows, sign posts, benches — and as the spotlight zooms out from the bridal party, it uncovers less and less. We only catch a familiar, erratic humming, interrupted by an occasional sigh of relief. We observe the bakers and pilots tipping the track, their shoulders tied together in one seemingly broken line. We notice the two hundred women of the Symphony, Circus, and Fire Brigade hauling the Circus cart that cradles the machine of Chekov. And lastly, we spot Chekov resting on the cart, surrounded by ribbons, a massive figure in this puddle of joy and apathy. Artists from some other planet are avoiding the parade. We focus on many, let us say the least ordinary Icelandic magician of the era, Barbara T. As the party pauses on its path, we skip shots of the dancing bakers, of the hands of elves, and dwarves, farm animals from the west, fishermen from the east, brown-eyed aliens, pale-skinned robots. We glimpse the swarm, skipping the cart float of Chekov as it quickly leaps its path along the Queen's street. Wellington, short, plain, undecorated, sits at the tail of beggars from a few planets, and beside them a thin line of robots. The telescope loses sight of those who sleep on the cart with Chekov's machine: the slender, gentle, but now resolved Cooper, Chekov's sibling, Dimitri, the meek, almost tender eyes of Captain Kirk, now elated at the audience itself, and lastly Captain Picard — a face with the bravery of a coward, the apathy of a rebel, and now emboldened like the heart of a vengeful sister. The librarian has laughed down the avenue, where from her corner of vision we can barely spy the Martian singing with the gardener. She looks down slowly then turns forward cautiously to her task. Chekov smirks at the window to see what has amused her so. The Martian and the gardener slam shut the window and tiptoe out. Chekov is curious that she is being ignored in such a fashion."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Gandhi's body, adorned with flowers, is drawn on an Army weapon-carrier by military personnel, surrounded by a sea of mourners. Commentators like the renowned Edward R. provide coverage of the ceremony.
