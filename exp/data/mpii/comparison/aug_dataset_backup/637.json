This barn has been transformed for a new and different purpose. Both Merrill and Graham unbuckle their seat belts and turn their attention towards the persistent and unmistakable buzzing noise emanating from the back of their vehicle. Sitting comfortably in the back seat, Morgan picks up a pale blue radio receiver that rests beside him on the well-worn seat. Right next to him, Bo is securely fastened in a child's car seat, her curious eyes intently fixed on Morgan as he raises the receiver to his ear and makes a gesture towards the wide, open sky above. With a resigned sigh, Merrill turns his gaze away. Graham, observing his brother with thoughtful consideration, shifts his focus back to Morgan, extending his hand to take the receiver. Morgan willingly hands it over, and Graham and Merrill exchange a meaningful glance as they listen intently and carefully. Merrill leans back, visibly exasperated by the situation, while Graham exits the vehicle, followed closely by the rest of the family. Bo is momentarily frozen in shock, which prompts Merrill to glance down at Morgan, contemplating the situation with concern. Graham leans back into the car, causing Merrill to appear uneasy and apprehensive. Graham slowly stands upright as Merrill extends his hand. Together, they hold the receiver across the roof of the car firmly. Morgan climbs onto the roof, crawling his way towards Graham and Merrill, and takes hold of the receiver.

Inside the vehicle, both Merrill and Graham methodically undo their seat belts, their attention drawn to a persistent buzzing noise emanating from the back seat. Morgan, seated beside Bo, reaches over to pick up a pale blue radio receiver resting next to him, while Bo, secured in a child's car seat, watches intently. Morgan raises the receiver to his ear, his finger pointing skyward, prompting a sigh from Merrill, who then turns away. Graham, observing his brother's reaction, takes a moment to ponder before shifting his focus back to Morgan, extending his hand to retrieve the receiver. Morgan obliges, handing it over, and Graham and Merrill exchange a meaningful glance as they both listen intently. Merrill, feeling a mix of frustration and resignation, leans back in his seat as Graham exits the vehicle, followed closely by the rest of the family. Bo, caught off guard, freezes momentarily in shock, while Merrill casts a contemplative look down at Morgan. Graham bends back into the car, his movements deliberate, as Merrill's unease becomes palpable. Graham slowly rises to his full height, and Merrill extends his hand, resulting in the two brothers jointly holding the receiver across the car's roof. Morgan, with a sense of purpose, climbs onto the roof, crawling towards Graham and Merrill to reclaim the receiver. Meanwhile, Bo, filled with determination, runs around to the car's bonnet and attempts to climb up, but Graham, anticipating her move, sits firmly on the bonnet to prevent her progress. Merrill joins Morgan on the roof, providing a steadying hand as Morgan directs the receiver skyward. Bo, undeterred, struggles to ascend the roof, prompting Merrill to reach out and grasp her hand. As Morgan gradually lowers the receiver, his gaze fixed on it, Bo slides back down into Graham's waiting lap. Transitioning to another task, Graham, now carrying a metal dish of dog food for Isabel, steps out of the farmhouse through a screen door into the enveloping darkness. He walks with measured steps across the lawn towards Isabel, the Alsatian, who is chained to her kennel. Isabel, visibly agitated, shifts restlessly, pulling at her chain and barking into the quivering field of maize. Graham halts just short of the dog, his eyes scanning the darkened field as he slowly pivots to face the crop. Isabel lunges unexpectedly at Graham, causing him to recoil in surprise before he refocuses on the gently rustling field. Despite Isabel's continued agitation, Graham turns his attention to a battered metal toolbox resting on a nearby picnic bench. He opens it and carefully lifts out a large torch. With cautious steps, he inches forward, extending his free hand while directing the torch's circular beam onto the edge of the crop. Graham advances slowly towards the wall of maize, stepping inside the tall, dense corn with an even, deliberate pace. He navigates a narrow channel between two rows of rigid stalks, the white torchlight angled low to illuminate the limp, straggly green leaves that bend back as he pushes through them."

Merrill and Graham undo their seat belts, relics of automotive safety innovation from decades past, and turn towards the buzzing noise emerging from the back. Morgan picks up a pale blue radio receiver, a device commonly used to pick up audio signals over the airwaves, from beside him on the seat, while Bo sits next to him in a child's car seat designed to ensure safety during travel. She watches Morgan as he puts the receiver to his ear, a gesture reminiscent of those trying to catch elusive signals, and points to the sky, indicating where the signals might originate. Merrill sighs, a deep breath suggesting a mix of concern and frustration, and turns away. Graham watches his brother, ponders with an expression hinting at a deeper worry, and then turns back to Morgan, reaching back for the receiver. Morgan gives it to him, and Graham and Merrill, a pair bonded by familial ties and shared history, stare at each other and listen. Merrill sits back exasperated as Graham gets out, followed by the rest of the family. Bo freezes in shock, her eyes wide with surprise, and Merrill looks down at Morgan and considers the weight of the moment. Graham leans back down into the car as Merrill, uneasy about the unknown, looks away. Graham slowly stands while Merrill reaches out his hand in a gesture that signals both support and solidarity. Together, Merrill and Graham hold the receiver across the car roof, signaling a unified front. Morgan climbs onto the roof, demonstrating youthful agility, crawls towards Graham and Merrill, and takes the receiver. Bo runs around to the bonnet and clambers up, her small feet slipping on the metal surface, but Graham sits on the bonnet to prevent her from getting any further. Merrill gets onto the roof with Morgan and holds him steady as Morgan points the receiver up to the sky, an act revealing his determination to uncover the source of the signals. Bo struggles to get onto the roof, and Merrill takes hold of her hand, ensuring her safety as Morgan slowly lowers the receiver and looks at it with a mix of curiosity and determination. Bo slides back down into Graham's lap, comforted by his presence. Carrying a metal dish of dog food, usually filled with kibble, for Isabel in one hand, Graham steps out of the farmhouse through a screen door that creaks slightly on its hinges, into the dark, walking steadily across the lawn to where the Alsatian, a breed known for its loyalty and protective instincts, is chained to its kennel. Agitated, Isabel shifts and jumps about, pulling at the chain and barking into the quivering field of maize, a crop reaching maturity with tall, verdant stalks. Graham stops just short of the dog and looks out into the darkened field, slowly turning his body to face the crop, which sways gently in the evening breeze. Isabel lunges at Graham, who recoils, then stares in surprise at the dog before turning back to the gently rustling field, a vast expanse hinting at mystery and potential danger. Isabel remains agitated, her barking echoing in the night. Graham opens a battered metal toolbox resting on a picnic bench, once used for leisurely outdoor meals, and lifts out a large torch, an essential tool in rural areas for nighttime exploration. Inching cautiously forward and holding out his free hand, he directs the circular torch beam onto the edge of the crop, illuminating the intricate details of nature. Graham walks slowly up to the wall of maize and steps inside the tall dense corn, venturing on at an even pace and moving down a narrow channel between two rows of rigid stalks, the air filled with the earthy scent of the fields. The white torchlight angled low illuminates the limp straggly green leaves, which bend back as he pushes through them, creating a path into the unknown."

Marcus groans and gazes around. Juliana observes her sister, contemplates, and then looks back at Ellie, reaching out for the compass. Ellie hands it to her, and Juliana and Marcus glance at each other and feel. Marcus relaxes startled as Juliana bounds out, accompanied by the rest of the group. Finn halts in disbelief, and Marcus glances down at Ellie and reflects. Juliana leans back down into the sand as Marcus appears uncomfortable.

Juliana halts just beyond the dog and gazes out into the dimmed grove, swiftly twisting her body to face the canopy. Max lunges at Juliana, who retreats, then gapes in amazement at the dog before looking back to the softly swaying grove. Max remains nervous. Juliana opens a glossy wooden crate resting on a folding chair and retrieves a small lantern. Shuffling briskly onward and holding out her free arm, she aims the rectangular lantern beam on the base of the canopy. Juliana marches briskly up to the grove of palms and steps inside the thin thicket of trees, advancing on at a rushed pace and sliding down a broad path between two rows of firm trunks. The golden lantern light aimed high lights up the drooping brittle fronds, which sway back as she glides through them."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
