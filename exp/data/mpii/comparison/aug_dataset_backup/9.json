          "description": "An exquisite arrangement of freshly cut, vibrant roses is displayed elegantly in a clear vase, set against the backdrop of a pristine white tile wall. Suddenly and without warning, the once-spotless tile is splattered with a spray of blood, its dark, deep crimson shade eerily mirroring that of the roses. At that moment, Ricky descends the staircase, with Jane following closely behind him. Ricky proceeds to open the door leading from the dining room but abruptly comes to a halt as Jane emerges behind him. On the kitchen table, a pool of blood begins to form ominously. Ricky cautiously steps into the kitchen and slowly makes his way toward Lester's lifeless body, his eyes wide with shock, yet he remains unexpectedly unafraid. He kneels down, gazing intently at Lester's unseen face, and Lester returns the gaze; his eyes are devoid of life, yet they bear a faint, almost imperceptible smile. In a moment of subtle change, his smile grows ever so slightly. We find ourselves soaring above a vast expanse of a white, cloud-strewn sky, and an eleven-year-old Lester excitedly looks up, pointing with delight as a solitary dot of light traverses an unimaginably star-filled sky. Meanwhile, Ricky and Jane lie curled up together on Jane's bed, fully clothed and facing each other, expressions of alarm etched on their faces. Outside, in the crisp autumn air, maple trees shed their leaves, sending them down in a ghostly, fluttering descent toward the pavement below. Angela stands in front of a mirror, meticulously adjusting her makeup, but a sudden turn reveals her frightened expression. We zoom in closely on the hands of an ancient woman, whose papery skin is visible as she buttons up a cardigan sweater with deliberate care. Carolyn, now drenched to the core, walks slowly toward the striking red door, clutching her purse with a tight grip, as a classic 1970 Pontiac Firebird rests in the driveway of a suburban home, the sun casting its reflective glow on the windshield. The Colonel makes his entrance, soaked with wetness and wearing latex gloves, the front of his T-shirt smeared with blood. He paces back and forth in front of a gun case, its glass door swung open, conspicuously missing a gun from inside. Jane, standing resolutely, opens her bedroom door and stares directly at us, while another door opens to reveal a four-year-old Jane, delightfully dressed as a princess, holding a lit sparkler and smiling with shy innocence. Carolyn enters the scene, terror gripping her as she holds her purse tightly, locking the door swiftly behind her, then retrieves a Glock 19. She opens the closet door, shoves the gun hastily into a hamper, and enveloped by Lester's distinct scent, gathers up as many of his clothing items as she can, pressing them to her face. Overcome with emotion, she collapses to her knees, pulling several items of clothing down with her, and begins to weep uncontrollably. In a nostalgic black-and-white scene, a younger Carolyn sits across from us on a whirling teacup ride, laughing with uninhibited joy as she spins the wheel, causing us to whirl around even faster. The scene shifts as we watch the video Ricky had shown Jane earlier: an empty white plastic bag being whimsically tossed about by the wind, carried in graceful circles around us, at times whipped with force, only to be sent soaring skyward, and then gently floating back down to the ground, carried by the invisible hands of the wind."

Suddenly, and without any warning, the once-spotless, clean tile is splattered with a sudden spray of blood, its dark, deep crimson shade eerily mirroring and resembling that of the beautiful roses. At precisely that moment, Ricky begins his descent from the staircase, with Jane following closely behind him. Ricky proceeds to open the door leading from the dining room but abruptly comes to a halt as Jane emerges and stands directly behind him.

          "description": "An arrangement of vibrant, fresh-cut roses is carefully placed in a vase, standing out starkly against the pristine white tile wall, their deep crimson hues rich and captivating. Suddenly, in a shocking contrast, the white tiles are immediately sprayed with bright, red blood that eerily matches the intense color of the roses, creating a horrifying visual. In another moment, Ricky descends the staircase methodically, each step echoing slightly until his entire figure is revealed, and just behind him, Jane follows closely, her presence quiet but noticeable. As Ricky approaches the door leading from the dining room, he grips the handle and pulls it open with a deliberate motion but hesitates in the doorway as Jane comes into view behind him, both pausing momentarily as if caught in the weight of the scene. Upon entering the kitchen, they are confronted with the grim sight of a pool of blood spreading ominously across the table's surface. Ricky, summoning a sense of determination and curiosity, steps into the kitchen with careful, slow strides until he is positioned near Lester's lifeless form, his eyes wide with a blend of shock and steely calmness, yet not a trace of fear in his demeanor. He lowers himself to one knee, leaning in to fix his gaze on Lester's unseen face, peering into eyes devoid of life, yet finding a subtle, haunting smile etched upon Lester's lips. This slight smile seems to mirror Ricky’s, as he responds with a barely perceptible one of his own, as if sharing a silent understanding or final farewell. Abruptly, we are transported to an ethereal realm above a vast expanse of white, fluffy clouds, where a young eleven-year-old Lester gazes skyward, his eyes filled with wonder and excitement as he points eagerly to a tiny speck of light trailing across an intensely starry night sky, a moment filled with awe and innocence. Meanwhile, Ricky and Jane, now lying fully clothed on her bed, remain curled together, their eyes locked onto each other’s, expressions filled with a mix of surprise and concern. Outside, the autumn air stirs the branches of towering maple trees, their vibrant leaves slowly detaching and drifting ghost-like toward the pavement, a serene yet melancholic scene. Inside, Angela stands before her mirror, meticulously adjusting her make-up with a precise hand until a sudden jolt of fear makes her turn abruptly, startled and on edge. In another frame, the camera zooms in on the frail, delicate hands of an ancient woman as her fingers deftly work to button up her cardigan sweater, each movement deliberate and gentle. Meanwhile, drenched from head to toe by pouring rain and clutching her purse with a determined grip, Carolyn makes her way slowly toward a bold red door, her every step purposeful despite the soaking rain. In the driveway of a typical suburban home, a 1970 Pontiac Firebird sits parked, the gleaming sun reflecting sharply off its windshield, casting vivid, bright highlights. Within the house, the Colonel, also wet and wearing latex gloves, moves with restless energy, pacing in front of a gun case that sits ominously open, its glass door ajar, and a noticeable absence where a gun once lay, adding a layer of tension to his presence. Meanwhile, Jane opens her bedroom door, her gaze intent and directed outward as if confronting us directly, a silent challenge in her eyes. As this unfolds, another door opens to reveal a four-year-old Jane, endearingly dressed in a whimsical Princess costume, a lit sparkler in her hand casting a warm, flickering glow as she beams with a shy, innocent smile. The scene shifts back to Carolyn, who, still gripped by terror and clinging to her purse, enters a room, hastily shuts the door behind her, turns the lock securely into place, and retrieves a Glock 19 with a steady hand. She quickly opens the closet, thrusts the gun into a hamper with a decisive motion, and, overwhelmed by a rush of emotion as she senses Lester’s lingering presence through his scent, grabs a handful of his clothes, pressing them desperately to her face in a poignant embrace. Overcome by grief, she sinks to her knees, clothes cascading around her as she begins to sob, the weight of loss breaking through her composed exterior. In a stark black-and-white memory, a much younger Carolyn is seen seated across from us on a spinning teacup ride, her laughter uncontrollable and infectious as she spins the wheel with gusto, causing us to whirl around faster in a dizzying, joyful blur. Our attention then shifts to the simple yet mesmerizing video Ricky shared with Jane earlier, where an empty white plastic bag dances in the open air, the breeze catching it and sending it into a graceful, looping journey around us. At times, the bag is whipped about violently by sudden gusts, then lofted high into the sky, only to descend once more in an elegant, floating descent to the earth, its movements poetic and strangely beautiful."

Instantly, the tile is sprayed with blood, a shocking contrast that matches the deep crimson of the roses, reminiscent of scenes from dramatic crime movies. Ricky comes down the stairs, his footsteps echoing in the quiet house, followed by Jane, whose worried expression hints at underlying tension. Ricky opens the door from the dining room, a room filled with cherished memories and family gatherings, then stops as Jane appears behind him. A pool of blood is forming on the kitchen table, a sight that evokes a chilling sense of loss and violence. Ricky enters the kitchen and slowly approaches Lester's lifeless body, wide-eyed but not afraid, as if confronting a long-feared inevitability. He kneels, gazing at Lester's unseen face, and Lester looks back; his eyes are lifeless, but he's smiling a slight smile, suggesting a final, mysterious resolution. Then he smiles, ever so slightly. We're flying across a white blanket of clouds, a scene evoking dreams or distant memories, and eleven-year-old Lester looks up, pointing excitedly as a dot of light, likely a meteor or falling star, falls across an unbelievably starry sky. Ricky and Jane lie curled up on Jane's bed, fully clothed, looking at each other, alarmed, as if they've just been jolted by a shared realization or discovery. Maple trees in autumn, with their vibrant leaves signaling the change of seasons, send ghostly leaves fluttering slowly toward pavement, creating an atmosphere of quiet reflection. Angela stands in front of the mirror fixing her make-up, preparing perhaps for an important event or encounter, but then turns, frightened by an unexpected sound or thought. Close-up on an ancient woman's papery hands, marked by time and experience, as they button a cardigan sweater, a routine task filled with nostalgia. Carolyn walks slowly toward the red door, which symbolizes both danger and passion, drenched to the bone, clutching her purse tightly, while a 1970 Pontiac Firebird, an iconic muscle car representing freedom and rebellion, is in the driveway of a suburban home and the sun's reflection is in the windshield, creating a blinding glare. The Colonel enters, wet and wearing latex gloves, with blood covering the front of his T-shirt, a grim hint at violent actions taken. He paces in front of a gun case with the glass door open, and a gun is conspicuously missing from inside, suggesting a mystery or impending danger. Jane opens her bedroom door, staring at us, as if challenging or questioning our presence, while a door opens to reveal four-year-old Jane dressed in a Princess costume, holding a lit sparkler that casts a warm glow and smiling shyly, capturing the innocence of childhood. Carolyn enters, terrified and still clutching her purse, shuts the door, locks it, then takes out a Glock 19, a popular model known for its reliability and used by both law enforcement and civilians for protection. She opens the closet door, shoves the gun into a hamper, and, aware of Lester's scent that lingers in his clothes, grabs as many of his clothes as she can, burying her face in them, overwhelmed by grief. She sinks to her knees, pulling several clothing items down with her, and begins to cry, her sobs echoing in the empty space. In black and white, a younger Carolyn sits across from us on a spinning teacup ride at a renowned amusement park, laughing uncontrollably as she twists the wheel, making us spin faster, a moment of carefree joy frozen in time. We're watching the video Ricky showed Jane earlier of an empty white plastic bag being blown about, reminiscent of the delicate dance of life and the random beauty found in everyday moments, the wind carrying it in a circle around us, sometimes whipping it violently, or sending it soaring skyward, then letting it float gracefully to the ground."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
