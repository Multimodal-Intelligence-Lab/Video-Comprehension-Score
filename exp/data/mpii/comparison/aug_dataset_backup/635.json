A shrug is given by Graham, an uncertain look is given at Merrill, his cheeks are blown out by him, and the ceiling is looked at by Merrill, then Merrill holds up his hands and away in frustration, he turns.

This unsettling sound gradually fades, leaving behind an eerie silence. \n\nThe following morning, in the serene and quiet dining room, Caroline finds herself seated with Morgan. Morgan, who is grasping her beloved walkie-talkie tightly, gives a slight, almost imperceptible nod. Caroline acknowledges this gesture with a warm and welcoming smile, nodding back, and then she beams pleasantly in response. Meanwhile, from the adjacent lounge area, Bo is comfortably seated, fully engrossed in watching a colorful display of cartoons. As Graham approaches, Bo, like the others, turns his attention toward Graham. On the television set, three glasses of water stand prominently, catching the light. Caroline casts a glance across the room, her eyes settling on Merrill, who is positioned at the opposite end of the expansive and polished dining room table. His head rests lazily on one hand as he peers up at her; with a cheeky grin playing on his lips, Merrill rubs his finger absentmindedly along the smooth, cool tabletop, prompting Caroline to offer a nonchalant shrug in response. Caroline then turns her gaze back to Morgan, who remains intently absorbed in studying her walkie-talkie, before shifting her attention once more towards Merrill. \n\nMeanwhile, Graham makes his way steadily across the lounge, his eyes spotting the trio of water glasses that rests on a small table.

As he approaches, both Merrill and Graham instinctively turn their heads to look behind them, their attention caught by something that barely grazes the swing, creating a fleeting moment of curiosity. Their eyes follow the unseen presence as it quickly moves past, and their ears catch the sound of urgent rustling among the maize stalks just beyond the swing, a noise that crescendoes briefly before gradually dying away, leaving them in suspense. The following morning, the scene shifts to the dining room, where Caroline is seated comfortably with Morgan, who holds onto her walkie-talkie. Morgan gives an understanding nod, a gesture filled with silent communication, to which Caroline responds with a warm smile and a nod of her own, her lips naturally spreading into a grin that conveys mutual understanding. In the adjoining lounge, Bo is engrossed in cartoons, his eyes glued to the screen, as Graham makes his way over to him, prompting Bo to follow his movement. On the TV set, three glasses of water sit conspicuously, a detail that doesn't escape Caroline's notice. She shifts her gaze to Merrill, who is at the opposite end of the long dining room table. Merrill rests his head on his hand, his eyes meeting Caroline's as he offers a playful grin, his fingers idly rubbing the tabletop in an absent-minded manner, while Caroline simply shrugs in response. Her attention shifts back to Morgan, who is absorbed in examining her walkie-talkie, before returning to Merrill. Graham traverses the lounge, his eyes catching the sight of three glasses of water placed on a small table. He leans over, picks them up, and straightens, only to notice additional glasses on a nearby cabinet. He pauses, then decides to put the three glasses back where he found them before continuing into the dining room, where he takes a seat at the table next to Merrill. Caroline, with her notebook in hand, regards them with a slightly patronizing look, causing Graham to appear tense and awkward. She acknowledges Graham with a nod. Graham gives a noncommittal shrug, casting a tentative glance in Merrill's direction before expelling a frustrated breath. Merrill's eyes wander to the ceiling, and he lifts his hands in a gesture of exasperation before turning away. Bo enters the dining room, lightly taps Graham on the arm to catch his attention, and then departs, which prompts Merrill to shift uncomfortably in his seat. Graham takes a moment to think, his thoughts interrupted when Bo returns, drawing Caroline's gaze upwards. Meanwhile, in the lounge, the TV broadcasts footage of a cornfield marked by crop circles similar to those on Graham's land, capturing his steely blue eyes with its imagery. A voice from the TV reports on 17 circles scattered across a map of India, with scenes of people standing amidst the circles playing out onscreen. Graham stands transfixed by the television, his attention momentarily broken as Morgan uses his inhaler and Caroline stands supportively behind him. The pair leaves the house, their pace leisurely as they move away from the farmhouse, Caroline shaking her head in disbelief. Upon reaching her police car, she gives a confirming nod, opens the driver's door with a smile, and climbs inside. Graham remains standing, watching her as she navigates around an island of grass situated in the middle of a stretch of gravel driveway, before driving away down the path. In the back of a car, Morgan and Bo are seated, with Bo pointing a finger towards Morgan, who nonchalantly brushes it away. Graham, sitting in the driver's seat, turns the radio off once more, casting a sideways glance over his shoulder at Morgan before returning his focus to the road, while Morgan releases a weary sigh. From above, an aerial perspective offers a view directly down onto a tranquil freeway that courses through a suburban area, highlighting the contrast between their situation and the seemingly undisturbed world outside."

The next morning, Caroline, the newly appointed deputy sheriff of the town, sits in the dining room with Morgan, who's holding her walkie talkie; the device, a gift from her father, allows her to stay connected with her friends around the neighborhood. Morgan nods, Caroline smiles warmly and nods back, sharing a silent bond born from years of friendship, and she grins. Bo sits in the adjoining lounge, watching cartoons that revive the whimsical characters of 1980s Saturday morning TV, as Graham walks over, and Bo does so. There are three glasses of water on the TV set, a habit Bo developed after learning from his mother about hydration's health benefits. Caroline looks across at Merrill, who sits at the other end of the long dining room table, the table crafted by a local artisan famed for his craftsmanship, resting his head on his hand and looking up at her; Merrill grins at Caroline and absently rubs his finger on the table top while she shrugs. Caroline glances at Morgan, who's studying her walkie talkie, and looks back at Merrill. Graham walks across the lounge and spots three glasses of water on a small table, leans over, and picks them up. He stands upright and sees some more glasses of water on a nearby cabinet, then puts the three glasses back down and walks into the dining room, where he sits at the table by Merrill, the former high school baseball star now content with his quiet life. She checks her notebook and gives them a patronizing look, one she'd perfected during her years at the academy, and Graham looks tense and awkward; she nods. Graham shrugs, looks uncertainly at Merrill, blows out his cheeks from a habit he developed under stress, and Merrill looks at the ceiling, then holds up his hands and turns away in frustration. Bo comes into the dining room, taps Graham on the arm as a reminder of a family signal, and leaves, causing Merrill to shift awkwardly. Graham considers for a moment before Bo comes back, and Caroline looks up. In the lounge, the TV shows news footage of a cornfield, an area near Graham's home, with a line of crop circles similar to Graham's, a phenomenon often attributed to extraterrestrial activity. A man talks to the camera, explaining the recent global sightings, 17 circles are scattered across a map of India, and footage shows people standing in some of the circles, a viral sensation online. Graham's steely blue eyes gleam with curiosity as he stares at the TV while Morgan takes a puff of his inhaler, a necessity due to his asthma, and Caroline stands behind him. Graham and Caroline come out of the house, and as they stroll away from the old farmhouse that has been in Graham's family for generations, she shakes her head. Caroline nods, opens the driver's door of her police car, a reliable vehicle despite its many miles, smiles, gets in, and Graham stands and watches as Caroline pulls around an island of grass, purposely planted to enhance the rural charm, in the middle of a stretch of gravel and heads off down the driveway. Morgan and Bo sit in the back of a car, Bo points a finger at Morgan, and he brushes it away, a playful sibling interaction. Graham turns the radio off again, and in the driving seat, glances over his shoulder at Morgan, then turns back to the road as Morgan sighs wearily, reflecting a long day.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

She gives them a patronizing look; Graham appears tense and uncertain. Bo taps Graham's arm, leaves, and returns as Caroline looks up. The TV shows news of crop circles like Graham's, with footage from India. Graham's eyes gleam as he watches, while Morgan uses his inhaler. Graham and Caroline exit the house, and she nods and smiles before driving away in her police car. Morgan and Bo sit in a car's back seat, with Morgan brushing away Bo's pointing finger. Graham turns off the radio, checks on Morgan, and continues driving through a quiet suburban freeway."
