Evan glances up to notice one of the individuals leaning over the second level, Karl, a gigantic brawny convict with tattoos of swastikas and other Nazi emblems on his arm, blows a kiss at Evan and winks. Evan enters a dimly illuminated cell festooned with images of Jesus Christ and various Saints. Sitting on the lower bunk is Carlos, an enormous Hispanic felon covered with faded Indian ink prison inkings of Christ in agony. Carlos gazes at Evan apathetically as Evan prepares his bed on the top bunk. Carlos departs the cell without a further word. Evan places his tray down at a table occupied with Carlos and some other detainees. Carlos shrugs at Evan and presents him a roll. Her hair is now bottle-blonde. Four inches of Plexiglas divide the two and they converse on monitored phones. Andrea nods, holding up two composition books. They gaze at each other and Evan gradually lowers the phone. He disconnects, Andrea still pressing her phone to her ear. Evan walks closely behind Carlos through a passageway, clutching his notebooks. As he passes Karl, the Neo-Nazi, Karl reaches over and securely seizes Evan's crotch. Evan stands there, astonished, unable to react when another Neo-Nazi, Rick, bats Evan's notebooks out of his hands and onto the floor. Vitality returns to Evan as he dashes for the notebooks. He and Rick grip the notebooks at the same time, initiating a minor tug of war. Rick rips them away, Evan coming up with only a few torn pages. Evan observes the damage and goes crazy. Evan holds a tattered journal entry in his hand and completes a conversation and then scrutinizes the page. We are back in Mrs. Boswell's first grade class where all of the children sketch colorful illustrations. As he approaches them, Mrs. Boswell firmly seizes his shoulders and guides him back to his own desk. Evan, defeated, glances over at his blank piece of paper. He grins mischievously and grabs some colored pencils. Soon enough, an image materializes: Evan wielding a dagger stands over a pile of several deceased inmates, Karl and Rick. When finished, he sneaks over to Mrs. Boswell's desk, where the two paper spindles rest. The metal spikes reach up and pierce a number of paper notes and messages. She glances over in time to see Evan using all of his seven-year-old might to fling his hands down toward the spindles.

Evan enters a dimly lit cell plastered with pictures of Jesus Christ and various Saints, relics of his cellmate's devout Catholic upbringing. Sitting on the bottom bunk is Carlos, a massive Hispanic convict who earned respect for his role in mediating gang disputes, covered with faded Indian ink jail tats of Christ in agony.

Matteo glances at Oliver excitedly as Oliver tidies up his space on the bottom bunk. Matteo enters the cabin with a loud cheer. Oliver sets his tray down at a table surrounded by Matteo and some other tourists. Matteo laughs at Oliver and hands him some bread. His shoes are now bright red.

Oliver ducks into a brightly lit tent adorned with illustrations of Hercules and numerous Myths.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
