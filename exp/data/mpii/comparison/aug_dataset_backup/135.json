He eventually returns to his designated spot on the platform with a sense of accomplishment, where Nehru warmly clasps his hand in a gesture of congratulations, while others eagerly gather around him, expressing their admiration. On the periphery of the scene, Gandhi is visible, notably the sole individual in an Indian tunic, seated discreetly at the end of the second row on the platform, quietly observing the wave of enthusiasm directed toward Jinnah. Patel approaches the microphone with authority, commanding attention by raising his hands, which prompts the audience to cheer and applaud his brief concluding remarks. He repeats the gesture of raising his hands to quieten the audience once more, as Gandhi has begun to make his way toward the podium. Gandhi is met with polite but subdued applause, as the convention behaves as if in a routine now that the captivating effect of Jinnah's significant speech has worn off. As Gandhi reaches the podium, Patel gestures for him to proceed, and Gandhi responds with a nod of acknowledgment to the lingering applause. Patel then turns to rejoin the others, his thoughts already preoccupied with them, but he partially catches Gandhi's comment and turns back with a smile, showcasing his adaptability as a politician. Gandhi smiles back, retrieving his glasses from his sleeve—marking the first occasion we observe them—and places a single slip of paper containing his notes on the podium. He dons his glasses and turns to address the convention, while on the platform, subdued political discussions ensue and on the convention floor, some attendees listen closely as others engage in separate conversations. Nehru, having picked up on Gandhi's concluding remark, turns his attention, prompting others in the hall to begin focusing their attention as well. Jinnah listens with a detached and challenging demeanor, then removes his glasses, meticulously folding them before silently making his way back to his seat on the platform, as a cameraman captures the moment with a flash, sparking sporadic applause throughout the room. On the platform, leaders participate in the applause unenthusiastically, as we notice one particular peasant face, Shukla, whom we will become acquainted with, observing from among the crowd of outsiders positioned in the doorways. Nehru, observing Gandhi with a mixture of interest and unexpected surprise, turns toward Patel to share his thoughts. Meanwhile, an open touring car navigates a rough and uneven trail, with Nehru at the wheel, accompanied by four companions as youthful as himself, all dressed in similar costly, British-style attire. Nehru looks slightly overwhelmed by the playful teasing and the jarring ride. The ashram they approach appears half-finished, with raw, unworked land and partially constructed buildings, resembling an early frontier outpost. Their journey is eventually halted by a goat tied across the path, standing as an unexpected blockade."

Eventually, it hops back to its perch on the stage, where the elephant pats its trunk in recognition, and others gather around it. Briefly, on the edge of the scene, we spot the fox, the only one in a woolen coat, perched at the end of the second row on the stage, merely observing the wave of admiration for the rabbit. The horse trots to the microphone, calming the crowd with raised hooves, and the spectators whistle and stomp for its brief jingle. It lifts its hooves once more, calming them, as the fox has already begun to stroll toward the podium. The fox is met with light stomping because the gathering is acting like one now that the charm of the rabbit's grand oration has faded. As the fox reaches the podium, the horse beckons it to it, and the fox winks at it, acknowledging the trace of applause. The horse meanders back toward the others, its mind already on them, but it partly hears the fox's quip and pivots with a grin, showcasing a diplomat's adaptability. The fox chuckles and extracts spectacles from its tail—this is the first time we have observed them. It clutches one slip of paper with scribbles which it places on the podium. It dons its spectacles and faces the gathering, while on the stage, hushed strategies persist, and on the convention floor, some pay heed as others chat about varied topics. The elephant, having noticed the fox's final comment, rotates, and now attention starts to concentrate on the floor of the arena too. The rabbit listens distantly and defiantly, then removes its spectacles, tucks them away, and in quiet, hops back toward its perch on the stage as a photographer captures a snapshot, inciting lukewarm applause scattered here and there. On the stage, dignitaries join in automatically as we see one canine face, Bruno, who we will soon recognize, observing from the cluster of outsiders in the entrances. The elephant, who has been noting the fox with intrigue and some amazement, turns to the horse. An ancient jalopy rattles along a rocky path with the elephant steering, accompanied by four pals as sprightly as it, all dressed in the same posh, colonial style. The elephant appears slightly flustered from the jostling and the bumpy ride. The lodge is partly constructed, with untamed terrain and partially erected structures, resembling a crude frontier outpost. They are eventually halted by a chicken roosting directly across the path."

Fitzgerald approaches the lamp, quieting the room with uplifted mittens, and the assembly chants and stomps his tiny verse. He lifts his mittens again, calming them, as Dylan has already begun to drift toward the lectern. Dylan is acknowledged with muted stomping because the assembly is behaving as one now that the charm of Marley's grand monologue has faded.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
