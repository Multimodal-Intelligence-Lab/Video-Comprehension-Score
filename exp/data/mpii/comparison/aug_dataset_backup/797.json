In the quieter confines of a back room, Willie busily places a sizable sack down while Marcus gestures meaningfully toward an air conditioning vent nearby. Marcus then skillfully removes the vent cover, hoists himself into the narrow duct, and begins to navigate through it, clutching a small torch to illuminate his path. In a nearby office, a man seated at his desk looks up curiously at the ductwork as peculiar noises emanate from above, and a woman, also working diligently at her desk, does the same. Another woman, positioned at an adjacent desk, glances up, then casually turns around to examine the duct, shrugs in a nonchalant manner, and returns to her tasks.\n\nMarcus eventually arrives at another vent and peers through it to take in the view of a security office filled with monitors and various pieces of equipment. He carefully observes the setup and takes detailed notes on a small pad. Meanwhile, Gin, indulging in some self-care, is having a pedicure when his phone rings, and he answers it. Roger Merriman, the father of a young child, is currently in prison. Gin then enters the stark visitors' room at the penitentiary, where Roger, noticeably balding and wearing glasses, sits waiting. Gin nods his head in acknowledgment and rises from his seat, while Roger remains seated, looking somewhat confused by the interaction.\n\nIn another setting, Willie is preparing a meal for the kid and Grandma, diligently cooking, serving the food, and adding a generous spoonful of something onto the dish. He then turns back to the stove momentarily to flip a slice of bologna, which he proceeds to serve on a plate for himself, styled to resemble a North Pole delicacy, and places it on the breakfast bar. The young child sets off to collect it, handing the plate to Willie, who promptly returns it to the child, who struggles slightly with a door that seems stubbornly stuck due to an excessive amount of adhesive. Willie watches as the child discovers a cheap sweet inside.\n\nElsewhere, Bob joins Gin, who is in the process of mixing and rather reluctantly slurping down a dose of Fibracell stool softener, grimacing at the taste while Bob cringes in sympathy nearby. Outside, a bus pulls up in front of the bustling mall, and a group of skaterats spots the child as he disembarks at the bus stop. Observing them, the kid hesitates for a moment before deciding to walk determinedly down the street, with the skaterats following maliciously in his wake. They catch him, taunt him, and the boy eventually wanders off, with a Santa nearby scratching absent-mindedly. The kid appears with his trousers humorously pulled up to his armpits. Marcus departs the scene while Willie, observing the kid, stares in disbelief, shaking his head incredulously. The child simply gazes back at him before continuing on his way, his underpants still humorously positioned around his armpits.

A woman, also working diligently at her desk, does the same, her curiosity piqued by the strange sounds. Another woman, positioned at an adjacent desk, glances up at the source of the noise, then casually turns around to examine the duct. She shrugs in a nonchalant, dismissive manner and returns to her tasks, seemingly unbothered.\n\nMarcus eventually arrives at another vent and peers through it, taking in the view of a bustling security office filled with an array of monitors and various pieces of equipment.

Gin then enters the stark, unwelcoming visitors' room at the penitentiary, where Roger, noticeably balding and wearing glasses, sits waiting with an air of expectancy.

In a hidden back room, Willie carefully lowers a sack to the floor, while Marcus gestures purposefully toward an air conditioning vent. Marcus then methodically removes the cover from the vent, hoisting himself up with effort to enter the duct. As he clambers in, he clutches a torch tightly to illuminate his path, crawling cautiously along the confined space. In the nearby office, a man sits at his desk when sudden noises draw his attention upwards to the ceiling duct, causing a woman engrossed in her tasks at an adjacent desk to also look up, curious. Another woman at the next desk momentarily diverts her gaze to the duct, registers the noise with a nonchalant shrug, and returns to her work without further concern. Meanwhile, Marcus continues on his journey through the ducts until he reaches a strategic location where he peers through a vent, observing a security office brimming with monitors. He takes in the array of equipment intently, jotting down detailed notes on a pad for future reference. Simultaneously, Gin indulges in a leisurely pedicure session when his phone rings, prompting him to answer. In the grim confines of a prison, Roger Merriman, the kid's father, sits balding and bespectacled, waiting in the visitors' room as Gin enters. With a subtle nod of acknowledgment, Gin rises to leave while Roger's expression remains puzzled by the interaction. Back at home, Willie busies himself in the kitchen, cooking for the kid and Grandma. He meticulously serves up a portion, adding a dollop with care before returning to the stove to deftly flip the sizzling bologna. Once satisfied, he prepares a plate of North Pole-style fried bologna for himself and places it on the breakfast bar. The kid, eager, approaches to retrieve it but struggles with a sticky door, attempting to open it as if hindered by excessive adhesive. As Willie watches, the kid discovers a cheap sweet inside, much to Willie's mixed amusement and bemusement. Elsewhere, Bob accompanies Gin, who nonchalantly mixes a dose of Fibracell stool softener, gulping it down with a grimace while Bob winces in shared discomfort. Outside the bustling mall, a bus arrives at the stop, catching the attention of lurking skaterats as they spot the kid disembarking. Sensing potential trouble, the kid hesitates momentarily before resolutely continuing down the street, aware of the skaterats tracking him with malicious intent. They eventually catch up, surrounding him, and grot him. The boy manages to wander off afterward, as Santa stands nearby, scratching his own ass, seemingly oblivious while the kid reappears with his pants awkwardly hiked up to his armpits. With a resigned expression, Marcus prepares to depart as Willie, still staring incredulously at the kid's peculiar attire, shakes his head in disbelief. The kid merely stares back before nonchalantly walking away, leaving Willie to watch him go with a doleful look. Willie then turns back to Marcus, who regards him with the solemn, deadpan demeanor befitting an elf. In the bar, Gin stands next in line, joining Willie and Marcus, while Marcus shifts uneasily, the tension palpable among them."

In a back room, Willie puts a sack down while Marcus points to an air conditioning vent, a common target in heist scenarios because of its metal structure that can easily be manipulated. Marcus removes the cover from the vent, clambers into the duct, and crawls along it clutching a torch, a high-lumen flashlight favored by professionals for its brightness and reliability. In an office, a man looks up at the duct as noises emanate from it, the clattering echoing in the quiet space, and a woman working at her desk also looks up, along with a woman at the next desk who then turns around, looks at the duct, shrugs, and resumes her work, accustomed to strange noises in the old, temperamental building's ventilation system. Marcus arrives at a vent and observes a security office filled with monitors, displaying live feeds from various cameras around the mall, looks at the equipment, and makes notes on a pad, recording each camera's blind spots methodically. Meanwhile, Gin is having a pedicure at Luxe Nails, a popular nail salon for the affluent, and answers his phone. Roger Merriman, the kid's dad, is in prison for a series of bank robberies, and Gin walks into the prison visitors' room where Roger, who is balding and bespectacled, is sitting. Gin nods his head and gets up as Roger looks confused, the brief interaction raising more questions than it answers. Willie cooks for the kid and Grandma, serves it up, spoons a dollop onto it, turns back to the stove to flip the bologna, and serves a plate of North Pole-style fried bologna for himself, a dish inspired by the harsh winters of Alaska, placing it on the breakfast bar. The kid heads off to get it, hands it to Willie, who gives it back to the kid struggling to open the door, which appears to have been stuck with excessive adhesive, a makeshift security measure grandma uses to feel safe. Willie watches as the kid finds a cheap sweet inside, an unexpected treat that reveals a softer side to the gruff atmosphere. Bob is with Gin, who mixes and slurps a dose of Fibracell stool softener, grimacing as Bob winces, knowing the effects are both immediate and uncomfortable. A bus pulls up outside the mall, a public transport hub bustling with activity, and skaterats see the kid getting off at the stop. The kid sees them, hesitates, then walks down the street, lined with shops closing for the evening, with the skaterats following maliciously. They get him and grot him, a slang term for mugging originating in the local dialect. The boy wanders off as Santa, the mall's seasonal worker, scratches his own ass, oblivious to the chaos outside, and the kid appears with his pants around his armpits, a comical sight that elicits smirks from passersby. Marcus heads off while Willie looks at the kid, stares incredulously, shakes his head, and the kid just stares back, the bizarre scene frozen in time before walking away with his underpants still around his armpits. Willie watches him go with a doleful expression and turns back to Marcus, who stares at him with a very deadpan expression for an elf, his costume adding to the surreal atmosphere. Gin is next in line, and Gin, Willie, and Marcus are in a bar known for its cheap drinks and loud patrons, where Marcus shifts uneasily, aware of the unpredictable nature of the night ahead."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
