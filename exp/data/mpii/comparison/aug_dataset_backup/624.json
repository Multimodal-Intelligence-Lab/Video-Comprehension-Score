Suddenly, the same man leans up on his elbows in bed, his eyes darting feverishly around the simply furnished room. He relaxes and sits up. The man, Graham Hess, comes out of his bedroom wearing a black t-shirt and pajama bottoms. He walks along the landing in his bare feet and comes to a closed door with some hand-drawn children's pictures stuck to it. Graham pauses for a moment to listen at the door, then returns to his bedroom, picking up some discarded socks on the way. He's in his mid-40s with short dark hair and a rugged handsome face. Graham crosses the bathroom and stares out of the door, his toothbrush in his mouth. He strides across the landing, opens the door to the children's room, and glances around. A younger man in a similar rural-style bedroom suddenly jolts and tumbles out of bed. He jumps to his feet and strains to listen.

          "description": "In a serene rural backyard, a set of swings and a climbing frame are perfectly positioned alongside a picnic table and a brick barbecue, all of which are overlooked by an upstairs window. Inside this window, there is a bedroom where a framed photo sits on a bedside table, capturing a smiling family comprising a mum, dad, a young boy, and a girl, with the dad donning a clerical collar. Suddenly, in a moment of abrupt awareness, the same man from the photo leans up on his elbows in bed, his eyes scanning feverishly around the simply furnished room. As a wave of calmness washes over him, he relaxes and proceeds to sit up. This man, Graham Hess, clad in a black t-shirt and pajama bottoms, emerges from his bedroom and walks along the landing in his bare feet, coming to a halt at a closed door adorned with hand-drawn children's pictures. He pauses momentarily to listen intently at the door, decides not to enter, and then retraces his steps back to his bedroom, picking up some discarded socks along the way. Graham, a man in his mid-40s with short dark hair and a rugged handsome face, crosses into the bathroom and momentarily stares out the door, toothbrush in mouth, before taking purposeful strides across the landing to open the door to the children's room. He casts a quick glance around the room before a sudden noise draws attention to a younger man in a similar rural-style bedroom who jolts awake, tumbles out of bed, and jumps to his feet, straining to understand what he's hearing. Meanwhile, Graham hastens out of his wooden farmhouse and makes his way towards a whitewashed barn, as the younger man, Merrill, races down a flight of steps from another floor. Together, Graham and Merrill charge through a field of tall green maize, only stopping when they reach a gap that reveals a clear pathway slicing through the crop. Ahead stands a dark-haired girl, approximately six years old, further down the path. The two men sprint over to her, with Graham reaching her first and gently grasping her arms. Merrill quickly lifts Bo up, and Graham, determined, rushes on through the maize until he reaches a fair-haired boy, about 10 years old, who is staring intently across the field with glazed eyes. Graham gently turns Morgan's head to face him, but Morgan places his hand around his father's jaw, redirecting Graham's gaze to align with his own. As comprehension dawns, Graham stands and begins to walk slowly through the sea of maize, Merrill trailing behind, still carrying Bo in his arms. As Graham halts, he surveys the surroundings anxiously, swallowing hard before he tentatively steps forward onto a vast area of flattened maize stalks. In a moment of awe and wonder, Graham, Merrill, Morgan, and Bo arrive at the perimeter of a massive circular expanse where the maize has been entirely flattened, while two large Alsatians pace restlessly in the center. An aerial perspective reveals the scene with Graham and his family standing within the circle, approximately 100 yards in diameter, and another crop circle situated beside it, identical in size but distinguished by a small semi-circle of standing maize at its core."

          "description": "A set of swings and a climbing frame stand in a rural backyard, typical of homes nestled in the expansive countryside known for its serene landscapes, along with a picnic table and a brick barbecue, structures that often host family gatherings, overlooked by an upstairs window which offers a sweeping view of the surrounding fields. Inside, a framed photo on a bedside table shows a smiling family: mum, dad, a young boy, and a girl. The dad wears a clerical collar, indicating his role as a priest or pastor in a local church community. Suddenly, the same man leans up on his elbows in bed, his eyes darting feverishly around the simply furnished room, which is adorned with rustic wooden furniture common in rural homes. He relaxes and sits up. The man, Graham Hess, a former Episcopal priest who left the ministry after a personal tragedy, comes out of his bedroom wearing a black t-shirt and pajama bottoms. He walks along the landing in his bare feet, feeling the cool hardwood floors beneath him, and comes to a closed door with some hand-drawn children's pictures stuck to it, showcasing the creativity of his children. Graham pauses for a moment to listen at the door, then returns to his bedroom, picking up some discarded socks on the way. He's in his mid-40s with short dark hair and a rugged handsome face that hints at a life spent mostly outdoors. Graham crosses the bathroom and stares out of the door, his toothbrush in his mouth, the minty taste lingering as he surveys his home. He strides across the landing, opens the door to the children's room, and glances around, noting the peacefulness that contrasts with his earlier tension. A younger man in a similar rural-style bedroom, reflecting the simplicity and functionality needed in a working farmhouse, suddenly jolts and tumbles out of bed. He jumps to his feet and strains to listen. Graham rushes out of his wooden farmhouse, originally built in the early 20th century as part of a homesteading effort, and heads towards a whitewashed barn, once used for housing livestock but now renovated for storage, while the younger man runs down a flight of steps from the other floor. Graham and the young man, Merrill, his brother who moved in to help with the farm after a failed baseball career, charge through a field of tall green maize, grown in neat rows for harvest season. They stop when they reach a gap and look along a clear pathway, which cuts through the crop. A dark-haired girl of about six-years-old stands a little further down the path. The two men run over to her, and Graham grabs her by the arms. Merrill picks up Bo, the little girl known for her quirky habit of leaving half-full glasses of water around the house, and Graham dashes on through the maize. He reaches a fair-haired boy of about 10, who stares glassily across the field. Graham turns Morgan's head to face him, sensing something extraordinary in his son's expression. Morgan puts his hand around his father's jaw and turns his head to face in the direction he had been staring. Graham stands and slowly walks through the maize, shadowed by Merrill, who's still carrying Bo in his arms. Graham stops and glances around anxiously, noticing the rustling of maize leaves in the breeze. He swallows hard and tentatively steps forward onto a sea of flattened maize stalks. Graham stares in wonder as he, Merrill, Morgan, and Bo come to the perimeter of a vast circular expanse of flattened maize, recognizing it as a crop circle, a phenomenon often attributed to extraterrestrial activity or human pranksters. Two large Alsatians, known for their herding instincts, pace around uneasily in the center. An aerial view shows Graham and his family standing in the circle, which is about 100 yards in diameter, a staggering sight that seems to defy simple explanation. Another crop circle lies beside it, the same size but with a small semi-circle of maize still standing within it, creating an intricate pattern whose meaning is elusive."

Suddenly, the same man jerks up on his elbows in bed, his eyes flickering nervously around the simply furnished room. He calms and stretches up. The man, Graham Hess, exits his bedroom wearing a black t-shirt and pajama bottoms. He creeps along the landing in his bare feet and arrives at a closed door with some hand-drawn children's pictures attached to it. Graham hesitates for a moment to glance at the door, then marches to his bedroom, picking up some scattered socks on the way. He's in his mid-40s with short dark hair and a rugged handsome face.

Suddenly, the same scarecrow leans up on its elbows in a hammock, its eyes darting feverishly around the elaborately decorated tent. It relaxes and sits up. The scarecrow, Lionel Mitchell, comes out of its hammock wearing a crimson raincoat and denim shorts. It walks along the pier in its bare feet and comes to a locked trunk with some hand-painted jockey uniforms stuck to it. Lionel pauses for a moment to listen at the trunk, then returns to its hammock, picking up some discarded mittens on the way. It's in its mid-200s with flowing rainbow hair and a ruggedly charming face. Lionel crosses the library and stares out of the portcullis, its umbrella in its mouth. It strides across the pier, opens the trunk to the jockey's compartment, and glances around. A giant pumpkin in a similar desert-style courtyard suddenly jolts and rolls out of its hammock. It jumps to its fins and strains to listen. Lionel rushes out of its wooden igloo and heads towards a pink-streaked yurt, while the giant pumpkin rolls down a flight of escalators from the opposite balcony. Lionel and the pumpkin, Clover, charge through a field of tall blue radishes. They stop when they reach a chasm and look along a narrow boardwalk, which cuts through the foliage. A dark-haired fish of about six weeks old flutters a little further down the boardwalk. The two beings swim over to it, and Lionel grabs it by the fins. Clover picks up Tulip, and Lionel paddles on through the radishes. It reaches a fair-haired squirrel of about 10, who stares glassily across the orchard. Lionel turns Fern's head to face it. Fern puts its paw around its father's antenna and turns its head to face in the direction it had been staring. Lionel stands and slowly walks through the radishes, followed by Clover, who's still carrying Tulip in its fins. Lionel stops and glances around anxiously.

Outside, a poster on a mantelpiece depicts a frowning group: grandmother, teacher, an elderly gentleman, and a toddler. The teacher sports a pirate hat. Abruptly, the same gentleman springs up on his knees by a dresser, his ears twitching anxiously around the ornately decorated lounge. He tenses up and stands upright. The gentleman, Oliver Trent, emerges from his kitchen wearing a red sweater and denim shorts. He skips along the hallway in his booted feet and arrives at an open window with some cartoonish drawings pinned to it. Oliver hesitates for a moment to sniff at the air, then retreats to his kitchen, scooping up some stray gloves along the way. He's in his late 50s with long blonde hair and a gentle serene expression. Oliver enters the closet and glances out of the window, a comb in his hand. He prances across the hallway, shuts the window to the office, and peers around. An older woman in a similar urban-style parlor suddenly startles and rolls off the couch. She vaults to her feet and strains to see. Oliver dashes out of his stone bungalow and strides towards a blue-painted garage, while the older woman strolls up a series of steps from the other entrance. Oliver and the older woman, Eliza, meander through a meadow of tall golden wheat. They pause when they encounter a clearing and gaze along a narrow trail, which threads through the undergrowth. A red-haired boy of about nine-years-old perches a little further up the trail. The two individuals stroll over to him, and Oliver pats him on the shoulders. Eliza lifts Tom, and Oliver trots on through the wheat. He approaches a dark-haired girl of about 12, who gazes dreamily across the meadow. Oliver tilts Emma's chin to face him. Emma taps her cousin's elbow and turns his face to view in the direction she had been gazing. Oliver stoops and gently moves through the wheat, accompanied by Eliza, who’s still holding Tom in her arms. Oliver halts and surveys the surroundings nervously. He breathes deeply and gingerly steps forward onto a patch of flattened wheat stalks. Oliver gapes in amazement as he, Eliza, Emma, and Tom reach the boundary of an extensive oval region of flattened wheat. Two large collies circle around restlessly in the middle. An overhead perspective shows Oliver and his companions standing in the oval, which is about 100 meters in width. An additional crop circle lies next to it, identical in size but with a tiny triangle of wheat still upright within it."

Suddenly, the same man lifts himself up on his knees in bed, his eyes scanning sharply around the plainly decorated space. He eases back and stands up. The man, Graham Hess, emerges from his bedroom wearing a brown sweater and cargo pants. He tiptoes along the hallway in his woolen socks and arrives at a closed door with some hand-drawn children's animals taped to it. Graham hesitates momentarily to eavesdrop at the door, then heads back to his bedroom, grabbing some misplaced gloves on the way. He's in his mid-40s with short dark hair and a rugged handsome face. Graham crosses the kitchen and peers out of the door, his comb in his mouth. He marches across the hallway, opens the door to the children's playroom, and scans the area.

Outside, a crumpled map on a coffee table displays a thoughtful couple: a pilot, a chef, a young cat, and a bird. The pilot wears a flower crown. Abruptly, the same person flips up on their hands on a bench, their fingers twitching calmly around the colorfully decorated area. They tense and stand up. The person, Arthur Lane, strolls out of their kitchen wearing a blue hoodie and jogging shorts. They amble along the promenade in their bright shoes and approach an open window with some printed travel brochures taped to it. Arthur hesitates for an instant to whistle at the window, then ventures back to the kitchen, retrieving some forgotten slippers on the journey. They're in their early 30s with long blonde hair and a quirky amused expression. Arthur maneuvers through the garage and peers out of the window, their comb in their hand. They march across the promenade, swings open the window to the children's playroom, and peers inside. An older woman in a similar suburban-style living room suddenly leaps and rolls out of an armchair. She springs to her feet and yawns to taste. Arthur jogs out of their brick villa and strides towards a yellowish greenhouse, while the older woman skips up a series of ladders to the attic. Arthur and the older woman, Sandra, glide through a meadow of short purple lavender. They pause when they reach an opening and observe a covered bridge, which zigzags through the flowers. A blonde cat of about two-years-old lounges a little further down the bridge. The two people trot over to it, and Arthur nudges it by the ears. Sandra scoops up Max, and Arthur leaps on across the lavender. They find a dark-haired rabbit of about 5, who gazes vacantly over the meadow. Arthur rotates Lily's paws to face them. Lily places their elbow around their parent's shoulder and rotates their face to focus in the direction they had been gazing. Arthur stands and gently hops through the lavender, shadowed by Sandra, who's still cradling Max in their hands. Arthur halts and peers around curiously. They gulp quietly and gingerly stroll onward onto a sheet of trampled purple petals. Arthur gawks in amazement as they, Sandra, Lily, and Max wander to the boundary of a tremendous oval patch of flattened lavender. Two small squirrels dance around merrily in the middle. A panoramic shot shows Arthur and their guild lounging in the field, which is about 300 feet in length. Another floral pattern reveals itself beside it, the same dimensions but with a tiny quarter-moon of lavender still flourishing within it."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

In his 40s, with rugged features, Graham and his brother Merrill rush through a maize field upon seeing something unusual. They find Graham's daughter Bo and son Morgan standing in the crop. Graham turns Morgan's attention, and both face the same direction with concern. As Graham, Merrill carrying Bo, and Morgan navigate through the field, they discover a vast, circular area of flattened maize with pacing Alsatians in the center. The aerial view reveals another crop circle with a small semi-circle still standing beside it."
