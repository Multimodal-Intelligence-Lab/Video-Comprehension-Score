With a nod, Bo Catlett stands, prompting Ronnie to react by straightening his posture. Ronnie, in a calculated move, slips open his coat just enough to reveal the gun nestled in his belt, making sure Harry sees it. Bo Catlett exchanges a knowing glance with Ronnie, casting a final look at Chili before trailing Ronnie out through the door. Left behind, Harry fixes his eyes on the door for a moment, acutely aware of Chili's stare fixed upon him. As Chili turns his gaze on Harry, he shakes his head silently in disapproval while Harry settles into one of the available chairs, his hands awkwardly reaching for his cigarettes. Outside, parked conspicuously, sits Chili's minivan. Feeling his composure slipping away, Harry rubs his eyes in frustration and swiftly moves toward a row of payphones nearby. Meanwhile, Chili is seated at a desk, engaged in conversation over the phone, their eyes meeting briefly across the distance, each silently assessing the other until Chili breaks the gaze to check his watch. Karen, caught off guard, hesitates in her response, and Chili allows the pause to linger, letting its weight sink in. In a different scene, Leo lowers himself into an armchair, casting a sorrowful glance at the briefcase beside him. He nods solemnly, then, with a purposeful motion, retrieves the briefcase as he stands from the sofa, and Leo rises from his chair in tandem. Approaching the door, Chili extends his hand, opens it, and glances back at Leo, then proceeds toward the elevator. The scene shifts as Chili drives along a shadowy road leading up to the park, maneuvering his car to a stop behind a row of trailers. Exiting the vehicle, he strides purposefully toward the set, where Harry, looking skyward, is engaged in a loud exchange with someone. Rounding a corner, there is a sudden burst of light illuminating the path ahead. As Chili begins to make his way back, he catches sight of Leo's frightened expression just moments before the door slams shut. Leo steps into the doorway, prompting Chili to shake his head and turn back toward the elevator. He halts, pivots, and without uttering a word, sinks into one of the plush red leather chairs. Bo Catlett offers him a grin, withholding the script tightly. Bo watches intently as Chili picks up a copy of the script and begins to leaf through its pages. As Chili skims through, a name catches his attention. Karen, observing him, holds her smile, opting to linger for a moment longer. Deeply absorbed in the movie, Chili mouths the lines silently along with the characters. As Tanya, portrayed by Marlene Dietrich, resumes her slow, deliberate walk away, Karen takes her seat at the far end of the row. As the film concludes, the audience begins to rise and make their way out, leaving Chili to turn to a man seated a few spots away. The man, noting Chili's gaze, casts a look of acknowledgement, wraps an arm around his companion, and quickly moves up the aisle, clearing Chili's view to reveal Karen seated at the row's end. Rising to her feet, she and Chili begin ascending the aisle side by side. As they exit the theater, they pause momentarily, standing together in the afterglow of the cinematic experience."

Harry backs away, holds the script to his chest, knowing the importance of the screenplay's confidentiality. Bo Catlett, a seasoned producer with a reputation for being persuasive, notices this. Bo Catlett eyes him a beat, then pushes out of his chair, which is part of his signature style of asserting dominance in negotiations. Bo Catlett nods, gets up. Ronnie, known for his intimidating presence, sits up straight. Ronnie opens his coat so that Harry can see a gun tucked in his belt, a reminder of the high stakes involved in the movie industry, where money often attracts danger. Bo Catlett gives Ronnie a look, a silent communication between two men familiar with this kind of tension. Bo Catlett glances once more at Chili, a well-regarded fixer in the film business, then follows Ronnie out the door. Harry stares at the door a moment, senses Chili staring at him, a man known for his ability to read others. Chili looks at Harry. Chili shakes his head as Harry sits down in one of the chairs, fumbles for his cigarettes, a habit he's picked up during stressful meetings. Chili's minivan, a trusted vehicle for his line of work, is parked out front. Obviously losing it now, Harry rubs his eyes and quickly walks off to a row of payphones, a relic in the age of mobile phones but still useful for discrete conversations. Chili sits at the desk on the phone, dealing with yet another crisis. They consider each other a moment until Chili finally checks his watch, a reminder of the tight shooting schedule they are under. Karen, an influential actress in the project, looks caught, doesn't answer right away. Chili lets that sink in a minute, understanding the ramifications of her silence. Leo, the film's financier, sits down in the armchair, stares sadly at the briefcase, knowing it contains documents that could make or break the production. Leo nods. He picks up the briefcase as he rises from the sofa, and Leo gets out of his chair, signaling the end of their discussion. Chili reaches for the door, opens it, and looks back at Leo. As Chili starts for the elevator, he thinks about the complexity of the film business. Chili drives a dark road up into the park, a secluded location often used for secretive industry meetings. Chili pulls in behind a row of trailers, which serve as temporary offices for the film crew. He gets out of the car and heads for the set where Harry, now in full director mode, is looking up at the sky and yelling at someone, likely a crew member about the lighting. He rounds a corner, and we see an explosion of light up ahead as we come upon the filming of a nighttime scene. As he starts back, he sees Leo's scared look just before he slams the door shut, understanding the pressure Leo is under. Leo steps into his doorway. Chili shakes his head, starts back for the elevator, knowing there's more work to be done. Chili stops, turns around, contemplating the path ahead. Chili says nothing, sits down in one of the red leather chairs, a familiar setting for difficult conversations. Bo Catlett smiles at him, doesn't give up the script, knowing the power it holds. Bo watches as Chili picks up a copy of the script, begins flipping through it, searching for insights. Chili flips through the script, sees a name he recognizes as a key character. Karen smiles, decides to wait a moment, appreciating Chili's focus. Chili, lost in the movie, keeps mouthing the dialogue, absorbed in the narrative as if it were part of his life. As Tanya, a character played by the legendary Marlene Dietrich, resumes her slow walk away, Karen sits down at the end of the row, reflecting on her role. People start getting up to leave, the credits rolling. Chili turns to a guy a few seats away from him, someone who looks like a fellow industry insider. The guy gives Chili a look, puts his arm around his date, and quickly starts up the aisle so that Chili can now see Karen sitting there at the end of the row. She gets up, they start up the aisle together, sharing a moment of mutual understanding. As Karen and Chili exit the theater, stand there a moment, they both ponder the next steps in their complicated lives."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby cafÃ©, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to.

Meanwhile, Leo sits sadly with a briefcase. Chili heads out, drives to a film set where Harry is yelling, prompting an explosion of light. Seeing Leo scared, Chili returns to the elevator, turns back, and sits in a chair. Bo smiles but keeps the script while Chili flips through it, mouthing dialogue. Karen watches him, then joins him as people leave the theater. They exit together, pausing momentarily outside."
