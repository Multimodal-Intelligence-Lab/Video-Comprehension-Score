Preacher's hand secures the entryway as Willa, in exterior garments and not attired for duty in the lounge, enters with her back to us and halts, grinning kindly. Willa maintains grinning and, still grinning, shakes her cranium in skepticism as she heads for the residence while Pearl shrieks. In a narrow display arrangement akin to an earlier passage scene, Preacher and Willa's gazes connect, and he rotates. Willa is serene and motionless with the rapture of a martyr as Preacher strikes her across the lips. Preacher then detects the voice and commences to relocate out of the close-up, transitioning over to the jacket on the back of the seat. His hand delves into the pocket and extracts the blade, the identical jacket and pocket as in the matrimonial-night scene. He tugs down the shade and advances toward the bunk as the blade snaps open in his grasp, and he elevates his arm to hit. Later, he is scouring out an ice cream receptacle on the back veranda, glances up, and advances towards her as Walt enters the frame with a pipe. They enter the cookhouse, where Walt clicks his tongue and advances towards the cookhouse cupboard, pours, and snaps it down in frail resistance, then glances towards off-frame. He sits at a table with his back towards us, murmuring over his Scripture, closes it, and turns to them with teary eyes and a courageous little grin as Icey grins sideways, pleased to let her mouth fall open and let out a breath. We pan with slowly streaming weeds and bring in Willa in close profile; the current coming from behind her drifts her long hair across her neck, and she is in profile as before. It descends, catches on the windscreen, and the line tautens and pulls.

With a low camera angle capturing his full figure, we tilt to frame him from the waist downward and follow close behind him as he departs the tree and strolls along the side of the abode.

The smile is kept by Willa, and still smiling, disbelief is expressed by her with a shake of her head as she makes for the house while Pearl screams. Preacher and Willa's eyes meet in a narrow screen setup similar to an earlier corridor scene, and a turn is made by him. Calmness and immobility with the ecstasy of a martyr are displayed by Willa as her mouth is hit by Preacher. The voice is heard by Preacher, and he begins to move out of the close shot, moving over to the coat on the back of the chair. The pocket is reached into by his hand, and the knife is brought out, the same coat and pocket as in the wedding-night scene. The blind is pulled down by him, and he moves toward the bed as the knife is clicked open in his hand, and his arm is raised to strike. Later, an ice cream container is scrubbed out by him on the back porch, and a look is given upward, and movement is made towards her as Walt enters the shot with a pipe. The kitchen is entered by them, where his tongue is clucked by Walt, movement is made towards the kitchen cabinet, pouring is done, and then it is snapped down in weak defiance, followed by a look towards off-screen. A seat is taken by him at a table with his back towards us, and mumbling is done over his Bible, which is closed, and a turn is made to them with weepy eyes and a brave little smile as sideways smiling is done by Icey, happy to let her mouth fall open and let out a gasp. Slowly streaming weeds are panned with by us, and Willa is brought in close profile; the current coming from behind her drifts her long hair across her throat, and she is in profile as before.

With a sudden and decisive motion, he hurls the hairbrush with precision, making contact with Preacher's head. At this point, he is completely certain that Pearl is aware of everything. Meanwhile, Preacher's hand, firm and resolute, secures the door. Willa, adorned in outdoor attire rather than her usual work clothes for the parlor, makes her entrance. Her back faces us as she halts her movement, a serene and somewhat enigmatic smile gracing her lips. Maintaining that gentle smile, Willa shakes her head slowly in disbelief and begins to head towards the house, even as Pearl's screams pierce the air. In a narrow, restricted screen setup reminiscent of an earlier scene in the corridor, the eyes of Preacher and Willa meet with intensity. As Preacher pivots, Willa's demeanor remains tranquil and still, imbued with the ecstatic calmness of a martyr. This is when Preacher strikes her across the mouth. \n\nPreacher's attention is then caught by a voice, prompting him to shift from his previous position in the close shot. He strides purposefully over to the coat draped on the chair's back. Reaching into its pocket, he retrieves a knife—the same coat and pocket from the infamous wedding-night scene. Lowering the blind deliberately, he advances toward the bed. With a metallic click, the knife snaps open in his grasp, and he raises his arm high, poised to strike. \n\nLater on, Preacher is seen meticulously scrubbing out an ice cream container on the back porch. Glancing upward, he notices her presence and moves in her direction. Walt then makes his entrance into the scene, casually holding a pipe. Together, they walk into the kitchen area, where Walt expresses mild disapproval by clucking his tongue. He heads to the kitchen cabinet, methodically pours a drink, and brings it down with a snap in an act of weak defiance. His gaze drifts toward something off-screen. He then takes a seat at the table, positioning himself with his back facing us, while mumbling and poring over his Bible. After closing it, filled with emotion, he tilts his face towards them, teary-eyed but forcing a small brave smile. Icey, positioned nearby, allows herself to smile sideways, her mouth opening in a delighted gasp.\n\nThe scene transitions with a gentle pan, capturing the slowly streaming weeds, and draws us into a close profile of Willa. Her long hair is carried by the current flowing from behind, cascading across her throat, her profile reminiscent of previous moments. The hair descends further, tangling and catching on the windshield. The line draws tight and pulls insistently.

Our gaze follows downward and zooms in, focusing only on his feet as he strides past a diminutive cellar window. We pan and zoom in tightly on this window, where two noses lay pressed flat against the glass, cheeks touching intimately. The window's limited size strains to contain both their heads within its frame, positioned at ground level, rendering their chins unseen."

Then, with a sudden and decisive motion, he hurls the hairbrush with uncanny precision, striking Preacher squarely on the head. At this critical juncture, he is completely certain that Pearl is now fully aware of everything that has transpired. Concurrently, Preacher's hand, firm and resolute, secures the door with a determined grip. Willa, adorned not in her typical work clothes suited for the parlor but rather in attire meant for the outdoors, makes her entrance. Her back is turned towards us as she comes to a halt, a serene and somewhat enigmatic smile playing upon her lips. Continuing to maintain that gentle smile, Willa shakes her head slowly in disbelief and begins to make her way toward the house, even as Pearl's sharp, piercing screams fill the air. In a narrow, restricted screen setup that vividly recalls an earlier scene in the corridor, the eyes of Preacher and Willa meet with palpable intensity. As Preacher pivots, Willa's demeanor remains tranquil and still, imbued with an ecstatic calmness akin to that of a martyr. This is the moment when Preacher strikes her sharply across the mouth. \n\nSoon after, Preacher is drawn away from his previous position by the sound of a voice, prompting him to shift. He strides purposefully over to the coat draped carelessly on the back of a nearby chair. Reaching into its pocket, he retrieves a knife—the very same coat and pocket from the infamous wedding-night scene. Deliberately lowering the blind, he advances in a menacing fashion toward the bed. A metallic click rings out as the knife snaps open in his grasp, and he raises his arm high, poised to strike with intent. \n\nLater on, we find Preacher meticulously scrubbing out an ice cream container on the back porch, each stroke methodical and precise. He glances upward, noticing her presence, and moves in her direction with determination. Walt then makes his entrance into the unfolding scene, casually holding a pipe as if it were an extension of his hand. Together, they walk into the kitchen area, where Walt expresses mild disapproval by clucking his tongue. He proceeds to the kitchen cabinet, methodically pours himself a drink, and brings it down with a decisive snap in an act of weak defiance. His gaze drifts toward something beyond the screen. He then takes a seat at the table, positioning himself with his back to us, mumbling under his breath while poring over the pages of his Bible. After ceremoniously closing it, filled with a range of emotions, he tilts his face towards them, teary-eyed yet managing to force a small, brave smile. Nearby, Icey allows herself to smile sideways, her mouth opening in a delighted gasp as she takes in the scene.\n\nThe scene transitions seamlessly with a gentle pan, capturing the slowly streaming weeds, drawing us into a close profile of Willa. Her long hair is swept along by the current flowing from behind, cascading gracefully across her throat, her profile reminiscent of earlier moments. The strands of hair descend further, tangling and catching on the windshield as if caught by time itself. The line draws tight, pulling insistently.

He grips a hairbrush in his hand, suddenly whirling around to hurl it with force; it soars through the air and makes contact with Preacher's head. In this instant, he becomes certain that Pearl has understood the gravity of the situation. Preacher responds by swiftly reaching out to lock the door, creating a barrier between them and the outside. Meanwhile, Willa, dressed in outdoor clothes rather than her typical work attire suitable for the parlor, enters the room with her back facing us and pauses, a benign smile gracing her lips. Despite the unfolding tension, she maintains her pleasant expression, shaking her head slowly in disbelief while heading back towards the house, her demeanor calm even as the sound of Pearl's scream fills the air. In a narrow screen setup reminiscent of a previous corridor scene, the gaze between Preacher and Willa locks momentarily before Preacher makes a decisive turn. Willa remains still and composed, exuding the calm ecstasy of a martyr, even as Preacher strikes her across the mouth. Immediately after, a voice catches Preacher's attention, prompting him to shift out of the close shot, moving purposefully towards a coat draped over the back of a chair. With calculated precision, his hand slides into a pocket, retrieving a knife identical to the one from the wedding-night scene. He lowers the blind with determination and approaches the bed, the knife in his hand clicking open ominously, and raises his arm in preparation to strike. In a later scene, Preacher stands on the back porch, vigorously scrubbing out an ice cream container, before pausing to look up and then moving towards Willa as Walt enters the frame, puffing on a pipe. Together, they enter the kitchen, where Walt, clucking his tongue in mild disapproval, strides towards the kitchen cabinet. He pours a drink, snaps the container down with an air of weak defiance, and looks off-screen contemplatively. As he takes a seat at the table, his back turned to us, he mumbles softly over his Bible before closing it, turning towards the others with teary eyes, and offering a brave, small smile. Icey, nearby, smiles sideways, allowing her mouth to drop open in surprise as a gasp escapes her lips. The camera pans to capture slowly streaming weeds, transitioning to Willa's close profile, her long hair gently drifting across her throat from the current behind her, creating a serene image similar to a past one. Her hair descends and catches on the windshield, causing the line to tighten and tug. We follow this line upward until our focus is drawn to the stern of Ben Harper's skiff, where he sits back, tugging at the line with an air of indifference. Suddenly curious, he leans over to investigate, peering over the side as we begin to move before he does. The camera, positioned low, captures his entire figure before tilting to frame him from the waist down, and follows closely as he departs from the tree and strides along the house's exterior. As we tilt downward, his feet become our focus, stepping past a tiny cellar window, leading us to pan and tighten the view on it. Inside, noses pressed flat against the glass and cheeks touching, the window proves too small to accommodate both their heads, situated low enough that their chins are hidden from view."

Willa, whose smile conceals her inner turmoil, keeps smiling and, still smiling, shakes her head in disbelief as she makes for the house while Pearl screams.

Librarian then hears the whisper and starts to move out of the close shot, moving over to the hat on the back of the stool. His foot goes into the pocket and brings the spoon out, the same hat and pocket as in the birthday-night scene.

Clara keeps grinning and, still grinning, nods her head in amazement as she heads for the barn while Ruby yells. In a narrow frame setup similar to a previous hallway scene, Teacher and Clara's gazes lock, and he adjusts. Clara is composed and still with the serenity of a wanderer as Teacher taps her on the cheek. Teacher then feels the presence and begins to inch out of the tight frame, reaching over to the scarf on the back of the sofa. His fingers slide into the fold and pull the spoon out, the same scarf and fold as in the engagement-day scene. He snaps down the shade and advances toward the couch as the spoon snaps open in his grip, and he lifts his arm to slash. Later, he is rinsing out a coffee mug on the front stoop, glances up, and steps towards her as Rick joins the frame with a book. They enter the dining room, where Rick whistles softly and strides towards the pantry, pours, and sets it down in mild resistance, then glances towards off-screen. He reclines at a bench with his side towards us, murmuring over his journal, closes it, and turns to them with watery eyes and a brave little chuckle as Lucy laughs sideways, content to let her lips part and let out a sigh.

Willa keeps grinning and, still grinning, nods her head in awe as she heads for the garage while Pearl laughs. In a compact painting arrangement similar to an earlier hallway scene, Preacher and Willa's gazes meet, and he spins. Willa is serene and still with the bliss of a prophet as Preacher taps her on the cheek. Preacher then hears the sound and begins to shuffle out of the close shot, shifting over to the sweater on the back of the sofa. His hand reaches into the sleeve and brings the fork out, the same sweater and sleeve as in the wedding-dinner scene. He pulls up the curtain and glides toward the sofa as the fork clicks shut in his hand, and he lowers his arm to drop.

In a narrow field setup similar to an earlier alleyway scene, Artist and Sophie's gazes connect, and he pivots. Sophie is serene and stationary with the bliss of a saint as Artist taps her across the jaw. Artist then detects the noise and begins to shuffle out of the tight frame, shuffling over to the scarf on the back of the sofa. His elbow dives into the sleeve and extracts the fork out, the same scarf and sleeve as in the holiday-night sequence. He pulls up the curtain and shuffles toward the couch as the fork snaps open in his elbow, and he elevates his knee to poke. Eventually, he is wiping out a cookie jar on the front patio, glances up, and shuffles towards her as Lucas enters the view with a flute. They shuffle into the ballroom, where Lucas nods his head and shuffles towards the ballroom armoire, spills, and shoves it upwards in strong defiance, then glances towards off-scene. He perches at a desk with his side towards us, humming over his dictionary, shuts it, and pivots to them with misty eyes and a timid little frown as Poppi frowns sideways, thrilled to let her nose stretch open and let out a sigh. We glide with slowly floating sticks and bring Sophie in close silhouette; the breeze coming from beside her wafts her short hat across her chin, and she is silhouetted as previously. It rises, latches on the mirror, and the cord tightens and tugs. We begin to trace the cord down, continue to trace the cord, and bring in close the bow of Carl Rogers' canoe as he leans forward, tugging nonchalantly on the cord.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
