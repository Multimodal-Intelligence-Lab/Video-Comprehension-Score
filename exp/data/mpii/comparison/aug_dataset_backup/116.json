He switches the lights on, closes the door, puts the lights on, closes the door, and puts the key in his pocket.

He flips the lights on, shuts the door, flips the lights on, shuts the door, and places the key in his pocket. He lifts up the telephone; Phyllis is on the telephone and is not dressed as in Norton's office. He disconnects, removes his hat, and drops the hat and briefcase on the sofa. Neff glances around the chamber and crosses to lower the venetian blinds and pull the drapes. He collects up the morning gazette lying messily on the floor and places it in the waste-paper basket. The doorbell chimes, and Neff halts in sudden fright. For a moment, he stands still, then crosses to the door and opens it. In the open door stands Keyes, who strides past him into the chamber with his hands clasped behind his back and an odd, absent-minded expression in his eyes. Neff shuts the door without taking his eyes off Keyes. Keyes halts in the center of the chamber and swivels, pokes his abdomen with his thumb, and has halted in front of Neff. They gaze at one another for a tense instant; Neff scarcely breathes. Keyes shakes his head abruptly, pokes his abdomen again, and resumes his pacing. Ultimately, Keyes continues and goes on pacing up and down. Ultimately, Neff can't endure the silence any longer, crosses to the corridor door, and places his hand on the knob to open the door.

He promptly switches on the lights, ensuring the door is closed behind him, and then thoughtfully places the key in his pocket for safekeeping. Picking up the phone receiver, Neff hears Phyllis on the line, noting her attire differs from when she was in Norton's office.

He reaches for the light switch, flicking it on, enveloping the space in brightness, then closes the door behind him with precision, ensuring the room's privacy. Neff slides the key into his pocket for safekeeping before he picks up the phone, hearing Phyllis on the line, though she is not dressed as she was in Norton's office. After the call, Neff hangs up, removes his hat, and casually lets both the hat and his briefcase fall onto the davenport with a sense of relaxation. His eyes survey the room, and he strides over to the venetian blinds, lowering them methodically and drawing the curtains closed for added privacy. Noticing the morning paper carelessly strewn on the floor, he bends down, gathers it up, and disposes of it in the waste-paper basket with a swift motion. Suddenly, the doorbell rings, jolting Neff into a brief moment of alarm. He stands frozen for a split second, then moves with purpose to the door, opening it to reveal Keyes standing there. Without a word, Keyes strides past Neff into the room, his hands clasped behind his back, his eyes having a faraway, contemplative look. Neff follows Keyes with his gaze, shutting the door softly behind him while keeping his focus on Keyes, who comes to a stop in the center of the room. Keyes turns around, prods his stomach with his thumb absent-mindedly, and stands facing Neff, creating a charged silence between them. Neff holds his breath, feeling the tension in the air. Keyes gives a sudden shake of his head, jabs his stomach once more, and resumes pacing, moving back and forth as if lost in thought. The silence stretches on, unbearable for Neff, and he ultimately crosses to the corridor door, reaching out to grasp the knob, ready to open it. As the door swings slightly open, revealing the vacant hallway, Phyllis, who has been stealthily standing close to the door, quickly retreats, flattening herself against the wall behind the opening door to avoid detection. Keyes exits, and Neff, trailing behind him, scans the hallway anxiously for Phyllis's presence. His attention catches her form through the narrow opening of the partly opened door, and with quick thinking, he pushes the door wider to shield her from Keyes's view. He presses the call button for the elevator, and as the doors part, he turns back to Neff, throwing one last glance of irritation. Phyllis seizes the moment to approach Neff, yet he remains unresponsive, until suddenly he pulls her close, planting a kiss upon her lips.

Among them sits Lola Dietrichson, clad in a simple black suit and hat, a visible symbol of mourning. Her fingers fidget nervously with a handkerchief, her eyes fixed apprehensively on the elevator doors, signaling her anticipation and unease."

The corridor door opens, letting light in as Neff, a sharp but disillusioned insurance salesman, enters with his hat on, a symbol of his professionalism, and his briefcase under his arm. He switches the lights on, closes the door, puts the lights on, closes the door, and puts the key, a small brass key with a worn finish from years of use, in his pocket. He picks up the phone; Phyllis, an enigmatic and manipulative woman with her own hidden motives, is on the phone and is not dressed as in Norton's office, where business attire is the norm. He hangs up, takes off his hat, and drops the hat and briefcase, which contains crucial documents, on the davenport, an elegant piece of furniture often found in fashionable homes of the time. Neff looks around the room and crosses to lower the Venetian blinds, invented in the 18th century and popular for controlling light and privacy, and draw the curtains. He gathers up the morning paper, filled with headlines that capture the tumult of the era, lying untidily on the floor and puts it in the waste-paper basket. The doorbell rings, and Neff stops in sudden alarm, his mind racing with possible scenarios. For a second, he stands motionless, then crosses to the door and opens it. In the open door stands Keyes, who walks past him into the room with his hands clasped behind his back and a strange, absent-minded look in his eyes, suggestive of his relentless pursuit of the truth. Neff closes the door without taking his eyes off Keyes, a man whose intuition and experience are feared by many. Keyes stops in the middle of the room and turns, prods his stomach with his thumb, a habitual gesture indicative of his deep concentration, and has stopped in front of Neff. They look at each other for a tense moment; Neff hardly breathes, aware of the stakes. Keyes shakes his head suddenly, prods his stomach again, and resumes his pacing, a sign of his restless analytical mind. Finally, Keyes continues and goes on pacing up and down. Finally, Neff can't stand the silence any longer, crosses to the corridor door, and puts his hand on the knob to open the door. The hallway, a narrow passage lined with faded wallpaper, is empty except for Phyllis, who has been standing close to the door of Neff's apartment, listening with intense curiosity. The door has just started to open when Phyllis moves away quickly and flattens herself against the wall behind the opening door. Keyes is coming out, and Neff, behind him, looks anxiously down the hallway for Phyllis, who remains a shadowy and unpredictable figure in his life. Suddenly his eye catches a glimpse of her through the crack of the partly opened door, and he pushes the door wide to hide her from Keyes. He pushes the call button for the elevator, a polished brass button that gleams under the dim hallway light, and turns, then pulls back the elevator door, a heavy, ornate piece of machinery typical of the era, and turns to Neff with one last glance of annoyance. She moves toward him, but he does not respond; instead, he pulls her close and kisses her, an impulsive act fraught with danger and desire. Meanwhile, two telephone operators, stationed in their orderly cubicles to handle the constant flow of calls, and a receptionist, efficiently managing the front desk, are at work; several visitors are waiting in chairs, a testament to the bustling life of the office, and among them is Lola Dietrichson, wearing a simple black suit and hat, an outfit symbolizing grief, indicating mourning. Her fingers nervously pick at a handkerchief, a small square of white linen clutched tightly, and her eyes are watching the elevator doors anxiously, revealing her troubled state of mind."

It switches the lamps on, closes the window, puts the lamps on, closes the window, and puts the marble in its satchel. It picks up the trumpet; Daisy is on the trumpet and is not painted as in Raven's suitcase. It hangs up, takes off its scarf, and drops the scarf and lunchbox on the hammock.

The gong rings, and Turtle freezes in sudden alarm. For a moment, it stands still, then waddles to the attic window and opens it. In the open attic window stands Sparrow, who flutters past it into the attic with its wings tucked behind its back and a vacant, dreamy look in its eyes. Turtle closes the attic window without taking its eyes off Sparrow. Sparrow pauses in the middle of the attic and turns, taps its beak with its claw, and has paused in front of Turtle.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby cafÃ©, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
