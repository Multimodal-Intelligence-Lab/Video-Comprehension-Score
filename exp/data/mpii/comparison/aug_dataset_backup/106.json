Jenny and Forrest then commence walking together in unison, but quite suddenly and without warning, a dirt clod strikes Forrest on the back of his head. This prompts Jenny to immediately turn her concerned attention toward him as he instinctively reaches up to rub the sore spot. Not far off, three young boys dismount from their bicycles and start picking up more rocks to throw. Another dirt clod hits Forrest squarely in the eye, causing him to stumble backward in pain and ultimately fall to the ground. The boys glare at him with menacing eyes. Jenny quickly helps Forrest back to his feet as Boy #1 and Boy #2 continue their relentless assault, hurling even more dirt clods at him, one of which strikes his arm. Forrest, in a bid to escape, attempts to flee along the road, but his leg braces severely hinder his movement. This forces him to hobble awkwardly, while Jenny shouts after him in desperation. Boy #1 and Boy #2 return to their bicycles, and the boys begin to pursue Forrest with determination. He continues to hobble along the dusty road, with Jenny standing by helplessly, watching the scene unfold. Forrest darts a glance over his shoulder and sees the three boys racing toward him on their bikes; he tries his best to increase his pace despite the cumbersome braces.

Boy #1 and Boy #2 turn back to their bikes, and the trio mounts their bikes to pursue Forrest, who continues to hobble along the dirt road with Jenny watching from a distance.

Three young boys, notorious in the neighborhood for bullying, get off their bikes and pick up more rocks, and Forrest is hit in the eye with another dirt clod, causing him to fall backward onto the ground as the boys glare at him with malice. Jenny helps Forrest back up as Boy #1 and Boy #2 throw more dirt clods at him, with another one hitting him in the arm, a bruise already beginning to form. Forrest tries to run along the road, a dusty rural path often used by children playing, but his braces, designed to correct his spinal ailment, make it impossible, so he hobbles along as Jenny yells after him to hurry. Boy #1 and Boy #2 turn back toward the bikes, and the boys ride after Forrest, who continues to hobble along the dirt road while Jenny stands and watches, her heart pounding in fear for him. Forrest looks over his shoulder as the three boys race on their bikes, gaining speed as if driven by a cruel game, and he begins to run faster with his braces on as they chase him relentlessly. Blood drips from a cut on his head, but he continues running despite the boys on the bikes gaining on him, fueled by determination. Forrest hobbles along and then begins to gain speed, running from the chasing boys who seem to enjoy the pursuit.

Surprised, Forrest runs and looks down at his legs as he continues to run faster, with the metal braces and straps flying off his legs, liberating him. Forrest runs free of his braces and begins to pick up speed, his strides longer and more confident, while the chasing boys ride over the remains of his braces, astonished by the sight. The black woman continues to read her magazine, seemingly unaware of the dramatic chase, and Forrest smiles as he remembers, feeling a sense of newfound freedom. He is already at the far end of the road, a safe distance from the chasing boys who stop and watch in disbelief as Forrest sprints away from them, his speed only increasing. Forrest runs down a driveway toward Jenny's small house, a modest home with a weathered front porch, knocks on Jenny's door, looks around the field to the left, and notices Jenny, who has been waiting for him just out of sight. He runs toward her with relief in his eyes. He reaches Jenny, and she grabs his hand, a familiar gesture of solidarity, and runs into the field, a sprawling cornfield that offers them temporary refuge. Jenny's dad, notorious in the community for his erratic behavior when drunk, steps out onto the porch and shouts, then steps out toward the field, running through it with a liquor bottle in his hand while searching for Jenny. Jenny and Forrest run into the cornfield, a place of both hiding and fear for them, as Jenny's dad tries to chase her with an unsteady gait, and Jenny drops to her knees, pulling Forrest down with her, both trying to hide among the towering stalks."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
