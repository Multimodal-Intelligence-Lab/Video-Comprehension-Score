A brunette woman, slipping from a man's desperate grasp, finds herself sliding down the deck on her stomach. All along the grand Titanic, individuals dangle precariously from ropes, spill over railings, or helplessly slide straight into the cold ocean. More and more people clamber over the railing at the stern of the ship. With a sudden leap, one man jumps and free-falls into the frigid waters, where small, desperate groups of survivors cling for dear life to any floating debris they can find. Standing by the rear railing, a baker with dark, jet-black hair watches intently as a falling man bounces off one of the enormous propellers and cartwheels into the sea below. The baker, unfazed by the chaos, retrieves a flask from his pocket and takes a swig. Jack wraps his arms securely around Rose as she clutches onto the railing with white-knuckled determination. Sitting close beside Molly in a lifeboat, Ruth's eyes are glazed over with shock as she watches from afar, while Ismay, who is also in a lifeboat, turns away from the horror and squeezes his eyes shut, unable to look any longer. Meanwhile, a crewman reaches out towards a sparking circuit breaker, only to be dramatically flung back by a fierce shock. Throughout the length and breadth of the Titanic, electric lights flicker ominously before going out completely as the rear of the ship continues its upward tilt. Blood streaks down his forehead as Lovejoy clings desperately to a side railing that begins to split apart. Inside the massive ship, a ceiling collapses loudly as several crucial support columns fail, and small but fiery explosions burst from the portholes. A pair of men helplessly slide into the widening chasm, and the mighty ship snaps violently in half, sending the rear of the boat plunging downward back toward the unforgiving sea. The back of the Titanic hits the ocean surface with a resounding slap, crushing dozens in its path.

People helplessly slide down the dangerously slanted deck, adding to the pandemonium, while Jack's eyes widen with shock and horror as he witnesses individuals colliding violently with deck chairs, resulting in an utterly chaotic scene. A brunette woman, slipping hopelessly from a man's desperate grasp, finds herself sliding down the deck on her stomach, struggling to stop. All along the grand, majestic Titanic, individuals dangle precariously from ropes, spill over railings, or helplessly slide straight into the cold, unforgiving ocean. More and more alarmed passengers clamber over the railing at the stern of the ship in a frantic bid for survival. With a sudden, decisive leap, one man jumps and free-falls into the frigid waters below, where small, desperate groups of survivors cling tenaciously for dear life to any floating debris they can find amidst the chaos.

Meanwhile, elsewhere on the ship, a crewman reaches out towards a sparking circuit breaker, only to be dramatically flung back by a fierce electrical shock that sends him reeling. Throughout the length and breadth of the Titanic, electric lights flicker ominously before giving out completely as the rear of the ship continues its relentless upward tilt. Blood streaks down his forehead as Lovejoy clings desperately to a side railing that begins to split apart under the immense pressure. Inside the massive ship, a ceiling collapses loudly, echoing as several crucial support columns fail, and small but fiery explosions burst forth from the portholes. A pair of men helplessly slide into the widening chasm, and the once-mighty ship snaps violently in half, sending the rear portion of the boat plunging downward back toward the unforgiving sea below. The back of the Titanic hits the ocean surface with a resounding slap, crushing dozens in its path with terrifying force. The last of the ship's massive funnels topples over with a crash as water rushes furiously into the widening gap between the two sections, which remain tenuously joined at the bottom, and the Titanic quickly fills with water, beginning its inevitable descent into the depths.

Sheets of water shimmer in the bright, unforgiving moonlight, rising up from the restless ocean, as people clinging to railings lose their tenuous grips and fall helplessly into the void. One man bounces off a nearby cab stand before slamming into other people clinging below, creating a devastating domino effect of falling bodies amidst the chaos. A blonde maid dangles desperately from the railing near Rose, who gazes deeply into the young woman's eyes just before she loses her grip and falls, disappearing from sight.

On the slanted deck, people find themselves losing their footing, sliding uncontrollably, and Jack's eyes widen in horror as he witnesses the chaotic scene of people and deck chairs colliding violently with each other. A brunette woman, unable to maintain her grip on a man's hand, slips out of his grasp and involuntarily slides along the deck on her stomach, becoming part of the disarray. Throughout the length of the Titanic, the situation is dire as people desperately cling to ropes, spill over railings, or helplessly slide down into the unforgiving ocean. In the midst of the chaos, more individuals continue to scramble over the railing at the back of the ship, with one man making the terrifying decision to leap and free fall into the icy waters below, where small groups of survivors cling desperately to floating debris in hopes of salvation. At the rear railing, a black-haired baker observes the grim spectacle of a falling man impacting one of the giant propellers and cartwheeling into the sea with horrifying momentum. The baker then retrieves a flask from his pocket and calmly takes a drink, seemingly resigned to the unfolding tragedy. Meanwhile, Jack clings tightly to Rose, wrapping his arms protectively around her as she grips onto the railing for dear life. In a lifeboat some distance away, Ruth sits next to Molly, her eyes glazed over with shock as she witnesses the distant horror unfold. On the same lifeboat, Ismay, overcome with guilt and fear, turns away from the devastation, shutting his eyes in an attempt to block out the scene. Amidst the pandemonium, a crewman reaches toward a sparking circuit breaker, only to be violently flung away by an electric shock. The electric lights that illuminate the Titanic flicker uncertainly before extinguishing altogether as the rear of the ship continues its inexorable tilt skyward. With blood trickling down his forehead, Lovejoy clings desperately to a side railing as it begins to splinter and crack apart. Inside the ship, the devastating collapse of the ceiling occurs as several support columns fail, triggering small explosions that send flames shooting dramatically from portholes. Two men find themselves powerless as they slide into the ever-widening chasm, and in a catastrophic moment, the mighty ship snaps in half, sending the rear section plunging precipitously back toward the sea. As the back of the Titanic crashes down onto the ocean's surface with immense force, it crushes dozens in its wake. The final funnel of the ship topples over as water surges into the gap between the two massive sections, still connected at the bottom, and the Titanic rapidly succumbs to the water's embrace, sinking with relentless speed. In a frantic bid for survival, Jack climbs over the railing at the ship's rear as it tilts skyward with alarming rapidity, while other passengers, equally desperate, manage to scramble over the railings. Sheets of water glimmer hauntingly in the moonlight as they rise from the ocean, and those who are dangling from railings lose their grips, plummeting into the depths below. One man meets a grim fate as he bounces off a cab stand before colliding with others hanging on below, setting off a tragic domino effect of falling bodies. A blonde maid clings to the railing near Rose, and as their eyes meet, the young woman loses her grip and falls, vanishing into the chaos below. Her breath visible in the frigid air, Rose turns toward the baker, who crouches on the railing beside her, and in a moment of shared understanding, he returns her silent gaze. Finally, with the unstoppable force of nature, the entire ship succumbs to the depths and sinks completely."

As passengers struggle for survival, people slide down the slanted deck, and Jack's eyes widen as he observes people and deck chairs smashing into each other. A brunette woman slips out of a man's grasp and slides on the deck on her stomach, amidst the chaos surrounding the sinking of the ill-fated ship. All along the Titanic, people dangle from ropes, a desperate attempt to avoid the freezing Atlantic waters, spill from railings, or slide down into the ocean. More people climb over the railing at the back of the ship, frantically trying to find refuge. One man jumps and free falls into the icy water, where small groups of survivors cling to floating debris, remnants of the luxurious ocean liner. Standing at the rear railing, the black-haired baker, known for his extraordinary survival story, watches a falling man bounce off one of the giant propellers and cartwheel into the sea. The baker pulls a flask out of his pocket and takes a drink, using alcohol to stave off the cold. Jack wraps his arms around Rose as she grips onto the railing, holding on for dear life. Sitting beside Molly, a renowned socialite, in a lifeboat, Ruth's eyes are glassy as she watches from a distance, while Ismay, the chairman of the White Star Line, also in a lifeboat, turns away from the carnage and squeezes his eyes shut in despair. A crewman reaches towards a sparking circuit breaker, which is a dangerous operation on a sinking ship, and a shock flings him. All along the Titanic, electric lights flicker, then go out as the rear of the ship, a towering structure, continues to tilt upward. Blood streaming down his forehead, Lovejoy grips a side railing as it splits apart, highlighting the structural failure facing the ship.

Jack climbs over the railing at the back of the ship as it tilts skyward rapidly, a harrowing climb for survival, and passengers manage to scramble over the railing. Sheets of water glimmer in the moonlight, which rises up from the ocean, and people dangling from railings lose their grips and fall, succumbing to the inevitable pull of gravity. One man bounces off a cab stand before slamming into other people hanging on below, creating a domino effect of falling bodies in the chaos. A blonde maid dangles from the railing near Rose, who looks into the young woman's eyes, deeply impacted by the human suffering around her, as she loses her grip and falls. Her breath visible in the cold air, a sign of the freezing conditions, Rose turns toward the baker, who crouches on the railing beside her, and he returns her silent gaze.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby cafÃ©, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
