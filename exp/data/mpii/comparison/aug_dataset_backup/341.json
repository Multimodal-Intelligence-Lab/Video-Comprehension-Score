Despite his skill, the arrow merely glides straight through the ghostly apparition, proving entirely ineffective. Meanwhile, ARAGORN advances steadily forward, his determination unshaken, eyes resolutely fixed on the spectral form looming before him. The KING OF THE DEAD, his expression contorted into a menacing snarl, lifts his deadly sword high above ARAGORN's head. In a dramatic and slow-motion arc, he brings the weapon down upon ARAGORN, accompanied by a blood-curdling shriek. Undaunted, ARAGORN raises his own formidable sword in response. A low, eerie whistle resonates through the air as his sword slices through the atmosphere, culminating in a loud, resounding clang when the blade of Anduril clashes with the spectral sword. The sharp ring of metal echoes hauntingly through the caverns, creating an eerie symphony of sounds. The KING OF THE DEAD stares at ARAGORN in utter disbelief, while ARAGORN boldly seizes the shocked ghost by the neck, holding the razor-sharp blade menacingly against the spirit's throat before eventually releasing him. Ghostly faces, their eyes hollow and haunting, fix their gaze upon ARAGORN as countless ORCS continue their relentless march forward, advancing menacingly towards the formidable walls of MINAS TIRITH.

The KING OF THE DEAD snarls and raises his deadly sword above ARAGORN'S head, sweeping it towards him with a terrifying shriek in slow motion as ARAGORN raises his sword, Anduril the Flame of the West, reforged from the shards of Narsil, in answer. There is a low whistle as it sweeps through the air, followed by a clang as the blade of Anduril clashes with the spectral sword, the sharp ring of metal reverberating through the caverns deep beneath the haunted hills of Dunharrow. The KING OF THE DEAD stares at ARAGORN in disbelief as ARAGORN grabs the shocked ghost by the neck and holds the sharp blade against the ghost's throat before releasing him. Ghostly faces, remnants of the cursed army who broke their oath to Gondor long ago, stare hollow-eyed at ARAGORN as thousands of ORCS, bred by the dark sorcerer Sauron, continue moving relentlessly forward towards the walls of MINAS TIRITH, Gondor's last great fortress.

DENETHOR, the Steward of Gondor overwhelmed by grief and despair, emerges from the tower hall towards his son and bends to the stretcher bearing his son, with PIPPIN devastated by the scene before him. GOTHMOG, the hideously disfigured orc chieftain, turns to his lieutenants, and at his orders, the great catapults, massive war machines of Mordor, fire. The orc catapults do not fire rocks, causing horror to sweep through the streets of MINAS TIRITH as the severed heads of FARAMIR'S horsemen, once proud soldiers of Gondor, land among the soldiers.

Thousands of flickering torches give the army the look of a moving city in the murky Mordor twilight, a land perpetually shrouded in darkness, as DENETHOR struggles to regain the power of speech.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
