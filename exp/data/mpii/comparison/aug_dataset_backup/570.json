Zed's workplace is a round, glazed chamber elevated above the central level of MIB headquarters. Jay and Kay sit opposite the bureau from Zed. There are five video displays on a partition behind Zed's bureau, and on each screen is another Man in Black, in various regions of the globe, the metropolis identifier and a chronometer ticking in a corner of the picture. While Zed converses, he goes through documentation on his bureau. Next to him, his computer display beeps importantly. Zed glances over at it. Jay and Kay emerge out the front of MIB headquarters. Rosenberg, the jewelry shop proprietor, steps out of a taxi in the meat-packing zone, still carrying the elaborate container and his cherished feline. A moment later, the Orkin van halts to a pause across the avenue. He proceeds into Leshko's, a Russian eatery. Rosenberg enters the diminutive eatery, squinting in the relative dimness. At a table in the center, he perceives a man dining alone—an immense, dignified, yet profoundly peculiar-looking man in his mid-fifties. Rosenberg walks cautiously over to the table, but does not take a seat. He moves forward, to face Rosenberg, who places the elaborate container on the table. Rosenberg and the Arquillian gaze at each other for a lengthy moment—and then clasp each other. The embrace has an odd, formal quality to it, like mafiosi arriving at a sitdown. They hold on, long and tight, and both appear choked with sentiment. Finally, they separate and take their places. They converse in a strange extraterrestrial language, which is subtitled. The chauffeur hands over some papers. The guy extracts two other cards and hands those over. Mrs. Redgick is in front, moaning in agony, holding her swollen abdomen. Kay straightens up, quickly. Mrs. Redgick cries out again. Redgick gets out of the vehicle, concerned. Suddenly a tentacle lashes out from between Mrs. Redgick's legs, snaps once, and coils around the door jamb, clutching hold. Now a second tentacle lashes out, but this one coils around Jay's throat and pulls tight. Jay glances down at the being cooing and nestling on his torso. It regurgitates on him. Back in the vehicle, Jay wipes the last of the vomit off his attire while Kay starts up the automobile. Close on various supermarket tabloids as a hand flips through them. Kay is furiously inspecting through the tabs; Jay is standing behind him, somewhat embarrassed. Kay pulls a copy of the Weekly World News from the stand and gives the guy a dollar. He slaps the paper down on the bonnet in front of Jay, the sheets turned open to a headline in script so large one would think it reserved for the Second Coming."

A circular, windowed room is the location of Zed's office, elevated above the main floor of MIB headquarters. Across the desk from Zed sit Jay and Kay. On a wall behind Zed's desk are five video monitors, and on each monitor, another Man in Black is seen in different parts of the world, with the city name and a clock ticking in a corner of the image. While paperwork is gone through by Zed on his desk, he talks. Next to him, an important beep is made by his computer screen. The screen is looked over at by Zed. Out of the front of MIB headquarters come Jay and Kay. A cab is stepped out of by Rosenberg, the jewelry store owner, in the meat-packing district, still carrying the ornate box and his beloved cat. A moment later, the Orkin van is pulled to a stop across the street. Leshko's, a Russian diner, is entered by him. Into the tiny restaurant comes Rosenberg, squinting in the relative darkness. At a table in the middle, a man eating alone is seen by him—an enormous, dignified, yet profoundly strange-looking man in his mid-fifties. Carefully, Rosenberg walks over to the table, but a seat is not taken by him. Forward, he steps to face Rosenberg, who sets the ornate box on the table. Rosenberg and the Arquillian stare at each other for a long moment—and then each other is embraced by them. To it, the embrace has an odd, formal quality, like mafiosi coming to a sitdown. Long and hard, they hold on, and with emotion, both seem choked. Finally, they break apart and take their seats. In a bizarre alien tongue, they speak, which is subtitled. Some documents are handed over by the driver. Two other cards are dug out by the guy and handed over. In front, in pain, Mrs. Redgick is moaning, holding her swollen belly. Fast, Kay straightens up. Again, a scream is made by Mrs. Redgick. Out of the car steps Redgick, worried. Suddenly, from between Mrs. Redgick's legs, a tentacle whips out, the whip is cracked once, and the door post is wrapped around, grabbed hold of. Now a second tentacle whips out, around Jay's neck it wraps, and it pulls tight. Down at the creature, Jay looks, cooing and nestling on his chest. On him, it is vomited. Back in the car, the last of the puke is wiped off Jay’s suit while the car is started up by Kay. Close on various supermarket tabloids as they are flipped through by a hand. Through the tabs, Kay is searching furiously; behind him, Jay is standing, a little embarrassed. From the stand, a copy of the Weekly World News is pulled by Kay and a buck is given to the guy. The paper is smacked down on the hood in front of Jay, the pages turned open to a headline in typeface so large one would think it reserved for the Second Coming."

Behind Zed, five video monitors are mounted on the wall, each displaying a different Man in Black stationed in various global locations, with the city name and a clock ticking away in the corner of each screen. As Zed engages in conversation, he multitasks by shuffling through the paperwork laid out on his desk. His attention is momentarily diverted when his computer screen emits an important beep, prompting him to glance over. Transitioning to a new scene, Jay and Kay emerge from the entrance of MIB headquarters. Meanwhile, in the meat-packing district, Rosenberg, the jewelry store owner, alights from a cab, carefully holding both an ornate box and his cherished cat. Moments later, an Orkin van arrives and comes to a halt across the street. Rosenberg makes his way into Leshko's, a Russian diner, where he enters the dimly lit establishment, his eyes adjusting to the subdued lighting. In the center of the room, he spots a solitary man dining—a man of considerable size, dignity, and notably peculiar appearance, seemingly in his mid-fifties. Rosenberg approaches the table cautiously yet refrains from sitting down immediately. The other man rises to face Rosenberg, who places the ornate box on the table. There is a lingering moment where Rosenberg and the Arquillian exchange an intense gaze before they embrace each other. The embrace is formal, almost ritualistic, reminiscent of a mafioso sitdown, characterized by a long and emotionally charged grip. Both finally release and take their seats, beginning a conversation in an alien tongue, which is helpfully subtitled for clarity. Meanwhile, a driver hands over several documents, and another individual produces and hands over two additional cards. Out in front, Mrs. Redgick is doubled over in pain, clutching her swollen belly. Reacting swiftly, Kay straightens his posture, as Mrs. Redgick emits another anguished scream. Alarmed, Redgick exits the car in a flurry of concern. Suddenly, a tentacle emerges with startling speed from between Mrs. Redgick's legs, snapping like a whip before coiling around the doorpost to secure itself. Soon after, a second tentacle lashes out, this time encircling Jay's neck with a tight grip. Jay looks down to find a peculiar creature affectionately nestled against his chest, which promptly vomits on him. Back inside the vehicle, Jay endeavors to clean the remnants of the vomit from his suit as Kay turns the ignition, preparing to drive off. The scene cuts to a close-up of various supermarket tabloids being flipped through by an eager hand. Kay is intensely searching through the publications, with Jay standing slightly behind, wearing an expression of mild embarrassment. Kay eventually singles out a copy of the Weekly World News, offers a dollar to the vendor, and then emphatically slaps the newspaper on the hood of the car in front of Jay, the pages conspicuously open to a headline so prominently displayed it would seem appropriate for a proclamation as significant as the Second Coming."

Jay and Kay come out the front of MIB headquarters, the iconic building disguised as a nondescript office to avoid public scrutiny. \n\nRosenberg, the jewelry store owner known for his rare gem collection, steps out of a cab in the meat-packing district, historically known for its transformation into a trendy neighborhood, still carrying the ornate box and his beloved cat. A moment later, the Orkin van, often used by undercover agents as a disguise, pulls to a stop across the street. He heads into Leshko's, a Russian diner famed for its authentic borscht and cozy atmosphere. Rosenberg comes into the tiny restaurant, squinting in the relative darkness that contrasts with the bright lights of the street. At a table in the middle, he sees a man eating alone—an enormous, dignified, yet profoundly strange-looking man in his mid-fifties, an Arquillian, known for their advanced technology and peaceful demeanor. Rosenberg walks carefully over to the table, but does not sit down. He steps forward, to face Rosenberg, who sets the ornate box on the table.

Now a second tentacle whips out, but this one wraps around Jay's neck and pulls tight, reminding him of the unpredictable nature of alien biology. Jay looks down at the creature cooing and nestling on his chest, a newborn alien adjusting to its new environment. It vomits on him, a reflexive reaction common among its species. Back in the car, Jay wipes the last of the puke off his suit while Kay starts up the car, ready to drive off to their next assignment.\n\nClose on various supermarket tabloids as a hand flips through them.

He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Behind Zed are monitors showing other MIB agents worldwide. As Zed sorts through paperwork, his computer beeps. Outside, Jay and Kay leave the headquarters. Rosenberg, carrying a box and a cat, exits a cab in the meat-packing district and enters Leshko's diner. Inside, he meets a strange-looking man and places the box on the table. They share an emotional, formal embrace and converse in an alien language. Meanwhile, Mrs. Redgick screams from labor pains, and tentacles emerge, one wrapping around Jay. He holds a creature, which vomits on him. Later, Jay cleans his suit and Kay searches tabloids, eventually buying a copy of the Weekly World News, revealing a significant headline."
