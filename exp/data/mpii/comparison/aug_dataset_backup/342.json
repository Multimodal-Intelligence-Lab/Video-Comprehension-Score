          "description": "As Gandalf fixes his gaze on the approaching Orc army, now less than 50 yards from the city walls, he evaluates the imminent threat. Within the walls of Minas Tirith, mighty wooden catapults, meticulously prepared for such an assault, are launched with precision. The sound of their release echoes as \"Thwat! Thwat! Thwat!\" with these colossal machines sending their enormous rocks soaring high into the sky, clearing the battlements. The cinematic aerial perspective captures the dizzying trajectory of these huge boulders as they arc through the air, coming perilously close to the camera before gravity takes over and they plummet violently towards the Orcs below. With a resounding \"Crunch!,\" the boulders make contact, flattening row upon row of the Orc soldiers. Again, the catapults discharge another volley—\"Thwat!\" one hundred more rocks are released, followed immediately by \"Thwat!\" another hundred. The impact creates chaos among the Orc front ranks, causing widespread panic as the great boulders continue to land, wreaking havoc amongst them. Amidst the devastation, Gandalf strides purposefully along the battlements, observing as the massive stones continue to rain down on the besieging Orc army. In the midst of this chaos, Gothmog, showing no fear, glances upward at the ominous whistling sound of a boulder speeding toward him. With practiced calm and disdain, he sidesteps its deadly path and spits contemptuously at the passing rock. Suddenly, the atmosphere shifts as nine Nazgûl dive out of the dim sky, clad in their fearsome battle attire. With their piercing shrieks filling the air, the soldiers below react instinctively, throwing themselves down to avoid the menacing overhead flight. Panic overtakes the Gondorian soldiers as they frantically seek shelter, covering their ears to escape the chilling cries of the Nazgûl. Meanwhile, the wooden catapults within Minas Tirith's walls are once again fired, continuing their relentless assault. The Nazgûl, like vultures hunting doomed flesh, circle low over the city, plucking soldiers into the air and callously dropping them to their deaths hundreds of feet below. Towers and buildings crumble under the assault, causing chaos as soldiers, women, and children frantically dodge the falling masonry. Despite the turmoil, Gondorian soldiers valiantly launch a rain of arrows at the advancing towers and trolls, but it proves futile as the towers, with grim inevitability, reach the walls. Their doors crash down, unleashing hordes of Orcs directly onto the lower levels of the city. As the Orcs swarm from the tower, Gandalf realizes with alarm that Pippin has descended from the citadel. In a moment of shock, Pippin stands transfixed as a huge Orc leaps toward him. With swift precision, Gandalf intercepts the beast, striking it decisively with his staff, effortlessly cutting through the attacking foe. Behind Gandalf, another Orc readies itself to attack, but Pippin, acting on instinct, slashes with his sword, saving Gandalf. In response, Gandalf turns to Pippin, offering a smile even amidst the chaos. Out of the black, swirling battle smoke emerges an iron monstrosity—a massive wheeled battering ram, 60 feet high and 150 feet long, pushed by twenty formidable mountain trolls. This beast, with a massive iron head cast in the likeness of a snarling wolf, is Grond, the battering ram from hell. The orcs chant reverently as Grond inches closer and closer, causing Gandalf to blanch at the sight of this terror. Meanwhile, Gollum leads Frodo up a long ravine between columns of torn and weathered rock. Ahead looms a great grey wall, a massive expanse of mountain stone, and in the shadows at the base of this towering rock lies a tunnel. Frodo reacts with revulsion to the foul stench emanating from the black hole, while Smeagol nervously senses his plan beginning to unravel."

MIGHTY WOODEN CATAPULTS, ancient siege weapons designed to hurl projectiles over long distances, are positioned within the walls of MINAS TIRITH, the heavily fortified capital of Gondor, and are fired. THWAT! THWAT! THWAT! CATAPULTS send their great ROCKS, each weighing hundreds of pounds, high into the air, over the medieval-style BATTLEMENTS! Dizzying AERIAL SHOTS of huge BOULDERS, previously quarried from the White Mountains, fly up close to CAMERA then fall away towards the ORCS, the relentless soldiers of Sauron! CRUNCH!! BOULDERS flatten ORCS. THWAT!! 100 more ROCKS. THWAT!! another 100! With centuries of military tradition, the ORC FRONT RANKS are in disarray. As the GREAT BOULDERS land among them, the ORC start to PANIC. GANDALF, who wears robes of white signifying his high status among wizards, walks the BATTLEMENTS as the huge BOULDERS rain onto the ORC ARMY below. GOTHMOG, the leader of Sauron's armies known for his grotesque appearance, glances up at a WHISTLING SOUND -- a huge BOULDER hurtles towards him. He side-steps CALMLY out of the way, spitting on the BOULDER in CONTEMPT. SUDDENLY! 9 NAZGUL, the ghostly servants of the Dark Lord who once were kings of men, DIVE out of the DIM SKY, CLAD in BATTLE. SOLDIERS, seasoned warriors of Gondor, throw themselves down as the NAZGUL zoom overhead, emitting their PIERCING SHRIEKS that chill the bravest hearts! GONDORIAN SOLDIERS run for SHELTER in PANIC, covering their ears against the dread sound. MIGHTY WOODEN CATAPULTS, operated by skilled engineers, are positioned within the walls of MINAS TIRITH and are fired! The NAZGUL, known for their fearsome steeds, circle LOW over the CITY, like VULTURES seeking doomed men's flesh. SOLDIERS are plucked into the AIR by SHRIEKING NAZGUL and dropped to their DEATHS hundreds of FEET BELOW. TOWERS and BUILDINGS, standing for centuries, are DESTROYED. CHAOS ensues as SOLDIERS, WOMEN, and CHILDREN, the innocents caught in war, DODGE falling MASONRY. GONDORIAN SOLDIERS send a rain of arrows at the approaching TOWERS, siege engines used to breach walls, and TROLLS, the brutish creatures brought in as shock troops, but it is TOO LATE! The TOWERS reach the walls, their DOORS crashing down, releasing ORCS directly onto the LOWER LEVELS. As the ORC swarm from the TOWER, GANDALF realizes PIPPIN, one of the brave hobbits from the Shire, has come down from the CITADEL, the central stronghold of the city. PIPPIN looks on stunned, as a HUGE ORC, a creature bred for war, leaps towards him. GANDALF intercepts the BEAST, striking him with his STAFF, a symbol of his authority and power. GANDALF wields his STAFF, cutting through the attacking ORC with EASE. BEHIND him, an ORC prepares to cut down GANDALF. PIPPIN, gathering courage from his adventures, instinctively slashes his SWORD at him. GANDALF turns on PIPPIN, smiling despite himself at the young hobbit's bravery. Out of BLACK SWIRLING BATTLE SMOKE crawls an IRON MONSTER! A MASSIVE WHEELED BATTERING RAM, 60 FEET HIGH and 150 FEET LONG, pushed by 20 huge MOUNTAIN TROLLS, creatures known for their immense strength. It has a MASSIVE IRON HEAD, cast in the likeness of a SNARLING WOLF. Known as GROND, the BATTERING RAM FROM HELL, it is named after the weapon of the Dark Lord Morgoth. The Orc are chanting in a primal rhythm as the BEAST is wheeled closer and closer to the gate. GANDALF, blanching at the sight of this crawling machine of destruction, prepares to resist. Meanwhile, GOLLUM, once a hobbit-like creature twisted by the power of the One Ring, leads FRODO up a LONG RAVINE between COLUMNS of TORN and WEATHERED ROCK. AHEAD is a GREAT GREY WALL, a last huge mass of mountainstone, and in the SHADOWS at the base of the TOWERING ROCK lies a TUNNEL, a foreboding entrance into darkness.

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Gothmog sidesteps a boulder, showing contempt. Suddenly, nine Nazgul swoop down, their shrieks causing panic among Gondor soldiers, who run for shelter. The Nazgul wreak havoc, plucking soldiers into the air. Despite the soldiers' arrows, siege towers reach the walls, releasing Orcs onto the lower levels. Gandalf notices Pippin amidst the chaos and saves him from an Orc, with Pippin bravely striking another attacker. An enormous battering ram, Grond, approaches, pushed by mountain trolls. Meanwhile, Gollum guides Frodo through a ravine toward a tunnel, revealing a sinister plan."
