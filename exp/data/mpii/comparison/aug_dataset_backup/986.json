He removes his suit coat and gazes at Benjamin, who reclines in the drawer at Queenie's bedside. Tizzy sits on the bed, and Queenie glowers at him, lifts her brows, and gazes at him. She dons a white nightgown. Tizzy glances away, picks up his coat, and begins for the entrance. He halts and takes off his spectacles, placing them on the dresser. He tosses his black coat over the steel bed frame and sits near Queenie. Benjamin stirs in his improvised cradle, and Tizzy and Queenie put an arm around each other, their eyes meeting. She leans forward and kisses him softly on the lips, and he cradles her neck as they descend onto the bed while kissing. As a child, Benjamin resembles a bald, old gentleman.

Queenie's sparse basement room is entered by Tizzy, and she is looked at by him from the bed. His suit jacket is taken off by him, and he stares at Benjamin, who is lying in the drawer at Queenie's bedside. The bed is sat down on by Tizzy, and a glare is given by Queenie, her brows are raised, and she stares at him. A white nightdress is worn by her. Away from her, he looks, picks up his jacket, and starts for the door. A pause is made by him, and his spectacles are removed, putting them on the dresser. His black jacket is thrown over the steel bed frame by him, and close to Queenie, he sits. In his makeshift cot, Benjamin is stirred, and an arm is put around each other by Tizzy and Queenie, their eyes meeting. She leans forward and tenderly kisses him on the lips, and her neck is cupped by him as down onto the bed, they sink while kissing. As a child, a bald, old man is resembled by Benjamin. At a dining table, an ear trumpet is used by Benjamin, and round glasses are worn with wispy, white hair around the sides of his shiny, bald head. Back and forth along a porch, he pushes himself in his wheelchair, but a walking stick is wedged between Benjamin's wooden spokes by an elderly resident to stop him. The stick is retracted by the old man, and to the top of the front steps, Benjamin wheels himself to watch children playing in the street, with his wheels drawing closer to the top step. At Queenie's bedside, he lies and clasps her hand as the room is entered by Tizzy. The stairs are climbed by Tizzy, carrying frail, child-sized Benjamin in his arms. In his wheelchair in the empty lounge, sits Benjamin beside an elderly woman who sleeps in a chair in the corner of the dark, wood-paneled room. To the glass-paned double front doors he wheels himself, stands up, peers out, and against the glass, he breathes before beneath him, his legs suddenly give way, and he collapses. Up a flagpole outside in the rain, a flag is raised by a naked old man. A white-haired old woman with scarlet lipstick stands while Benjamin is bathed by Queenie with the bathroom door wide open, and his stiff, right leg is tried to be straightened. Next to a large marquee, Tizzy washes up. In a wicker-backed wheelchair, Benjamin dozes, but he is woken up by Queenie, who primly rises to her feet. She approaches women in white uniforms and nurses' hats while nearby stands the preacher in a suit. Beside Benjamin, her purse is placed by Queenie, who wears a pale orange dress, and something is whispered to the bespectacled preacher, who puts an arm around her and looks at the congregation. On Queenie's belly, a hand is put by the mustachioed preacher and into the arms of the nurses, she is pushed, gets back on her feet, and Benjamin's boater is removed by the preacher, staring at him."

He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day.

Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Tizzy removes his suit jacket, pauses at the door, and then sits close to Queenie, leading to a tender kiss. Benjamin, resembling a bald old man as a child, uses an ear trumpet at the dining table and moves in his wheelchair until an elder stops him. He watches children from the porch steps until collapsing. Queenie clasps his hand as Tizzy carries Benjamin up the stairs and places him in his wheelchair next to a sleeping elderly woman. In front of glass doors, Benjamin stands, peers out, and collapses. Elsewhere, Tizzy washes up, and Queenie, in a pale orange dress, whispers to a preacher during a service. She places her purse by Benjamin, and the preacher gestures towards the congregation."
