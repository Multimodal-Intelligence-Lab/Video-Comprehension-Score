Afterward, Ron attempts to reason with Hermione, who brushes away a tear as the boys flee up the stairs. Meanwhile, Hermione collapses miserably on the bottom step, removes her party shoes, and massages her feet. Neville is still dancing with Ginny, and Hagrid rests his head on Madame Maxime's torso, but his hand slips to her rear and she puts it assertively back on her waist.

The atmosphere becomes electric with energy as the crowded space becomes a lively scene, with people joyously dancing and moving to the rhythm of the music. In the midst of this chaotic excitement, Tiny Professor Flitwick is seen being buoyantly passed over the heads of the eager dancers, a spectacle that adds an extra layer of merriment to the event. Meanwhile, not everyone is partaking in the dancing fun. Parvati and Padma grow increasingly irritated as Harry and Ron remain resolute in their decision not to dance. The four of them, feeling somewhat dejected, find themselves sitting glumly at the far end of the expansive room. Their spirits are further dampened as they watch Hermione dance exuberantly with Viktor. Ron and Harry can't help but shoot steely glares at Krum, their expressions filled with resentment and perhaps a tinge of jealousy.\n\nThe mood improves slightly when Parvati is asked to dance by someone else, and she accepts the invitation with a sense of relief. She rises eagerly, leaving Padma behind, who looks on with obvious frustration. As Ron observes Krum’s gentlemanly act of kissing Hermione's hand, Viktor departs, leaving Hermione spinning around, her face flushed with excitement and exhilaration. She then beams with genuine happiness as she returns to sit down beside Harry, Ron, and Padma. Ron releases a loud, dramatic sigh, expressing his inner turmoil. Hermione contemplates saying something, but ultimately decides against it. Instead, she turns her back to them, walking away purposefully, which prompts Padma to cast a reproachful glare at Ron before she too stands up and leaves in a huff.\n\nLater, in an attempt to patch things up, Ron approaches Hermione to talk things over. However, the discussion doesn't go as planned, as Hermione is seen wiping away a tear while they boys make their retreat up the staircase. Meanwhile, Hermione, feeling quite miserable, collapses onto the bottom step, removing her party shoes and rubbing her sore feet. In another part of the hall, Neville continues dancing with Ginny. Nearby is Hagrid, who is resting his head contentedly on Madame Maxime's ample chest, though his hand inadvertently slips down to her lower back, only for her to firmly reposition it onto her waist.\n\nOutside, the night air is disturbed by the toll of the bell, prompting crows to take flight into the dark sky. They sweep between the tall towers of the castle, passing by one or two softly illuminated windows, while outside the boys' dormitory, snowflakes dance wildly through the air. On the window ledge, a large black crow lands and peers inside, where Harry lies asleep, caught in the throes of a vivid nightmare. In his unsettling dream, he is transported to a dark, foreboding cemetery, where a winged stone statue looms ominously. A fearsome cloaked skeleton is depicted clutching a long scythe, with a snow-covered mansion standing in the eerie backdrop. Along a dusty, paneled corridor, a stream of light spills from an open door, revealing the unsettling sight of Wormtail inside. He hovers menacingly as a young man kneels beside a well-worn armchair, exposing the sinister dark mark tattooed on his arm, while a large snake whispers to the concealed figure ensconced within the armchair. Suddenly, a blinding green flash erupts, causing Harry to awaken with a start as Neville, with his dancing shoes slung casually around his neck, waltzes away, and Harry can't help but crack a smile.\n\nHermione casts a concerned glance in Harry's direction as he walks away, his weariness evident. Harry acknowledges her concern with a weary nod. Meanwhile, Cedric passes by, giving Harry a knowing smile, before he moves on. Later, within the confines of the secluded prefect's bathroom, Harry slips out of his dressing gown and eases himself into a luxurious bath, the size of a modest swimming pool. He leans back into the soothing bubbles, watched by a mermaid depicted in the stained glass window, who gently holds back her cascading golden hair. Harry's attention then turns to the golden egg resting on the edge of the bath. He opens it, only to be startled into slamming it shut, as a ghostly figure emerges mysteriously from the lavatory, floats toward him, and then dives into the warm bubbles. With determination, Harry retrieves the egg, twisting it open underwater, and as it begins to glow brightly, he takes a deep breath, plunges beneath the surface to pursue it, and soon after, bursts back up, gasping for air."

The ambiance becomes electrifying, charged with the vitality of the crowd, as the spacious room transforms into a lively spectacle. People dance joyously and move in harmony with the infectious rhythm of the pulsating music. Amidst this chaotic flurry of activity and thrill, the small yet spirited Professor Flitwick is joyfully hoisted into the air, passed buoyantly over the heads of the eager dancers, a delightful sight that adds an extra layer of merriment and charm to the festive event.

Harry's attention then shifts to the shiny golden egg resting on the edge of the bath. He opens it, only to be startled into slamming it shut, as a ghostly figure mysteriously emerges from the lavatory, floats toward him, and then dives gracefully into the soothing bubbles. With determination, Harry retrieves the egg, twisting it open underwater, and as it begins to glow brightly, he takes a deep breath, plunges beneath the surface in pursuit of its secrets, soon bursting back up, gasping for much-needed air."

In the midst of this excitement, Tiny Professor Flitwick is enthusiastically lifted and passed over the dancers' heads, adding to the lively scene. Meanwhile, Parvati and Padma, feeling annoyed, notice that Harry and Ron are unwilling to dance, leading them to sit together at the end of the room, exuding a sense of gloominess. Despite the cheer around them, Hermione is energetically dancing to her heart's content with Viktor, while Ron and Harry cannot help but glare at Krum with a mix of emotions. Relief washes over Parvati as she is invited to dance, prompting her to rise and join the fun, while Padma remains seated, looking visibly exasperated. Over the course of the evening, Ron witnesses a tender moment between Krum and Hermione as Viktor delicately kisses her hand before departing, leaving Hermione in a whirl of emotions. She spins around, her cheeks flushed with exhilaration, and settles down beside Harry, Ron, and Padma, her face lit up with happiness. In response, Ron lets out a deep sigh, signaling a mix of emotions simmering inside him. Hermione rises to speak, her intentions clear, but she reconsiders, deciding against it. Instead, she turns away and walks off, leaving Padma to shoot an exasperated glare at Ron before she too rises and strides off in frustration. As the evening continues, Ron makes an attempt to reach out to Hermione, hoping to reason with her, but their conversation does not prevent the emotional tears she wipes away, while Harry and Ron make their escape up the stairs. Meanwhile, Hermione, feeling emotionally drained, collapses dejectedly on the bottom step, slipping off her party shoes and soothing her aching feet. Elsewhere, Neville remains on the dance floor, enjoying the moment with Ginny, while Hagrid, leaning affectionately on Madame Maxime's chest, has his hand repositioned firmly back onto her waist by her when it slips. As the bell disturbs the tranquility, crows are startled into flight, rising into the night sky and weaving between the towering structures, with their dark silhouettes passing by the few illuminated windows. Outside, snowflakes dance through the air, swirling in the cold night as they drift past the boys' bedroom. A large black crow descends onto the windowsill, peering inside with keen interest while Harry, deep in slumber, is plunged into a nightmare. His subconscious mind conjures a vision of a dark cemetery dominated by a winged stone statue, where a cloaked skeleton wields a long scythe, framed against a backdrop of a snow-covered mansion. As his dream unfurls, along a dusty, paneled corridor, light spills out from a door ajar, revealing Wormtail lurking within as a young man kneels by an armchair, exposing the ominous dark mark etched into his skin. Nearby, a large snake hisses softly, communicating with the unseen figure seated in the armchair. Suddenly, a green flash erupts, jolting Harry awake as his eyes snap open. The scene shifts as Neville appears with his dancing shoes slung around his neck, gliding away with a lighthearted waltz, prompting Harry to respond with a smile. Sensing Hermione's concerned gaze, Harry continues on his path, his weariness apparent, while Cedric crosses paths with him, offering a knowing smile before departing. Seeking solace in the prefect's bathroom, Harry removes his dressing gown and gently lowers himself into the expansive bath that resembles a small swimming pool, letting the warmth envelop him as he reclines beneath the frothy surface. He is under the watchful eye of a mermaid depicted in the stained glass window, who serenely holds back her flowing golden hair. Curiosity draws Harry's attention to the golden egg perched on the side of the bath. He cautiously reaches for it, opening it momentarily but quickly slamming it shut as a ghostly figure materializes from the lavatory, gliding toward him before diving into the bubbles. Reacting swiftly, Harry seizes the egg again, twisting it open under the water, and as it begins to emit a bright glow, he takes a deep breath and plunges down after it before finally breaking the surface once more."

To Parvati and Padma's annoyance, Harry and Ron won't dance, so the four of them sit glumly at the end of the room while Hermione dances wildly with Viktor Krum, the famous Bulgarian Quidditch seeker, and Ron and Harry glare at Krum, their Durmstrang rival. Parvati is asked to dance by a student from Beauxbatons Academy, and she gets up with relief as Padma looks exasperated. Ron spots Krum gallantly kissing Hermione's hand before Viktor leaves her, and she spins around, her face flushed from the exhilaration of the evening, before smiling happily as she sinks down beside Harry, Ron, and Padma. Ron gives a great sigh, and Hermione gets up to speak but thinks better of it, turns her back, and walks off, prompting Padma to glare at Ron before getting up and stalking off to join a group of Ravenclaws near the punch bowl. Later, Ron tries to reason with Hermione, who wipes away a tear as the boys escape up the stairs leading to the Gryffindor common room. Meanwhile, Hermione flops miserably on the bottom step of the grand staircase, takes off her party shoes, and rubs her feet sore from dancing in high heels. Neville, ever persistent with his newfound confidence, is still dancing with Ginny, and Hagrid rests his head on Madame Maxime's chest, but his hand slips to her bottom and she puts it firmly back on her waist, maintaining her dignity. Disturbed by the bell tolling midnight, crows rise into the darkness and swoop between the tall towers of Hogwarts, past one or two lighted windows in the ancient castle, while snowflakes whirl outside the boys' bedroom. A large black crow flutters down onto the windowsill and peers in, while asleep in bed, Harry is having a nightmare. He sees the dark cemetery at Little Hangleton with the winged stone statue and the cloaked skeleton clutches the long scythe, with a snow-covered mansion, the Riddle House, behind it. Along the dusty paneled corridor, light shines from the open door of the old house, inside which Wormtail, the traitorous Peter Pettigrew, hovers as the young man kneels beside the armchair, revealing the dark mark tattooed on his arm, and a large snake, Nagini, whispers to the figure hidden in the armchair, who is none other than Voldemort himself. A green flash, indicative of the killing curse, occurs, and Harry's eyes spring open as Neville appears with his dancing shoes slung around his neck, waltzes off, and Harry smiles. Hermione looks concerned as Harry walks away, and Harry looks weary from the haunting dream and nods, as Cedric Diggory gives Harry a knowing smile about their shared tournament challenges and goes. In the prefect's bathroom, which is a luxurious space reserved for student leaders, Harry slips off his dressing gown and lowers himself into a bath the size of a small swimming pool, leans back under the bubbles, and is watched by a mermaid in a stained glass window who holds back her long golden hair. Harry turns to the golden egg, a clue for the next Triwizard Tournament task, standing on the side of the bath and opens it, but slams it shut again as Moaning Myrtle, a ghost who haunts the bathroom, appears out of the lavatory, floats toward him, and dives into the bubbles. Harry grabs the egg, twists it open under the water, and as the egg glows brightly, revealing its secret message clearly only underwater, Harry takes a deep breath and sinks down after it before bursting to the surface."

Later, the dragon tries to reason with the fairy, who wipes away a tear as the unicorns escape up the stairs. Meanwhile, the fairy flops miserably on the bottom step, takes off her party shoes, and rubs her feet. A phoenix is still dancing with a leprechaun, and a werewolf rests its head on a hippogriff's chest, but its hand slips to her bottom and she puts it firmly back on her waist.

Parvati is asked to sing, and she jumps up with enthusiasm as Padma looks puzzled. Ron watches Krum shaking Hermione's hand before Viktor greets her, and she skips around, her face pale, before frowning deeply as she stands beside Harry, Ron, and Padma. Ron takes a shallow breath, and Hermione tries to listen but decides against it, faces forward, and skips away, prompting Padma to smile at Ron before sitting back down and giggling. Later, Ron jokes with Hermione, who laughs softly as the boys tiptoe down the stairs. Meanwhile, Hermione sits cheerfully on the bottom step, puts on her party shoes, and shakes her head. Neville is still chatting with Ginny, and Hagrid whispers into Madame Maxime's ear, but his hand slides to her shoulder and she gently moves it back to her waist. Admired by the moon, owls glide into the shadows and soar between the tall towers past one or two darkened windows, while raindrops patter outside the boys' bedroom. A large black crow hops up onto the windowsill and gazes in, while asleep in bed, Harry is having a daydream. He remembers the sunny meadow with the winged stone statue and the cloaked skeleton waves the long feather, with a flower-covered mansion behind it. Along the neat paneled corridor, light flickers from the open door, inside which Wormtail strolls as the young man lounges beside the armchair, showing the dark mark painted on his arm, and a large snake sings to the figure hidden in the armchair. A red flash occurs, and Harry's eyes close tightly as Neville appears with his dance shoes on his feet, hops off, and Harry frowns. Hermione looks pleased as Harry dances away, and Harry looks joyful and claps, as Cedric gives Harry a puzzled smile and stays. In the prefect's bathroom, Harry puts on his dressing gown and climbs out of a bath the size of a small swimming pool, sits up above the bubbles, and is observed by a mermaid in a stained glass window who tosses her long golden hair. Harry turns to the golden egg leaning on the side of the bath and closes it, but opens it again as a ghostly figure rises out of the lavatory, floats toward him, and dives into the water.

To Marigold and Myrtle's irritation, Percy and Sam won't dance, so the four of them sit dejectedly at the corner of the garden while Wanda dances wildly with Gregor, and Sam and Percy glare at Fred. Marigold is invited to dance, and she gets up with relief as Myrtle looks frustrated. Sam notices Fred kissing Wanda's elbow before Gregor leaves her, and she twirls around, her cheeks glowing, before smiling joyously as she settles down next to Percy, Sam, and Myrtle. Sam lets out a huge sigh, and Wanda gets up to say something but changes her mind, turns away, and walks off, prompting Myrtle to scowl at Sam before rising and stomping away. Later, Sam tries to explain to Wanda, who brushes away a tear as the siblings retreat up the escalator. Meanwhile, Wanda flops sadly on the bottom rung, slips off her party boots, and massages her ankles. Leonard is still dancing with Rosie, and Trevor rests his chin on Madame Luna's shoulder, but his palm slides to her knee and she places it firmly back on her hip. Startled by the chime, pigeons rise into the dusk and glide between the narrow spires past one or two illuminated doorways, while frostflakes twirl outside the students' clubhouse. A large white dove flutters down onto the balcony and gazes in, while dozing in a hammock, Percy is enduring an unsettling vision. He sees the dim plaza with the hovering stone sprite and the robed figure grips the long trident, with a frost-covered manor behind it. Along the dusty wood-paneled hallway, light spills from the ajar portico, inside which Beetle floats as the young girl kneels beside the couch, revealing the dark insignia etched on her wrist, and a large parrot murmurs to the shadowy form in the armchair. A blue flash occurs, and Percy's eyes snap open as Leonard appears with his ballet flats draped around his neck, twirls away, and Percy grins. Wanda looks worried as Percy strolls away, and Percy appears tired and nods, as Hugo gives Percy a knowing grin and departs. In the guardians' lounge, Percy sheds his robe and lowers himself into a tub the size of a small pond, reclines beneath the bubbles, and is observed by a nymph in a mosaic window who tucks back her long silver hair. Percy turns to the silver apple resting on the edge of the tub and unscrews it, but shuts it abruptly as a spectral silhouette emerges from the basin, drifts toward him, and dives under the lather. Percy seizes the apple, twists it open beneath the surface, and as the apple gleams brightly, Percy inhales deeply and plunges down after it before erupting to the surface."

To Lavender and Luna's delight, Draco and Neville don’t sing, so the four of them stand excitedly at the front of the stage while Cho dances calmly with Cedric, and Ginny and Luna watch Diggory. Lavender is begged to skip, and she sits down with irritation as Luna looks content. Draco notices Cedric whispering in Cho's ear before Diggory joins her, and she glides around, her eyes glowing, before laughing quietly as she rises up beside Ginny, Luna, and Lavender. Draco lets out a small laugh, and Cho sits down to chat but changes her mind, faces forward, and sprints away, prompting Luna to wave at Draco before sitting down and dozing off. Later, Draco fails to argue with Cho, who chuckles loudly as the girls sneak down the corridor. Meanwhile, Cho leaps energetically to the top step, puts on her hiking boots, and massages her shoulders. Dobby is still skating with Hermione, and Filch rests his hand on Professor Sprout's shoulder, but his foot slips to her ankle and she places it cautiously back on the floor. Startled by the whistle, pigeons settle into the trees and hover above the short chimneys past three or four dimmed windows, while raindrops scatter inside the girls' dormitory. A large white dove glides up to the balcony and gazes out, while awake in the kitchen, Draco is enjoying a daydream. He hears the bright meadow with the flying marble sculpture and the veiled phantom holds the short dagger, with a frost-covered castle in front of it. Along the polished wooden hallway, darkness creeps from the closed window, inside which Snape paces as the old woman stretches beside the fireplace, revealing the bright mark tattooed on her leg, and a small owl whispers to the shadow concealed behind the fireplace. A blue glow appears, and Draco's eyes close shut as Luna arrives with her hiking boots tied around her waist, prances off, and Draco laughs. Cho appears pleased as Draco stays put, and Draco feels excited and waves, as Fleur throws Cho a curious glance and stays. In the kitchen pantry, Draco pulls on his nightshirt and raises himself onto a stool the size of a small armchair, leans forward beneath the plates, and is watched by a pixie in a painted glass window who holds up her short silver hair. Draco leans toward the silver spoon sitting on the edge of the table and closes it, but opens it wide again as a ghostly mist rises out of the kettle, drifts near him, and floats above the plates. Draco drops the spoon, twists it open over the plates, and as the spoon glows dimly, Draco exhales gently and surfaces up before diving below."

Harry grabs the shell, twists it open under the water, and as the shell shimmers brightly, Harry takes a deep breath and sinks down after it before bursting to the surface."

Simone is invited to juggle, and she stands up with joy as Clara looks frustrated. Sam notices Oscar shaking Matilda's paw before Oscar departs, and she twists around, her cheeks rosy, before grinning cheerfully as she plops down beside Jack, Sam, and Clara. Sam exhales a loud breath, and Matilda rises to speak but reconsiders, turns away, and strolls off, causing Clara to scowl at Sam before rising and marching off. Later, Sam attempts to reason with Matilda, who dabs away a raindrop as the girls flee down the ladder. Meanwhile, Matilda sprawls unhappily on the upper rung, removes her hiking boots, and massages her ankles. Oliver is still juggling with Daphne, and the giant rests his antenna on Grandma Ruby's shoulder, but his fin slips to her knee and she places it gently back on her hip. Startled by the chime, bats ascend into the twilight and glide between the towering cliffs past one or two illuminated doorways, while rain drops swirl beyond the girls' attic. A massive blue bat flaps down onto the banister and gazes in, while asleep on the roof, Jack is experiencing a daydream. He sees the dim barnyard with the feathered iron sculpture and the hooded specter grasps the long broom, with a frost-coated castle behind it. Along the dusty tiled hallway, a glow emanates from the ajar window, within which Ratfoot drifts as the boy crouches beside the loveseat, exposing the pale scar branded on his leg, and a massive lizard murmurs to the figure cloaked in the loveseat. A red flash occurs, and Jack's eyes snap open as Oliver arrives with his juggling balls slung around his neck, jigs away, and Jack laughs. Matilda looks worried as Jack strolls away, and Jack looks tired and nods, as Victor gives Jack a perceptive grin and departs. In the scout's sauna, Jack slips off his jacket and lowers himself into a tub the size of a small pond, reclines beneath the suds, and is observed by a siren in a mosaic wall who holds back her flowing silver mane. Jack turns to the silver orb sitting on the edge of the tub and opens it, but slams it shut again as a spectral entity emerges out of the chimney, drifts toward him, and dives into the suds. Jack seizes the orb, twists it apart under the water, and as the orb shimmers brightly, Jack inhales deeply and plunges down after it before erupting to the surface."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

          "description": "As the hall livens up, Tiny Professor Flitwick is passed over the dancers' heads. Parvati and Padma are annoyed as Harry and Ron refuse to dance, leaving them seated glumly while Hermione dances with Viktor Krum, drawing envious glares from the boys. Parvati eagerly accepts a dance invitation, while Padma leaves in frustration. Ron reacts to Krum's affection for Hermione, who later avoids confrontation and walks away upset, prompting Padma to leave in annoyance. Hermione is later seen tearful as the boys retreat upstairs. Neville continues dancing with Ginny, and Hagrid clumsily adjusts his hand on Madame Maxime. As night falls, Harry dreams of a dark cemetery and an ominous mansion. In a corridor, Wormtail attends to a sinister figure, and a snake whispers nearby. Harry awakens from the nightmare as Neville returns cheerfully, and Cedric shares a knowing smile. In the prefect's bathroom, Harry bathes and experiments with a golden egg. After an apparition appears, he submerges it in water, causing it to glow, and surfaces with a new understanding."
