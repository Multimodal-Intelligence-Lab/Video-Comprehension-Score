          "description": "The panorama dims to ebony. In the yard, precipitation rebounds off the deserted supper table where droplets splash into half-vacant goblets of ivory vino. A taper blaze wavers in a battle to remain ignited. Emily and Tim recline in each other’s embrace in bed. They fondle each other’s visages. She gazes into his eyes. Tim caresses her arm as he gazes into her affectionate eyes. Emily fiddles delicately with his auricle, then lowers her gaze and lightly brushes his lips with her fingertips. Emily gazes at him sincerely. Emily appears weepy and places her lips on his shoulder. A large droplet rolls down Emily's nose. Tim clutches her to him. She buries her visage in his torso. They smooch. The beat in Emily's neck leaps rhythmically. Amber light washes over her visage as she reclines slumbering serenely. Tim reclines beside Emily, observing her intently. Emily's hand reposes palm-up on the vacant cushion beside her. She twitches faintly but doesn't awaken. The cicatrix on the superior part of her left bosom exhibits just above the sheet. Tim, now attired in his denim, stands at her bedside and tugs on his polo shirt. Looking disturbed, he gazes down at Emily. Tim exits the domicile by the French windows. He departs slowly across the dim yard in the soaking precipitation, then trots to the picket barrier. He leaps over it. Tim sprints frantically down a thoroughfare of boutiques, some of which possess neon-illuminated signs. Drenched to the skin, Tim erupts into a medical center passageway and strides down it to the nurses' desk. The nurse regards Tim cautiously. Looking distraught and perturbed, Tim turns away from the nurses' desk, strides a little and sits down on a chair beside a water cooler. He gazes at the ground. Tim looks up when Dr. Briar enters the passageway and walks to meet her. She appears alarmed. Tim raises a hand helplessly, marches back along the passageway and pushes through the double doors. The medical center's principal doors slide open. Tim walks out into the night. The precipitation cascades as a mournful Tim strides away from the medical center. As he walks, he takes his mobile device from his denim pocket and taps in a numeral. Dan and Michelle lie slumbering in each other’s embrace. Dan reaches for the mobile device on his bedside bureau. Tim rings off. Dan, now sitting up in bed, remains with the mobile device to his ear and drops his head. Tim returns to his hostel chamber and pauses in the entryway. His countenance is slightly glazed, as if consumed by his own melancholic musings. He turns and gazes outside, then closes the door. Tim sits on the brink of his bed, breathing heavily. Regaining his composure slightly, Tim reaches for the mobile device on his bedside bureau and makes a call."

A candle flame is flickered in a struggle to stay alight. Emily and Tim are lying in each other's arms in bed. Each other's faces are caressed by them. His eyes are stared into by her. Her arm is stroked by Tim as he stares into her adoring eyes. His ear is played with gently by Emily, then her eyes are lowered and his lips are touched lightly with her fingertips. He is stared at earnestly by Emily. Looking tearful, Emily puts her lips to his shoulder. Down Emily's nose rolls a large tear. She is hugged to him by Tim. Her face is buried in his chest by her. A kiss is shared by them. The pulse in Emily's neck is jumped rhythmically. Her face is bathed in golden light as she lies sleeping peacefully. Beside Emily, Tim lies, watching her closely. On the empty pillow beside her, her hand rests palm-up. A slight twitch is made by her, but she doesn't wake. Just above the sheet, the scar on the upper part of her left breast is shown. At her bedside, now dressed in his jeans, Tim stands and pulls on his polo shirt. Looking troubled, Emily is stared down at by him. By the French windows, the house is left by Tim. The dark garden is set off slowly across by him in the pouring rain, then he jogs to the picket fence. The fence is jumped over by him. Down a street of shops, some of which have neon-lit signs, Tim runs frantically. Soaked to the skin, a hospital corridor is burst into by Tim, and it is stridden down by him to the nurses' station. Tim is eyed warily by the nurse. Looking fraught and agitated, away from the nurses' station, Tim turns, paces a little and a chair beside a water cooler is sat down on by him. The floor is stared at by him. Tim looks up when Dr. Briar enters the corridor and is walked to meet by him. Alarmed, she looks. Helplessly, a hand is raised by Tim; back along the corridor, he marches and the double doors are pushed through by him. The hospital's main doors are slid open. Into the night, Tim walks out. As a grief-stricken Tim strides away from the hospital, the rain cascades. As he walks, his mobile phone is taken from his jeans' pocket by him, and a number is tapped in. In each other's arms, Dan and Michelle are lying asleep. The phone on his bedside cabinet is reached for by Dan. Off, Tim rings. Now sitting up in bed, with the phone to his ear, Dan remains and his head is dropped. Tim returns to his motel room and the doorway is paused in by him. Slightly glazed, as if consumed by his own sad thoughts, his expression is. The outside is turned and stared at by him, then the door is closed. On the edge of his bed, Tim sits, panting. Slightly regaining his composure, the phone on his bedside cabinet is reached for by Tim and a call is made."

In the sprawling garden, rain falls relentlessly, its droplets bouncing playfully off the surface of an abandoned dinner table. These raindrops plop with a soft, rhythmic sound into half-empty glasses that still contain remnants of white wine. Nearby, a solitary candle flickers valiantly, its small flame struggling to hold its ground against the damp air. Inside, Emily and Tim lie intertwined in one another's arms in bed. They tenderly caress each other's faces, exchanging silent gestures of affection. She gazes deeply into his eyes, full of emotion. Meanwhile, Tim gently strokes her arm while he is captivated by her adoring eyes. Emily, with a gentle touch, plays with his ear, then lowers her gaze and delicately places her fingertips on his lips. Her earnest stare conveys a depth of feeling. As she becomes tearful, she presses her lips softly to his shoulder. A large tear forms and rolls slowly down Emily's nose. Tim pulls her closer, holding her tightly to him. She buries her face against his chest, seeking comfort in his presence. They share a kiss, and the pulse in Emily's neck thrums with a lively rhythm. Golden light cascades over her face as she lies in peaceful slumber. Tim remains beside her, watching her intently. Emily’s hand rests with its palm upward on the otherwise empty pillow beside her. She experiences a slight twitch but remains asleep. A scar is visible just above the sheet, on the upper part of her left breast. Tim, now clad in jeans, stands by her bedside and pulls on his polo shirt. His eyes, filled with trouble, gaze down at Emily. Tim exits the house through the French windows. He moves slowly at first across the dark, rain-drenched garden, and then breaks into a jog toward the picket fence. He leaps over it with determination. Tim runs frantically down a street lined with shops, some of which have neon-lit signs casting an eerie glow. Drenched to the skin, Tim bursts into the sterile environment of a hospital corridor and strides purposefully down it, heading straight for the nurses' station. The nurse gives Tim a wary, cautious look. Appearing fraught and agitated, Tim turns away from the station, paces back and forth, and finally settles into a chair beside the water cooler. His eyes fixate on the floor. When Dr. Briar enters the corridor, Tim looks up and walks swiftly to meet her. Her expression is one of alarm. Tim raises a hand in helplessness, then marches back down the corridor and forcefully pushes through the double doors. The hospital's main doors slide open with a mechanical hum. Tim steps out into the night, where the rain cascades down, and strides away from the hospital, his grief evident in every step. As he walks, he extracts his mobile phone from the pocket of his jeans and taps in a familiar number. Dan and Michelle, meanwhile, lie asleep in each other's arms. Dan reaches out for the phone on his bedside cabinet. Tim, having rung off, leaves Dan, now sitting up in bed, with the phone to his ear, his head dropping with the weight of the news. Tim finally returns to his modest motel room and pauses for a moment in the doorway, his expression slightly glazed, as if lost in his own sorrowful thoughts. He turns to gaze outside, and then closes the door with resignation. Sitting on the edge of his bed, he pants slightly, working to regain his composure.

In the expansive, sprawling garden, the rain falls persistently, its droplets bouncing energetically off the surface of an unattended dinner table. These raindrops create a soft, rhythmic symphony as they gently plop into half-empty glasses that still cling to the remnants of white wine. Nearby, a solitary candle bravely flickers on, its diminutive flame valiantly struggling to remain alight against the oppressive, damp air. Inside, Emily and Tim are nestled together, intertwined in one another’s arms upon the bed. Their tender caresses intertwine with silent gestures of affection as they lovingly touch each other's faces. Emily gazes deeply into Tim's eyes, her gaze filled with heartfelt emotion. Meanwhile, Tim gently caresses her arm, mesmerized by her loving, adoring eyes. With gentle fingers, Emily plays with his ear, and then her gaze shifts down as she delicately places her fingertips upon his lips. Her earnest, sincere stare communicates a profound depth of feeling. As tears well up, she presses her lips softly upon his shoulder. A significant tear forms, rolling slowly and deliberately down Emily's nose. Tim draws her in closer, holding her tightly against him. She nestles her face against his chest, seeking solace and comfort in his presence. They share a tender kiss, and the rhythm of Emily's pulse beats with life in her neck. Golden light spills over her face as she lies in a peaceful, serene slumber. Tim remains by her side, watching her intently with an unwavering gaze. Emily’s hand rests palm-up on the otherwise empty pillow beside her. A slight twitch runs through her, yet she remains fast asleep. A scar is faintly visible, just above the sheet, on the upper part of her left breast. Tim, now wearing jeans, stands by her bedside and pulls on his polo shirt. His troubled eyes are filled with concern as he gazes down at Emily. Tim exits through the French windows of the house. Initially, he moves slowly across the dark, rain-soaked garden before breaking into a determined jog toward the picket fence, which he leaps over with determination. Tim rushes frantically down a street lined with shops, some adorned with neon-lit signs casting an eerie, otherworldly glow. Soaked to the bone, Tim bursts into the sterile environment of a hospital corridor and strides purposefully down its length, making his way directly to the nurses' station. The nurse regards Tim with a wary, cautious look, her eyes reflecting concern. Appearing fraught and deeply agitated, Tim turns away from the station, pacing back and forth before finally settling into a chair positioned next to the water cooler. His eyes fixate on the floor, lost in thought. When Dr. Briar enters the corridor, Tim looks up and walks swiftly to meet her. Her expression is one of alarm and concern. Tim raises a hand in a gesture of helplessness, then resolutely marches back down the corridor, pushing forcefully through the double doors. The hospital's main doors open with a mechanical hum. Tim steps out into the night, where the relentless rain cascades down, and strides away from the hospital, each step heavy with evident grief. As he walks, he extracts his mobile phone from the pocket of his jeans and taps in a familiar number. Meanwhile, Dan and Michelle lie asleep, embraced in each other's arms. Dan reaches out for the phone resting on his bedside cabinet. After Tim has rung off, Dan, now sitting upright in bed, remains with the phone pressed to his ear, his head heavy and bowed under the weight of the news. Tim finally returns to his modest motel room, pausing for a moment in the doorway, his expression slightly glazed, as if lost deep within his own sorrowful thoughts. He turns to cast a lingering gaze outside before closing the door with a sense of resignation. Sitting on the edge of his bed, he pants slightly, working to regain his composure. Slowly, Tim reaches for the phone on his bedside cabinet and initiates a call."

In the garden, raindrops tumble down from the sky, hitting the surface of the abandoned dinner table with a rhythmic splatter, where the droplets accumulate and then descend into half-empty glasses that still contain traces of white wine. Nearby, a candle's flame flickers and dances unpredictably as it fights valiantly against the encroaching elements to remain lit. Inside, Emily and Tim are intimately nestled in each other's embrace in bed, their arms comfortably encircling one another. Emily gently caresses Tim's face, feeling the contours beneath her fingertips as she holds his gaze with unwavering intensity. In return, Tim tenderly runs his hand up and down Emily's arm, maintaining eye contact, absorbed by the adoration reflected in her eyes. Emily lightly plays with his ear, twirling it gently before lowering her eyes and allowing her fingers to brush delicately against his lips. Her expression becomes earnest as she continues to gaze at him, her eyes welling up with unshed tears. She leans forward, pressing her lips softly to his shoulder, and as she does so, a large tear escapes and slowly trails down from her nose. In response, Tim tightens his embrace, drawing her nearer, and she buries her face against his chest to seek comfort. Their lips meet in a tender kiss, and the rhythmic pulse in Emily's neck is visible, synchronizing with the golden light that bathes her serene, sleeping face. Tim lies beside her, his gaze fixated on her peaceful appearance. Emily's hand rests palm-up on the empty pillow next to her, twitching subtly in her slumber, yet she remains asleep. The scar on the upper part of her left breast peeks slightly above the sheet, a hint of its presence. Tim, now dressed in jeans, stands beside her and slips on his polo shirt, his expression clouded with worry as he glances down at Emily. Exiting the room, he leaves the house through the French windows, pausing momentarily as the pouring rain greets him. He begins to move slowly through the dark garden, the rain drenching him further, and transitions to a jog as he approaches the picket fence, vaulting over it with determination. In the next instant, Tim is sprinting frantically along a street lined with shops, some adorned with neon-lit signs casting eerie glows. Soaked entirely through to his skin, he bursts into the sterile atmosphere of a hospital corridor and strides with purpose toward the nurses' station, where he is met with a wary glance from a nurse. Agitation seeps through his demeanor as Tim abruptly turns away from the station, pacing in small circles before settling into a chair beside a water cooler, where he drops his gaze to the floor in contemplation. His attention shifts upwards as Dr. Briar enters the corridor, prompting him to intercept her path. She appears alarmed upon seeing him, and Tim, in a gesture of helplessness, raises his hand before decisively marching back down the corridor and pushing his way through the swinging double doors. The hospital's main doors slide open effortlessly to permit Tim's exit into the night. The rain continues to cascade around him as he strides away, a shroud of grief enveloping his movements. As he walks, he retrieves his mobile phone from his jeans' pocket, methodically tapping in a number. Elsewhere, Dan and Michelle are entangled in sleep, their arms wrapped around each other in comfort, when Dan reaches over to the bedside cabinet to pick up the ringing phone. Before he can respond, Tim ends the call abruptly. Dan, now sitting up in bed, remains with the phone pressed to his ear, his head bowed contemplatively. Tim eventually returns to his motel room, pausing at the threshold with a slightly glazed expression, as if lost in a haze of sorrowful reflections. He turns his eyes toward the outside world once more before decisively closing the door. He then perches on the edge of his bed, breathing heavily but evenly as he attempts to regain his composure. Calming slightly, he extends a hand to the phone resting on his own bedside cabinet and proceeds to make another call."

          "description": "The scene fades to black. In the garden, a place known for its vibrant roses and well-trimmed hedges, rain bounces off the abandoned dinner table where droplets plop into half-empty glasses of white wine, a vintage from a renowned vineyard in Napa Valley. A candle flame, sheltered under an ornate glass cloche, flickers in a struggle to stay alight. Emily and Tim lie in each other's arms in bed, a sanctuary they created together in their downtown apartment. They caress each other's faces, finding solace in the quiet intimacy they share. She stares into his eyes, which reflect the dim glow of the streetlights outside. Tim strokes her arm as he stares into her adoring eyes, a mirror of his own affection. Emily plays gently with his ear, then lowers her eyes and lightly touches his lips with her fingertips, a gesture they often shared during their long weekend getaways. Emily stares at him earnestly, her emotions laid bare. Emily looks tearful and puts her lips to his shoulder, a place she often sought comfort. A large tear rolls down Emily's nose, glistening like a diamond. Tim hugs her to him, feeling her warm breath against his skin. She buries her face in his chest, seeking the heartbeat that calms her. They kiss, a bittersweet farewell in the stillness of night. The pulse in Emily's neck jumps rhythmically, a sign of her deep emotional turmoil. Golden light, cast by the antique lamp on their nightstand, bathes her face as she lies sleeping peacefully. Tim lies beside Emily, watching her closely, as if memorizing every detail. Emily's hand rests palm-up on the empty pillow beside her, a silent testament to their shared dreams. She twitches slightly but doesn't wake, lost in dreams of a hopeful future. The scar on the upper part of her left breast, a memory of past battles, shows just above the sheet. Tim, now dressed in his jeans, stands at her bedside and pulls on his polo shirt, a familiar routine disrupted by his troubled thoughts. Looking troubled, he stares down at Emily, contemplating the uncertain path ahead. Tim leaves the house by the French windows, which overlook the lush, rain-soaked garden. He sets off slowly across the dark garden in the pouring rain, then jogs to the picket fence, a boundary they once painted together. He jumps over it with practiced ease. Tim runs frantically down a street of shops, some of which have neon-lit signs advertising late-night diners and convenience stores. Soaked to the skin, Tim bursts into a hospital corridor, where the sterile environment contrasts sharply with the chaos in his heart, and strides down it to the nurses' station. The nurse eyes Tim warily, accustomed to seeing distress in the late hours. Looking fraught and agitated, Tim turns away from the nurses' station, paces a little and sits down on a chair beside a water cooler, the hum of which fills the quiet hallway. He stares at the floor, his mind racing with unresolved fears. Tim looks up when Dr. Briar enters the corridor, a physician known for her empathy and expertise, and walks to meet her. She looks alarmed, sensing the gravity of the situation. Tim raises a hand helplessly, unable to voice his turmoil, and marches back along the corridor, pushing through the double doors to the waiting area. The hospital's main doors slide open with a whisper. Tim walks out into the night, where the rain cascades down, matching his grief-stricken demeanor. As he walks, he takes his mobile phone from his jeans' pocket and taps in a number, a lifeline to his closest friend. Dan and Michelle lie asleep in each other's arms, finding comfort in each other's presence. Dan reaches for the phone on his bedside cabinet, a device that often brings both news and distress. Tim rings off, unable to bring himself to speak. Dan, now sitting up in bed, remains with the phone to his ear and drops his head, sensing the unspoken crisis. Tim returns to his motel room, an impersonal space he rented during this difficult time, and pauses in the doorway. His expression is slightly glazed, as if consumed by his own sad thoughts, reflecting on the choices that led him here. He turns and stares outside, observing the distant city lights blurred by rain, then closes the door, seeking solitude. Tim sits on the edge of his bed, panting, the weight of the night pressing down on him. Regaining his composure slightly, Tim reaches for the phone on his bedside cabinet, ready to make a call that might bring some clarity or comfort."

Zoe's elbow rests fist-down on the full suitcase beside her. She flutters slightly but doesn't dance. The tattoo on the lower part of her right foot appears just beneath the blanket. Sam, now wearing his shorts, sits on her windowsill and pushes on his hoodie. Looking amused, he glances up at Zoe. Sam enters the circus through the barn doors. He zooms swiftly across the bright stadium in the gentle wind, then strolls to the stone wall. He slides under it. Sam crawls gleefully up a desert of trees, many of which contain candlelit lanterns. Dry to the bone, Sam whispers into a school library and tiptoes through it to the janitors' closet. The janitor eyes Sam eagerly. Looking calm and collected, Sam turns toward the janitors' closet, saunters a little, and stands down on a rug beside a soda machine. He looks at the ceiling. Sam gazes down when Mrs. Fern exits the library and glides to greet him. She looks asleep. Sam offers a foot happily, skips quietly along the library and swims through the swinging gate. The school's side gates swing inward. Sam dances in under the sun. The snow tumbles as an exhilarated Sam tiptoes toward the school. As he skips, he retrieves his calculator from his hoodie’s pouch and dials a letter. Alex and Laura sit running in each other's hats. Alex signals for the chalk on his overhead shelf. Sam signs off. Alex, now standing up in class, continues with the chalk to his knee and lifts his arms. Sam enters into his library suite and rests on the bookshelf. His expression is slightly focused, as if immersed in his own cheerful dreams. He drops and gazes inside, then opens the window. Sam stands on the top of his bookshelf, giggling. Losing his excitement slightly, Sam signals for the chalk on his headboard and writes an essay."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Tim, troubled, dresses and leaves Emily sleeping peacefully. He crosses the garden in the rain, jumping the fence and running through the streets until reaching a hospital. Frantic, he enters and sits near a water cooler, visibly distressed. Dr. Briar arrives, prompting Tim to leave, overwhelmed with grief. Outside, he walks in the rain, calls Dan, who is with Michelle, but hangs up, leaving Dan concerned. Tim returns to his motel, absorbed in melancholy thoughts. Gaining some composure, he makes another call from his room."
