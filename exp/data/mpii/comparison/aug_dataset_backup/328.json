This figure, snugly situated in the grass, eventually rises and faces the camera directly, revealing a strikingly handsome young hobbit characterized by dark, curly hair and deep, enchanting blue eyes. This is none other than Frodo Baggins, his eyes sparkling with a flicker of excitement and an inquisitive spirit. He tosses aside the lengthy grass stem he had been idly chewing, and in an instant, he dashes off with a sudden surge of energy.\n\nMeanwhile, a cart is heard rattling along a leafy lane. At the helm is a hunched figure clad in a grey garment, steering the cart. The shambling old pony, tasked with pulling the cart, emits a snort and rears up slightly. This delightful scene is set in the Shire, precisely 60 years later, as the camera pans to reveal another figure reclining beneath the dappled sunlight that filters through the branches of an ancient tree. Out of nowhere, Frodo emerges on a bank above the cart. They share a momentary glance before both burst into hearty laughter. Frodo's face erupts into a wide, beaming smile as he leaps onto the cart's front seat with boundless enthusiasm.\n\nThe cart trundles past a field of lupins being meticulously tended by Gandalf, who casts a glance at Frodo, his eye twinkling with warmth and amusement.

Odo Proudfoot turns his gaze upward as the cart proceeds by, his expression marked by deep suspicion.\n\nAs the cart makes its rattling entrance into the quaint village of Hobbiton, a rustic settlement nestled among rolling green hills and ancient, towering trees, excited children pursue the cart with cheerful glee. Gandalf, however, pays no heed to the children's cries. As they stand disappointed, watching Gandalf fade away up the lane, colorful balls of brightness suddenly spring forth from the cart, fizzing joyously above the delighted children's heads. Gandalf, pleased with his clever jest, smiles to himself, and even Odo Proudfoot cannot resist a soft chuckle.\n\nFrodo ascends within the cart as Gandalf brings the horse to a halt.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
