As he moves, he adopts a slow, deliberate stride, his shoulders drooping under an unseen weight, and his hands burrowed deep in his pockets. His voice, detached yet laden with emotion, resonates over the scene as he meanders across the street, his focus inward as traffic intermittently whooshes past him. Crossing to the opposite sidewalk, he becomes momentarily entangled with a heavyset man, brushing against him and eliciting a hostile glare that Mickey, lost in thought, fails to register. In a jarring transition, the pitch-black bedroom is suddenly bathed in light as Mickey, startled awake in his bed by unseen thoughts, fumbles to turn on the lamp beside him. Burdened by his ongoing reflections, he rises from the bed, straightens his disheveled pants, and proceeds out of his loft bedroom into a shadowy upper hallway. Descending the spiral staircase, he steps into the dimly lit living room, only for the film to transition to a flashback steeped in tension. Dr. Smith is stationed behind his desk, facing the camera, a wall of periodicals forming a backdrop behind him. The camera shifts to capture Dr. Smith's perspective, revealing Hannah and Mickey seated opposite him, their expressions mirrored in shock. The camera returns focus to the dazed pair, their eyes tracking Dr. Smith as he moves back to settle into his high-backed leather chair. As he begins to speak, the camera closes in on his face, amplifying the gravity of his words. Outside, on a bustling sidewalk, Mickey and Hannah walk amidst the crowd, disconnected from the world around them; Hannah weeps openly, clutching a tissue to her face. They continue on, oblivious to passersby, until they fade from view, and the scene transitions to a brightly illuminated and inviting living room, brimming with pillows and lush greenery. Seated comfortably on the couch, Norman and his wife, Carol, sip coffee in the filtered sunlight. Mickey emerges from the kitchen, balancing a partially devoured chocolate cake on a serving plate, as warm sunlight streams through the windows in his path. Briefly visible in the background, Hannah busies herself brewing more coffee. Mickey deposits the cake on the coffee table, already a mosaic of plants, plates, and a bamboo tray organized with utensils and napkins. With a sigh, he collapses onto a nearby couch, weary fingers massaging his forehead. Norman, with a chuckle, watches as Mickey begins to pace, his thoughts turbulent. Hannah, hands pressed near her face, shares a glance with Carol before letting out a sigh of her own. Mickey halts his pacing momentarily, gathering his thoughts, then resumes his restless pacing behind the couch. Norman and Carol maintain a silence steeped in anticipation as Mickey once again pauses, leaning over the couch back behind Norman, hands rubbing his knees before he reclines against the wall. Reacting, Norman and Carol exchange a silent conversation through glances, Carol offering a nervous chuckle as Norman sips his coffee. Hannah reaches for the cake, and as Carol and Norman share another glance, their reactions seethe with unspoken understanding amidst the shared turmoil."

He strides slowly, his shoulders slouched from the weight of concern, his hands in his pockets, and his voice is heard over the screen as he crosses the street in this bustling Manhattan neighborhood, continuing his self-absorbed walk on the opposite side while occasional traffic, typical of New York's busy avenues, goes by. Mickey brushes against a heavyset man who gives him a nasty look, but Mickey is so dazed, he doesn't even notice. The dark bedroom in his loft, known for its industrial style and high ceilings, is abruptly lit as Mickey, lying in his bed, wakes up with a start and turns on his night-table lamp. Mickey, still ruminating over the news from the doctor, stands up, fixes his pants, and walks out of his bedroom loft into a dark upper hallway that echoes with the creaks of its wooden floorboards. He walks down a spiral staircase, a design element popular in urban apartments, into the dark living room, and the film cuts to a flashback of Mickey's past. Dr. Smith, a renowned oncologist in the city, sitting behind his desk, faces the camera, with rows of periodicals lining the wall behind him, evidence of his continuous engagement with the latest medical research.

Mickey and Hannah walk on the sidewalk in their Upper West Side neighborhood, oblivious of the passing pedestrians, with Hannah crying and blowing her nose into a tissue handed to her by Mickey. Hannah sobs, clutching her tissue to her face as they walk offscreen, and the film cuts to Hannah and Mickey's living room, which is brightly lit by the afternoon sun streaming through large windows and cluttered with pillows and plants, creating an inviting yet chaotic atmosphere. Norman and Carol, his wife and long-time friends of the couple, sit on the couch drinking coffee, their cups steaming in the cool air. Mickey walks from the kitchen into the living room, holding a half-eaten chocolate cake on a serving plate, a gesture of comfort, while the sun pours through the windows he passes, highlighting the dust particles in the air. Hannah is briefly seen in the background, preparing more coffee in the kitchen with an espresso machine. Mickey puts the cake down on the coffee table, which is already crowded with assorted plants, plates, and a bamboo tray holding utensils and napkins, an indicator of their penchant for hosting friends. Mickey sighs and flops down on an adjoining couch, rubbing his forehead, trying to ease the tension. Norman chuckles, attempting to lighten the mood, and Mickey starts to pace, a habit he's picked up during stressful times. Hannah, her hands clasped near her face, glances briefly at Carol and sighs, sharing a silent moment of understanding. Mickey pauses for a moment, collecting his thoughts, then stops his pacing and looks at the group before starting to pace behind the couch anew, lost in his thoughts. Norman and Carol remain silent as Mickey stops pacing and leans on the couch behind Norman, rubbing his hands on his knees, then leans back against the wall covered with framed photos of happier times. Norman and Carol turn to each other, reacting with subtle concern, and Carol glances at Norman and chuckles nervously while he takes a sip of coffee, savoring its comforting warmth. Hannah reaches for the cake as Carol and Norman exchange glances, reacting to the tense yet supportive gathering."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
