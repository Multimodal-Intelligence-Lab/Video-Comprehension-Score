From the platform, Uri has hoisted Alec onto the ascending vessel, but Alec can't reach him, so with all his strength, Uri seizes Alec's legs and tosses him into the sky before plunging into the chasm and dropping. Two boarding officials drag the resisting youth onboard. Meanwhile, the communications official detects a hydraulic fault preventing the gate from shutting, and Adriane notices Lily and Noah on the display as dark, battling floodwaters erase the airfield and the peaks. On the vessel bridge, the Ark office guides Adrian and Laura through the crowded corridor, and the crew observes amazed as the floodwater clears the surrounding peaks.

Anheuser scowls as the countdown tower reaches zero, lights go off as water crashes over the vessel, and the crew are knocked over on the bridge. The boarding officials and Uri's youths hurry away as water crashes in around them, and water slams through a passage, knocking individuals over. The crew re-man their controls, and in the flooded passage, Nina tends to Tenzen, who has injured his limb. A door slams shut on Lily and Tamara, and Tamara gets Lily and Caesar free, trapping herself in a flooding passage. On the bridge, Anheuser notices a wrecked aircraft hovering through the crashing waves. The enormous jet pushes on the water, they collide, and the aircraft breaks the anchor away as the vessel ascends with massive waves curling up and over the top. A computer graphic displays the angle of the collision between the two vessels as the vessel descends dramatically, sending the crowds in the corridor off their feet. The vessel dives headfirst, and items crash around in the passage. Adrian and Laura locate Lily, and on the bridge on a flat rooftop, they observe a computer graphic of Mount Everest. Down in the geological bay connecting passage, Jackson, Kate, Noah, and Tibetans hear all this over the speaker.

From his precarious position on the platform, Uri has managed to hoist Alec onto the rising ark, but Alec is unable to reach him.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
