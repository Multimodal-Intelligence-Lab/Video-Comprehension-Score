Bert, spotting Eddie, points in his direction and snaps his fingers as if trying to remember something, pretending for a brief moment to forget Findley's name. After nodding to everyone present, he turns and makes his departure. Sarah, observing the interaction, gives Bert a meaningful look. The camera then tilts upward, moving away from the energetic Dixieland combo that is enthusiastically blaring out a lively, bouncy tune, until it captures Sarah descending the stairs. She gazes down at the lively party unfolding below. Grasping the rail with one hand for balance while holding a champagne glass delicately in the other, she gracefully maneuvers her way down the steps. As she proceeds, she pauses momentarily to stop a waitress who is on her way upstairs, exchanging her used glass for a fresh, new one. We then follow her slightly unsteady, doll-like descent, watching as she drifts slowly and dreamily past the musically animated combo, past Eddie, who finds himself cornered by a fashionable blonde wearing a daringly low-cut dress, and past Findley, who stands alone with his drink, quietly observing the assembled guests. She continues onward, gliding past the bleary-eyed couples swaying on the dance floor, until she finally reaches the bar. Bert is present there as well, his head rhythmically bobbing to the Dixie beat, his eyes openly surveying her figure beneath her plainly covered cotton print dress. She spins away from him abruptly, takes her glass, and heads to a secluded corner of the room. Bert nonchalantly walks over to her side, leans in closely, and whispers something in her ear. Her expression hardens instantly; in a flash of anger, she turns sharply and throws her champagne in his face, letting her glass smash onto the floor. Overcome with emotion, she begins to cry and almost collapses, but Bert catches her by the shoulders, holding her up. The music halts suddenly, and the dancing couples strain to catch a glimpse of the commotion. Eddie pushes his way through the crowd of onlookers, attempting to take her into his arms, but she beats against his chest, sobbing uncontrollably, unable to form words. Gently, Eddie carries her trembling, limp body across the dance floor to the stairs, while Bert watches them depart, wiping the champagne from his coat lapels. The music resumes once more. A Negro maid waits patiently in the room, keeping a watchful eye over Sarah and the coats on which she is now lying. A woman enters with an air of disgust, shoving Sarah off her precious fur coat.

Meanwhile, Bert, catching sight of Eddie, gestures in his direction and casually snaps his fingers, as if trying to jog his memory, playfully pretending for an instant to have forgotten Findley's name. After acknowledging the gathered individuals with a nod, he turns away and takes his leave. Observing the exchange, Sarah gives Bert a look filled with unspoken meaning. The camera then shifts its focus upward, moving away from the lively, spirited Dixieland combo that is energetically filling the air with a vibrant, bouncy tune, until it finds Sarah, who is gracefully descending the stairs. She looks down on the lively, bustling party unfolding below her. With one hand firmly grasping the rail for support and the other delicately holding a champagne glass, she skillfully maneuvers her way down the steps. As she makes her way down, she pauses briefly to intercept a waitress ascending the stairs, exchanging her empty glass for a fresh, full one. Our attention then follows her slightly unsteady, almost doll-like descent, as she drifts slowly and dreamily past the musically animated combo, past Eddie, who is now engaged with a chic blonde in a daringly low-cut dress, and past Findley, who stands alone with his drink, quietly surveying the gathered guests. Continuing her path, she glides serenely past the bleary-eyed couples entwined on the dance floor, until she arrives at the bar. Bert is there, his head moving in time with the Dixie rhythm, his eyes openly assessing her figure beneath her simply adorned cotton print dress. She spins away from him with a suddenness, takes her glass, and retreats to a secluded corner of the room. Bert casually ambles over to her side, leans in closely, and murmurs something into her ear. Her demeanor hardens with immediate severity; with a burst of anger, she swings around sharply and hurls her champagne into his face, letting the glass crash onto the floor. Overwhelmed by emotion, she starts to weep and nearly collapses, but Bert catches her by the shoulders, preventing her from falling. The music abruptly ceases, and the dancing couples strain to witness the commotion. Eddie pushes through the throng of onlookers, attempting to comfort her, but she beats against his chest, her sobs shaking her body, unable to articulate any words. Gently, Eddie lifts her quivering, limp form across the dance floor toward the stairs, while Bert remains standing, watching them leave, wiping the champagne from his coat lapels. The music resumes once again. A Negro maid stands waiting patiently in the room, her watchful eyes on Sarah and the coats she is now lying on. A woman enters, her demeanor one of disdain, as she pushes Sarah away from her prized fur coat. As Eddie enters the doorway, the woman retrieves her coat and departs. He pauses, casting a momentary glance at Sarah, before turning to exit. Findley, holding both his drink and a cork-tipped cigarette, escorts Bert and Eddie down the stairs to his elegantly furnished game room. This room is beautifully embellished, featuring rich wood paneling and plush divans, and further highlighted by terra cotta Roman statues. At the center of attention in the room is a billiard table, presently concealed beneath a cloth cover. As Findley makes his way to the bar, Eddie eagerly pulls back the cloth, unveiling that it is not a standard pool table. Instead, it is a billiard table, which Eddie completes uncovering."

As he approaches, Bert catches sight of Eddie and, with a moment of playful forgetfulness, snaps his fingers as if struggling to recall Findley's name before he acknowledges everyone with a knowing nod and exits the scene. Sarah, witnessing this exchange, gives Bert a pointed look. Meanwhile, the camera gradually tilts upwards, capturing the lively energy of a Dixieland combo energetically playing a bouncy melody, before focusing on Sarah as she gracefully descends the stairs, her eyes scanning the lively party unfolding beneath her. With one hand securely gripping the rail for balance and the other delicately holding a champagne glass, she carefully navigates her way down the staircase. On her way, she halts a waitress ascending the stairs to exchange her empty glass for a fresh one. Our attention follows her measured, almost doll-like descent as she glides past the musicians of the combo, making her way past Eddie, who appears somewhat ensnared by the attention of a stylish blonde dressed in a revealing gown, and then past Findley, who stands solitarily with a drink in hand, quietly observing his guests from afar. She continues her elegant journey, weaving through couples on the dance floor swaying dreamily to the music with bleary eyes, until she finally arrives at the bar. There, she finds Bert, who is absorbed in the spirited rhythm of the Dixie beat, his head moving in sync with the music, his eyes appreciatively tracing the contours of her body, modestly clad in a cotton print dress. Abruptly spinning away from him, she takes possession of her newly acquired glass and retreats to a secluded corner of the room. Bert casually follows her, closing the distance between them, and leans in to murmur something into her ear. Instantly, her expression transforms, hardening with anger as she turns sharply, hurling the champagne onto his face before letting the glass fall dramatically to the floor, shattering upon impact. Overcome with emotion, she begins to cry and stumble, but Bert quickly reacts, supporting her by the shoulders to keep her from collapsing. The music abruptly halts, prompting the dance couples to strain their necks for a better view of the commotion. Eddie pushes through the curious onlookers, reaching Sarah in an attempt to comfort her, but she defensively beats against his chest, sobbing uncontrollably and unable to articulate her distress. Eddie then wraps his arms around her quivering, weakened frame and painstakingly escorts her across the dance floor toward the stairs, while Bert watches them retreat, casually wiping the remnants of champagne from his coat lapels. As the music resumes, a Negro maid sits quietly in a room, keeping an eye on both Sarah and the coats upon which she lies. A woman enters, glancing with disdain as she brusquely moves Sarah aside to retrieve her fur coat. Eddie appears in the doorway as the woman takes her coat and departs. He pauses momentarily to regard Sarah, then turns away and exits. Findley, with a drink in one hand and a cigarette with a cork tip in the other, accompanies Bert and Eddie down the stairs to his luxurious game room. The room is tastefully appointed, its wood-paneled walls adorned with plush divans and elegant terra cotta Roman statues. In the center stands a table draped with a cloth, which Eddie enthusiastically begins to remove, revealing underneath not a pool table as he expected, but a billiard table. He completes the uncovering of the billiard table, ready for the next chapter of their evening's entertainment."

Bert, who is known for his teasing antics, points to Eddie and snaps his fingers, pretending to forget Findley's name; he nods to them all and leaves with a casual air of indifference. Sarah gives Bert a look that conveys more than words ever could. The camera tilts upward from a lively Dixieland combo, a type of jazz popular in the early 20th century, blaring out a bouncy tune, to find Sarah, elegantly dressed for the occasion, descending the stairs, looking on at the lively party below. Holding the rail with one hand, and a champagne glass filled with an expensive vintage in the other, she maneuvers her way down the steps. She stops a waitress, part of the well-staffed team ensuring the event runs smoothly, on the way upstairs and exchanges her glass for a new one, appreciating the fresh bubbles. We follow her unsteady, doll-like descent as she moves slowly, dreamily past the combo, past Eddie, who is cornered by a chic blonde in a low-cut dress that turns heads, and past Findley, alone with his drink, observing his guests with the air of a seasoned host; she continues past the bleary-eyed couples on the dance floor, entranced by the night's festivities, until she comes to the bar. Bert is there too, his head bobbing to the Dixie beat, his eyes running over her body so plainly covered by a simple cotton print dress, despite the extravagance around her. Spinning away from him, she takes her glass and goes to a corner of the room, seeking solitude. Bert walks casually to her side, leans over, and whispers something in her ear that clearly crosses a line. Her face hardens, and angrily she turns and throws her champagne, an expensive vintage wasted, in his face and smashes her glass on the floor, a dramatic gesture that captures everyone's attention. She starts to cry and starts to fall, but Bert holds her up by the shoulders, gaining unwanted attention. The music stops, and the dance couples strain to get a look at what has happened, their curiosity piqued by the commotion. Eddie shoves through the gawking crowd, tries to take her in his arms, but she beats on his chest, sobbing, unable to make words amidst her emotional turmoil. Eddie drags her limp, trembling body across the dance floor to the stairs while Bert watches them go, wiping the champagne off his coat lapels, a testament to the night's excess. The music starts up again, attempting to restore normality. A Negro maid, dedicated and patient, sits in the room, watching over Sarah and the coats that Sarah is lying on, an emblem of service in the era's societal structure. A woman enters and, disgusted by the scene, pushes Sarah off her fur coat, a symbol of her status. Eddie appears in the doorway, and the woman takes her coat and leaves, her priorities clear. Eddie looks at Sarah for a moment, then turns and walks out, his mind weighed down by the night's events. Findley, with a drink and cork-tipped cigarette, a popular choice among refined smokers, in hand, escorts Bert and Eddie down the stairs to his game room, a sanctuary of leisure. It is a beautifully appointed salon, wood-paneled, filled with plush divans and decorated with terra cotta Roman statuary, reflecting a taste for classical elegance. In the center of the room is the billiard table, now covered by a cloth, hiding the night's entertainment. Findley goes to the bar, ever the gracious host, while Eddie eagerly pulls back the cloth that covers the table, but it's not a pool table -- it's a billiard table, a subtle distinction appreciated by connoisseurs. Eddie finishes uncovering the table, ready for the next chapter in the evening's unfolding drama."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
