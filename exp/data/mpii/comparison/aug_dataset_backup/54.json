Without hesitation, he slides the glass across the surface of his desk toward Curly, who stares at it with a blank expression before finally picking it up and downing it in one swift motion.

With a practiced and steady hand, he pours a generous serving into the glass. Without a moment's hesitation, he slides the filled glass smoothly across the desk to Curly, who gazes at it with a blank expression before finally lifting it and downing the contents in one swift motion. Now, Gittes guides Curly past Sophie, who makes a conspicuous effort to avert her gaze. Gittes, with an arm casually draped around Curly's shoulders, flashes a broad, dazzling smile, but as soon as the door closes behind Curly, the smile swiftly disappears from his face. As Gittes enters the room, Walsh stands up as a gesture of acknowledgment, and Gittes returns the gesture with a nod before continuing on his way.

They watch closely as Mulwray makes his way down to the center of the riverbed, where he pauses, turning slowly, as if contemplating the bottom of the riverbed or perhaps simply staring into the void.

He quickly scans the array of whiskey bottles lined up, their labels glinting in the light, and decisively selects a cheaper bottle of bourbon, ignoring the more expensive options. With practiced ease, he unscrews the cap and pours a generous shot into the glass, the liquid splashing slightly as it fills. He then shoves the glass across the desk toward Curly, who stares at it blankly for a moment before his hand reaches out, wraps around the glass, and lifts it to his lips. Curly tilts his head back, draining the contents in one swift motion. Gittes then guides Curly past Sophie, who deliberately turns her gaze away, avoiding eye contact. As they walk, Gittes throws an arm around Curly's shoulders, offering a dazzling smile that seems to light up his face. However, as soon as he shuts the door behind Curly, the smile vanishes, replaced by a more serious expression.

He shoves the glass across his desk toward Curly, a local fisherman who often seeks Gittes' advice, who stares dumbly at it, then picks it up and drains it. He's now walking Curly past Sophie, Gittes' efficient secretary who manages the office affairs, and who pointedly averts her gaze. Gittes throws an arm around Curly and flashes a dazzling smile, honed through years of dealing with all kinds of clients, then shuts the door on him and the smile disappears. Walsh, Gittes' seasoned and loyal associate, rises when Gittes enters, Gittes nods, acknowledging Walsh's silent professionalism, and walks on in. Gittes walks over to Mrs. Mulwray, the elegant and poised wife of a prominent engineer, and again flashes a warm, sympathetic smile, and she holds her breath, feeling the weight of her secretive concerns. Gittes pulls up a chair sitting next to Mrs. Mulwray between Duffy and Walsh, gives Duffy, their quick-tempered colleague, an irritated glance, causing Duffy to stop chewing, likely on a piece of gum, and then Gittes sighs. Former Mayor Sam Bagby is speaking, known for his controversial water policies that have divided the community, with a huge map, overleafs, and bold lettering behind him. Some councilmen are reading funny papers and gossip columns, indicative of their disregard for the proceedings, while Bagby is speaking, and some grubby farmers sit next to them, bored, having traveled from the outskirts of the city to voice their concerns. One yawns and edges away from one of the dirtier farmers, while an amalgam of farmers, businessmen, and city employees listen with keen interest, aware of the impact of Bagby's decisions on their livelihoods. A man looks up with interest from his racing form, commonly browsed by gambling aficionados, during a whispered conference, walks to the huge map with overleafs, and he is a slender man in his sixties, who wears glasses and moves with surprising fluidity, developed from years of working in the fields. He turns to a smaller, younger man and nods, prompting the man to turn the overleaf on the map, revealing the proposed water routes. Mulwray, a key figure in the city's water department, leaves the overleaf board and sits down. Suddenly, there are some whoops and hollers from the rear of the chambers, and a red-faced farmer drives in several scrawny, bleating sheep, protesting recent water diversions affecting their pastures. Bailiffs and sergeants-at-arms respond to the imprecations of the Council and attempt to capture the sheep and the farmers, having to restrain one who looks like he's going to bodily attack Mulwray, frustrated by the water shortage impacting his livelihood. The sun blazes off the river's ugly concrete banks, part of the city's controversial flood control measures, while where the banks are earthen, they are parched and choked with weeds, indicative of the ongoing drought. After a moment, Mulwray's car pulls into view on a flood control road about fifteen feet above the riverbed, where he often goes to contemplate his next moves. Someone holding a pair of binoculars is positioned downstream, possibly a private investigator or concerned citizen, and just above the flood control road, using some dried mustard weeds for cover, and trains the binoculars on him. They watch while Mulwray makes his way down to the center of the riverbed, where he stops, turns slowly, and appears to be looking at the bottom of the riverbed or at nothing at all, a habit that hints at his deep contemplation of the city's water issues. Then a small Mexican boy atop a swayback horse, an animal reflecting the rough, rural life in the area, rides it into the riverbed and into Gittes' view. Gittes moves a little further back as Mulwray rounds the bend in the river and comes face to face with the Mexican boy on the muddy banks, an encounter that seems to puzzle both."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Gittes then greets Mrs. Mulwray with a reassuring smile as he sits beside her, casting an annoyed look at Duffy. Meanwhile, former Mayor Sam Bagby presents a large map, while councilmen and farmers exhibit varying levels of interest. Mulwray, involved in map discussions, sits down as chaos erupts with a farmer driving sheep into the chambers. Bailiffs try to control the situation, preventing any attack on Mulwray. Outside, Mulwray drives along a flood control road, observed by someone with binoculars. Mulwray stops in the riverbed, seemingly lost in thought. A Mexican boy on horseback approaches, catching Gittes' interest as he watches the encounter unfold."
