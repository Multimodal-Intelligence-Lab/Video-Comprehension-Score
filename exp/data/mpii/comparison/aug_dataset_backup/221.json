A slow blues is being played and sung by Tommy in the background while coffee cups are held by the three convicts who gaze into the fire. As he is stretched out, his coffee is swished by Pete as he stares into the blaze, murmuring while he gives his coffee a thoughtful swish. Dirt is shoveled onto the fire by Pete as the three men tense up, and Delmar and Everett scramble to peek over a low ridge. Their point-of-view shows a lone barn surrounded by various police vehicles that have pulled up facing it, with their car parked to one side. Guns are trained on it by armed men, their backs to us, with some taking cover on the near side of their parked cars.

The dusty road is shuffled down by the three men, their drift lost as all three turn, reacting to the sound of an approaching speeding car which corners on two wheels and comes into view. It is crashed back onto all four, and dollar bills are snapped and fluttered out its windows as it speeds along. The three men are roared up to by the car as Delmar waggles a hopeful thumb, and it is screeched to a halt. A call is leaned over to make through the passenger window by the driver, a young man in a sharp suit with a round, babylike face, as a fluttering dollar bill is plucked out of the air by Delmar, who looks at it wonderingly, holds it stretched between two hands, brings the two sides together, then gives it an appraising pop. Like a child gazing at soap bubbles, Delmar looks around at the wafting currency and yanks another fluttering bill out of the air. The three men climb in, the car is squealed out, and a glance is shot up to the rearview mirror by the driver as the sirens grow louder, then he gropes inside his coat. The gun is stopped from being withdrawn by the man as he appraises his passengers while the paper currency fluttering inside the car is reacted to by Delmar. The door is opened, and the running board is stepped onto by him, while Everett is given a casual gesture, which startles him as Everett slides over. Now fully outside and facing the pursuit vehicles, George Nelson has clamped one hand on the car roof and waves to Delmar with the other while he sends a spray of bullets back at the pursuit car. Wild firing is done by Nelson as he gains on the pursuit cars, and their fire is returned."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
