Armstead's is a quintessential diminutive-town billiard saloon with a tavern, a brief order counter, a skee-ball apparatus, and billiard tables for minor, congenial matches. The few patrons in Armstead's this day are not participating; they rest and peruse the periodicals. Charlie and Eddie are at the tavern, consuming unadulterated bourbon. Charlie ascends from his barstool, and Eddie is already at the table. Charlie joins Eddie as the match is in mid-progress, and it's Eddie's attempt. He finishes his bourbon, sways a tad, leans over the table, and clumsily jabs at the white cue sphere with his cue, missing a simple attempt. Several more townsfolk have entered from the avenue and are observing the play. The barkeep replenishes the glasses as soon as they are vacated. Two spheres lie side by side on the table. Eddie gazes at them, attempting to deduce his attempt, blinking his eyes to concentrate better. Some of the spectators appear dubious, but Eddie pats the corner pocket assuredly, leans over, and snaps out his attempt. The sphere banks in, and he pounds his friend Charlie on the shoulder and collapses into a nearby chair. Frustrated, Eddie drapes across the table and arranges them up himself. They toss their currency on the table, and Eddie attempts, but his attempt is too forceful and his sphere vaults over the edge of the table. The barkeep cannot restrain his rapid laughter. Eddie hesitates, grinning. Bashfully, the barkeep restores the spheres in their original locations. Eddie chalks up his cue, waiting restlessly for the barkeep to return with the currency from the cash register. Then he finishes his beverage and swiftly strokes out his attempt, the sphere banking crisply and directly into the corner pocket. There is a cocky smirk on his face as he grasps for the dollar bills. The portal of the Packard coupe slams shut. Eddie Felson holds up his stuffed wallet for his friend, Charlie Burns, to observe. He tosses it on the seat beside him and activates the ignition. Henry nods, then steps up on a stool to adjust the minute hand of the clock. It now stands at ten o'clock. It is twelve-thirty when Eddie Felson and Charlie Burns first enter into Ames. Only one table is in use; the hall is vacant. In Eddie's hand is his leather cue case.

With this task completed, he strides purposefully and directly toward Armstead's, a place that truly embodies the essence of a small-town pool hall. Armstead's offers a warm and inviting atmosphere, complete with a friendly bar, a short order counter serving quick, appetizing bites, a skee-ball machine for those desiring some light-hearted amusement, and several pool tables carefully arranged for small, enjoyable games that patrons often indulge in. On this particular day, however, the scant few individuals present in Armstead's choose not to engage in any gaming activities; instead, they sit quietly and are deeply engrossed in their newspapers, appearing quite content with this leisurely activity.\n\nAt the bar counter, both Charlie and Eddie find themselves seated comfortably, enjoying straight bourbon together. As the moment arises for Charlie to slowly lift himself from his barstool, Eddie has already moved to the pool table, ready and eager to play. Observing that the game is already in motion, Charlie joins Eddie at the table just as Eddie is about to take his next shot. Charlie, in one swift motion, finishes his bourbon, sways gently for a moment, bends over the pool table, and awkwardly attempts to strike the white cue ball with his stick. Sadly, he misses what should have been an easy shot.\n\nSimultaneously, more residents from the town gradually make their way inside from the street, gathering with a casual demeanor to observe the developing play. The bartender, always attentive and diligent in his duties, promptly refills any empty glasses as swiftly as they are emptied. On the table, two pool balls lie side by side, and Eddie, peering intently at them, thoughtfully calculates how best to approach his next shot. Blinking his eyes in an effort to sharpen his focus, some of the onlookers watch with a keen interest, while others seem somewhat skeptical. Eddie, nevertheless exuding a confident air, pats the corner pocket with a sense of purpose, as if signaling his next move. Leaning over the table with determination, he executes his shot with decisiveness. The ball banks successfully into the pocket, leading Eddie to triumphantly pound Charlie on the shoulder in celebration before he collapses contentedly into a nearby chair.\n\nDespite feeling a bit of a sting from the earlier events, Eddie lies across the pool table and takes it upon himself to set up the balls for the next round. They casually toss their money onto the table, eager to continue the game. Eddie takes his next shot; however, his overenthusiastic execution causes the ball to unexpectedly leap over the table's edge. Witnessing this amusing mishap, the bartender bursts into a series of staccato laughter. Eddie pauses for a brief moment, then smiles ruefully. Meanwhile, the bartender, still chuckling, diligently replaces the balls in their initial positions. With renewed focus, Eddie chalks up his cue, waiting with some impatience for the bartender to return with their winnings from the cash register. He subsequently consumes his drink in one go and skillfully executes another shot, with the ball crisply banking and heading straight into the corner pocket. A cocky leer gradually spreads across his face as he reaches for the freshly won dollar bills.\n\nThe distinct sound of the Packard coupe's door slamming shut reverberates through the air. Eddie Felson, brimming with a sense of pride, holds up his rather stuffed billfold for his friend, Charlie Burns, to see. Casually, he tosses it onto the seat next to him and turns on the car's ignition, preparing to drive away. Henry takes note of this and then steps up onto a stool to carefully adjust the minute hand of the clock, ensuring it accurately reads ten o'clock. By twelve-thirty, Eddie Felson and Charlie Burns make their initial entrance into Ames. Currently, only one pool table is in use, leaving the remainder of the hall otherwise empty. Eddie enters with confidence, holding his leather cue case firmly in hand, and they pause for a moment before the swinging doors, taking in their surroundings. They saunter over to the cashier's cage, where a sign firmly declares NO GAMBLING ALLOWED, a notice that clearly captures their attention. Eddie's arrival doesn't escape the notice of Big John and Preacher, two well-known figures at Ames, with the former being an ever-present gambler and the latter an addict, both perpetually waiting for any action to unfold at all hours of the day."

This small-town pool hall welcomes him with its unassuming charm, complete with a bar, a short order counter serving quick bites, a skee-ball machine for those seeking lighthearted diversion, and pool tables inviting players for small, friendly games. Inside, only a handful of people are present, choosing to sit and engross themselves in their newspapers rather than engage in the action. At the bar, Eddie finds his friend Charlie, and they both indulge in glasses of straight bourbon. Charlie gradually rises from his barstool, taking a moment to steady himself before heading over to where Eddie is already stationed at the pool table. As the game is underway with Eddie in the spotlight, he confidently finishes his bourbon, though it causes him to weave slightly. He bends over the table, trying to steady himself, and awkwardly attempts to strike the white cue ball with his stick but misses what ought to have been a straightforward shot. Meanwhile, more townspeople trickle in from the street, gathering to observe the unfolding match with keen interest. The bartender, ever attentive, is swift in refilling their glasses each time they are emptied. Staring intently at the pool table, Eddie scrutinizes two balls lying in close proximity, blinking to sharpen his focus. Despite some skeptics among the onlookers, Eddie taps the corner pocket with assurance, leans over, and executes his shot. The ball obediently banks into the pocket, prompting Eddie to jubilantly pat Charlie on the shoulder before collapsing into a nearby chair. Undeterred by the setback, Eddie props himself up and prepares the table for the next play, placing the balls back into their starting positions as they toss money onto the table to up the stakes. With determination, Eddie takes another shot, but his eagerness results in too much force, propelling the ball off the table. The bartender erupts into boisterous laughter that echoes around the pool hall. Eddie pauses, grins broadly, and, with an air of good-natured resignation, observes as the bartender dutifully returns the balls to their original positions. While waiting for the bartender to fetch the money from the cash register, Eddie attentively chalks his cue, impatiently anticipating his next move. He swiftly downs another drink, steadies himself, and with precision, sends the ball banking neatly and decisively into the corner pocket. A smug leer spreads across his face as he collects the dollar bills in victory. In the aftermath, the door of the Packard coupe slams shut with a definitive thud. Eddie Felson holds up his now bulging billfold for his pal Charlie Burns to admire before tossing it casually onto the seat beside him and turning the ignition on. Meanwhile, Henry, a diligent employee, steps onto a nearby stool to adjust the minute hand of the clock, reflecting the passage of time to ten o'clock. It is twelve-thirty when Eddie Felson and Charlie Burns make their entrance into Ames. The hall is notably empty, with only one table occupied. Eddie grips his leather cue case in hand as they pause before the swinging doors, casting a calculating glance around the room. They stroll over to the cashier's cage, where a prominently displayed sign on the brass bar reads \"NO GAMBLING ALLOWED.\" Their arrival does not go unnoticed by Big John and Preacher, two regulars who spend countless hours at Ames, perpetually on the lookout for the next opportunity for action."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

After some stumbling, he wins money from pool bets, revealing a cocky grin. Eddie flaunts his winnings to Charlie and leaves the bar. Later, they arrive at Ames, a pool hall where signs warn against gambling. Noticed by Big John and Preacher, regulars at Ames seeking action, Eddie's leather cue case suggests he's ready for serious play."
