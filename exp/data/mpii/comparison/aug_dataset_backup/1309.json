After what feels like an eternity wrestling with his inner turmoil, he finally extends his hand to grasp the car keys, taking a decisive action to start up the vehicle.

With a sense of urgency, Elijah pivots quickly to watch the man threading his way through the maze of parked cars, making his way out of the parking lot. Elijah inhales deeply and, with a sense of resignation, turns off the engine. He notices the man in the army jacket almost imperceptibly dwindling into the distance with each purposeful step. A surge of adrenaline courses through Elijah, causing his breath to quicken. Determined not to lose sight of the man, he propels himself forward, weaving through the lot with an increased sense of urgency. He maneuvers around obstructive chrome bumpers and jutting tailpipes as he hastens his pace. Gradually but surely, Elijah closes in on the man in the army jacket. \n\nAs the man reaches the threshold of a subway entrance that marks the boundary of the parking lot, he pauses and turns slightly, then vanishes swiftly into the subway's depths.

With ample effort and determination, he arrives, albeit with significant exertion, at the subway entrance. Peering into the opening, he notes a steep, daunting flight of stairs leading down to the underground platform. Just at that moment, he catches a fleeting glimpse of the tail of the army jacket disappearing from view. Breathing heavily from the physical exertion, Elijah grips the railing tightly and begins his descent into the depths of the subway. He knows he must maintain his pace, moving rapidly down the steps with decreasing hesitance, embracing the agility he never knew he possessed. However, amidst this urgency, his foot unfortunately catches on one of the steps, causing his hand to slip away from the safety of the railing. He tumbles down the remaining stairs, landing in a heap upon the dirty, gum-stained floor of the subway landing. \n\nLying there with his jaw clenched tightly, Elijah’s face twists into a mask of discomfort and anguish as his eyes take in the inverted view of the subway turnstiles.

After what feels like an eternity in this mental storm, he finally extends a hand, fingers brushing the cool metal of the keys before firmly grasping them and turning them in the ignition to start up the car. He takes a moment to glance into the rearview mirror, where his eyes catch sight of a man in a green army jacket, casually strolling behind the vehicle. The sight jolts him into action; he quickly turns his body to get a better look, noticing the man weaving through the maze of parked cars, heading out of the parking lot. Elijah draws in a deep, steadying breath and decides to cut the engine, aware that the figure in the army jacket seems to be getting smaller with each step they take away from him. His breathing becomes more rapid and forceful, a reflection of his agitation and urgency, and he urges himself to move faster. As he maneuvers through the lot, he dodges the potential hazards of jutting chrome bumpers and protruding tailpipes, each obstacle requiring a nimble sidestep or quick duck as he gains ground on the retreating figure. The man in the army jacket reaches the boundary of the parking lot, a subway entrance, and turns just as he gets there, disappearing inside. Elijah ramps up to a jog, the sudden burst of speed unfamiliar and taxing, sending jolts of pain through his underused muscles. Nevertheless, he perseveres, straining every fiber to reach the subway entrance, where he pauses momentarily at the threshold to peer inside. His gaze follows the steep descent, eyeing the stairs that lead down to the subway floor, catching one last glimpse of the disappearing tail of the army jacket before it vanishes from view. With heavy breaths, he latches onto the railing, steeling himself before plunging down the steps, knowing he must maintain his speed. He grits his teeth, releasing more of his initial hesitation with each hurried step. His movements become fluid, almost graceful, until the inevitable happens: his foot snags a raised edge of a step, and his grip on the railing falters. He tumbles, falling uncontrollably down the remainder of the stairs, ultimately coming to a halt in an undignified heap on the grimy, gum-spotted subway floor. Pain etches itself across his face, muscles locked in a grimace, as he looks up and sees the world inverted, his view filled with the turnstiles of the subway. The man in the green army jacket, casting a cursory glance back, meets Elijah's eyes blankly before pushing through the turnstile. Elijah's consciousness slips away, the last thing he registers being the coat's tail hiking up to reveal the silver glint of a gun handle tucked into the man's waistband. Meanwhile, elsewhere, as the day bleeds into the red hues of twilight, David's neighborhood is bathed in a rich crimson glow. A Septa bus rolls to a complete stop before a public high school, its doors hissing open to release its passengers, including David, who steps down onto the pavement clad in his security uniform. Once off the bus, David turns toward the high school football field behind him, where a group of children are enthusiastically engaged in a touch football game. Among them, Joseph separates from the huddle, sprinting across the field to join David. With a nod of acknowledgment between them, David diverts his gaze to the field, attention captured by the sight of an impressively muscular college-age man in sweats standing amidst the children. David’s eyes follow closely as this apparent cornerback, surrounded by an admiring cluster of kids, indulges their curiosity, allowing a couple of them to feel his proudly flexed bicep, much to their delight."

He finally reaches for the keys, deciding it's time to leave the parking lot adjacent to the busy downtown shopping center, and starts up the car. He looks into the rearview mirror and sees the man in the green army jacket, a common surplus item often associated with military veterans, pass behind his car. Elijah quickly turns and sees the man moving through the parked cars heading out of the parking lot, a vast expanse typically crowded on weekends. Elijah takes a deep breath and turns off the engine. The figure in the army jacket seems to move farther away with every step. Elijah starts breathing harder, anxiety creeping into his chest. He pushes himself to move faster. He avoids the hard chrome bumpers and tailpipes that jut out from the cars, relics of an older generation's automotive design, as he quickens his pace through the lot. He gains on the army jacket. The man in the army jacket turns as he reaches a subway entrance, part of the city's extensive and historic underground transit system, that marks the end of the parking lot. He disappears into the subway entrance. Elijah quickens into a jog now. He hasn't done this in a while, his lifestyle being mostly sedentary, and it's painful. He makes it with great strain to the subway. He looks into the entrance. A steep flight of stairs, worn smooth by countless commuters, leads to the subway floor. The tail of the army jacket is glimpsed before it disappears. Elijah breathes hard as he takes hold of the railing, cold and slightly sticky from the humid environment. Elijah starts his descent. Elijah has to move fast. He takes the steps with less and less hesitation, driven by urgency. He's moving with great agility, and then his foot catches on a step. His hand slips away from the railing. He falls down the remaining part of the stairs. He comes to a stop in a pile on the dirty, gum-stained floor of the subway landing, littered with remnants of countless hurried meals. His jaw is locked in a grimace of pain. His contorted anguished face sees the turnstiles of the subway, part of the fare collection system, upside down. The green army jacketed man looks back at Elijah with a blank expression, pushing through the turnstile. The last thing Elijah sees before he blacks out is the tail of the man's coat riding up as he moves through the turnstile. The silver handle of a gun peeks out from the belt of his pants, a chilling reminder of potential danger. David's neighborhood, historically vibrant and diverse, turns crimson as the day comes to an end. The Septa bus, part of Philadelphia's regional public transportation authority, pulls to a stop in front of a public high school. David steps off, still in his security clothes, worn from a long shift. David turns to the high school football field behind him. A group of children are having a touch football game, a popular after-school activity. Joseph runs out from the huddle across the field to David. Joseph nods. David looks to the fields to see a very muscular college-age man in sweats, likely a local college athlete, who stands with the other children. David stares at his son. David watches the cornerback, known for his lightning-fast reflexes on the field, being surrounded by kids. He's letting a couple of the kids feel his flexed bicep, a playful display of strength admired by younger admirers."

He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
