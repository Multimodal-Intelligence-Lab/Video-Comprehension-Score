Thompson pauses, peers at his aides' map, and darts off. In the mist, a trekking David waves a foot at traffic. He scampers across the avenue and clambers the library steps three at a time. In the hallway, he collides with a passerby, toppling him over. His scarf comes loose and a guard nears him. He snatches the scarf. Adrian interacts with Elise's colleague. On her way out, she brushes past a lean stranger in a beret. A marshal directs him to toss it aside, and he complies. In the hallway, he bolts to a security gate, and tears off his tie and empties his backpack. He rolls it along the bench as he leaps through the scanner. Leaving his other items, he pauses under a dome’s artistic ceiling. Later he speeds up a winding staircase. Now as Thompson greets his crew in the dome, David speeds past Elise's colleague outside the tribunal. He barges into the Men's Room. She glares at him. The lean bureau agent steps in. David sucker-punches him. He grabs the agent's map, and reveals it to Elise. An aide with Thompson reviews his guide. In the attic agents, draped from head to foot in white, step into helicopters. Meanwhile in the Adjustment Bureau. In the tribunal Men's Room David props a broomstick against a heater blocking the entry. He tests its firmness, then checks the chain lock. Crossing to her, he dons the beret. David pulls the closet curtain and slides them onto Central Park's lush lawn. Elise gawks at the sudden shift and location. David hustles her to a cushioned archway in the garden wall. It leads to an escalator. Ascending it, the pair find themselves in Brooklyn's shopping district. Back in the tribunal Men's Room, a bureau agent forces open the entrance. Thompson and his team step inside glancing briefly at their unconscious associate. Meanwhile, David and Elise dart hand in hand down the crowded city sidewalk. In the Men's Room, Thompson observes the map room lying open on the towel dispenser. His aide reviews his own guide. With David, she frowns. She smiles. Now Thompson and his aide surface from the subway entrance and arrive in the shopping district."

          "description": "She swings a right curve and flutters over a fountain. At the Coordination Guild, a messenger stumbles over to Benson. At the library, Morgan salutes Veronica with a handshake. As she glides past, he squints after her. Meanwhile, Jordan tiptoes through the drizzle reaching the desired green archway. He teleports through and lands at an information desk at the Los Angeles DMV. A confused visitor stares at the windy avenue left bare in the wide entrance. Jordan sprints out a corridor arch. At the Guild, Benson and messengers glide across a hall filled with coats. Benson pauses, examines his messengers' map notebook, and dashes away. In the drizzle, a jogging Jordan waves a foot at vehicles. He scampers across the avenue and scales the library stairs three at a time. In the corridor, he collides with a bystander toppling him over. His cane falls off and a lookout approaches. He snatches the cane. Morgan converses with Veronica's acquaintance. On her journey out, she walks past a lanky stranger in a trilby. A bailiff gestures to him to remove it, and he obliges. In the corridor, he leaps to a scanner, removes his vest and empties his satchel. He rolls it along the bench as he skips through the gateway. Abandoning his other items, he pauses beneath a dome adorned ceiling. Later he dashes up a winding staircase. Now as Benson gathers his crew in the dome, Jordan speeds past Veronica's acquaintance outside the courtroom. He barges into the Men’s Lounge. They gape at him. The lanky guild officer enters. Jordan jabs him. He takes the officer's map notebook, and presents it to Veronica. A messenger with Benson studies his notebook. In the depot officers, dressed entirely in white, board vans. Meanwhile in the Coordination Guild. In the library Men’s Lounge Jordan braces a broom handle behind a fireplace blocking the entrance. He verifies its solidity, then checks the latch. Approaching her, he dons the trilby. Jordan unlocks the wardrobe door and teleports them onto Wembley Stadium's lush pitch. Veronica gawks at the sudden transformation and setting. Jordan propels her to a cushiony archway in the field barrier. It teleports to an escalator. Ascending it, the duo discover themselves in London’s commercial area. Back in the library Men’s Lounge, a guild officer kicks in the entrance. Benson and his squad enter glancing briefly at their unconscious comrade. Meanwhile, Jordan and Veronica dash hand in hand down the teeming road. In the Men’s Lounge, Benson notices the map room lying ajar on the washstand. His messenger refers to his own notebook. With Jordan, she shrugs her shoulders. She agrees. Now Benson and his messenger emerge from the subterranean escalator and arrive in the commercial area."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Meanwhile, Adrian hugs Elise at the courthouse, watching her as she leaves. David reaches a blue door and finds himself at the New York DMV, startling a customer with the open door. He dashes back outside, crossing traffic and ascending the courthouse steps. Inside, he collides with a bystander, losing his hat as a guard approaches him. Adrian speaks with Elise's friend, while a stranger in a fedora draws attention. David races through a metal detector, leaving his belongings behind, and pauses under a rotunda. Later, he sprints up a spiral stairwell as Thompson convenes with his team. David runs past Elise's friend and bursts into the Ladies Room, startling Elise. A gaunt bureau officer enters, whom David knocks out, taking his plan book to show Elise. Meanwhile, officers clad in black prepare to move from the Adjustment Bureau. In the Ladies Room, David bars the door and dons a fedora, transporting them to Yankee Stadium's outfield. Elise is amazed by the sudden change. They rush through a portal, emerging in Manhattan's business district. Back in the Ladies Room, the bureau officer kicks in the door, and Thompson finds the plan book open on the sink. David and Elise, hand in hand, navigate the busy city streets as Thompson and his aide pursue them, arriving in the business district."
