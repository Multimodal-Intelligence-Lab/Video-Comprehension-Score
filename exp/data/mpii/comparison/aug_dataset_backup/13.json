Meanwhile, Barbara Fitts is absorbed in her own task, standing over the stove where she mechanically flips sizzling strips of bacon, her eyes focused intently on something far removed from her immediate surroundings. Barbara, who appears to be at least a decade younger than her husband, possesses a beauty that could be described as reminiscent of June Cleaver. Suddenly, Ricky makes his entrance, which causes Barbara to jump slightly as she turns her attention to him while attempting to serve him the bacon she has just prepared. Ricky, however, opts to help himself to some scrambled eggs from another waiting pan before he joins his father at the dining table. The Colonel, engrossed in reading The Wall Street Journal, sits at a small dinette, and soon both he and Barbara exchange alarmed glances. The Colonel, puffed up with a sense of purpose, strides toward the living room and opens the front door. There, standing outside, are the two Jims, one of whom, Jim #1, extends a basket overflowing with an assortment of fresh flowers, vegetables, and a small white cardboard box tied neatly with raffia. The Colonel eyes them with a mix of suspicion and curiosity. The Jims exchange quick glances with each other and then direct their focus back on the Colonel, whose expression reveals a moment of confusion before realization dawns upon him. As the Colonel drives down the road, a brooding expression darkening his features, Ricky sits beside him in the passenger seat, engrossed in using a calculator while diligently jotting down figures in a notebook. A tense silence hangs in the air, broken only by the Colonel's sharp glance at Ricky, which is charged with barely contained anger. A few moments later, sensing that a response is anticipated, Ricky lets out a sigh, redirecting his attention toward his father. The Colonel, momentarily caught off guard by this interaction, quickly regains his composure as Ricky resumes his task of totaling two painstakingly calculated columns of numbers. In another scene, Jane and Angela are positioned with two other teenage girls, who eventually drift away from them. The arrival of the Colonel's Ford Explorer signals a change, and Ricky emerges from the vehicle. Angela's gaze fixes on Jane, which is soon followed by a widening smile as Jane finds herself confronted by Ricky, who stands before her, his eyes locked onto hers with an intensity that leaves Jane feeling unsettled, prompting her to avert her gaze. Ricky, sensing her discomfort, allows a smile to play across his lips and then casually walks away while Angela casts a wide-eyed look toward Jane, who pointedly chooses to ignore it. Meanwhile, the Colonel and Barbara find themselves seated together on a couch, seemingly absorbed in watching television. The Colonel appears to be enjoying the program, evident in his occasional smiles, while Barbara merely stares blankly at the screen. The Colonel lets out a chuckle in response to a joke, momentarily startling Barbara, and it becomes apparent that the three people on the couch are watching the television more like strangers awaiting a flight at an airport terminal. As we continue to follow their interactions, we see them pass by a sign and enter a bustling ballroom where impeccably dressed real estate professionals gather in clusters, engaging in animated conversations, while catering waiters skillfully maneuver through the crowd, offering trays of hors d'oeuvres. Carolyn's jaw tightens noticeably as she pulls Lester toward a distinguished silver-haired man and his considerably younger wife, whom we quickly recognize as the formidable Buddy Kane, often referred to as the Real Estate King. With renewed enthusiasm, Carolyn eagerly inserts herself into their conversation, her voice rising slightly in volume, all the while wearing her most radiant and charming smile."

Ricky, however, chooses to help himself to some scrambled eggs from another pan waiting on the stove before he proceeds to join his father at the dining table.

He opens the front door, standing a bit puffed up, to find the two Jims standing there. Jim #1 extends a basket brimming with flowers, vegetables, and a small white cardboard box tied with raffia, as the Colonel fixes them with a suspicious stare. Exchanging silent looks, the Jims turn their gaze back to the Colonel, who remains confused until a flicker of realization crosses his face. The scene shifts with the Colonel driving, his eyes fixed intently on the road, his expression dark, while Ricky sits in the passenger seat, his fingers deftly pressing the calculator buttons and jotting down numbers in a notebook. The Colonel casts a sharp, angry glance at Ricky, prompting Ricky, who continues his calculations, to become aware that a response from him is anticipated. He emits a weary sigh and turns his gaze toward his father; the Colonel momentarily appears taken aback but swiftly regains composure, and Ricky resumes his task of summing two columns of numbers.

Jane, feeling uneasy, averts her gaze, prompting Ricky to smile softly and walk away, while Angela casts a wide-eyed look at Jane, who chooses to disregard it. Meanwhile, the Colonel and Barbara are positioned on a couch, their attention on the television; the Colonel is grinning and enjoying the show, while Barbara merely stares blankly. The Colonel's laughter at a joke startles her, and the three of them continue watching the television much like strangers sitting together at an airport terminal.

Address books, once a household staple before the digital era, often held personal connections and contacts. Meanwhile, Barbara Fitts stands at the stove, a modern gas range that replaced her old electric model last year, flipping bacon strips mechanically with her eyes focused elsewhere. She is at least ten years younger than her husband and is pretty in a June Cleaver-ish way, reminiscent of the iconic 1950s television housewife from \"Leave It to Beaver.\" Ricky enters, home from school early due to a pep rally, and startles Barbara, who turns to him as she attempts to serve him bacon. Ricky serves himself scrambled eggs from another pan, which he had perfected to his taste during culinary class, then joins his father at the table. The Colonel sits at a dinette reading The Wall Street Journal, a leading international business-focused newspaper, and then he and Barbara look at each other, alarmed.

The Jims look at each other, then back at the Colonel, who looks at them confused, but then it dawns on him, a realization of past interactions. The Colonel drives, a former Marine, staring darkly at the road ahead, with Ricky in the passenger seat using a calculator and jotting numbers down in a notebook for his upcoming math test.

After a beat, as Ricky continues his calculations, he realizes a response is expected from him, so he sighs and then looks at his father.

Jane and Angela are standing with two other teenage girls, who then move away from them. The Colonel's Ford Explorer, a popular SUV model for families, pulls up, and Ricky gets out. Angela stares at Jane, then her mouth widens into a smile as Jane suddenly finds Ricky standing in front of her, looking at her intently with his eyes searching hers. Jane is unnerved and has to look away, so Ricky smiles and walks off while Angela shoots a wide-eyed look at Jane, who ignores it, pretending nothing happened. The Colonel and Barbara are seated on a couch, a plush piece of furniture they bought at a summer sale, watching television, and while the Colonel is smiling, enjoying the show with the lightheartedness of a sitcom, Barbara just stares. The Colonel chuckles at a joke and startles her, as the three of them stare at the TV like strangers in an airport, surrounded by unfamiliarity. We follow them as they pass a sign directing guests to the ballroom, and inside the ballroom, well-dressed real estate professionals stand in clumps, chatting, a scene reminiscent of a business networking event, while catering waiters serve hors d'oeuvres like miniature quiches and smoked salmon canapés. Carolyn's jaw tightens, then she drags Lester toward a silver-haired man and his much younger wife, whom we recognize as Buddy Kane, the Real Estate King, noted for his numerous best-selling books on property management.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
