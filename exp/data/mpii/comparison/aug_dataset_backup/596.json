Dumbledore's hair and beard are buffeted by the strong wind, but his eyes are affixed on an inverted v-shaped fissure in the cliff face as Harry and Dumbledore are inside a rocky cavern. Dumbledore sharpens a knife against a rock and pierces his right hand with it. Harry looks at the wound as Dumbledore smears his bloodied hand across the rock face, which starts to crumble, and he steps back beside Harry and they both watch. Using their wands as torches, they enter a previously-hidden tunnel and approach a lake, looking out across the water with their wands reflected in the dark surface. Dumbledore sends a ball of light across the lake; it rises and falls over the surface of the water, then flares up, illuminating a tiny island in the distance. Dumbledore sets a foot on a half-submerged crystalline rock and stretches out his left hand over the water as the lake at his feet bubbles and churns. Something moves amidst the frothing waters, and a length of chain leaps up into Dumbledore's hands. He passes the end of the chain to Harry, who starts to pull on it as they watch the chain lift something out of the water, revealing the carved prow of a small boat rising in front of them. Harry tugs with greater vigor, hauling the boat towards them, and the boat slowly carries them across the still water towards the island. Reaching it, they scramble out onto the translucent rock where a dip in a rock pedestal forms a crystal basin filled with liquid. Dumbledore passes his hand over the shimmering surface, looks up with a start, uses a large shell as a cup, fills it with the liquid, and drinks.

Harry picks up the shell, steps over to the basin, scoops up more liquid, returns to Dumbledore, and helps him drink, filling the shell again, returning again and again, forcing the liquid into Dumbledore's mouth until the basin is almost empty. Dumbledore, his eyes half closed, presses his lips together, then reluctantly opens his mouth. He opens his mouth, Harry steps back, and Dumbledore raises his head and opens his eyes wide while Harry still holds the empty shell.

This striking scene is the very same craggy cliff depicted on Tom Riddle's postcard, with ominous, dark clouds scattered threateningly behind them. Meanwhile, the powerful sea relentlessly washes over them with spray and spume. Dumbledore's long, flowing hair and equally flowing beard are continuously buffeted by the strong, gusty wind, yet his eyes remain unflinchingly fixed intently on an inverted v-shaped fissure in the rugged cliff face. Meanwhile, both Harry and Dumbledore find themselves standing inside a shadowy, rocky cavern. Dumbledore methodically sharpens a knife against the rough surface of a rock and then deliberately uses it to pierce his right hand. Harry observes the wound with deep concern as Dumbledore smears his bloodied hand purposefully across the rock face, which then begins to crumble away before their eyes. He steps back to stand closely beside Harry, and together they watch the remarkable transformation unfold. Utilizing their wands as makeshift torches, they venture cautiously into a previously-hidden tunnel and approach a vast, enigmatic lake, gazing thoughtfully out across the water with their wands' light reflected in the dark, still surface. Dumbledore sends a glowing ball of light gracefully across the lake; it rises and falls over the water's smooth surface, then unexpectedly flares up brightly, illuminating a tiny island seen in the distance. Dumbledore carefully sets a foot on a half-submerged crystalline rock and stretches out his confident left hand over the churning water as the lake at his feet vigorously bubbles and churns with energy. Something stirs amidst the frothing waters, and a length of shiny chain suddenly leaps up into Dumbledore's waiting hands. He duly passes the end of the chain to Harry, who begins to pull on it with determination as they both watch the chain gradually lift something out of the water, revealing the intricately carved prow of a small boat rising gracefully before them. Harry tugs with greater vigor, steadily hauling the boat closer towards them, and the boat slowly but surely carries them across the still, dark water towards the distant island. Upon reaching it, they scramble out onto the translucent rock, where a dip in a rock pedestal forms a crystal basin filled with a mysterious, shimmering liquid. Dumbledore passes his hand over the glistening surface, looks up with a start of realization, and then uses a large shell as a makeshift cup, filling it with the liquid and drinking deeply. His eyes closed, he drains the shell completely, then opens his eyes and shudders, stepping back from the basin and sitting down with difficulty, covering his ear with his blackened right hand.

Dumbledore's hair and beard are buffeted by the strong wind, which is typical in this coastal region known for its fierce weather, but his eyes are affixed on an inverted v-shaped fissure in the cliff face as Harry and Dumbledore are inside a rocky cavern, once used by smugglers to hide contraband. Dumbledore sharpens a knife against a rock using a technique he learned in his youth, and pierces his right hand with it. Harry looks at the wound as Dumbledore smears his bloodied hand across the rock face, which starts to crumble, revealing an ancient magical mechanism, and he steps back beside Harry and they both watch. Using their wands as torches, they enter a previously-hidden tunnel and approach a lake, said to be enchanted by ancient wizards, looking out across the water with their wands reflected in the dark surface. Dumbledore sends a ball of light across the lake; it rises and falls over the surface of the water, then flares up, illuminating a tiny island in the distance that is rumored to hold powerful secrets. Dumbledore sets a foot on a half-submerged crystalline rock, known to be slippery and treacherous, and stretches out his left hand over the water as the lake at his feet bubbles and churns. Something moves amidst the frothing waters, and a length of chain leaps up into Dumbledore's hands, crafted centuries ago by a master blacksmith. He passes the end of the chain to Harry, who starts to pull on it as they watch the chain lift something out of the water, revealing the carved prow of a small boat designed for stealth and concealment, rising in front of them. Harry tugs with greater vigor, hauling the boat towards them, and the boat slowly carries them across the still water towards the island. Reaching it, they scramble out onto the translucent rock where a dip in a rock pedestal forms a crystal basin, reminiscent of ancient ceremonial altars, filled with liquid. Dumbledore passes his hand over the shimmering surface, looks up with a start, uses a large shell, once used by merfolk for similar rituals, as a cup, fills it with the liquid, and drinks. His eyes closed, he drains the shell, then opens his eyes and shudders, stepping back from the basin and sitting down with difficulty, covering his ear with his blackened right hand, a sign of the potion's powerful effect. Harry picks up the shell, steps over to the basin, scoops up more liquid, returns to Dumbledore, and helps him drink, a task fraught with danger, filling the shell again, returning again and again, forcing the liquid into Dumbledore's mouth until the basin is almost empty.

Dumbledore tries a feather on a stone and taps his right hand against it. Harry glances at the mark as Dumbledore brushes his bloodied hand across the rock face, which begins to glow, and he moves back beside Harry and they both observe. Using their wands as spotlights, they walk into a newly-revealed tunnel and arrive at a lake, gazing out across the water with their wands mirrored in the dark surface. Dumbledore projects a beam of light across the lake; it skims and bounces over the surface of the water, then brightens, revealing a tiny island in the distance.

McGonagall sharpens a spoon against a tile and pierces her left foot with it. Hermione looks at the scratch as McGonagall smears her scratched foot across the tile surface, which starts to tremble, and she steps back beside Hermione and they both watch. Using their scrolls as lanterns, they enter a previously-hidden corridor and approach a meadow, looking out across the grass with their scrolls reflected in the bright surface. McGonagall sends a flash of light across the meadow; it rises and falls over the surface of the grass, then flares up, illuminating a tiny hut in the distance. McGonagall sets a foot on a half-submerged emerald stone and stretches out her right hand over the grass as the meadow at her feet sways and rustles. Something moves amidst the swaying bushes, and a length of twine leaps up into McGonagall's ears. She passes the end of the twine to Hermione, who starts to pull on it as they watch the twine lift something out of the grass, revealing the carved prow of a small sled rising in front of them. Hermione tugs with greater vigor, hauling the sled towards them, and the sled slowly carries them across the still meadow towards the hut. Reaching it, they scramble out onto the opaque stone where a groove in a stone column forms a crystal goblet filled with powder. McGonagall passes her ear over the glistening surface, looks down with a sigh, uses a large book as a cup, fills it with the powder, and eats. Her ears closed, she empties the book, then opens her ears and shudders, stepping back from the goblet and sitting down with difficulty, covering her elbow with her brightened left foot. Hermione picks up the book, steps over to the goblet, scoops up more powder, returns to McGonagall, and helps her eat, filling the book again, returning again and again, forcing the powder into McGonagall's mouth until the goblet is almost empty.

Snape's cloak and sleeves are whipped by the fierce gale, but his eyes are focused on an arched, u-shaped crevice in the mountain face as Ron and Snape are inside a mossy cavern. Snape hones a sword against a boulder and scratches his left arm with it. Ron glances at the injury as Snape brushes his scratched arm across the boulder face, which starts to dissolve, and he moves away beside Ron and they both observe. Using their maps as guidebooks, they navigate a previously-hidden pathway and approach a crater, gazing across the landscape with their maps mirrored in the dim surface. Snape sends a gust of wind across the crater; it rises and dips over the terrain, then bursts forth, revealing a distant clearing in the horizon. Snape places a foot on a half-submerged wooden log and extends his right arm over the ground as the crater at his feet swirls and spins. Something shifts amid the swirling dust, and a length of rope springs up into Snape's hands. He hands the end of the rope to Ron, who starts to tug on it as they watch the rope elevate something from the ground, unveiling the ornate prow of a small raft emerging before them. Ron pulls with increased effort, dragging the raft towards them, and the raft gradually transports them across the quiet landscape towards the clearing. Arriving there, they clamber out onto the opaque log where a recess in a wooden pedestal forms a glass basin filled with liquid. Snape waves his arm over the sparkling surface, glances up suddenly, uses a vast shell as a scoop, fills it with the liquid, and drinks. His eyes closed, he empties the shell, then opens his eyes and trembles, stepping away from the basin and sitting down gingerly, clutching his knee with his ashen left hand. Ron grabs the shell, moves to the basin, gathers more liquid, returns to Snape, and assists him in drinking, filling the shell repeatedly, returning constantly, urging the liquid into Snape's mouth until the basin is nearly depleted. Snape, his eyes partly shut, presses his lips tight, then hesitantly opens his mouth. He opens his mouth, Ron steps away, and Snape lifts his head and opens his eyes fully while Ron still grips the empty shell. Snape licks his lips, and Ron goes back to the basin, picking up a ring and rope lying at the bottom, as he lifts his map."

Dumbledore's cloak and tunic are jostled by the gentle breeze, but his eyes are fastened on a wedge-shaped indentation in the mountain face as Harry and Dumbledore are inside a sandy grotto. Dumbledore hones a feather against a stone and scratches his left forearm with it. Harry observes the scratch as Dumbledore brushes his stained arm across the stone face, which starts to swell, and he slides back beside Harry and they both observe. Using their wands as lanterns, they traverse a previously-unseen passage and advance toward a pond, staring out across the liquid with their wands mirrored in the bright surface. Dumbledore sends a beam of sound across the pond; it glides and echoes over the surface of the liquid, then glimmers, revealing a tiny peninsula in the distance. Dumbledore sets a toe on a partially-drowned shimmering branch and extends his right hand over the liquid as the pond at his feet foams and swirls. Something shifts among the swirling liquids, and a length of thread jumps up into Dumbledore's grasp. He hands the tip of the thread to Harry, who begins to twist it as they watch the thread lift something out of the liquid, exposing the carved stern of a small raft emerging in front of them. Harry twists with greater strength, dragging the raft towards them, and the raft slowly carries them across the calm liquid towards the peninsula. Arriving there, they clamber out onto the clear branch where a curve in a wooden stand forms a glassy basin filled with mist. Dumbledore waves his arm over the flickering surface, glances up with a jolt, uses a tiny jug as a scoop, fills it with the mist, and drinks. His eyes closed, he empties the jug, then opens his eyes and quivers, stepping back from the basin and collapsing with difficulty, shielding his cheek with his stained left arm. Harry lifts the jug, strides over to the basin, ladles more mist, returns to Dumbledore, and assists him in drinking, filling the jug again, returning repeatedly, coaxing the mist into Dumbledore's mouth until the basin is nearly clear.

McGonagall polishes a spoon against a branch and slices her left finger with it. Ron gazes at the scratch as McGonagall rubs her stained finger along the wooden wall, which starts to dissolve, and she steps forward beside Ron and they both observe. Using their hats as lanterns, they walk through a newly-revealed corridor and reach a pond, gazing out over the liquid with their hats mirrored in the clear surface. McGonagall launches a ball of shadow over the pond; it dips and rises beneath the surface of the liquid, then bursts up, revealing a tiny raft in the distance. McGonagall sets a toe on a half-submerged metallic bar and waves her right leg over the liquid as the pond at her heels fizzes and spins. Something shifts within the bubbling liquid, and a coil of rope jumps into McGonagall's arms. She tosses the start of the rope to Ron, who begins to yank on it as they observe the rope drag something from beneath the liquid, exposing the polished mast of a large raft appearing in front of them. Ron pulls with increased enthusiasm, drawing the raft closer to them, and the raft gradually transports them over the calm liquid towards the raft. Arriving, they clamber off onto the transparent wood where a crevice in a wooden platform creates a glass bowl filled with mist. McGonagall waves her foot above the glimmering mist, glances up suddenly, uses a small bucket as a scoop, fills it with the mist, and gulps. Her eyes shut, she empties the bucket, then opens her eyes and quivers, stepping forward from the bowl and sinking down with ease, covering her toe with her reddened left finger. Ron takes the bucket, strides to the bowl, gathers more mist, returns to McGonagall, and aids her in drinking, filling the bucket once more, returning repeatedly, forcing the mist into McGonagall's mouth until the bowl is nearly full. McGonagall, her eyes half open, presses her tongue together, then reluctantly spreads her mouth. She spreads her mouth, Ron steps forward, and McGonagall lowers her chin and closes her eyes wide while Ron still grips the full bucket.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
