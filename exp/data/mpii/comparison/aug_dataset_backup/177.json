Into the chamber comes the sibling, 18, very attractive, as Alan, 18, donning a Halloween disguise and a garb, enters. She titters as the beau leaps into the space. The beau tears off his disguise, unveiling a good-looking young male beneath, and they smooch again with more fervor as she reacts to him. The Vantage swivels away from the pane, pacing uneasily and perturbed, and then springs back from the pane, swiftly prowling down the side of the dwelling, past the Jack-O-Lantern, to a portal, which is swiftly opened as the Vantage moves inside. The Vantage glides quietly through the dwelling into the cookhouse, up to a compartment, which is opened, and a large cleaver is extracted. The Vantage swivels around and moves to the cookhouse portal, looking down a corridor to the front portal. The beau is seen stepping out of the chamber portal, fastening his shirt. Gradually, the Vantage moves into the space, concentrating on the discarded Halloween disguise on the ground, bending down to pick it up, then suddenly covering the Vantage with the disguise through the eye-holes. The Vantage moves gradually down the corridor to the chamber portal, peering inside where the sibling sits at her night-table brushing her hair, still entirely unclothed. The Vantage moves up behind the sibling, and sensing a presence, she spins around, staring at the Vantage and covering her bosom quickly. Suddenly, the Vantage lunges forward as the sibling continues to stare incredulously, and there is a rapid blur as the Vantage drives the cleaver into the sibling's chest and out again almost before it's seen. In a wild convulsion, the cleaver blurs in and out of frame, slashing the sibling ruthlessly as she begins to shriek, tries to fend off the blows with her hands, then suddenly falls out of frame to the ground. The Vantage moves back away from the sibling's lifeless form, spins around, and careens out of the chamber at top speed, racing through the shadowy dwelling to the front portal, out the portal, down the steps, and rapidly up the avenue. The camera careens along in frenzied flight, up the pavement, up a small side passage, down someone's backyard, then comes to a sudden, abrupt halt in front of Mother and Father just emerging from a neighbor's dwelling.

In a frenzied tumult, the feather duster blurs in and out of view, dusting the parrot tirelessly as it begins to squawk, attempts to fend off the strokes with its talons, then all of a sudden drops out of view to the ground. The viewpoint edges away from the parrot's motionless form, twirls around, and rushes out of the library at full speed, sprinting through the dimmed palace to the main gate, out the gate, down the steps, and swiftly up the boulevard. The camera bounces along in panicked retreat, up the pathway, up a tiny lane, down someone's orchard, then halts suddenly, abruptly stopping in front of the Gardener and the Sailor just emerging from a neighbor's cottage.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
