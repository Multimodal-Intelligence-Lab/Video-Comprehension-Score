Jack proceeds to place Joe in the back seat of his patrol car before he steps over to speak with Colonel Nelec, who listens with a facial expression that grows increasingly stern and solemn.\n\nJack briefly steps back to engage further with the Colonel, and Joe, seated in the back of the patrol car, observes as the two men exchange a formal handshake. Later in the day, Joe and Jack make their way back home, where an emotional scene unfolds. Joe's eyes well up with tears, and he directs a piercing glare at his father, Jack, who returns the glare, visibly wrestling with his emotions. Turning away from his son, Jack strides purposefully out of the house, leaving Joe standing alone, looking desolate. His emotions overflow, and a single tear descends down Joe’s cheek, which he hurriedly wipes away with his hand.\n\nAs dusk settles in, Joe gets on his bike, pedaling up a challenging, steep hill until he reaches the entrance gates of a cemetery perched at the summit.

The moment he enters the compound, the vehicle is promptly surrounded by a formidable group of heavily armed soldiers. Inside, Colonel Nelec occupies a seat at Woodward's bedside. Woodward, with his face marred by lacerations from an earlier train crash, fixes a hardened, stony glare at the Colonel from where he lies in the hospital bed.

With a look of embarrassment crossing his face, Joe reaches down to pick up a model train carriage. Alice, wearing her zombie makeup, glances up at Joe, who, despite the situation, manages to crack a smile. At that moment, Charles enters the scene as Deputy Tally is engaged in showing Jack a map, while Deputy Rosko takes a moment to adjust his radio, ensuring it’s tuned correctly. Meanwhile, outside, the Air Force is actively searching a house around which the kids are filming. It is during this tense moment that Jack arrives, and the kids watch with uncertainty as Jack approaches and takes the camera from them. After this, Jack guides Joe towards his patrol car, helping him into the backseat, and then he moves over to converse with Colonel Nelec, whose demeanor shifts to one of seriousness. Joe, seated inside the patrol car, witnesses Jack stepping back over to the Colonel, and he observes the two men engaging in a handshake that suggests a mutual, albeit strained, understanding. The scene shifts later to a moment when Joe and Jack return home. Here, emotions run high as Joe, his eyes brimming with tears, fixes a glaring stare at his father, and Jack returns the glare, visibly struggling to suppress his own turbulent emotions. Jack eventually breaks the tense silence by turning away and marching out of the house, leaving behind a bleakness that envelops Joe, who allows a solitary tear to escape and roll down his cheek, which he then wipes away with his hand. As dusk settles, Joe, seeking solace or perhaps clarity, rides his bicycle up a steep hill, arriving at the gates of a cemetery perched at the top. He cycles between the gravestones, eventually coming to a stop, and sits in silence, lost in thought as he stares into the distance. In his hand, he grips his mother's locket, looking down at it with a mixture of longing and remembrance. His introspection is interrupted by an unfamiliar noise; he looks up, rises to his feet, and retrieves a torch from his rucksack, directing its beam towards a nearby building. Approaching a window, he peers inside and is startled to witness earth being tossed about within, which spooks him, compelling him to retreat swiftly. Meanwhile, Jack navigates his patrol car through the gates of Lilian Air Field, only for the vehicle to be quickly surrounded by heavily armed soldiers, marking the heightened security and tension at the compound. Elsewhere, in a more foreboding setting, Colonel Nelec sits beside Woodward's hospital bed. Woodward, his face visibly scarred from the train crash, meets the Colonel's gaze with a stony glare. Nelec, undeterred, leans in closer to Woodward before offering him a piercing stare and then turning to leave the bedside. As Nelec walks away, his aide, Overmyer, steps forward to inject a toxin into Woodward's intravenous drip, a malicious action that induces convulsions. Overmyer watches the scene with a dispassionate demeanor as Woodward succumbs, while the Colonel, facing away from the bed, stands in silence, waiting for the room to fall quiet once more. Back at Joe’s home, the tranquility of night is broken by a knocking at Joe's window, rousing him from his sleep. He gets up and opens the window to see Alice outside, and he assists her as she climbs in, guiding her hand as she steps down from the desk. Together, they are drawn to the hum of a Cinay projector starting up, and Alice steps forward to watch the film, which reveals tender footage of Joe as a baby held by his mother. In the film, baby Joe gently sucks on the locket she wears, an image that poignantly ties the past and present together for Joe and Alice."

Looking embarrassed, he picks up a model train carriage, a replica from the famed Pennsylvania Railroad, and Alice, in her zombie makeup for the local film project they are engaged in, suddenly looks up at Joe, who smiles. Charles comes in as Deputy Tally shows Jack a map of the recent unusual disturbances in the area, and Deputy Rosko pauses to tune in his radio, hoping to catch any emergency broadcasts.

Jack puts Joe in the back of his patrol car and goes over to talk to Colonel Nelec, a stern officer known for his unwavering approach to military protocols, whose expression hardens. Jack steps back over to the Colonel, and sitting in the patrol car, Joe watches as the two men shake hands, a tense signal of an uneasy agreement. Later, Joe and Jack return home, where Joe, with tears in his eyes caused by an overwhelming sense of disbelief, glares at his father, and Jack glares back, struggling to contain his emotions rooted in paternal concern. Jack turns away and marches out of the house, leaving Joe looking bleak. A tear rolls down Joe's cheek, and he wipes it away with his hand, determined not to show weakness. At dusk, Joe cycles up a steep hill known for its panoramic view of the town and enters the gates of a cemetery at the top, cycling on between the headstones where local heroes were laid to rest. Joe sits silently staring into the distance, looking down at his mother's locket, a treasured family heirloom, which he holds in his hand. Hearing a noise, he looks up, gets to his feet, and takes a torch from his rock sack, a gift from his late mother, shining it on a building nearby, a dilapidated structure long abandoned by its owners. Looking through a window, he can see earth being tossed about inside the building and, spooked by the mysterious activity, he runs off. Jack drives his patrol car through the gates of Lilian Air Field, a restricted military zone, where inside the compound, his car is immediately surrounded by heavily armed soldiers, a testament to the heightened state of alert. Nelec sits at Woodward's bedside, and with his face lacerated from the train crash, Woodward, a former government scientist with shocking secrets, glares stonily back at the Colonel from his hospital bed. Nelec leans in closer to him, then gives him a hard stare, a silent threat, and walks away from the bedside as his aide, Overmyer, injects toxin into Woodward's drip, and he begins to convulse. Overmyer watches this passionately as Woodward dies, a testament to his unwavering loyalty to Nelec's commands, while the Colonel stands with his back to the bed and waits for it to go quiet, signaling completion of another cold-hearted mission. Back at home, Joe is awakened in the middle of the night by a knocking at his window, and he gets up, opening the window to Alice, who climbs in, seeking refuge from her troubled home life. He takes her hand to help her down off the desk and tries the light. A Cinay projector starts up, a cherished relic from his parents' collection, and Alice moves forward to watch the film, which shows footage of Joe as a baby with his mother, a poignant reminder of happier times, where he sucks on her locket as she holds him."

He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
