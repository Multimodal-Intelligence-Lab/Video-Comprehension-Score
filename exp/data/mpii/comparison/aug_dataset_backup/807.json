Ferris observes Hani stride up to the crouching person and remove the covering, then dial a mobile device. Karami accepts the device, and Hani proceeds to Ferris. Karami disconnects, and Hani retrieves the device while Karami gazes up at him. Karami rises, and Hani pecks his cheeks. One of the males hands Karami a cycle, and he departs. Hani saunters over to Ferris, who acknowledges thoughtfully. Subsequently, Ferris, ambling back to his residence, is on the device and perceives someone in his residence. Two SUVs journey through entrances and halt in front of the Jordanian General Intelligence Directorate, where Ferris and Hoffman exit the transports and proceed along passages to join Hani in the consultation chamber. Hoffman grins stiffly, seated, and places a photo on the surface, gazing at Hani, who peers at Ferris. In the SUV, Hoffman puffs a hefty stogie and has a beverage with Ferris on the veranda of his residence, while children play soccer on the patch of land in front of the secure dwelling. Skip stands amid the bazaar as Karami, attired in dark slacks, a light cream blouse, vest, and skullcap, emerges from an entryway and strides through the bazaar. Seeing him, Skip communicates into an earpiece. Sporting sunglasses, Karami strolls deliberately through the marketplace with Skip trailing him. Karami removes his sunglasses and peruses a periodical as he walks down a narrow path with Skip on his tail. Further along the path, a van is reversing. Karami decelerates, glances down at his periodical, and looks round at Skip, who throws out his hands. Karami darts between the van and a structure, sprinting down side paths as the van obstructs Skip's path. Two males leap out, and Skip pounds on the portal before the van advances. Skip squeezes through the gap and runs down the path, but Karami is vanished. Ferris rests on the cot in a treatment chamber at the wellness clinic when Aisha the nurse enters, jabs a needle in his abdomen, and exits. He follows her, passing densely packed concrete edifices with ramshackle flat roofs. Crowds of people swarm on the path, where vendors peddle goods from carts. Ferris strolls along the path with Aisha, who dons a headscarf, and they are photographed. At a clinic, Ferris sits in a waiting area with a collection of women and children; some women regard him curiously and grin. Emerging from her chamber, Aisha beams at Ferris."

Marwan, Hani, and the rest of the men, known for their roles in clandestine operations, get out of their cars, and Hani gestures for Marwan to open the door for Ferris to get out. Ferris, an intelligence officer with a keen eye for detail, watches Hani walk up to the kneeling figure and take off the hood, revealing the captive’s face, then dial a cell phone, likely a secure line for sensitive communications. Karami, a trusted operative within the network, takes the phone, and Hani goes to Ferris. Karami hangs up, and Hani takes the phone back while Karami stares up at him. In a traditional display of respect, Karami stands, and Hani kisses his cheeks. One of the men, following pre-arranged plans, gives Karami a bicycle, a discreet mode of transport, and he leaves. Hani strolls over to Ferris, who nods thoughtfully, considering the implications of their meeting. Later, Ferris, walking back to his modestly furnished apartment in a bustling district, is on the phone and sees someone in his apartment, raising his suspicions. Two armored SUVs drive through heavily secured gates and stop in front of the Jordanian General Intelligence Directorate, the central hub for national security operations, where Ferris and Hoffman get out of the vehicles and head along corridors designed for security to join Hani in the meeting room, a place of strategic significance. Hoffman smiles tightly, sits, and puts a photograph on the table, a common practice in intelligence for identifying targets, staring at Hani, who glances at Ferris. In the SUV, Hoffman smokes a fat cigar, a trademark of his character, and has a drink with Ferris on the balcony of his apartment, while kids play football on the patch of ground in front of the safe house, a frequent scene in urban neighborhoods. Skip stands amidst the market, a bustling hub of local life, as Karami, dressed in dark trousers, a pale cream shirt, waistcoat, and skullcap, emulating local customs, emerges from a doorway and walks through the market. Seeing him, Skip talks into an earpiece, coordinating with his team. Wearing shades, Karami walks purposefully through the marketplace with Skip following him. Karami takes off his shades and reads a newspaper, a discreet way to blend in, as he walks down a narrow street with Skip on his tail. Further down the street, a van, possibly involved in covert activities, is reversing. Karami slows up, glances down at his paper, and looks round at Skip, who throws out his hands in frustration. Karami darts between the van and a building, navigating through the labyrinthine alleyways, and running down side streets as the van blocks Skip's way. Two men jump out, indicating a planned maneuver, and Skip bangs on the door before the van moves forward. Skip squeezes through the gap and runs down the street, but Karami is gone, having skillfully evaded capture. Ferris sits on the bed in a treatment room at the health clinic, a common setting for gathering intelligence under the guise of medical needs, when Aisha the nurse walks in, jabs a needle in his stomach, administering necessary medication, and walks out. He follows her, passing densely packed concrete buildings with ramshackle flat roofs, typical of urban centers. Hordes of people swarm on the street, a sign of the city's vibrant energy, where traders sell produce from barrows, offering a glimpse into local life. Ferris walks along the street with Aisha, who wears a headscarf, signifying her cultural and religious identity, and they are photographed, potentially indicating surveillance. At a clinic, Ferris sits in a waiting room with a group of women and children; some women look at him curiously and smile, perhaps intrigued by his foreign demeanor. Emerging from her room, Aisha smiles at Ferris, suggesting an established rapport between them."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Later, Ferris, on his phone, notices someone in his apartment. He and Hoffman then head to the Jordanian General Intelligence Directorate for a meeting with Hani. Hoffman shows a photo, creating tension. At Ferris's apartment, Hoffman smokes and drinks as kids play outside. Meanwhile, Skip follows Karami through a market, losing him when a van blocks his path. Ferris receives a shot from nurse Aisha at a clinic and follows her outside, where they are photographed amidst bustling streets. Ferris waits in a clinic with women and children, receiving curious smiles. Aisha smiles at Ferris as she exits her room."
