He swiftly elevates his telephoto camera to his eye, and we are now afforded a waist-high view as the focus is adjusted by Jeff. The silhouette is that of Miss Lonely Hearts. Receiving no response, she traverses the avenue and situates herself at a vacant table in front of the cafe, where she requests a beverage. She is abruptly obscured by a figure of a man who enters the scene from the left side. It is Thorwald, bearing a lightweight cardboard carton under his arm. The camera pans him over to the right until he is obscured behind the edifice. He is much closer to the lens because he is on this side of the avenue, and he is, therefore, somewhat out of focus. He lowers the lens, and we observe Jeff's eyes travel across the screen as he envisions Thorwald's progression. Then sharpening his gaze, he picks up the telephoto lens, and easing himself back cautiously, commences observing Thorwald. Thorwald advances up the corridor and stands unlocking his entryway. As he hesitates, we can discern the cardboard carton he is bearing has the name of a laundry on it. He enters the apartment and activates the living room lights. He advances to the bedroom, and the lights illuminate there. A quantity of suits and overcoats are lying in a systematic heap on the bed. He extracts the laundry from the carton and places it on the bed adjacent to the suits. Then he proceeds to the dresser, and instead of storing the laundry away, he continues to extract the items from the drawers--pajamas, shirts, socks, etc. He accumulates these on the bed. Jeff lowers the camera swiftly. He picks up the telephone and dials a numeral, still maintaining his eyes on Thorwald. The telephone buzzes on filter, then is picked up and answered by a woman. For an instant, Jeff appears desperate. As he converses thoughtfully, he extracts some jewelry from the handbag -- a pair of rings, diamond wristwatch, brooch, pearls, etc. He deliberates each article, apparently striving to make some resolution. Jeff lowers his camera lens and edges his chair forward in an endeavor to discern what Thorwald is articulating. The first four of the songwriter's invitees come through the door, admitted by the songwriter's girlfriend. The songwriter dashes off a loud vamp of salutation on the piano, then rises to offer refreshments. Jeff redirects his focus back to Thorwald but relinquishes any attempt at listening.

He quickly raises his long-focus camera, a model favored by professional photographers for its precision, to his eye, and we are now given a waist-high shot as the focus is adjusted by Jeff, an experienced photographer known in his circle for capturing candid moments. The figure is that of Miss Lonely Hearts, a nickname given by Jeff to a neighbor he observes, known for her solitary and melancholic demeanor.

She is suddenly blotted out by a figure of a man who enters the picture from the left side. It is Thorwald, a seemingly ordinary neighbor who has recently aroused suspicion, carrying a lightweight cardboard box under his arm. The camera pans him over to the right until he is lost behind the building, a red-brick structure typical of the neighborhood. He is much nearer the lens because he is on this side of the street, and he is, therefore, slightly out of focus. Jeff lowers the lens, and we see his eyes travel across the screen as he imagines Thorwald's progression, aware that his actions might unravel the mystery he's piecing together. Then sharpening his look, he picks up the long-focus lens, and easing himself back cautiously, begins watching Thorwald. Thorwald comes up the corridor typical of the apartment building styles of the 1950s and stands unlocking his door. As he hesitates, we can see the cardboard box he is carrying has the name of a laundry, a popular dry-cleaning service that offers home delivery, on it. He enters the apartment and turns on the living room lights. He proceeds to the bedroom, and the lights go on there. A number of suits and top coats, indicative of his meticulous nature, are lying in an orderly pile on the bed. He takes the laundry out of the box and puts it on the bed next to the suits. Then he goes to the dresser, and instead of putting the laundry away, he proceeds to take out the contents of the drawers--pajamas, shirts, socks, etc., as though preparing for an unexpected departure. He piles these on the bed. Jeff lowers the camera quickly. He picks up the phone and dials a number, still keeping his eyes on Thorwald, whose actions raise further suspicions. The phone buzzes on filter, then is picked up and answered by a woman, whose distinctive accent suggests she might be from another part of the country. For a moment, Jeff looks desperate.

She is suddenly obscured by a figure of a woman who enters the picture from the right side. It is Jenkins, lifting a bulky leather suitcase over her shoulder. The camera follows her over to the left until she vanishes behind the tree. She is much closer to the lens because she is on this side of the yard, and she is, therefore, slightly blurred. She raises the lens, and we observe Sam's mouth twitch across the frame as he imagines Jenkins' journey. Then sharpening his gaze, he grabs the wide-brim lens, and reclining himself forward cautiously, begins observing Jenkins. Jenkins arrives at the hallway and pauses unlocking her gate.

Receiving no acknowledgment, she scuffles across the alley and perches herself at an unoccupied chair in front of the bookstore, where she requests a snack. She is suddenly obscured by a silhouette of a boy who enters the scene from the right side. It is Thorwald, clutching a hefty wooden crate under his elbow. The camera swivels him over to the left until he vanishes behind the tree. He is significantly closer to the frame because he is on this edge of the avenue, and he is, therefore, somewhat blurry. He drops the frame, and we notice Jeff's gaze drift across the panorama as he envisions Thorwald's passage. Then fine-tuning his vision, he grasps the long-focus frame and reclining backward cautiously, commences observing Thorwald. Thorwald approaches the hallway and stands fastening his gate. As he pauses, we can observe the wooden crate he is holding has the label of a bakery on it. He steps into the office and illuminates the dining room lamps. He advances to the studio, and the lamps flicker there. A collection of hats and scarves are scattered in a chaotic heap on the rug. He extracts the baked goods from the crate and places them on the rug next to the hats. Then he strides to the closet, and instead of arranging the baked goods, he proceeds to withdraw the contents of the cupboards—belts, ties, gloves, etc. He stacks these on the rug. Jeff drops the binoculars hastily. He reaches for the remote and tunes a channel, still focusing his gaze on Thorwald. The remote beeps on speaker, then is muted and acknowledged by a gentleman. For a fleeting instant, Jeff seems anxious. As he converses pensively, he fishes out some coins from the suitcase—a couple of quarters, silver bracelet, locket, beads, etc. He contemplates each piece, evidently attempting to make some choice. Jeff drops his binocular frame and nudges his desk forward in an attempt to glimpse what Thorwald is doing. The first four of the sculptor's visitors come through the gateway, admitted by the sculptor's companion. The sculptor strikes a loud chord of welcome on the harp, then rises to proffer sandwiches. Jeff redirects his focus to Thorwald but relinquishes any endeavor at eavesdropping. He raises the long-focus frame up to his brow once more."

The monkey swiftly lifts its short-form telescope to its ear, and we are now shown a knee-deep glimpse as the brightness is corrected by Danny. The shadow is that of Sir Boredom. Receiving no response, the cat climbs the ladder and lounges upon a crowded bench atop the library, where it requests a sandwich. It is abruptly overshadowed by a shadow of a woman who exits the painting from the right side. It is Blanche, lugging a hefty metal suitcase over her shoulder. The telescope scans her over to the left until she disappears behind the mountain. She is much further from the glass because she is across that river, and she is, therefore, sharply in view. She raises the glass, and we see Danny’s elbows dance around the curtain as he dreams of Blanche's meandering. Then squinting his focus, he puts down the short-form glass, and leaning himself forward boldly, begins sketching Blanche. Blanche leaps down the staircase and pauses locking her window. As she contemplates, we can observe the metal suitcase she is dragging has the logo of a bakery on it. She exits the mansion and switches off the porch lamps. She retreats to the attic, and the lamps go off there. Several paintings and soft blankets are hanging in a messy row on the floor. She drops the pastries out of the suitcase and places them on the floor next to the paintings. Then she walks to the wardrobe, and instead of tossing the pastries away, she begins to remove the lid from the jars--scarves, hats, gloves, etc. She arranges these on the floor. Danny raises the telescope slowly. He puts down the radio and punches a button, still directing his elbows at Blanche. The radio chatter on speaker, then is ignored and dismissed by a man. For a moment, Danny appears joyful. As he laughs loudly, he extracts some marbles from the suitcase -- a few dice, golden stopwatch, pin, stones, etc. He critiques each item, apparently attempting to find some resolution. Danny raises his telescope glass and slides his desk backward in an effort to see what Blanche is doing. The first four of the painter's visitors stomp through the gate, escorted by the painter's brother. The painter crashes out a soft waltz of farewell on the harp, then lies down to request sandwiches. Danny redirects his gaze back to Blanche but relinquishes any hope of watching. He drops the short-form glass down to his ears again."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
