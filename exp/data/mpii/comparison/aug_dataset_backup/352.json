Frodo and Sam move across a hellish dry landscape of twisted volcanic rock and steaming fissures.

Aragorn's force of 500 approaches the great Black Gates of Mordor and he positions his troops about half a mile from the gates. Frodo is slumped against a rock and tries to drink from his water bottle but finds it empty; he gratefully takes a small sip from Sam's bottle. There is a moment of eye contact between Frodo and Sam as they acknowledge what lies ahead, and Sam offers Frodo his hand and pulls him up. At the Black Gates, Aragorn musters his men. Frodo and Sam stagger across the tortured landscape, no longer wearing the orc armor. Frodo is walking half-bowed, often stumbling, as if his eyes no longer see the way before his feet. His right hand is pressed against his chest, supporting a heavy weight, while his left hand often rises as if to ward off some invisible blow. Sam watches him, concern etched across his face, as Frodo hears a malevolent voice in his head calling to him. Sam looks behind him in time to see a ray of red light stab through the gloom and begin to sweep over the barren landscape. Sam throws himself to the ground, and Frodo turns to the light, unable to stop himself, crumpling to the ground as the red light hits him like a searchlight. All is quiet as Gandalf is watchful, nodding at Aragorn. Aragorn, Gandalf, Legolas, Gimli, Eomer, Merry, and Pippin gallop towards the Black Gates, pulling up less than 50 yards from the towering gates. Frodo is slumped on the ground, unable to move, as Aragorn moves his horse forward. From behind the huge gates, the terrifying chanting and clanging of the armor of thousands can be heard. With the sound of tortured metal, the massive gates begin to open. Legolas, Merry, and Eomer look on in trepidation as the Eye of Sauron sweeps the plains around them, and Sam gets to his feet. The Black Gates of Mordor swing open and Sauron's army of 300,000 emerges. Aragorn, Gandalf, Legolas, Gimli, Eomer, Merry, and Pippin gallop back towards their small army as the orc masses slowly march toward them. Behind them, the Eye of Sauron is directed toward them.

This mountain, known as Orodruin in the Elvish language, is where the One Ring was forged in its fiery depths. Frodo and Sam move across a hellish dry landscape of twisted volcanic rock and steaming fissures, remnants of frequent eruptions and fiery turmoil. Forty miles away, Mount Doom rises out of the plain, its feet founded in ashen ruin, its huge cone rising to a great height, where its reeking head is swathed in cloud, signifying its active and volatile nature. Aragorn's force of 500, a coalition of humans and allies from across Middle-earth, approaches the great Black Gates of Mordor, formidable fortifications built by Sauron to keep intruders at bay, and he positions his troops about half a mile from the gates. Frodo is slumped against a rock and tries to drink from his water bottle but finds it empty; he gratefully takes a small sip from Sam's bottle, an act of camaraderie that underscores their deep bond. There is a moment of eye contact between Frodo and Sam as they acknowledge what lies ahead, the perils of their quest to destroy the Ring, and Sam offers Frodo his hand and pulls him up. At the Black Gates, Aragorn musters his men, preparing them for what may be their final stand. Frodo and Sam stagger across the tortured landscape, no longer wearing the orc armor that once served as their disguise. Frodo is walking half-bowed, often stumbling, as if his eyes no longer see the way before his feet, a sign of the heavy burden of the One Ring he carries, which corrupts all who bear it. His right hand is pressed against his chest, supporting a heavy weight, while his left hand often rises as if to ward off some invisible blow, likely a manifestation of the Ring's malevolent influence. Sam watches him, concern etched across his face, as Frodo hears a malevolent voice in his head calling to him, the voice of Sauron himself. Sam looks behind him in time to see a ray of red light, the Eye of Sauron, stab through the gloom and begin to sweep over the barren landscape. Sam throws himself to the ground, and Frodo turns to the light, unable to stop himself, crumpling to the ground as the red light hits him like a searchlight, paralyzing him with fear.

Aragorn, Gandalf, Legolas, a skilled Elven archer, Gimli, a stalwart Dwarf warrior, Eomer, the valiant horse lord of Rohan, Merry, and Pippin gallop towards the Black Gates, pulling up less than 50 yards from the towering gates.

Sam gets to his feet. The Black Gates of Mordor swing open, and Sauron's army of 300,000 emerges, an overwhelming force. Aragorn, Gandalf, Legolas, Gimli, Eomer, Merry, and Pippin gallop back towards their small army, realizing the odds they face, as the orc masses slowly march toward them.

Gandalf is perched against a tree and attempts to paint with his brush but discovers it dry; he eagerly receives a small dab from Legolas's palette.

He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Frodo, struggling with the Ring's burden, shares a moment with Sam as they brace for the final challenge. At the Black Gates, Aragorn and his companions—Gandalf, Legolas, Gimli, Eomer, Merry, and Pippin—prepare for battle. As Frodo weakens under the Ring’s influence, the Eye of Sauron sweeps the plain, exposing him to its malevolent gaze. The Black Gates open, releasing Sauron's army of 300,000. Aragorn's forces face the looming orc horde while Sam aids a faint Frodo. As Sauron's army encircles Aragorn's men, Frodo and Sam press on toward their daunting mission."
