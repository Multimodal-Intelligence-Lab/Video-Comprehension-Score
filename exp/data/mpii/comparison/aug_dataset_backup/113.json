Neff enters the elevator appearing pale and haggard with pain but maintains a deadpan expression as the night watchman joins him. The night watchman pulls the lever, the doors close, and the elevator rises. The door opens to reveal a small dark reception room with a pair of frosted glass doors labeled: PACIFIC ALL-RISK INSURANCE COMPANY - FOUNDED 1906 - MAIN OFFICE, with a little light beyond the glass doors. Neff straightens up and walks heavily out of the elevator, crosses the reception room to the doors, and pushes them open. These lead to a balcony that runs all the way around, overlooking the eleventh floor below, which is filled with desks, typewriters, filing cabinets, and business machines. Neff enters the area from the reception room while the twelfth floor remains dark and some light shines up from the eleventh floor where two colored women are cleaning the offices — one is dry-mopping the floor, the other moving chairs back into position. Neff moves away from the railing with a faint smile on his face and walks past two or three offices towards a glass door labeled with the number twenty-seven and the names: HENRY B. ANDERSON, WALTER NEFF, LOUIS L. SCHWARTZ. Neff opens the door to reveal three desks, filing cabinets, a typewriter on a stand, a dictaphone on a fixed stand against the wall with a rack of records underneath, and telephones on all three desks. Neff enters, switches on the desk lamp, and his head goes far back as his eyes close with cold sweat showing on his face. After staying like this for a moment, exhausted, his eyes open slowly and look down at his left shoulder. His good hand flips the overcoat back, unbuttons his jacket, loosens his tie and shirt, which proves to be quite an effort. He rests for a second, breathing hard with his eyes closed, then fingers a pack of cigarettes in his shirt pocket, pulls it out, and notices there is blood on it. He wheels himself back to the desk, dumps the loose cigarettes out of the packet, some blood-stained and a few clean. He takes a clean one, puts it between his lips, gropes for a match, lights the cigarette, takes a deep drag, and lets smoke out through his nose. Neff then pulls himself toward the dictaphone again while still in the swivel chair, reaches it, lifts the horn off the bracket causing the dictaphone to make a low buzzing sound. He presses the button switch on the horn, the sound stops, and the record revolves on the cylinder as he begins to speak. He then interrupts the dictation and lays down the horn on the desk.",

The night sentinel watches after Neff, relocks the entrance, and follows him to the lift. Neff enters the lift appearing pale and worn with agony but maintains an impassive expression as the night sentinel joins him. The night sentinel pulls the lever, the panels close, and the lift ascends. The entrance opens to disclose a small dim reception chamber with a pair of frosted glass panels marked: PACIFIC ALL-RISK INSURANCE AGENCY - FOUNDED 1906 - MAIN OFFICE, with a little light beyond the glass panels. Neff straightens up and walks heavily out of the lift, crosses the reception chamber to the panels, and pushes them open. These lead to a balcony that runs all the way around, overlooking the eleventh level below, which is filled with desks, typewriters, filing cabinets, and business equipment. Neff enters the area from the reception chamber while the twelfth level remains dark and some light gleams up from the eleventh level where two colored women are tidying the offices — one is dry-mopping the floor, the other repositioning chairs. Neff moves away from the railing with a faint grin on his visage and walks past two or three offices towards a glass panel marked with the number twenty-seven and the names: HENRY B.

Neff opens the panel to disclose three desks, filing cabinets, a typewriter on a stand, a dictaphone on a fixed stand against the wall with a rack of records beneath, and telephones on all three desks.

          "description": "In past the night watchman, Neff is walked in by him without being answered and towards the elevator, he is headed by Neff. After Neff, the night watchman looks, the door is relocked by him, and he follows him to the elevator. The elevator is entered by Neff appearing pale and haggard with pain, but a deadpan expression is maintained by him as the night watchman joins. The lever is pulled by the night watchman, the doors are closed, and the elevator is raised. A small dark reception room with a pair of frosted glass doors labeled: PACIFIC ALL-RISK INSURANCE COMPANY - FOUNDED 1906 - MAIN OFFICE, with a little light beyond the glass doors, is opened to reveal by the door. Neff is straightened up by himself and the elevator is walked heavily out of by him, to the doors he is crossed by him, and they are pushed open by him. These are led to a balcony that runs all the way around, overlooking the eleventh floor below, which is filled with desks, typewriters, filing cabinets, and business machines. From the reception room, the area is entered by Neff while the twelfth floor is remained dark and some light shines up from the eleventh floor where the offices are cleaned by two colored women — the floor is dry-mopped by one, the chairs are moved back into position by the other. From the railing, Neff is moved away by himself with a faint smile on his face and two or three offices towards a glass door labeled with the number twenty-seven and the names: HENRY B. ANDERSON, WALTER NEFF, LOUIS L. SCHWARTZ are walked past by him. By Neff, the door is opened to reveal three desks, filing cabinets, a typewriter on a stand, a dictaphone on a fixed stand against the wall with a rack of records underneath, and telephones on all three desks. By Neff, it is entered, the desk lamp is switched on, and by his head, it is gone far back as with cold sweat showing on his face, the eyes are closed by him. Like this for a moment, exhausted, he stays, and slowly, his eyes are opened and they look down at his left shoulder. The overcoat is flipped back by his good hand, his jacket is unbuttoned, his tie and shirt are loosened, which proves to be quite an effort. For a second, he is rested, breathing hard with his eyes closed, then a pack of cigarettes in his shirt pocket is fingered by him, it is pulled out by him, and on it, he notices there is blood. To the desk, he is wheeled back, the loose cigarettes are dumped out of the packet by him, some blood-stained and a few clean. A clean one is taken by him, between his lips it is put, for a match he gropes, the cigarette is lighted, a deep drag is taken, and through his nose, smoke is let out by him. Toward the dictaphone again, Neff is then pulled by himself while still in the swivel chair, it is reached by him, the horn is lifted off the bracket causing a low buzzing sound to be made by the dictaphone. On the horn, the button switch is pressed by him, the sound is stopped, and on the cylinder, the record is revolved as speaking is begun by him. The dictation is then interrupted by him and on the desk, the horn is laid down."

Neff steps into the elevator, his physical appearance increasingly pale and visibly haggard, indicative of the pain he is suffering.

Gorilla stretches out and hops lightly out of the escalator, crosses the ballroom to the windows, and swings them open.

Gorilla bounces into the area from the ballroom while the sixth floor remains bright and some bells chime up from the fifth floor where two spotted dogs are organizing the studios — one is dry-painting the walls, the other rearranging drums back into place.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
