Rising with graceful fluidity, she begins to pace back and forth across the room, her focus gradually dissipating with each deliberate step she takes. At the same time, he remains deeply engrossed in perusing the policies that he holds firmly in his hands. Eventually, Phyllis comes to a stop, abandoning her pacing, and she returns to her seat, settling comfortably into the same position she had occupied earlier. His gaze inadvertently drifts back to the anklet once more. Neff, with a clear sense of determination, picks up his hat and briefcase, and the two of them make their way toward the archway together. As he crosses the threshold, he hands over his hat and briefcase to her, and proceeds directly to a door marked with lettering. With a grin unmistakably etched on his face, Neff opens the door and steps confidently into a modest executive office. The office lacks tidiness, featuring a spacious desk that occupies one corner, a good-quality carpet, several chairs for seating, a filing cabinet positioned against one wall, and a dictaphone strategically placed on the corner of the desk.

His attire consists of a dirty work shirt and corduroy pants, his hair rough and untidy, his face broad, with small, piggish eyes. In his hairy hand, he clutches a sweat-soaked hat resting precariously on his knee. He takes note of Neff standing just inside the door and casts a cautious sideways glance at Keyes. He pounds his own stomach pit, causing Gorlopis to recoil slightly from the impact. A blank form is placed before him, and after a moment of hesitation, Gorlopis laboriously scribes his signature. He then departs, ensuring the door closes behind him as he leaves. Keyes, with deliberate care, removes the stub of his cigar from his mouth and slowly turns it within the flame of a lit match before directing his focus towards Neff. Neff, still wearing that persistent grin, exits Keyes' office and makes his way back along the balcony, bypassing the bustling commotion of secretaries who scurry in and out of an array of doors. Neff enters his own office, where Anderson, a diligent and hardworking salesman, is seated at one of the desks, meticulously filling out a detailed report. Neff approaches his own desk, letting his eyes fall upon some mail, which he reads briefly before sitting down and leafing through his desk calendar.

The anklet on her leg gleams as she moves, and the camera remains fixed on her. Phyllis reaches the entrance hall, and as she strides toward the front door, her entire figure comes into clear view.

He removes his hat and stands there with a slight, amiable smile. He steps inside as she graciously leads him toward the inviting living room. Together, Phyllis and Neff pass through the archway, and she makes her way to a low tea table positioned in front of the davenport. The table is beautifully adorned with tall glasses, ice cubes, slices of lemon, a pot of tea, and various other items, and she pours herself a refreshing glass of tea."

She rises and walks up and down the room in the sprawling Dietrichson mansion, paying less and less attention. He, who is Walter Neff, an insurance salesman, consults the policies he is holding, which are central to the plot of their clandestine scheme. Phyllis stops in her walk and sits down again, in the same position as before. His eyes fall on the anklet again, a reminder of their conspiratorial bond. Neff takes his hat and briefcase, and they both move toward the archway, designed in the Spanish Colonial Revival style popular in California homes of the era.

He looks cautiously sideways at Keyes, the astute and persistent claims manager, pounds the pit of his stomach, and Gorlopis cringes under the impact, denoting a physical intimidation.

Keyes takes his cigar stub from his mouth and turns it slowly in the flame of a lighted match, a habitual gesture that underscores his contemplative nature, then turns to Neff. Neff walks out, still grinning, comes out of Keyes' office, and walks back along the balcony, past the activity of secretaries busy with the endless paperwork typical of 1940s office life, going in and out of doors, etc. Neff enters his own office, where Anderson, a seasoned salesman who often competes with Neff, sits at one of the desks, filling out a report. Neff goes to his own desk, looks down at some mail, reads it, sits down, and leafs through his desk calendar, flipping through the days that are becoming increasingly perilous.

The anklet glistens on her leg as she moves, and the camera pans on. Phyllis reaches the entrance hall, and as she walks toward the front door her whole body becomes visible. She wears a gay print dress with a wide sash over her hips, typical of the relaxed yet stylish post-war fashion, and opens the door. Outside is Neff, wearing a sport coat and flannel slacks, the casual yet smart attire of the mid-20th century. He takes his hat off and stands there with a little smile, a gesture reflecting the formality and politeness of the time. He comes in as she leads him toward the living room, decorated in an Art Deco style, indicative of the era's design preferences. Phyllis and Neff come through the archway, she heads toward a low tea table which stands in front of the davenport, with tall glasses, ice cubes, lemon, a pot of tea, etc., and she pours herself a glass of tea, a common ritual in American households seeking sophistication."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
