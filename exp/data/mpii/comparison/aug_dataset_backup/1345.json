Despite his desperate efforts, he is unable to avoid the inevitable, leading to a distressing collision. Meanwhile, Alice, taken aback, lets out a gasp of disbelief and abruptly halts the pedaling of her bicycle. She pivots her head, wide-eyed with fear and uncertainty, staring back at her father's car, unsure whether to return to his side. Louis is in a dire situation, profusely bleeding and suffering from severe injuries. With significant effort, he adjusts his position and peers into the cracked glass of the rearview mirror, assessing his predicament. During this time, Alice continues to fixate on the car, completely unaware of a looming figure approaching stealthily from behind her. At the moment she resolves not to return, she turns her focus back to the road, intent on resuming her ride. Louis tries to exit the car, but he is met with excruciating pain, and the door on his side is firmly jammed, forcing him to shift toward the passenger side. After a struggle, Louis finally manages to extricate himself from the confines of the vehicle. He stumbles away, disoriented and overcome with pain, his voice raw and strained as he screams into the air. In the distance, a factory stands imposingly against the backdrop of even more distant mountains, with a menacing plume of smoke spiraling upward into the sky, while the haunting sound of a siren echoes from afar.\n\nElsewhere, Joe is positioned at the counter alongside Charles, who is visibly in a foul mood.

As the filmed scene continues to play, Joe and Charles become embroiled in an argument, with Joe's mind racing, seemingly at a loss for how to process the unfolding events.

In an instant, the camera is toppled onto its side, recording the aftermath and settling debris. Charles steps forward, inadvertently causing the film to be partially projected onto him. Joe advances as well, and the film is cast partially onto him too. However, Joe's attention is drawn to something peculiar on the screen, calling out for Charles’ attention by slapping his arm, eyes firmly fixed on the screen. Charles follows suit, and together they both discern it amidst the train car wreckage: an entity too large, mostly out of frame, bizarre in its shape and flesh, with only its legs visible as it moves out of the frame. On film, and then externally, the ominous wail of an air raid siren begins to sound, its echoes resonating throughout the town."

When Louis finally gets out, he runs from his car, stumbling drunk and bleeding, screaming into the quiet neighborhood, shredding his voice. A distant factory, renowned for its production of steel products, even more distant mountains, known for their hiking trails, and an ominous plume of smoke are seen, while a far-off siren, reminiscent of small-town emergency alerts, is heard.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
