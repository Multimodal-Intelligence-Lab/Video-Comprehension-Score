Don picks up the glass and is suddenly acutely aware of the people at the table and Nat's eyes, which causes the glass to freeze halfway to his mouth. He puts it down and starts playing the nonchalant, casual drinker -- the man who can take it or leave it -- then takes a pack of cigarettes from his pocket, shakes one out, and lights it. As he puts the match in the ashtray, his eyes fall on that jigger of whiskey, so he puts the handkerchief back in his pocket, lifts the glass, and drains it in one gulp. Nat comes up with the bar towel to wipe off the wet ring left by the glass, while Don holds the empty jigger in his hand. From the table in the background, Gloria heads for the powder room, passing Don and running her finger through the neckline of his hair, then she goes on.

He extracts the bills and coins from his pocket and places it on the bar as Nat pours the beverage and returns to pressing lemons. Don lifts the tumbler and is suddenly keenly conscious of the folks at the table and Nat's gaze, which causes the tumbler to halt midway to his lips. He sets it down and commences portraying the blasé, informal imbiber -- the man who can accept it or reject it -- then removes a pack of cigarettes from his pocket, shakes one out, and ignites it. As he places the match in the ashtray, his gaze falls on that jigger of whiskey, so he returns the handkerchief to his pocket, lifts the tumbler, and empties it in one swallow. Nat approaches with the bar cloth to clean off the moist circle left by the tumbler, while Don grasps the empty jigger in his hand. From the table in the backdrop, Gloria heads for the powder room, passing Don and tracing her finger through the neckline of his hair, then she moves on. Don turns back to Nat, gestures at the sack with the apples peeking, but Nat glances and doesn't comprehend until Don, like an illusionist, extracts two apples, revealing the necks of the bottles, prompting Nat to extract one. Nat leans over the bar towards Don as he indicates the empty tumbler for Nat to refill it, and without a shift of expression, Nat pours the subsequent drink. Gloria returns from the powder room, and on her way to her gentleman companion at the table, she traces her finger through the neckline of Don's hair. She is almost beyond him when he seizes her hand and draws her towards him, then Don glances off to the table, and she returns to the table. The camera focuses on the moist circles the damp tumbler has left on the bar, and in two swift transitions, we observe the five circles, then six, then nine. He places the robe with the slippers within it into the case as Wick snaps shut the suitcase and clicks the lock. Wick carries his suitcase and proceeds into the living room, followed by Helen, setting down the suitcase and taking an overcoat from the closet, while Helen turns away from Wick, leans against the wall, hoping he won't perceive that she's weeping. Don, with an empty jigger in his hand, stands at the identical spot, only now leaning with his back against the bar in a place about half occupied with eight patrons at the bar and five tables filled."

The bills and change are taken from his pocket and put on the bar by him as Nat pours the drink and returns to squeezing lemons. The glass is picked up by Don, and he is suddenly acutely aware of the people at the table and Nat's eyes, which cause the glass to freeze halfway to his mouth. It is put down by him, and the nonchalant, casual drinker -- the man who can take it or leave it -- is started to be played by him. Then a pack of cigarettes is taken from his pocket, one is shaken out and lit. As the match is put in the ashtray by him, his eyes fall on that jigger of whiskey, so the handkerchief is put back in his pocket by him, the glass is lifted, and it is drained in one gulp.

This paper bag, often used by locals to discreetly carry goods, reveals a hint of his intentions. He takes the bills and change from his pocket, a gesture indicating both readiness and the casual nature of repeat visits, and puts it on the bar as Nat pours the drink, a classic whiskey, and returns to squeezing lemons, likely for the cocktail of a nearby patron. Don picks up the glass and is suddenly acutely aware of the people at the table, regulars eyeing newcomers with curiosity, and Nat's eyes, which causes the glass to freeze halfway to his mouth. He puts it down and starts playing the nonchalant, casual drinker -- the man who can take it or leave it -- then takes a pack of cigarettes from his pocket, a brand known for its smooth flavor, shakes one out, and lights it. As he puts the match in the ashtray, an ashtray branded with the bar’s logo, his eyes fall on that jigger of whiskey, so he puts the handkerchief back in his pocket, lifts the glass, and drains it in one gulp.

Don, with an empty jigger in his hand, stands at the same spot, only now leaning with his back against the bar in a place about half filled with eight customers at the bar and five tables occupied, capturing the lively yet intimate atmosphere of the establishment."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
