They observe as a military truck with a covered rear pulls into view and travels along the border of the rice field, where it halts. Troopers shove a cluster of five male farmers off the tailboard and into the earth at gunpoint as School Boy looks across at Diaz. The troopers fling armed grenades into the rice field, and the farmers are aligned at the border. Diaz scowls and glances at the suspended severed cranium while one of the troops points his firearm into the air. The farmers take the gunfire as the indication to initiate a sprint across the rice field, stumbling frantically through the water as BN observes aghast and the soldiers wear stern expressions. In slow motion, the farmers' feet slosh through the water, but they all make it successfully to the opposite side of the field and collapse on the embankment. A trooper shouts irately and kicks one of the farmers in the cranium, then raises his firearm, discharging bullets that strike the terrain near the farmers. The troops angrily signal to the terrified men to traverse the field again, but as a trooper raises his firearm, he receives an arrow in the back.

Among these tragic figures, a man's body can be seen, his head gruesomely and partially blown away, while not far off, the haunting skeletal remains of a child become visible. En-Joo, exuding a moody and contemplative demeanor, flicks a cigarette from his hand and lets it fall to the ground. BN, stepping up to take charge, leads the group away from this grim and unsettling sight, but suddenly, a wave of tension captures his attention, setting him instantly on high alert. With instincts finely tuned, BN and the mercenaries swiftly seek refuge behind the charred remnants of a timber framework, now nothing more than a blackened skeleton. Their eyes watch closely and intently as a military lorry, its tail strategically covered, emerges into view, proceeding to drive steadily along the edge of the paddy field, eventually coming to a stop. Soldiers, exuding a commanding and daunting presence, forcefully shove a group of five male peasants from the tailboard and into the dirt, all the while holding them menacingly at gunpoint. School Boy shares a significant, loaded glance with Diaz as the tension in the atmosphere thickens. In a display of calculated precision, the soldiers toss grenades that have been primed into the paddy field, and the peasants are lined up at the edge, their futures hanging in precarious uncertainty. Diaz frowns deeply, casting a telling look at the gruesome sight of a hanging, severed head, just as one of the soldiers raises his rifle and fires a shot into the air. The peasants, perceiving the gunfire as a signal, begin a desperate and frenzied race across the paddy field, moving awkwardly and stumbling frantically through the water. BN observes in horror, while the mercenaries wear expressions marked by grim determination. In slow motion, the peasants' feet splash through the water, yet, despite the chaos, they all manage to reach the other side of the field, ultimately collapsing in exhaustion on the bank. A soldier, consumed by anger, shouts harshly and delivers a brutal kick to one of the peasants in the head, then lifts his rifle, discharging bullets that pelt the ground perilously close to the terrified men. The troops, with aggressive and domineering gestures, command the frightened peasants to undertake the grueling crossing once more. However, just as a soldier lifts his rifle, an arrow suddenly pierces through his back, catching everyone off guard. Emerging from the cover of the trees, Rambo skillfully releases arrows from his bow, leaving School Boy utterly astonished and speechless. Another soldier, making a futile attempt to flee, is struck by an arrow in the back, followed by one in the head, while yet another soldier receives hits in the leg and eye, ultimately falling into the paddy field onto a grenade. The peasants, seizing the unexpected opportunity, scramble hastily and with determination towards BN and the mercenaries, and Rambo joins them, speaking urgently and intensely to BN. Lewis, turning his back on Rambo, is taken aback as Rambo draws an arrow, aiming it with deadly precision directly at Lewis' right eye. The other mercenaries, tense and wary, cover Rambo with their weapons, exchanging looks filled with concern until Rambo finally lowers the bow and arrow from Lewis' face, allowing Lewis to breathe a profound sigh of relief. Together, they move forward as the heavy rain begins to pour with intensity over the military camp at night. Inside the mess hut, the troops sit, engrossed, smoking and drinking beer, their eyes glued to the women performing an exotic dance routine on the stage. Meanwhile, Sarah languishes in a filthy pigsty, her hair disheveled, clothes dirty, and dark circles marking her eyes, as she gazes upwards through the narrow gaps in the floorboards. The commander paces calmly, back and forth, with an air of detachment. Simultaneously, the mercenaries have commandeered the soldiers' truck and are being expertly driven along a dirt track leading towards the camp, with Lewis holding a torch, guiding their way through the darkened landscape."

En-Joo, a mercenary known for his detached demeanor, looks moody and throws away a cigarette. BN, the leader of this ragtag group of soldiers of fortune, guides them away but is suddenly alerted, and BN and the mercenaries take cover behind charred sticks of timber framework, remnants from the village that was torched during the recent skirmish. They watch as a military lorry with a covered tail, a common transport vehicle in conflict zones, pulls into view and drives along the edge of the paddy field, a traditional rice-growing area in Southeast Asia, where it stops. Soldiers, likely conscripts in a regional militia, push a group of five male peasants off the tailboard and into the dirt at gunpoint as School Boy, one of the younger and less experienced mercenaries, looks across at Diaz, a more seasoned veteran with a cautious demeanor. The soldiers toss primed grenades into the paddy field, and the peasants, terrified and clearly forced into compliance, are lined up at the edge. Diaz frowns and glances at the hanging severed head, a gruesome warning meant to instill fear in the local populace, while one of the troops points his rifle into the air. The peasants take the gunfire as the signal to begin a race across the paddy field, stumbling desperately through the water as BN watches horrified and the mercenaries wear grim expressions, well-aware of the deadly game being played out. In slow motion, the peasants' feet slosh through the water, but they all make it successfully to the other side of the field and slump on the bank, exhausted but relieved. A soldier shouts angrily and kicks one of the peasants in the head, showing the brutal treatment they endure, then raises his rifle, firing bullets that hit the ground near the peasants, a scare tactic to maintain control. The troops angrily gesture to the frightened men to cross the field again, but as a soldier raises his rifle, he gets an arrow in the back, a swift and silent kill from Rambo, the legendary Green Beret known for his combat prowess, as he runs through the trees, letting fly with arrows from his bow, a weapon he wields with deadly accuracy, as School Boy looks astonished at the one-man army they have encountered. A soldier gets an arrow in the back as he tries to escape, then one in the head, while another catches one in the leg and eye, falling into the paddy field onto a grenade, causing a violent explosion. The peasants scramble towards BN and the mercenaries, desperate for protection, and Rambo joins them, speaking to BN in a low, authoritative voice that commands respect. Lewis, a mercenary with a burly build and a gruff demeanor, turns his back on Rambo, who draws an arrow on Lewis and aims it at the bald man's right eye, a tense standoff that underscores the mistrust among the group. The other mercenaries cover Rambo with their weapons, glancing at each other worriedly until Rambo lowers the bow and arrow from Lewis' face, making Lewis look relieved, the tension dissipating. They move as rain, a common occurrence during the monsoon season, pelts down on the military camp at night, where the troop sits smoking and drinking beer, numbing themselves to the horrors of war, in the mess hut, watching women perform an exotic dance routine on a stage, a brief distraction from their grim reality. Sarah, a hostage taken during a village raid, languishes in the pig sty with her hair untidy, clothes dirty, and dark bags under her eyes, a testament to her hardship, looking up through gaps in the floorboards as the commander, a man of imposing stature, walks calmly back and forth, pondering his next move. Meanwhile, the mercenaries have commandeered the soldiers' truck, a daring act highlighting their resourcefulness, and are driven along a dirt track towards the camp, with Lewis holding a torch, its flickering light cutting through the darkness of the jungle night."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
