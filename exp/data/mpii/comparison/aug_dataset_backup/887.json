He wraps the robe, made of fine fabric such as velvet, around himself and crosses to the window, where he sees Lizzie in the garden below. She is playing with a dog, a common sight in country estates, trying to wrestle a stick from its mouth. Standing at the window, Darcy watches her every move, captivated by her spirited nature.

He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

          "description": "Darcy glances at the card game in progress then crosses over to Lizzie and takes a seat at a desk while eyebrows are raised  Darcy realizes he is being spoken to and Lizzie smiles as he holds her in a steady thoughtful gaze  Mrs Bennet is being driven in a carriage as Lydia and Kitty excitedly poke their heads out of the window to see the grand red brick facade of Netherfield Hall  Mrs Bennet and the girls are shown in  Meanwhile Darcy walks away and Mr Bingley glares at his sniggering sisters before Lizzie takes a seat  Bingley glances over at Darcy and Lizzie closes her eyes in embarrassment  Darcy is then seen washing in a copper bath as a servant enters and pours a large jug of water over his head and back  Darcy flicks water from his hair leans back on towels against the high end of the bath leaves himself out of the bath and into a dressing gown held open for him by a servant  He wraps the robe around himself and crosses to the window where he sees Lizzie in the garden below  She is playing with a dog trying to wrestle a stick from its mouth  Standing at the window Darcy watches her every move  Meanwhile Mr Hurst is fast asleep in a chair while Mrs Hurst is also seated Lizzie is sitting on Jane's sickbed and gently strokes her sleeping sister's face  Jane slowly opens her eyes and looks weakly at Lizzie who gives her a hopeful smile  In the dining room Miss Bingley's good humor fades and someone stalks across the room as Lizzie is shown in  Two spaniels frighten pheasants from a bush as Lizzie watches the shooting party from Jane's bedroom window  She turns to look at her pale sister who smiles weakly up at her and Lizzie smiles back tearfully  The hunting party makes its way back to Netherfield Hall under a twilight sky  Lizzie turns away from a mirror wearing a white silk gown and the sisters smile at each other  Lizzie then walks down a staircase looks around uncertainly and is startled by a footman  She smiles gratefully looks around nervously unsure of where the drawing room is and walks into a dark corridor  She enters the billiard room where Darcy is playing alone and he swiftly bows to her  Hesitating in the doorway for a moment she hurries out while Darcy looks after her thoughtfully before continuing his game  Later Lizzie is reading a book in the drawing room "
