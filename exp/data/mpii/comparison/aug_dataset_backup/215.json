Eventually, they halt in flawless formation, still intoning, to face the Imperial Sorcerer, who stands before the blazing cross clad in a crimson satin garment and hood adorned with gold. An aisle leads through the center of the formation to the blazing cross, before which a gallows has been constructed. The rearmost rank has halted, facing away, only a few yards from the shrubs that conceal Delmar, Pete, and Everett. As the intoning proceeds, two Klansmen escort a black man, whom they seize by each arm, up the aisle toward the gallows. It is indeed Tommy Johnson. Over in the shrubs, Everett, Delmar, and Pete are straightening up and adjusting their appropriated garments and hoods, having disposed of the color escort. A colossal roar - and now the tiers resume their intoning. The color escort rushes up the aisle to draw up behind the two men escorting Tommy to the gallows. Everett hisses. Tommy glances back over his shoulder. Everett is unaware of the big man approaching from the rear. Whoosh - arriving Big Dan removes the hood from Everett's head. Everett is revealed - in blackface. The intoning suddenly ceases. The crowd is astonished. Big Dan removes the other two hoods - Delmar and Pete, in blackface. Everett, Pete, Tommy, and Delmar, carrying the Confederate banner, are retreating across the neutral ground separating the throng of Klansmen from the blazing cross. The throng chases in full cry. When the interlopers reach the base of the cross, Delmar pivots. He javelins the flagpole up and out toward the chasing throng. Homer Stokes is aghast.

Their movements are akin to a well-rehearsed marching band at the height of a halftime show, as they intersect and shuffle in unison. Eventually, after this precise choreography, they come to a halt, standing in immaculate formation. They continue their chanting, focusing their attention on the imposing figure of the Imperial Wizard. He stands prominently in front of a towering, burning cross, distinguished by his elaborate attire—a red satin robe and hood intricately trimmed with gold. An aisle cuts through the middle of this formation, leading directly to the burning cross, before which a menacing gibbet has been set up. The men in the backmost row have stopped, positioned facing away from the aisle, just a few yards from the bushes that serve as a hiding spot for Delmar, Pete, and Everett.\n\nAs the haunting chanting persists, two Klansmen are seen escorting a black man, gripping him firmly by each arm, as they march him up the aisle toward the ominous gibbet. This man is none other than Tommy Johnson. Meanwhile, hidden within the dense bushes, Everett, Delmar, and Pete are busily straightening themselves, adjusting their commandeered robes and hoods after having cleverly disposed of the color guard. Suddenly, a massive roar erupts, and the ranks resume their rhythmic chanting. The color guard briskly hustles up the aisle to position themselves behind the two men leading Tommy toward his fate at the gibbet. Everett, in a moment of urgency, lets out a hiss. Tommy glances back over his shoulder, sensing the tension. Unbeknownst to Everett, a large man is stealthily approaching him from behind. Without warning, there is a swift whoosh as Big Dan arrives and snatches the hood from Everett's head, leaving him exposed in blackface. \n\nThe chanting halts abruptly. The crowd, caught off guard, is left in stunned silence. Big Dan, with a dramatic flourish, removes the hoods from Delmar and Pete, revealing their disguises in blackface. With the scene now fully revealed, Everett, Pete, Tommy, and Delmar, bearing the Confederate flag, hastily retreat across the neutral ground that separates them from the fervent mob of Klansmen and the burning cross.

Not a single part of the flag touches the ground. The crowd erupts into cheers as Big Dan acknowledges the applause, beaming with pride. But then, from somewhere, another ominous BOINK echoes.

Their synchronized movements resemble those of a well-practiced, perfectly coordinated marching band at the very peak of a halftime show, as they gracefully intersect and shuffle with precise unity. Eventually, after this intricate choreography, they come to a complete halt, standing in an immaculately arranged formation. They continue their haunting chants, directing their collective attention toward the imposing, authoritative figure of the Imperial Wizard. He stands prominently and unmistakably before a massive, towering, burning cross, distinguished by his elaborate, ceremonial attire—a resplendent red satin robe and hood intricately trimmed with shimmering gold. An aisle runs directly through the middle of this formation, leading straight to the burning cross, before which a menacing gibbet has been ominously set up. The men in the backmost row have stopped moving, now positioned facing away from the central aisle, standing just a few yards away from the dense bushes that serve as a hidden observation point for Delmar, Pete, and Everett.\n\nAs the haunting, echoing chanting continues to persist, two stalwart Klansmen can be seen escorting a black man, gripping him with an iron hold by each of his arms, as they forcefully march him up the central aisle toward the foreboding gibbet. This man is none other than Tommy Johnson. Meanwhile, concealed within the dense and tangled bushes, Everett, Delmar, and Pete are busily straightening themselves, adjusting their commandeered robes and hoods after having cleverly dealt with the color guard. Suddenly, a massive, deafening roar erupts, and the ranks resume their rhythmic, unified chanting. The color guard swiftly hustles up the aisle to position themselves strategically behind the two men who are leading Tommy toward his ominous fate at the gibbet. Everett, in a sudden moment of urgency and desperation, lets out a sharp hiss. Tommy, sensing the tension in the air, glances back apprehensively over his shoulder. Unbeknownst to Everett, a large, ominous figure is stealthily approaching him from behind. Without any warning whatsoever, there is a swift whoosh as Big Dan arrives triumphantly and snatches the hood from Everett's head, leaving him exposed in his blackface disguise. \n\nThe chanting comes to an abrupt halt. The gathered crowd, caught completely off guard, is left in a state of stunned silence. Big Dan, with a dramatic and confident flourish, removes the hoods from Delmar and Pete as well, revealing their own disguises in blackface. With the scene now fully revealed, Everett, Pete, Tommy, and Delmar, holding the Confederate flag, hastily retreat across the neutral ground that separates them from the fervent, pursuing mob of Klansmen and the threatening burning cross. The mob gives chase, their voices raised in a howling cacophony as they pursue in full cry. Upon reaching the base of the imposing cross, Delmar makes a decisive and strategic move. He hefts the flagpole with determination and javelins it up and outward, sending it soaring toward the pursuing throng. Homer Stokes is left in utter mortification, completely taken aback by the unexpected turn of events.\n\nThe crowd collectively gasps, their heads tilted back, eyes wide, following the flag's trajectory in an awestruck silence. The only audible sound is the faint fluttering of the flag as it gracefully sails through the air. Homer Stokes' eyes slowly rise, then betray hesitation before starting to fall as the flag reaches its peak and begins its descent. We follow the flag's downward arc toward a sea of upturned white hoods. At the very center of this dramatic spectacle stands bareheaded Dan Teague, his arms outstretched tensely at his sides like a poised and attentive kick-off returner. He squints up with his single good eye, meticulously calculating the distance and trajectory of the descending flag. Suddenly, from somewhere within the scene, a loud BOINK reverberates, reminiscent of a taut wire suddenly snapping. The flag flutters momentarily in the air. The crowd waits in tense, anticipatory silence. Then, with a decisive WHAP! Big Dan expertly brings his hands up and together, successfully catching the flagpole before it reaches the ground. Not a single part of the flag touches the earth. The crowd erupts into enthusiastic cheers as Big Dan acknowledges the applause, beaming with pride. But then, from somewhere within the renewed commotion, another ominous BOINK echoes. As Big Dan's gaze shifts forward again, his smile fades, and his eye traces upward—upward—CREEEEEEK! The fiery cross is twisting and groaning under its own immense weight, and it begins its slow, inevitable descent."

Their movements are synchronized, intersecting paths before halting abruptly, maintaining perfect formation. They continue their eerie chant while turning their attention to the imposing figure of the Imperial Wizard, who stands confidently before them dressed in a striking red satin robe adorned with gold trim, positioned authoritatively in front of the burning cross. This cross is the focal point, marking the center of an aisle created through the middle of the formation, leading directly to where a gibbet has been ominously erected. Positioned at the back of the formation, the last row of men faces away from the spectacle, standing mere yards from the dense bushes that conceal Delmar, Pete, and Everett. Meanwhile, the chanting maintains its intensity as two Klansmen escort a black man, Tommy Johnson, holding him firmly by each arm, guiding him step by step up the aisle towards the menacing gibbet. In the cover of the bushes, Everett, Delmar, and Pete, having overpowered and dealt with the unsuspecting color guard, straighten and adjust the robes and hoods they have appropriated for disguise. A sudden, huge roar erupts as the ranks resume their rhythmic chanting. The color guard, without missing a beat, rushes up the aisle to position themselves strategically behind the men escorting Tommy, who is evidently anxious. Everett, attempting to conceal their plan, hisses quietly, drawing Tommy's backward glance over his shoulder. Unbeknownst to Everett, a large, imposing figure has approached from behind. With a swift, decisive motion, Big Dan arrives and tears the hood from Everett's head, exposing him blatantly in blackface. The chanting ceases suddenly, leaving the crowd in a state of shock and disbelief. Big Dan quickly follows up by removing the hoods from Delmar and Pete, revealing them too in blackface. In this moment of exposure and chaos, Everett, Pete, Tommy, and Delmar, with the Confederate flag in their possession, initiate a hasty retreat across the neutral ground that separates them from the pursuing mob of Klansmen, while the burning cross looms ominously behind them. As the mob surges forward, determined to close in on the intruders, Delmar, in a bold and defiant act, turns suddenly at the foot of the cross. He skillfully javelins the flagpole outward towards the advancing crowd, sending Homer Stokes into a state of incredulous anger. A collective gasp emerges from the crowd as they watch in stunned silence, their heads tilted back, fixated on the fluttering flag. All eyes remain on the flag as it reaches its peak and begins its graceful descent. Homer Stokes' eyes momentarily follow the flag's path, rising and then reluctantly falling. The scene shifts; we are drawn downwards with the descending flag towards a sea of expectant white hoods. Positioned dead center stands bareheaded Dan Teague, arms tensed and at the ready, like a kick-off returner eagerly awaiting the incoming projectile. With his single good eye narrowed in concentration, he calculates the flagpole's trajectory and distance. Suddenly, from an unknown source, a sharp BOINK reverberates, reminiscent of a snapping wire. The flag continues to flutter as an expectant silence envelops the crowd. In one swift, precise motion, Big Dan snaps his hands together, efficiently catching the flagpole without allowing the flag itself to touch the ground, to which the crowd erupts into enthusiastic cheers. Big Dan takes a moment to soak in their adulation, his expression one of beaming pride. Yet, as he gazes back toward the front, his smile fades, replaced by an expression of concern. His eye rises upward, tracking the source of a new sound—a loud, ominous CREEEEEK—emanating from the fiery cross that is now twisting precariously and beginning its descent, threatening to collapse and draw everyone's attention."

          "description": "The ranks of hooded men, chanting in a high hillbilly wail reminiscent of traditional Appalachian music, intersect and shuffle like a marching band at halftime, a spectacle common at college football games across the American South. At length, they stop in perfect formation, still chanting, to face the Imperial Wizard, the leader of the Ku Klux Klan, who stands in front of the burning cross, a sinister symbol of the Klan's racist ideology, dressed in a red satin robe and hood trimmed with gold, which denotes his high rank within the organization. An aisle leads through the middle of the formation to the burning cross, before which a gibbet, an execution device historically used for public hangings, has been erected. The backmost row has stopped, facing away, only a few yards from the bushes that hide Delmar, Pete, and Everett, who are the protagonists of this narrative set in the Great Depression-era South. As the chanting continues, two Klansmen lead a black man, whom they grasp by either arm, up the aisle toward the gibbet. It is indeed Tommy Johnson, a fictionalized version of the legendary blues musician who supposedly sold his soul to the devil. Over in the bushes, Everett, Delmar, and Pete are straightening up and adjusting their appropriated robes and hoods, having disposed of the color guard, an honor guard responsible for carrying ceremonial flags. A huge roar - and now the ranks resume their chanting. The color guard hustles up the aisle to draw up behind the two men leading Tommy to the gibbet. Everett hisses, signaling his companions for action. Tommy looks back over his shoulder. Everett is oblivious to the big man approaching from behind. Whoosh - arriving Big Dan whips the hood from Everett's head. Everett is exposed - in blackface, which they used as a disguise to infiltrate the ceremony. The chanting abruptly stops. The crowd is stunned. Big Dan whips off the other two hoods - Delmar and Pete, in blackface. Everett, Pete, Tommy, and Delmar, bearing the Confederate flag, associated with Southern heritage and often, controversially, with racism and segregation, are retreating across the neutral ground separating the mob of Klansmen from the burning cross. The mob pursues in full cry, baying like hounds in a foxhunt. When the intruders reach the foot of the cross, Delmar turns. He javelins the flagpole up and out toward the pursuing crowd. Homer Stokes, a prominent politician and secret Klan member, is mortified. The crowd gasps and watches, heads tilted back, in silence. The only sound is the fluttering flag. Homer Stokes' eyes rise, hesitate and start to fall as the flag reaches its zenith and starts to descend. We boom down with the hurtling flag toward a sea of upturned white hoods. Dead in the middle is bareheaded Dan Teague, known earlier for his aggressive confrontation with the protagonists. His arms are tensed out at his sides like a waiting kick-off returner, similar to a football player poised to catch the ball. He squints up with his one good eye, a remnant of a previous altercation, judging distance and trajectory. From somewhere, we hear a loud BOINK, as of a wire popping. The flag flutters. The crowd is silent. Big Dan sets and WHAP! He snaps his hands up and together. He has caught the flagpole. The flag has not touched the ground, an act seen as preserving its honor. The crowd cheers. Big Dan looks around, beaming acknowledgement of the cheers. From somewhere, another BOINK. As Big Dan's look reaches front again, his smile fades. His eye tracks up - up - CREEEEEEK! The fiery cross is twisting and starting to fall, its collapse symbolizing the inevitable downfall of hatred and prejudice."

A colossal whoosh - and now the battalions renew their yodeling. The honor guard scurries down the river to line up behind the two astronauts escorting Charlie to the guillotine. Sam murmurs.

Buster O'Leary is aghast. The assembly gasps and gawks, necks craned skyward, in awe. The sole noise is the fluttering banner.

From someplace, we detect a loud TWANG, as of a string snapping. The banner flutters. The gathering is quiet. Max sets and WHAM! He claps his hands up and together. He has grabbed the banner pole. The banner has not grazed the earth. The gathering applauds. Max glances around, radiating recognition of the applause. From someplace, another TWANG. As Max's view turns front again, his grin falters. His eye traces upward - upward - CREEEEEK! The shining lantern is tilting and starting to topple."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Everett, Delmar, and Pete, disguised in robes, have infiltrated the scene. Big Dan reveals Everett, Pete, and Delmar are in blackface, stunning the crowd. As the trio retreats, Delmar throws a Confederate flagpole, and the mob chases them. Homer Stokes is embarrassed when the flag arcs toward Big Dan, who catches it before it hits the ground. The crowd cheers, but the cross starts to fall, casting a shadow over the scene."
