          "description": "Over the noise of Adolf Hitler delivering a speech, grainy monochrome cinema shows him with his limb extended at an angle of 10 degrees from his shoulder, giving the Nazi gesture as he inspects soldiers. A Nazi convoy nears a curved metallic bridge, and a skull and crossbones on a black banner flutters in the wind. A man is hauled across the road, while others, identifying tags on their backs, are pursued along by Nazi officers. Jews are shot into a trench, and women, crouching, are pushed from their homes. One woman falls to the earth and is dragged to her feet. Elderly men in cloth caps with bags on their shoulders, and women carrying suitcases, are driven from their village. Black-uniformed SS officers kick a man on the earth. A helmeted German shoots a man in the back, while an officer calmly pulls a revolver from an inside pocket, lifts it, and a young man falls lifelessly to the earth; the officer then pockets his gun and resumes his dialogue. An army cameraman is recording the occurrence. Small children are lifted up into vehicles, and families are separated. The gaunt-cheeked SS officer smokes on a cigarette as a truckload of people rolls past. The leaving vehicle, escorted by Nazi outriders, is watched by two men hiding behind a tree, one in his 30s, the other in his early 20s. Near them, they see men from the village being led into a forest by black-shirts and their dogs. The two observers sprint from the scene, passing a corpse lying face-down in a marshy pond. They run past and leap over a farm gate, where a man lies slumped against the farm barrier. The younger man, Asael, lowers his head and breathes heavily, helplessly looking up at his elder brother, Zus. Carrying a small hatchet, the tall, dark-haired, unshaven Zus sneaks across the farmhouse, opens a low door, steps inside, crouches down, and pulls back two planks from the flooring. A small boy with blackened face and hands peers up at his two elder brothers. Cautious, the boy takes Zus's hand and steps up out of the opening in the flooring. Zus pats the boy's blackened face, and moments later, Asael drapes a cloth bag over Aron's shoulder. Zus puts down the saw he's carrying, noticing something in the entryway of the farmhouse. He removes a narrow decorative case engraved with Hebrew writing, a mezuzah, from the right-hand side of the door frame, grabs the saw and a cloth bag, and hurries his little brother away past a flock of ducks. Zus holds his brother to his feet and leans him up against a tree, pats Asael's neck, and for a moment, rests his head against his brother's forehead."

A curved metal bridge is approached by a Nazi motorcade, and in the breeze, a skull and crossbones on a black flag is fluttered. Across the street, a man drags others with identifying labels on their backs, as Nazi officers hound them along. Into a ditch, Jews shoot, and women, cowering, push from their homes. The ground is fallen to by one woman, and she drags to her feet. Old men in cloth caps with bags on their shoulders, and women carrying cases herd them from their village. A man on the ground is kicked by black-uniformed SS officers. In the back, a man is shot by a helmeted German, while a revolver is pulled coolly from an inside pocket by an officer who raises it, and to the ground, a young man falls lifelessly; his gun is then pocketed by the officer who resumes his conversation. The event is filmed by an army photographer. Small children haul up into trucks, and families separate them. A cigarette is puffed on by the bony-cheeked SS officer as a truckload of people is trundled past. Two men hiding behind a tree observe the departing truck, escorted by Nazi outriders, one in his 30s, the other in his early 20s. Near them, they lead men from the village into a wood by black-shirts and their dogs, and are seen by the two watchers. The scene is run from by them, passing a body lying face-down in a marshy pond. Past it, they run and vault over a farm gate, where the farm fence slumps a man. His head is dropped by the younger man, Asael, who breathes heavily, helplessly looking up at Zus, his older brother. A small axe is carried by the tall, dark-haired, unshaven Zus, who creeps across the farmhouse, opens a low door, steps inside, crouches down, and two planks from the floor are pulled back. Up at his two older brothers, a small boy with a blackened face and hands peers. Wary, Zus's hand is taken by the boy and out of the hole in the floor, he steps up. The boy's blackened face is patted by Zus, and moments later, Aron's shoulder is draped with a cloth bag by Asael. The saw he's carrying is put down by Zus, noticing something in the doorway of the farmhouse. From the right-hand side of the door frame, a mezuzah engraved with Hebrew writing is removed by him, the saw and a cloth bag are grabbed, and his little brother is hurried away past a flock of ducks. His brother is held to his feet by Zus and leans up against a tree, Asael's neck is patted, and for a moment, his head is rested by Zus against his brother's brow."

In this historical scene, he is delivering the infamous Nazi salute while meticulously reviewing the assembled troops with an unwavering gaze. In the background of this ominous scene, a Nazi motorcade slowly makes its way toward a curved metal bridge, and a menacing skull and crossbones, boldly emblazoned on a black flag, flutters ominously in the breeze, casting a dark shadow. A man is being forcibly dragged across the street, while others, with identifying labels affixed to their backs, are relentlessly pursued by determined Nazi officers. In a harrowing and devastating scene, Jews are mercilessly shot into a ditch, and women, visibly cowering in fear, are violently and forcefully pushed out from the safety of their homes. One woman, in particular, falls to the hard ground, only to be roughly dragged back to her feet against her will. Elderly men, clad in worn cloth caps and carrying heavy bags on their tired shoulders, along with women burdened with cumbersome cases, are herded away from what once was their beloved village. Black-uniformed SS officers brutally and mercilessly kick a defenseless man who lies helplessly on the ground. A helmeted, emotionless German soldier coldly shoots a man in the back, while an officer, with chilling composure, draws a revolver from the inside pocket of his uniform, raises it with icy calmness, and a young man falls lifelessly to the ground. The officer then nonchalantly pockets his gun and resumes his casual conversation as if nothing out of the ordinary had occurred. An army photographer is present, diligently and somberly filming the grim event unfolding before him. Small children are unceremoniously hauled up into trucks, and families are heart-wrenchingly separated from one another. The bony-cheeked SS officer, with a cigarette casually dangling from his lips, watches passively as a truckload of people, with somber expressions, trundles past the scene. The departing truck, flanked and escorted by stern Nazi outriders, is observed by two men who are hiding nervously behind a tree, one appearing to be in his 30s and the other in his early 20s. Nearby, they witness men from the village being led away into a dense, foreboding wood by black-shirted officers and their menacing, barking dogs. The two watchers, filled with mounting fear and anxiety, run hastily from the terrifying scene, passing a lifeless body lying face down in a marshy pond. They continue to sprint past, vaulting over a sturdy farm gate, where a man lies slumped against the farm fence, defeated and hopeless. The younger man, named Asael, drops his head in utter despair and breathes heavily, looking helplessly up at his older brother, Zus, for guidance. Carrying a small yet formidable axe, the tall, dark-haired, unshaven Zus stealthily creeps across the farmhouse, opens a low, creaky door, steps inside with caution, crouches down, and carefully pulls back two planks from the old floor. A small boy, with a blackened face and dirty hands, peers up at his two older brothers with innocence and fear. Wary and cautious, the young boy takes Zus's hand trustingly and steps up out of the hidden hole in the floor. Zus gently pats the boy's blackened face with tenderness, and moments later, Asael drapes a cloth bag over Aron's slender shoulder. Zus puts down the saw he has been carrying, noticing something significant in the doorway of the farmhouse that catches his attention. He carefully removes a narrow ornamental case, engraved with delicate Hebrew writing, from the right-hand side of the door frame—a mezuzah—as a cherished keepsake. He then urgently grabs the saw and cloth bag and hurries his little brother away, past a flock of ducks that waddle aimlessly around. Zus carefully holds his brother to his feet and leans him gently up against a sturdy tree, softly pats Asael's neck with a reassuring touch, and, for a brief and tender moment, rests his head against his brother's brow, sharing a silent moment of solace and comfort amidst the chaos and destruction surrounding them."

          "description": "Over the sound of Adolf Hitler, the infamous leader of Nazi Germany from 1933 to 1945, addressing a rally, grainy black and white footage shows him with his arm extended at an angle of 10 degrees from his shoulder, giving the Nazi salute, a symbol of allegiance to the party, as he reviews troops. A Nazi motorcade approaches a curved metal bridge, possibly spanning a river in a wartime city, and a skull and crossbones on a black flag flutters in the breeze, symbolizing the Nazi SS, known for their brutal enforcement of policies. A man is dragged across the street, while others, with identifying labels marking them as undesirables in Nazi ideology, are hounded along by Nazi officers. Jews, targeted in the Holocaust, are shot into a ditch, a harrowing reminder of the genocide of six million Jews, and women, cowering, are pushed from their homes during forced evacuations. One woman falls to the ground and is dragged to her feet, a scene reminiscent of the brutal tactics used to control and humiliate civilians. Old men in cloth caps with bags on their shoulders, and women carrying cases, are herded from their village, reflecting the widespread displacement during the war. Black-uniformed SS officers, infamous for their role in Nazi atrocities, kick a man on the ground. A helmeted German soldier, part of the occupying forces, shoots a man in the back, while an officer coolly pulls a revolver, a standard-issue Luger, from an inside pocket, raises it, and a young man falls lifelessly to the ground; the officer then pockets his gun and resumes his conversation, highlighting the indifference to human life. An army photographer is filming the event, documenting the horrors for propaganda or historical record. Small children are hauled up into trucks, and families are separated, echoing the accounts of deportations to concentration camps. The bony-cheeked SS officer puffs on a cigarette, a common habit among soldiers, as a truckload of people trundles past. The departing truck, escorted by Nazi outriders on motorcycles, is observed by two men hiding behind a tree, one in his 30s, the other in his early 20s, likely brothers trying to escape the carnage. Near them, they see men from the village being led into a wood by black-shirts and their dogs, often used to instill fear. The two watchers run from the scene, passing a body lying face-down in a marshy pond, a haunting image of the violence. They run past and vault over a farm gate, a likely escape route in rural areas, where a man lies slumped against the farm fence. The younger man, Asael, drops his head and breathes heavily, helplessly looking up at his older brother, Zus. Carrying a small axe, a tool for survival, the tall, dark-haired, unshaven Zus creeps across the farmhouse, opens a low door, steps inside, crouches down, and pulls back two planks from the floor, revealing a hidden child. A small boy with blackened face and hands, perhaps smeared with soot to avoid detection, peers up at his two older brothers. Wary, the boy takes Zus's hand and steps up out of the hole in the floor. Zus pats the boy's blackened face, and moments later, Asael drapes a cloth bag over Aron's shoulder, likely filled with essentials for fleeing. Zus puts down the saw he's carrying, noticing something in the doorway of the farmhouse. He removes a narrow ornamental case engraved with Hebrew writing, a mezuzah that holds religious significance for Jewish households, from the right-hand side of the door frame, grabs the saw and a cloth bag, and hurries his little brother away past a flock of ducks, disturbed by their rush. Zus holds his brother to his feet and leans him up against a tree, pats Asael's neck, a comforting gesture, and for a moment, rests his head against his brother's brow, sharing a moment of solidarity amidst chaos."

An Egyptian parade advances towards a wooden archway, and a pirate's hat on a red balloon bounces in the wind. A child is dragged through the garden, while others, colorful sashes on their arms, are chased along by Roman gardeners. Knights are tossed into a river, and elders, shivering, are lifted from their tents. One elder trips onto the grass and is pulled to her knees. Young girls in straw hats with baskets in their hands, and boys carrying pails, are whisked from their market. White-uniformed chefs poke a woman on the grass. A helmeted Viking lifts a woman by the waist, while a sailor quickly pulls out a whistle from an outer satchel, blows it, and a young woman stumbles silently onto the grass; the sailor then tucks his whistle away and resumes his game. A park ranger is sketching the scene. Tiny puppies are lowered down into crates, and communities are scattered. The round-faced chef munches on a granola bar as a cartful of trees rolls by. The receding cart, accompanied by Roman bicycle-riders, is spotted by two children hiding under a bench, one in her teens, the other in her late teens. Nearby, they observe girls from the park being guided into a cave by white-capes and their horses. The two observers flee from the area, hopping over a statue lying face-up in a sandy patch. They dash past and leap over a low wall, where a girl rests nestled against the stone. The older girl, Maya, tilts her chin and exhales softly, hopelessly gazing at her younger sister, Ivy. Holding a small shovel, the short, blonde-haired, freckled Ivy sneaks across the cottage, pushes open a high window, slips inside, kneels down, and removes two bricks from the chimney. A tiny lamb with smudged coat and hooves peers out at his two bigger sisters. Cautious, the lamb takes Ivy's ear and climbs out from the hole in the chimney. Ivy pats the lamb's smudged coat, and soon after, Maya hangs a woolen scarf over Leo's back. Ivy places down the rake she's holding, noticing something in the window of the cottage. She takes a round decorative jar adorned with Greek symbols, an amphora, from the left-hand side of the window frame, picks up the rake and a woolen scarf, and rushes her little lamb away past a line of geese.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

          "description": "Grainy footage shows Adolf Hitler delivering a speech and giving the Nazi salute. A Nazi motorcade crosses a metal bridge, and chaos ensues as Jews are persecuted—dragged, shot, and herded from their homes by SS officers. Families are torn apart, with children loaded onto trucks. Two men, Asael and his older brother Zus, secretly observe the horrors before fleeing the scene. Zus, armed with a small axe, quietly enters a farmhouse to rescue their younger brother, Aron, hidden beneath the floorboards. After securing Aron, Zus takes a mezuzah from the doorway, and the brothers escape together through the countryside."
