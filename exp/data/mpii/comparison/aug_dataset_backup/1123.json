In the corridor, Harry hears the disembodied voice again and follows the sound. Harry looks around nervously and, taking a deep breath, walks slowly around a corner, stopping at the horrible sight ahead of him. Lit by flaming torchlight, he sees the ghost of Nearly Headless Nick hanging stiffly in mid-air, and a boy, Justin, lying petrified on the ground, his eyes wide open, his arms stuck out in front of him. Harry kneels beside Justin and touches his stiff fingers. Filch the caretaker appears stealthily behind him. Still kneeling beside the petrified Justin, Harry notices a line of spiders quickly scuttling across the floor.

As Harry watches them go, Filch returns with Professor McGonagall, who hurries along the corridor towards Harry and regards the scene with horror. She walks briskly away, and Harry follows her towards an archway with a fiery torch burning on each side. Filling the archway is a huge stone statue of a griffin, with the head and outstretched wings of an eagle and the body of a lion. Harry steps towards it. Professor McGonagall spreads her long fingers and points them at the statue, which slowly turns, and Harry steps onto the circular staircase behind it. As the griffin continues to revolve, Harry is gradually carried upwards. At the top, he steps off and walks down a passage towards a large wooden door leading to a cluttered, circular room lined with glass cabinets, the walls hung with moving portraits of elderly wizards.

On one of the shelves high above his head, he catches sight of a patched and shabby pointed hat. As he stares at the crumpled hat, it starts to speak. The hat scowls, and Harry turns as he hears a faint sound. Behind him, a decrepit bird with tatty orange feathers is balancing on a perch. Harry moves towards the bird and smiles at the odd-looking creature. To his dismay, it suddenly bursts into flames. Harry takes a step back as the bird becomes a pile of ash below its perch.

He rises from the table and places his tomes under his arm, sensing that all the pupils are gazing at him as he swiftly strides out of the chamber. In the hallway, Harry perceives the bodiless voice again and trails the noise. Harry glances around anxiously and, taking a deep breath, strolls slowly around a bend, halting at the dreadful sight ahead of him. Lit by blazing torchlight, he observes the specter of Nearly Headless Nick suspended rigidly in mid-air, and a youth, Justin, lying immobilized on the ground, his eyes wide open, his arms thrust out in front of him. Harry crouches beside Justin and touches his rigid digits. Filch the caretaker materializes surreptitiously behind him. Still crouching beside the immobilized Justin, Harry observes a line of arachnids quickly scurrying across the floor. They follow one another up the wall, over the stone windowsill, and out of the open window. As Harry watches them depart, Filch returns with Professor McGonagall, who hastens along the hallway towards Harry and regards the spectacle with horror. She strides briskly away, and Harry follows her towards an archway with a fiery torch blazing on each side. Occupying the archway is a huge stone effigy of a griffin, with the head and extended wings of an eagle and the body of a lion. Harry steps towards it. Professor McGonagall spreads her long digits and aims them at the effigy, which slowly rotates, and Harry steps onto the spiral stairway behind it. As the griffin continues to rotate, Harry is gradually conveyed upwards. At the apex, he steps off and walks down a passageway towards a large wooden barrier leading to a cluttered, circular chamber lined with glass cabinets, the walls adorned with moving images of elderly sorcerers. The heavy wooden door swings open, and Harry peers cautiously inside. Harry walks up some steps into a smaller room lined with shelves of old volumes. On one of the shelves high above his head, he notices a patched and shabby pointed cap. As he stares at the crumpled cap, it begins to speak. The cap frowns, and Harry turns as he hears a faint noise. Behind him, a decrepit bird with tatty orange plumage is balancing on a perch. Harry moves towards the bird and smiles at the odd-looking creature. To his dismay, it suddenly ignites into flames. Harry takes a step back as the bird becomes a heap of ash below its perch. Dumbledore appears at the top of a flight of stairs just as a tiny head emerges from the heap of black ash, and the baby bird opens its beak."

His long fingers are spread and pointed at the statue by Professor McGonagall, which slowly turns, and onto the circular staircase behind it, Harry steps.

Towards the bird, Harry moves and at the odd-looking creature, he smiles. To his dismay, into flames it suddenly bursts. A step back is taken by Harry as into a pile of ash the bird becomes below its perch.

While looking around with some trepidation, he takes a deep breath to steady himself and cautiously walks around a corner. Here, he is met with a shocking and horrible sight that makes him stop in his tracks. In the light provided by flickering torches, he is horrified to see Nearly Headless Nick's ghost hanging unnaturally rigid in mid-air. Nearby, a boy named Justin lies on the ground, petrified, with unblinking eyes and his arms awkwardly outstretched in front of him. \n\nKneeling beside the motionless Justin, Harry reaches out to touch his stiff fingers, feeling the unnerving coldness. At that moment, Filch, the caretaker, inexplicably appears behind Harry, approaching with his usual stealth. Remaining in his kneeling position next to the petrified Justin, Harry's attention is suddenly drawn to a line of spiders scurrying hurriedly across the floor.

Rising deliberately from the table, he carefully gathers his collection of books, tucking them securely under his arm. As he does so, he can almost feel the eyes of every student in the room upon him, watching with an intensity that makes the air seem thicker. He quickly makes his way out of the room, his footsteps echoing in the sudden quiet. Once in the corridor, Harry halts momentarily as the familiar, unsettling disembodied voice reaches his ears once more. Driven by a mixture of curiosity and trepidation, he follows the elusive sound, looking around with a nervous darting of his eyes. Drawing in a deep breath to steady himself, he walks cautiously around the corner, only to abruptly stop, confronted by a scene both surreal and chilling. Bathed in the flickering glow of the flaming torches that line the walls, the ghost of Nearly Headless Nick appears suspended in mid-air, frozen in a stiff posture. Beneath him lies a boy, Justin, petrified on the cold stone floor, his eyes locked wide open, his arms extended rigidly before him. Compelled by concern, Harry kneels down beside Justin, reaching out tentatively to touch his unyielding fingers. At that moment, Filch the caretaker emerges unexpectedly, his presence almost spectral in its stealth. Still on his knees beside the motionless Justin, Harry's attention is caught by a line of spiders, their movements quick and purposeful as they scuttle across the floor. He observes them with a mix of intrigue and dread, watching as they march in single file up the wall, over the weathered stone windowsill, and out into the open world beyond. But his observation is cut short as Filch returns, this time with Professor McGonagall in tow. She hurries down the corridor towards him, her expression swiftly shifting to one of horror as she comprehends the scene before her. Without hesitation, she turns and walks briskly away, prompting Harry to follow her. They move towards an archway flanked by fiery torches, where a grand stone statue of a griffin stands sentinel, its eagle head and outstretched wings contrasting with its lion's body. Approaching the statue, Harry watches as Professor McGonagall spreads her fingers with a deliberate elegance, pointing them towards the statue. In response, the stone griffin begins to turn, revealing a hidden circular staircase. Harry steps onto it, and the revolving motion gently carries him upwards. As he reaches the top, he steps off the staircase and proceeds down a passage that leads him to a large wooden door. He pushes it open to reveal a cluttered, circular room lined with glass cabinets, its walls festooned with portraits of elderly wizards, each one animated with life. Stepping into the room, Harry ascends a small set of steps into a more intimate space, where shelves brimming with old books rise towards the ceiling. His gaze travels upwards until it settles on a shelf above, where he spots a patched and shabby pointed hat perched incongruously. To his surprise, as he focuses on the crumpled hat, it begins to speak with a knowing scowl. Just then, Harry's attention is diverted by a faint sound behind him. Turning, he sees a decrepit bird with tatty orange feathers precariously balancing on a perch. Drawn by curiosity, Harry moves closer, offering a tentative smile to the odd bird. However, his expression shifts to one of shock and dismay when the bird unexpectedly bursts into flames, its body disintegrating into a pile of ash beneath the perch. Startled, Harry instinctively takes a step back. But amid the blackened piles of ash, a tiny head slowly emerges, a baby bird pushing its way into the world and opening its beak as Dumbledore arrives at the top of a flight of stairs, observing the transformation with a serene presence."

Harry puts down his quill and closes his book, which contains the challenging spells and magical theories they are currently studying in Defense Against the Dark Arts. He gets up from the table and puts his books under his arm, sensing that all the students, who have recently been whispering rumors about him, are staring at him as he quickly walks out of the room. In the corridor of Hogwarts, the ancient castle known for its enchanted architecture and mysterious corridors, Harry hears the disembodied voice again and follows the sound. Harry looks around nervously and, taking a deep breath, walks slowly around a corner, stopping at the horrible sight ahead of him. Lit by flaming torchlight, he sees the ghost of Nearly Headless Nick, the Gryffindor house ghost who was beheaded in a botched execution in 1492, hanging stiffly in mid-air, and a boy, Justin Finch-Fletchley from Hufflepuff, lying petrified on the ground, his eyes wide open, his arms stuck out in front of him. Harry kneels beside Justin and touches his stiff fingers. Filch the caretaker, notorious for his disdain towards students, appears stealthily behind him. Still kneeling beside the petrified Justin, Harry notices a line of spiders quickly scuttling across the floor. They follow each other up the wall, over the stone windowsill, and out of the open window, seemingly escaping from an unseen threat. As Harry watches them go, Filch returns with Professor McGonagall, the stern Deputy Headmistress and Transfiguration professor, who hurries along the corridor towards Harry and regards the scene with horror. She walks briskly away, and Harry follows her towards an archway with a fiery torch burning on each side. Filling the archway is a huge stone statue of a griffin, a mythical creature symbolizing courage and leadership, with the head and outstretched wings of an eagle and the body of a lion. Harry steps towards it. Professor McGonagall spreads her long fingers and points them at the statue, which slowly turns, revealing that it conceals a secret passage. Harry steps onto the circular staircase behind it. As the griffin continues to revolve, Harry is gradually carried upwards to the headmaster's office. At the top, he steps off and walks down a passage towards a large wooden door leading to a cluttered, circular room lined with glass cabinets, the walls hung with moving portraits of elderly wizards, some of whom were former headmasters. The heavy wooden door swings open, and Harry peers cautiously inside. Harry walks up some steps into a smaller room lined with shelves of old books, many of which contain ancient and powerful magic spells. On one of the shelves high above his head, he catches sight of a patched and shabby pointed hat, the Sorting Hat, which originally belonged to Godric Gryffindor and decides students' Hogwarts houses. As he stares at the crumpled hat, it starts to speak, offering cryptic advice. The hat scowls, and Harry turns as he hears a faint sound. Behind him, a decrepit bird with tatty orange feathers is balancing on a perch, which Harry recognizes as Fawkes, Dumbledore's phoenix known for its ability to be reborn from its ashes. Harry moves towards the bird and smiles at the odd-looking creature. To his dismay, it suddenly bursts into flames, a natural part of a phoenix's life cycle. Harry takes a step back as the bird becomes a pile of ash below its perch. Dumbledore, the wise and revered headmaster of Hogwarts, appears at the top of a flight of stairs just as a tiny head pokes out from the pile of black ash, and the baby bird opens its beak, marking the rebirth of Fawkes."

The penguin looks around nervously and, taking a deep breath, walks slowly around a puddle, stopping at the horrible candy cane ahead of it. Lit by flaming streetlight, it sees the dolphin of Nearly Headless Rex hanging stiffly in mid-air, and a chair, Marshmallow, lying petrified on the grass, its eyes wide open, its arms stuck out in front of it. The penguin kneels beside Marshmallow and touches its stiff noodles. The giraffe the veterinarian appears stealthily behind it.

He rises from the bench and tucks his papers under his jacket, feeling that all the teachers are glaring at him as he swiftly marches out of the hall. In the hallway, Ron detects the echoing noise once more and tracks the noise. Ron glances around anxiously and, exhaling slowly, strides cautiously around a bend, halting at the dreadful vision ahead of him. Illuminated by flickering candlelight, he spots the specter of Moaning Myrtle hovering solemnly in mid-air, and a girl, Hannah, lying motionless on the ground, her eyes staring wide, her hands frozen in front of her. Ron crouches beside Hannah and taps her rigid fingers. Peeves the poltergeist emerges sneakily behind him. Still crouching beside the motionless Hannah, Ron observes a trail of beetles briskly darting across the tiles. They trail each other up the wall, over the stone frame, and out of the ajar window. As Ron observes their departure, Peeves returns with Hagrid, who rushes along the hallway towards Ron and surveys the scene with shock. She paces quickly away, and Ron trails her towards an entrance with a blazing candle flickering on each side.

Hagrid unfurls her wide hands and gestures them at the likeness, which gradually spins, and Ron steps onto the revolving platform behind it. As the dragon continues to spin, Ron is slowly lifted upwards. At the top, he disembarks and strolls down a corridor towards a massive iron gate leading to a cluttered, round hall lined with glass displays, the walls adorned with animated portraits of ancient witches. The solid iron gate swings open, and Ron peers cautiously within. Ron ascends a few steps into a smaller chamber lined with racks of ancient manuscripts. On one of the racks high above his head, he notices a patched and tattered umbrella. As he gawks at the wrinkled umbrella, it begins to sing. The umbrella grimaces, and Ron turns as he detects a distant murmur. Behind him, a shabby cat with scraggly green fur is balancing on a beam. Ron approaches the cat and grins at the peculiar animal. To his shock, it suddenly crumbles into embers. Ron takes a step backward as the cat turns into a mound of dust beneath its beam.

Harry peers around cautiously and, exhaling slowly, wanders leisurely around a bend, halting at the horrifying spectacle ahead of him. Illuminated by flickering lantern light, he sees the phantom of Nearly Headless Nick swaying limply in mid-air, and a child, Justin, lying frozen on the tiles, his eyes wide in terror, his legs extended beneath him.

Still crouched beside the frozen Justin, Harry observes a line of beetles slowly creeping across the ceiling. They trail each other down the wall, past the wooden sill, and into the closed window.

Rupert glances around anxiously and, inhaling deeply, tiptoes cautiously around a tree, pausing at the delightful spectacle before him. Illuminated by moonlight, he sees the shadow of Nearly Featherless Fred dangling gently in the starry sky, and a sheep, Gerald, reclining mesmerized on the grass, its eyes shut tight, its hooves pointing upwards. Rupert crouches beside Gerald and pats his rigid hooves. Grim the gardener appears quietly behind him. Still crouching beside the mesmerized Gerald, Rupert observes a trail of ants rapidly marching across the soil. They follow each other down the hill, over the mossy log, and into the open tunnel. As Rupert watches them leave, Grim returns with Professor Snapdragon, who dashes across the meadow towards Rupert and surveys the display with amazement. She strolls quickly away, and Rupert trails her towards an entrance with a glowing lantern dangling on each side.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
