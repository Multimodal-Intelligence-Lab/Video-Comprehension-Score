Her gaze lingers on him briefly before she turns and proceeds inside, leaving Ben standing, looking up at the entrance. Ben then enters his sedan, furiously pulls at his seat belt to secure it, and yells. Inside, a middle-aged woman sits at a table in Emily's kitchen, and Emily clears the dishes, taking them to the basin and leaving the nurse, Kate, at the table. Emily looks out of the window to see Ben toiling in the garden, and she observes him before walking through to the French doors in the living room and going out into the flourishing garden where Ben is bending from the waist down and uprooting weeds, pulls out more weeds, grins, and continues working. Emily observes him and then turns back to regard him. Ben, whose shirt sleeves are rolled up to his elbows, follows her to double timber doors, which she unlocks with a padlock.

On him, her eyes are briefly lingered before the inside of the house is entered by her, leaving Ben standing and looking up at the door. His saloon is then gotten into by Ben, the seat belt is angrily tugged at to fasten it, and a scream is let out by him. At a table in Emily's kitchen, a middle-aged woman is seated, and the plates are cleared by Emily, taken to the sink, and the nurse, Kate, is left at the table. Out of the window, Ben is seen by Emily while he is working in the garden, and he is watched by her before the French windows in the living room are walked through by her, leading her out into the lush garden where weeds are being pulled up by Ben as he bends from the waist. More weeds are tugged out by him, and a smile is given as the work is continued. He is watched by Emily, and then her gaze is turned back. Ben, with his shirt sleeves rolled up to his elbows, follows her to double wooden doors, which are unlocked by her with a padlock. As they enter, shafts of hazy, golden light are flooded into the workshop, and paper is taken by Emily, a flywheel is pedaled, and an angelic woman with butterfly wings is printed, which is studied by Ben. Their gazes are met by Ben, and an impish smile is given by Emily. In a large, sunny field, long grass is sat in by Emily as Ben is watched playing with Duke, who bounds to retrieve something. A gleeful smile is given by Emily as they are seated in shade with Duke beneath a tree. His head is shaken by Ben, a faint nod is given, and she is watched intently by him as around her cardigan is folded by her. A glance is given by Emily at Ben, and a blade of grass is played with. Into each other's eyes, their gazes are directed, and a nod is given by Ben, but her gaze is averted by Emily as her long, dark hair frames her soft features, and a strand of hair is drawn back behind her ear by her. Her speech is studied by Ben before his eyes are lowered. Down, Emily looks, and a wistful smile is shown, and Ben's hand reaches out, a brief caress of her hair is given. Later, out of Ben's car window, Duke's head is seen sticking as the avenue of palm trees is driven along to Emily's quaint clapboard house, and outside it, they pull up. A sweet, uncertain smile is given by Emily to Ben and a nod is shared before a beam is given and his cheek is leaned over and kissed by her. Emotional, Ben feels as she gets out, retrieves Duke from the back seat, and looks in through the open front passenger window. Emily is watched by Ben as she goes, then his gaze is turned away pensive, a faint smile flickering across his features before the car is driven off. In the sunny field, Ben is found sitting and smiling to himself. Later, outside Emily's house, Ben's saloon is parked, and the lights are killed, his seat belt is removed, and through Emily's pretty garden, he sneaks towards the workshop, a shoulder bag is carried as soft light shines out from the house."

She then turns away, her body pivoting as she moves inside, leaving Ben standing alone, his gaze fixed on the now-closed door. Ben, feeling the weight of the moment, walks to his saloon, opens the door, and slides into the driver's seat.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
