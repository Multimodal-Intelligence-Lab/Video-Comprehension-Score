Harry turns as the open mouth of a grinning shark, which has human legs and arms and wears red shorts, looms towards him. The shark flashes past, bites through the rope, and swims off with Hermione. Harry takes a firm grip on Ron's arm, then looks at the girl with long, fair hair floating alone. He looks cautiously at the merpeople hiding in the weeds and uses his wand to release the little girl.

Hermione appears on the surface with the shark, which immediately transforms its head into Viktor Krum. Wrapped in a dressing gown, Fleur watches the water anxiously. As Harry struggles towards the surface with Ron and the little girl, he notices his hands are no longer webbed and is suddenly attacked from below by a horde of vicious little squid-like grindylows with sharp teeth and many legs nipping at his ankles.

Harry is with Crouch as wild-haired Moody glares at Crouch with his mad, rolling eye and flickers his tongue. Crouch stares back into Moody's scarred face, then walks away looking confused. Moody swigs from his hip flask. The scene shifts to the forest at night, where Harry sees a black hat lying on the ground and clutches the scar on his forehead.

Harry rotates as the open mouth of a smiling fish, which has human limbs and wears red trunks, looms towards him. The fish flashes past, bites through the cord, and swims off with Hermione. Harry grasps Ron's arm tightly, then gazes at the girl with long, light hair drifting solo. He glances cautiously at the merfolk hiding in the plants and uses his wand to free the little girl.

Suddenly, a sharp, pointed trident is pressed threateningly against his throat.

With a swift flick of his wand, he successfully frees Cho from her bindings, an act that frightens the merman into retreating. In a timely manner, Cedric taps his watch, prompting Harry to nod in understanding and draw his own wand with the intention of releasing Hermione. However, his action is abruptly halted as a sharp, pointed trident suddenly materializes at his throat. In response, Harry turns his head and is met with the startling sight of a grinning shark bearing down on him. This shark, unusually equipped with human legs and arms, wears a pair of bright red shorts. With a swift and fluid motion, the shark darts forward, using its powerful jaws to sever the rope binding Hermione before swimming away with her in tow. Turning his attention to Ron, Harry grips his arm firmly, then shifts his gaze to a girl with long, fair hair who floats nearby in solitude. Aware of the merpeople concealed within the surrounding weeds, he cautiously uses his wand to liberate the little girl as well. As the clock ticks closer to eight minutes to 12, Cedric and Cho emerge first from beneath the water's surface and promptly make their way ashore. Simultaneously, Dumbledore and Crouch are seen descending the pavilion stairs with urgency. Shortly thereafter, Hermione resurfaces alongside the shark, which instantly transforms its head back into Viktor Krum. Meanwhile, Fleur, wrapped snugly in a dressing gown, watches the water with evident anxiety. As Harry arduously makes his way upward with Ron and the little girl in tow, he becomes acutely aware that the webbing between his fingers has vanished. Suddenly, from below, a swarm of aggressive little grindylows, resembling squid with sharp teeth and numerous legs, attacks him, nipping relentlessly at his ankles. In an effort to fend them off, he attempts to kick them away and releases his hold on Ron and the little girl, thrusting them upward toward safety. With his hands occupied and oxygen running low, he clutches at his neck as the relentless creatures swarm over him, their tentacles threatening to suffocate him. Desperate and fighting for survival, he manages to retrieve his wand, sending forth a burst of sparks that stuns the grindylows, scattering them in all directions. As the threat diminishes, Harry descends to the lake's bottom. At the stroke of twelve, Ron and the little girl surface, and Fleur leans over the water's edge, stretching out her hand in assistance. Deprived of his gills, Harry finds himself drifting helplessly, his gaze fixed on the bright patch of light shimmering above. In a final, exhausted bid for life, he raises his wand, propelling himself out of the water and onto the landing stage, where he gasps for air. Fleur, in a gesture of gratitude and relief, kisses both Harry and Ron and envelops Harry in a warm towel. Observing the scene, Dumbledore amplifies his voice with his wand, while Karkaroff seethes with anger. Standing with Crouch, Harry catches sight of the wild-haired Moody, who scrutinizes Crouch intently, his mad, rolling eye flicking with curiosity. Unnerved, Crouch holds Moody's scarred gaze momentarily before turning away, visibly perplexed. In the background, Moody discreetly takes a swig from his hip flask. The scene transitions to a forest at night, where Harry's attention is drawn to a black hat lying amid the scattered leaves. As he clutches his forehead, marked by the familiar pain of his scar, he notices the lifeless body of a man sprawled on his back among the fallen leaves, a heap of stillness. Compelled to probe further, Harry makes his way to Professor Dumbledore's room, only to find the door closed. In the next moment, Moody opens it, revealing himself to Harry."

Cedric taps his watch as Harry nods and draws his wand to release Hermione Granger, but a sharp, pointed trident, a common weapon among the mythical merpeople known to inhabit the lake, is held at his throat. Harry turns as the open mouth of a grinning shark, which has human legs and arms and wears red shorts, looms towards him, a startling transformation showcasing Viktor Krum's skill in Transfiguration. The shark flashes past, bites through the rope, and swims off with Hermione. Harry takes a firm grip on Ron Weasley's arm, then looks at the girl with long, fair hair floating alone, Gabrielle Delacour, Fleur Delacour's younger sister and one of the hostages. He looks cautiously at the merpeople hiding in the weeds, known for their non-interference policy during the task, and uses his wand to release the little girl. As the time approaches eight minutes to 12, a crucial deadline for completing the task, Cedric and Cho are the first to the surface and swim ashore. Meanwhile, Albus Dumbledore and Bartemius Crouch hurriedly descend the stairs of the pavilion atop the lake, anxious to see the task's outcome. Hermione appears on the surface with the shark, which immediately transforms its head into Viktor Krum, revealing his mastery of partial Transfiguration. Wrapped in a dressing gown, Fleur watches the water anxiously as her sister's fate hangs in the balance. As Harry struggles towards the surface with Ron and the little girl, he notices his hands are no longer webbed due to the diminishing effect of the Gillyweed, a magical plant that allows underwater breathing, and is suddenly attacked from below by a horde of vicious little squid-like grindylows, creatures notorious for their aggressive nature in the lake, with sharp teeth and many legs nipping at his ankles. He tries to kick them away and releases his grip on Ron and the little girl, pushing them up towards the surface. As he clutches his neck, hundreds of the creatures attack him, almost suffocating him with their tentacles. Struggling to fight them off, he pulls out his wand, and sparks fly, a standard defensive spell that stuns the grindylows and sends them flying in all directions. Harry then sinks to the bottom. As the clock strikes twelve, Ron and the little girl bob to the surface, and Fleur leans out over the water, stretching out her hand. With his gills now gone, Harry drifts helplessly, looking up at the patch of light above his head, and with a last desperate effort, raises his wand and rockets out of the water onto the landing stage, gasping for air. Fleur kisses Harry and Ron and wraps a towel around him, while Dumbledore puts his wand to his throat, amplifying his voice with the Sonorus charm, and Igor Karkaroff, headmaster of Durmstrang Institute, is furious. Harry is with Crouch as wild-haired Alastor Moody, a former Auror with a reputation for paranoia, glares at Crouch with his mad, rolling eye and flickers his tongue. Crouch stares back into Moody's scarred face, then walks away looking confused, an unsettling development in the ongoing mystery surrounding him. Moody swigs from his hip flask, a habit that raises suspicion. The scene shifts to the Forbidden Forest at night, a place of many secrets and dangers at Hogwarts, where Harry sees a black hat lying on the ground and clutches the scar on his forehead, a remnant of Voldemort's attack on him as a baby. A man lies on his back among the fallen leaves, heaped in and lifeless, a grim discovery hinting at dark events. Harry approaches Professor Dumbledore's room, finds the door closed, and Moody opens it, foreshadowing the revelations to come."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
