The wall of flames continues with a deafening roar as we are craning down. The faint National Anthem ends, and we hear the WEEEEEEEE of a test pattern, amidst the roaring. At the cut: WHOOOOOSH! A huge low-rider motorcycle bursts through the flames, its engine roaring even louder than the fire. Its driver is a huge leather-clad hellion, and the chains worn by the Biker clank ominously as he rides. The Biker roars out of frame, and as he roars into frame, his rear tire lays down a wake of fire as he roars along a ribbon of desert highway. Tracking with and also in on the Biker from behind as he roars along a strip of highway, he is reaching for the two sawed-off shotguns which are strapped crisscross across his back. Pulling the Biker from a distance as he levels the two shotguns, the tracking camera pulls back further to reveal a running jack-rabbit keeping pace with us in the foreground.

The Biker is approaching in the distant background, and CRACK - from afar, the foreground lizard is blown away.

Ed's eyes are fixed on the baby, observing its every movement, while Gale, Evelle, and Hi shift their gaze upward to look at Ed, their expressions frozen in a state of dumbstruck surprise. After a brief pause, Ed shifts her gaze to Hi, and Gale leans in close to Hi, his face etched with sincere concern, and whispers something under his breath, his words barely audible. An awkward silence envelops the room as Ed turns away and exits, the sound of the bedroom door slamming shut echoing in the air. Gale, now seated, meticulously studies his thumbnail, his eyes focused intently on the small detail, while Evelle's gaze is fixed on the ceiling, lost in thought. Still examining his thumb, Gale continues the conversation, his attention divided. Sometime later, Hi enters the room on tiptoe, his footsteps light and cautious. Ed lies in bed, her back turned to the room, facing the wall, with only the back of her head visible. Hi approaches the bed and sits gingerly on its edge, careful not to disturb Ed. With a gentle smile, he extends a finger through the bars of the crib, playfully engaging with the baby. The faint sound of the TV set in the living room filters into the room, momentarily startling Hi, but he quickly resumes playing with the baby. Ed eventually turns to face Hi, and he reciprocates, turning to meet her gaze. The scene shifts, and we find ourselves looking straight down at Hi, who is now asleep in bed, the perspective craning down to capture the moment. For a brief instant, a wall of flames appears, accompanied by a roaring sound, as the camera continues to crane down. The wall of flames persists, its deafening roar filling the air, as the camera maintains its downward movement. The faint strains of the National Anthem come to an end, replaced by the high-pitched WEEEEEEEE of a test pattern, blending with the roar of the flames. Suddenly, with a WHOOOOOSH, a massive low-rider motorcycle bursts through the flames, its engine roaring even louder than the fire. The driver, a huge leather-clad hellion, rides with an air of menace, the chains adorning the Biker clanking ominously as he speeds forward. The Biker roars out of the frame, and as he re-enters the frame, his rear tire leaves a trail of fire in its wake as he speeds along a ribbon of desert highway. The camera tracks with and zooms in on the Biker from behind as he races along the strip of highway, his hand reaching for the two sawed-off shotguns strapped crisscross across his back. The camera pulls back further, revealing a running jack-rabbit in the foreground, keeping pace with the Biker. With a CRACK, the first shotgun fires, spurting orange, and the rabbit in the foreground keels over. The Biker swings the other gun around, and on a rock in the foreground, a desert lizard basks in the sun. As the Biker approaches from the distant background, another CRACK rings out, and the lizard in the foreground is blown away. The camera captures the empty desert road stretching away, with a lone desert flower blooming in the foreground. The Biker roars into the frame, and as he speeds away, the flower bends with the draft of his passing and then bursts into flame. From behind, the camera booms down as it tracks the Biker, approaching the crest of a rise, capturing the relentless momentum of his journey."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Gale studies his thumbnail while Evelle stares at the ceiling. Later, Hi joins Ed, who faces the wall in bed, and quietly interacts with the baby in the crib. The TV sound filters in, surprising Hi, but he continues playing with the baby. Ed and Hi finally face each other. Suddenly, a wall of flames and roaring is seen, followed by the sound of the National Anthem and a test pattern. A massive motorcycle bursts through the flames, driven by a leather-clad Biker. The Biker speeds along a desert highway, laying fire in his wake, and reaches for his shotguns. He shoots a rabbit and a lizard, both in the foreground. As the Biker continues, a blooming desert flower bends and bursts into flame, and we approach the crest of a rise."
