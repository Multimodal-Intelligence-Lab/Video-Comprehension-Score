Willie taps Fats on the lapel to signal it's his break, and Sausage, an old-timer who once played in competitive circuits, sends the cue ball down the table to begin the game. Fats, a legendary pool player often compared to the likes of real-life icon Rudolph Wanderone, makes a good break, leaving the cue ball teetering over the far corner pocket. Eddie, who has the reputation of a young prodigy in the pool scene, looks at the lineup of the balls, then sets down his cue and walks over to the washroom, where he glances at Bert as he sprinkles powder on his hands to maintain grip. He turns, snatches up his cue, and rams a bank shot into the pack, a daring maneuver that requires perfect precision, pocketing the one ball as the others scatter. The crowd, a mix of enthusiasts and casual bystanders drawn to Ames for its famed intense atmosphere, applauds, and Eddie moves swiftly to his next shot, talking to Bert as he plays. Bert and Fats exchange glances as Eddie returns to his game, with Fats waiting for his turn, puffing steadily on his cigarette, an unfiltered Chesterfield—a choice of many serious players of the era.

A depressed Fats watches, as the clock over the door, a relic from the 1940s ticking away with solemnity, reads six o'clock. Fats remains in his seat with a drink in hand, likely a strong scotch he often favored, as Eddie slips into his jacket, helped by Preacher. Eddie unscrews his cue thoughtfully, a ritual among pool players signaling the end of a session, while Bert's bodyguards, known for their intimidating presence, stand waiting for instruction. Fats listens, head bowed, as Bert's men start to move forward but are stopped by a gesture from Bert, who tries to smile a friendly smile, a rare occurrence for the usually stern man. Eddie puts away his cue, staring at Bert before looking over at the downcast face of Minnesota Fats, who looks up at Eddie. Eddie takes his cue case and heads for the door, pausing for a moment to look around at the rows of empty tables, a scene of many past games, before leaving.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
