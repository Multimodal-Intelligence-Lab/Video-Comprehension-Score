Mozart halts abruptly with a small chortle and chortles again, while Orsini-Rosenberg glances at him bitterly and the Italian group - Orsini-Rosenberg and Bonno - guffaw quietly. An apologetic pause follows, and Bonno chortles in uneasy mirth. Joseph is evidently satisfied and indicates, having desired this outcome all along. Then he observes the manuscript in his hand and proceeds to the forte-piano, positioning himself. The others, except for Salieri, cluster around the manuscript held by the King. Mozart performs the initial portion of the march with lethal precision, reiterates a phrase skeptically, and all the courtiers glance at Salieri. Mozart performs another phrase, gradually transforming the music into the renowned march to be utilized later in The Marriage of Figaro, Non Piu Andrai. He performs with escalating abandon and skill as Salieri observes with a fixed smirk, and the court observes, amazed. Mozart concludes in tremendous splendor, removes his hands from the keys with a gesture of victory, and beams. We observe the olivewood crucifix, and Salieri is seated at his desk, gazing at it. Cavalieri vocalizes her subsequent scale, then another, and another, executing her drills in earnest. As she reaches a prolonged high note, the orchestral support in the midst of Martern Aller Arten from Il Seraglio begins, and the music shifts from drills to the exceedingly ornate aria. We dissolve on the vocalist's face, and she is suddenly not merely turbaned but painted and attired entirely in a Turkish fashion, and we are present.

Cavalieri is singing Martern Aller Arten from the line Doch du bist entschlossen, and the music rises again for the last 30 bars of the aria. All the cast is aligned on stage, and Mozart is conducting with joyful enthusiasm. Mozart bows frantically, over-stimulated. She advances toward Mozart with arms extended in a ridiculous theatrical movement, then notices the Emperor, gazes at him, fascinated, her mouth agape, unable even to curtsy."

Joseph, noticing Mozart's awkwardness, steps in to assist him while Von Strack and Bonno nod in acknowledgment. Meanwhile, Orsini-Rosenberg also nods, albeit with a noticeable lack of enthusiasm. Mozart's initial laugh is abruptly followed by another quick giggle. Observing him, Orsini-Rosenberg casts a sour look, yet the Italian faction—consisting of Orsini-Rosenberg and Bonno—laughs discreetly. A pause, marked by embarrassment, follows, during which Bonno giggles nervously, finding amusement in the situation. Joseph appears clearly pleased with the outcome, nodding in satisfaction, as it aligns with his hopes all along. It is then that he spots the manuscript in his hand and decides to head toward the forte-piano, seating himself there with focus. Gathering around the King, everyone else, except for Salieri, moves toward the manuscript now held by the royal figure. Mozart begins to play the first half of the march with an air of precise accuracy, although he repeats one phrase with a hint of doubt. All the courtiers in the room direct their gazes toward Salieri. Mozart then explores another musical phrase, gradually transforming the piece into the famous march that will later feature prominently in The Marriage of Figaro, known as Non Piu Andrai. His playing becomes increasingly spirited and displays great virtuosity, all while Salieri observes with a steadfast smile, and the rest of the court watches in astonishment. With grand flourish, Mozart concludes his performance, lifting his hands triumphantly from the keys and grinning broadly. The scene shifts, revealing the olivewood cross, as Salieri sits at his desk, fixating on it. Meanwhile, Cavalieri diligently continues her vocal exercises, moving from one scale to the next. As she achieves a sustained high note, the orchestral accompaniment of Martern Aller Arten from Il Seraglio seamlessly joins in, transforming the exercises into the highly ornate aria. We dissolve into the scene on the singer’s face, who is now not only wearing a turban but also fully painted and adorned in traditional Turkish attire, and the performance is underway.

Cavalieri continues with Martern Aller Arten, specifically from the poignant line Doch du bist entschlossen, as the music swells once again for the final 30 bars of the aria. The entire cast is assembled on stage, with Mozart conducting with palpable excitement and joy. Overcome with enthusiasm, Mozart bows frantically, practically vibrating with excitement. Moving toward Mozart, arms outstretched in an exaggerated theatrical gesture, she stops short at the sight of the Emperor. Mesmerized, she stares at him, mouth agape, struck by awe and unable even to perform a curtsey."

Observing the scene unfold, Orsini-Rosenberg casts a sour, disapproving look in Mozart’s direction. Yet, the Italian faction—this being Orsini-Rosenberg and Bonno—laughs discreetly, attempting to conceal their amusement.

Mozart halts his laughter for a brief moment, only to let out another giggle, creating an awkward atmosphere. Orsini-Rosenberg eyes him with a sour expression, while he and Bonno, representing the Italian faction, exchange discreet laughter. A pause filled with embarrassment follows, during which Bonno also giggles, this time out of nervous amusement, unable to hide his reaction. Observing the unfolding scene, Joseph appears visibly pleased, nodding subtly, having anticipated and desired this outcome all along. He then shifts his attention to the manuscript he holds and proceeds to the forte-piano, deciding to seat himself there. All others, with the exception of Salieri, converge around Joseph, where he holds the manuscript, creating a collective focus on this pivotal document. As Mozart begins to play the first half of the march, his execution is marked by deadly precision. He comes across a phrase he finds questionable and repeats it with some uncertainty, prompting all the courtiers to glance at Salieri for his reaction. Mozart then embarks on playing another phrase, infusing it with his flair and gradually transforming it into the renowned march that will later find its place in The Marriage of Figaro as Non Piu Andrai. As he plays, his interpretation grows increasingly bold and skillful, with Salieri watching him intently, his smile unchanging. The court stands in astonishment, their eyes fixed on Mozart as he brings his performance to a glorious conclusion, taking his hands off the keys with a flourish of triumph and beaming with satisfaction. We then see the olivewood cross as the scene shifts to Salieri, who is at his desk, lost in contemplation as he gazes at it. Meanwhile, Cavalieri is diligently practicing, singing her scales one after the other, fully immersed in her vocal exercises. As she reaches a sustained high note, the orchestral accompaniment of Martern Aller Arten from Il Seraglio begins, seamlessly transitioning her exercises to the exceptionally intricate aria. Our focus dissolves onto the singer's face, and in an instant, she is transformed, adorned in a full Turkish manner, complete with elaborate makeup and costume, signaling the performance's commencement. The house is packed with an eager audience, all eyes fixed on the spectacle conducted by Mozart from the clavier situated amidst the orchestra. Von Strack, Orsini-Rosenberg, Bonno, and Von Swieten cluster around the Emperor in a private box, paying close attention. In a separate box, sits an overdressed, middle-aged woman accompanied by three young girls, one of whom is Constanze; they are identified as the formidable Madame Weber and her daughters, Constanze, Josefa, and Sophie. The audience, including the Webers, is completely enraptured by the unfolding drama on stage, with Madame Weber particularly thrilled by the very experience of being present at such a grand event. As Cavalieri sings the dramatic lines starting from Doch du bist entschlossen, the music swells once more, carrying the performance into the final 30 bars of the aria. As the cast stands in an orderly line on stage, Mozart conducts them with exuberant joy, his excitement palpable and infectious. Overcome with emotion, Mozart bows repeatedly, almost frantically, his overexcitement evident. Cavalieri, noticing Mozart, begins to move toward him with arms theatrically outstretched, yet she becomes entranced upon seeing the Emperor, her eyes fixed on him, her mouth agape, paralyzed by awe and unable to muster even the semblance of a curtsey."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
