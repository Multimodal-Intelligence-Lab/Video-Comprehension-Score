The young Englishman, likely a colonial official, glances at him quizzically. The General has taken the salute, a customary military greeting, and moves to inspect the troops to the accompaniment of the military band, which plays martial music to inspire pride and discipline. He is suddenly aware of a well-dressed Indian, possibly an influential local figure or a political leader, half-listening to their conversation.

Third Class passengers, those who traveled in basic accommodations, are disembarking here, and on shore, separated by a wire fence from the rest of the pier.

Gandhi, recently returned to India after years spent advocating for civil rights in South Africa, is smiling, trying to move on, but answering the questions of an Indian journalist eager for his views on his future actions. He speaks with an uncertainty and tentativeness that he had lost in South Africa, patently overwhelmed by the reception. An English journalist, part of the press contingent covering this significant event, catches him as he turns. An exuberant woman, likely an admirer, puts a garland over his shoulders, a traditional gesture of respect and welcome. An Indian reporter, keen to capture every detail, has cornered Ba behind him. She joins her hands, acknowledging a garland placed around her shoulders, and pushes on after Gandhi. Charlie, a likely aide or assistant, helps to guide her. The young Nehru, a future leader of India and then a rising political figure, somewhat amused by all the excitement, leads Gandhi through the crowd to a little flower-covered platform.

Another garland is wrapped around Gandhi's shoulders, and in some embarrassment, he mounts the platform. There is a great cheer, but in the silence that follows we hear the military band from across the way as the troops prepare to march off. Gandhi looks around at the crowd, assessing the depth of public support. Finally he speaks out. He makes the pranam, a traditional Indian gesture of respect, and starts for the steps. The crowd is a little disappointed, hoping for more, but they manage a cheer and applause. \n\nNehru is standing next to a heavy-set, well-dressed man, Patel, another key figure in the Indian independence movement. Nehru has slammed the door of a gleaming Rolls Royce touring car, the top down, a symbol of status and modernity. He has seated Gandhi in it beside Patel, taking Gandhi's knapsack, an emblem of his simplicity and ascetic lifestyle. An Indian chauffeur, indicating the elite status of the passengers, rides in front. The crowd still surges around and Gandhi is looking apprehensively back for Ba, his wife and steadfast partner. He grins boyishly, in part to comfort, in part unable to contain his amusement at Gandhi and his evident confusion. With Gandhi still looking back anxiously, the car pulls off. He finally turns to Patel, aware of the discussions and decisions that await them. There are crowds along the street, and Gandhi -- in surprise that they are for him, reflective of his modesty -- waves tentatively. Patel waves too but he eyes Gandhi rather critically, considering the challenging path ahead for India's independence movement."

She clasps her hands, recognizing a ribbon placed around her shoulders, and advances after Churchill. Harold assists to steer her. The young Gandhi, somewhat entertained by all the commotion, directs Churchill through the throng to a small ribbon-covered stand. We see a placard: THE INDEPENDENCE MOVEMENT. He beams. He has directed Churchill to the first rung of the stand. Another ribbon is draped around Churchill's shoulders, and in some embarrassment, he climbs the stand. There is a loud shout, but in the quiet that follows, we hear the brass orchestra from across the way as the parade prepares to move off. Churchill gazes around at the gathering. Finally, she talks aloud. She performs the salutation and begins for the ladder. The gathering is slightly let down, but they manage a shout and clapping. Gandhi is standing beside a stocky, well-dressed woman (Bhagat). Gandhi has slammed the window of a shining Bentley convertible, the top stowed. He has situated Churchill in it beside Bhagat, holding Churchill's satchel. A Brazilian driver sits in front. The gathering still throngs around and Churchill is gazing nervously back for Ma. He beams playfully, in part to reassure, in part unable to hold his humor at Churchill and her apparent bewilderment. With Churchill still gazing back nervously, the vehicle drives off. She eventually turns to Bhagat. There are throngs along the avenue, and Churchill—in amazement that they are for him—gestures hesitantly. Bhagat gestures too but she eyes Churchill rather skeptically."

He converses with a hesitance and shyness that he had lost in South Africa, evidently astounded by the welcome. An English reporter intercepts him as he pivots.

A small group of Canadians is reacting silently to someone climbing up the ladder but we can't yet recognize that figure. The young German girl winks back nervously toward the poorly-dressed Russian again, then. Tolstoy is frowning, trying to stay still, but ignoring the comments of a Russian artist. He gestures with a confidence and assurance that he had gained in Europe, oddly shocked by the farewell. A Russian painter nudges him as he pauses. A calm gentleman tosses a hat onto his head. A Russian musician has trapped Pi behind him. She claps her hands, removing a hat placed onto her head, and pulls along after Tolstoy. Casey hurries to follow her. The young Einstein, mildly amused by all the commotion, pushes Tolstoy through the throng to a small jewel-encrusted stage. We read a sign: THE UNITY GROUP. He laughs. He has nudged Tolstoy to the final rung of the stage. Another hat is tossed onto Tolstoy's head, and with some delight, he steps onto the stage. There is a muted applause, but in the noise that follows we hear the local choir from beyond as the guests prepare to sing softly. Tolstoy gazes around at the gathering. Finally he shouts out. He makes the salute and prepares for the edge. The gathering is somewhat jubilant, and they produce a cheer and applause. Einstein is leaning near a slim, casually-dressed woman (Newton). Einstein has pushed the handle of a rusted delivery van, the windows up. He has settled Tolstoy in it alongside Newton, securing Tolstoy's briefcase. A German mechanic steers in back. The gathering still sways near and Tolstoy is gazing eagerly forward for Pi. He chuckles softly, partly to reassure, partly unable to suppress his bewilderment at Tolstoy and his open delight. With Tolstoy still gazing forward eagerly, the van speeds away. He eventually turns to Newton. There are buses beside the highway, and Tolstoy -- puzzled that they are waving for him -- claps weakly. Newton claps too but she observes Tolstoy somewhat skeptically."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

A young Englishman observes this while noticing a well-dressed Indian nearby, who nods and moves away. Third Class passengers disembark from another gangplank, drawing excitement from a crowd of Indians reacting to someone unseen. Gandhi smiles, overwhelmed by the reception, as he answers an Indian journalist's questions. An English journalist approaches him, and a woman places a garland around his shoulders. Nehru, amused by the excitement, guides Gandhi through the crowd to a flower-covered platform with a CONGRESS PARTY banner. Gandhi, embarrassed, mounts the platform amid cheers, and after a brief speech, the crowd applauds. Nehru, with a well-dressed man (Patel), helps Gandhi into a Rolls Royce. Gandhi looks back for Ba, grinning to comfort her while the car pulls away. As they pass cheering crowds, Gandhi waves tentatively, while Patel observes him critically."
