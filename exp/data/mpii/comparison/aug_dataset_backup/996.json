Meanwhile, Daisy and Gatsby, visibly shaken but continuing on, drive away from the horrific scene. Another driver steps out of their vehicle, frozen in shock while observing the scene before them. Nearby, the eerily unseeing eyes of the oculist Dr. T.J. Eckleburg's tattered billboard stare vacantly into the suffocating darkness of the night. Soon after, Tom arrives at the scene accompanied by Nick and Jordan, and in no time, the authorities have arrived. They all exit the car and make their way towards Wilson's dimly lit garage, now bustling with a concerned and restless crowd. As Tom catches sight of the devastated Wilson, he frowns deeply, his face crumpling with concern, while law enforcement officers endeavor to control the crowd's movement. One officer solemnly drapes a white sheet over Myrtle's lifeless form, which has been placed on a nearby table, prompting Tom to draw nearer. With trembling hands, he gingerly pulls back the sheet, the sight of Myrtle's blood-splattered body causing him to gasp aloud as Nick quietly removes his cap in a gesture of respect. Tom stands transfixed, his gaze fixed on the tragic scene, raising his hand in a plea to the officer. Tear-filled eyes meet Nick’s as Tom shakes his head sorrowfully. Standing with his head lowered in profound sorrow, Tom attempts to restrain Wilson, while an elderly officer casts a dubious glance before turning to leave. Wilson remains seated, looking utterly bewildered and lost, as Tom takes a seat across from him, offering him a drink. With tears cascading down his cheeks, Wilson brings the glass to his lips, then presses it against his face in a moment of overwhelming despair. Gently, Tom reaches out to touch Wilson’s cheek, allowing Wilson to lean against his shoulder, and offers quiet comfort by rubbing his back soothingly. Meanwhile, Nick carefully replaces the sheet over Myrtle's body. Tom, with Jordan by his side, drives away solemnly, their eyes fixed on the road ahead as the gleaming blue coupe fades into the enveloping darkness. Upon arrival at the grand Buchanan mansion, the servants promptly emerge, and Tom steps forward to open the imposing front door. Nick and Jordan linger on the porch, where an intense exchange occurs as Tom scrutinizes Nick, who returns the stare with a frown of his own. With an air of indifference, Tom disappears inside as Nick shoots a critical glare at Jordan, who is stunned by the unfolding events and hastily follows Tom into the house. Deeply troubled and with tension etched across his brow, Nick turns and walks away, still reeling from the evening's tumultuous events. He glances around, almost incredulous, before approaching Gatsby, who is concealed behind a shrub. Suddenly, Gatsby's face is illuminated by the lights that flicker on in the mansion, and Henri, the butler, steps onto the porch, surveys the surrounding area, but, failing to notice anyone, retreats back indoors. Nick regards Gatsby with a grave expression, and Gatsby, in turn, casts his gaze towards the glowing windows above, then back at Nick. A vivid flashback seizes the moment, showing Gatsby grabbing the wheel in panic as both he and Daisy watch in horror, frozen, as Myrtle collides with the windscreen and is violently thrown into the air—Daisy, to note, is in the driver’s seat. As Gatsby recounts the events, he appears distraught, and Nick, wide-eyed, observes him intently. Gatsby then turns away, overcome with emotion, and rests his face in his hand. Nick offers a brisk nod, attempting a weak smile, and discreetly makes his way around to the terrace, where his gaze falls upon Tom and Daisy seated at the dining table, engaged in conversation. Daisy sits in a daze while Tom edges closer to her, enveloping her in one arm as they remain together in their shared moment."

Another driver, stepping out of their vehicle, is frozen in shock, observing the heartbreaking scene that unfolds before them. Nearby, the eerily unseeing eyes of the oculist Dr. T.J.

Soon after this tragic discovery, Tom arrives at the scene, accompanied by Nick and Jordan, and it is not long before the authorities have also arrived.

As Tom catches sight of the utterly devastated Wilson, he frowns deeply, his face crumpling with concern, while law enforcement officers diligently endeavor to control the crowd's unruly movement. One officer solemnly drapes a pristine white sheet over Myrtle's lifeless form, which has been placed on a nearby table, prompting Tom to draw nearer with a sense of urgency. With trembling hands, he gingerly pulls back the sheet, the sight of Myrtle's blood-splattered body causing him to gasp aloud in horror, as Nick quietly removes his cap in a gesture of respect for the deceased.

Another driver exits their vehicle, stepping onto the road to survey the tragic scene, their gaze inevitably drawn to the faded, observing eyes on the nearby billboard of Dr. T.J. Eckleburg, which remain fixed in the dark night. Soon after, Tom arrives in another car with Nick and Jordan, and they later notice the flashing lights of police vehicles now at the scene. Exiting their car, they stride towards Wilson's garage, where a growing crowd has formed. Amidst the chaos, Tom locks eyes with a grief-stricken Wilson, his face clouded with concern, while policemen diligently hold back the onlookers. As one officer drapes a sheet over Myrtle's body, now laid out on a table, Tom steps forward, his curiosity piqued. He slowly reaches out, pulling back the sheet to reveal Myrtle's blood-stained corpse, his breath catching in his throat as Nick quietly removes his cap in respect. Tom stands motionless, silently communicates with a nearby cop by raising his hand, shaking his head with tear-filled eyes, and glancing at Nick, who watches with a somber expression. With his head hung low, Tom fights to maintain composure, restrains a distraught Wilson, while an older officer notices with a dubious glance before turning and walking away. Wilson remains seated, appearing dazed and lost, and Tom finds a seat opposite him, offering him a drink. Watching Wilson intently, Tom’s eyes glisten with unshed tears as Wilson accepts the glass and rests it against his forehead. In a moment of shared grief, Tom reaches out, gently touches Wilson’s face, and allows him to rest his head on his shoulder, soothing him by rubbing his back. Meanwhile, Nick delicately covers Myrtle’s body once more with the sheet. As time passes, Tom drives away with Jordan beside him, both fixedly staring ahead as their shiny blue coupe disappears along the dimly lit road. They eventually arrive at the Buchanan mansion, where servants promptly emerge to greet them, and Tom strides confidently to open the front door. Remaining on the porch, Nick and Jordan linger in shared silence as Tom scrutinizes Nick, who returns his gaze with a frown. With an air of dismissal, Tom enters the mansion, leaving Nick glaring at Jordan, who, visibly shocked, follows Tom into the house. Alone and visibly troubled, Nick’s brow furrows as he turns away, his mind racing, and he searches his surroundings incredulously. His wandering leads him to Gatsby, who is hidden behind a bush, his face suddenly illuminated by the light spilling from the house as the butler, Henri, briefly steps out, scans the area obliviously, and then retreats inside. Nick, wearing a grave expression, locks eyes with Gatsby, who glances towards the illuminated upstairs windows before turning back to Nick. A vivid flashback floods Gatsby's mind as he recalls the panic-stricken moment when he took control of the car's wheel, with both he and Daisy witnessing in horror as Myrtle collided with their windscreen and was violently propelled into the air, revealing Daisy as the one in the driver's seat. As Gatsby somberly recounts these harrowing events, he appears distraught while Nick listens, his eyes wide with shock. Seemingly overwhelmed, Gatsby turns away, lowers himself to a seat, and buries his face in his hand. Nick responds with a sharp nod, attempting a slight smile of reassurance before discreetly making his way around to the terrace, where he observes Tom and Daisy seated at the dining table, engaged in conversation. Daisy appears dazed, her eyes unfocused, while Tom inches closer, placing a comforting arm around her shoulder."

As Tom approaches Wilson's garage, he sees a desolate Wilson and grows visibly concerned when a policeman covers Myrtle’s body. Looking overwhelmed, Tom uncovers Myrtle’s blood-stained corpse, and, shaken, he silently signals to a policeman while exchanging a glance with Nick, who doffs his cap. Tom remains somber, attempting to comfort Wilson, who is dazed and motionless. Tom sits with Wilson, offers him a drink, and provides a consoling presence. Meanwhile, Nick re-covers Myrtle’s body, and Tom leaves with Jordan, driving down the dark road toward the Buchanan mansion. Upon arrival, servants appear as Tom enters the house, leaving Jordan and Nick on the porch. Nick exchanges a tense look with Tom, who enters without a word, causing Jordan to follow in shock. Troubled, Nick wanders off, stumbling upon Gatsby hiding nearby. As the house lights illuminate Gatsby’s face, Nick observes him gravely. Gatsby’s expression changes as he reflects on Myrtle’s fatal accident, where Daisy had been at the wheel. In a flashback, Gatsby and Daisy are shown in shock during the incident. Presently, Gatsby, distraught, recounts the sequence to a wide-eyed Nick. Gatsby turns inward in grief, as Nick nods and tries to comfort him.

The other driver gets out and stares at the scene, while the eyes on the ragged billboard for the oculist, Dr. T.J. Eckleburg, a symbol of moral oversight in the Valley of Ashes, stare blankly in the darkness. Tom drives up with Nick and Jordan, and later, police have arrived. They get out and walk towards Wilson's garage, a small, run-down establishment that serves as a livelihood for the impoverished George Wilson, where a crowd has gathered. Tom sees a bereft Wilson, who has been tormented by suspicions of his wife's infidelity, and frowns with concern as policemen hold the crowd back. One of them lays a sheet over Myrtle's body, which lies on a table stained with motor oil and grease, and Tom steps closer. He reaches out and pulls the sheet back, revealing Myrtle's blood-spattered corpse, gasping as Nick removes his cap out of respect. Tom just stares and holds his hand up to the cop, tearfully shaking his head and looking at Nick, his old friend from Yale. Tom stands with his head bowed, restrains Wilson, whose anguish threatens to boil over into rage, and an old cop frowns dubiously before walking away to keep an eye on the restless crowd. Wilson sits looking dazed, and Tom sits facing him, handing him a drink in an attempt to console him. Tom stares at him, and with tears rolling down his face, Wilson drinks and presses the glass against his face, seeking any relief from the shock. Tom touches Wilson's face and lets Wilson rest his head against his shoulder, rubbing his back comfortingly, an unexpected gesture of humanity. Nick covers Myrtle's body with the sheet, and Tom drives away with Jordan as they stare ahead, the shiny blue coupe, a symbol of wealth and excess, heading down the dark road. They arrive at the Buchanan mansion, where servants come out to attend to their wealthy employers, and Tom walks up to open the front door. Nick and Jordan stand on the porch as Tom studies Nick, who stares back, frowning, overwhelmed by the evening's events. With a dismissive glance, Tom goes inside, and Nick glares at Jordan, who, shocked by the night's revelations, marches into the house. Looking deeply troubled, his brow pinched with worry and disbelief, Nick turns and walks off and looks around incredulously, walking over to Gatsby, who's hiding behind a bush, reluctant to confront Daisy. Gatsby's face is suddenly bathed in light as lights come on in the house and the butler, Henri, a recent hire from a prestigious Manhattan agency, comes out onto the porch, looks around but doesn't see anyone, and goes back inside. Nick stares at Gatsby gravely, and Gatsby glances up at the lights in the upstairs windows, then back at Nick. There is a flashback of Gatsby grabbing the wheel in a moment of panic, and Gatsby and Daisy watch in horror as Myrtle slams against the windscreen and hurtles through the air, a tragic consequence of confusion and misjudgment. Daisy is in the driving seat, her hands trembling on the wheel. Recounting events, Gatsby looks distraught as Nick stares at him, wide-eyed, processing the shocking truth. Gatsby turns away and sits, resting his face against his hand, lost in thought. Nick nods sharply and attempts a smile, surreptitiously walking around to the terrace, where he sees Tom and Daisy sitting at the dining table, talking as if nothing had changed. Daisy sits looking dazed, caught between love and duty, as Tom moves closer and puts his arm around her, reclaiming his place by her side."

Brook just gapes and holds his palm up to the guard, tearfully shaking his head and looking at Creek.

Peter spots a forlorn Griffin and grins with empathy as lifeguards keep the throng at bay. One of them drapes a tarpaulin over Florence's figure, which rests on a hammock, and Peter tiptoes closer. He stretches out and peels the tarpaulin back, revealing Florence's paint-splattered effigy, chuckling as Roy tips his hat. Peter just gapes and raises his hand to the soldier, cheerfully shaking his head and gazing at Roy. Peter stands with his chin lowered, restrains Griffin, and an ancient sailor muses skeptically before strolling away. Griffin perches appearing stunned, and Peter lounges opposite him, passing him a snack.

He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
