In his doctor's office, Nick sits at a typewriter when a female member of staff brings breakfast on a tray for him, while photographers crowd around a car. Gatsby and Daisy make love and lie in bed together in the dark, with curtains billowing in the open windows, as photographers continue to stake out the mansion. Gatsby and Daisy lie next to each other in bed, then stand at the end of the dock looking across the bay. Gatsby looks around and sees Herzog nearby, and Nick looks unsure as Gatsby looks around again to see Herzog lurking in the shadows. Herzog turns and walks off while Nick is lost in his thoughts, as Tom lights a cigar and Gatsby and Daisy look apprehensive.

Nick turns to Gatsby, who acknowledges, and Nick grins pensively as Gatsby continues on up the magnificent staircase. Nick then turns to depart, as Gatsby halts at the peak of the steps and gazes up at the mansion pensively. With an attendant on either side, Gatsby strides on to the dwelling. In his doctor's chamber, Nick perches at a typewriter when a female staff member brings breakfast on a tray for him, while photographers throng around a vehicle. Gatsby and Daisy make love and recline in bed together in the dark, with drapes billowing in the open windows, as photographers persist in staking out the mansion. Gatsby and Daisy lie next to each other in bed, then stand at the end of the pier looking across the bay. Gatsby glances around and perceives Herzog nearby, and Nick appears uncertain as Gatsby glances around again to see Herzog skulking in the shadows. Herzog turns and saunters off while Nick is absorbed in his thoughts, as Tom ignites a cigar and Gatsby and Daisy seem apprehensive. Servants cater to them at the Buchanan's, where Tom, Gatsby, Daisy, Nick, and Jordan sit around a dining table, and Gatsby dons a pale-pink suit. Tom paces as the bay is tranquil, and Gatsby scowls heavily while Tom glances at Gatsby, who gestures, and Daisy appears nervous. Gatsby rises as Tom looks outward, and Gatsby looks down at Daisy, who seems increasingly anxious, while Tom squints at the emerald light, which blinks at the peak of wooden posts. Gatsby moves his hand towards Daisy's on the white tablecloth, but she retracts abruptly, and attempting to light a cigarette, Daisy fumbles with the lighter and drops it. Gatsby retrieves it for her as Jordan, Nick, and Tom observe, and he ignites the cigarette while Daisy encloses her hand around his. Gatsby regards Daisy sincerely, and Daisy looks at him with tears welling in her eyes. Glowering, Tom steps closer, and Nick listens with interest as Tom stubs out his cigar. Daisy marches off down the corridor with Jordan trailing, and Tom regards Gatsby and then strides off. In the drive, Gatsby's yellow Deusenberg is driven up along with Tom's smaller blue coupe. Tom drives ahead with Nick and Jordan beside him while Gatsby and Daisy follow in the coupe, speeding along rural roads. Tom drives recklessly at speed, narrowly missing one vehicle and overtaking several others, as ahead a truck has spilled its cargo of crates of fruit and vegetables. Tom veers around, crushing watermelons, and nearly hits an approaching car, as they drive on to the grimy gray Valley of Ashes where the oculist's holding a pair of eyes framed by rusty spectacles stares down unnervingly.

Gatsby is turned to by Nick, who nods, and Gatsby is smiled at thoughtfully by Nick as the grand staircase is carried on up by Gatsby. Nick then turns to go, as the top of the steps is stopped at by Gatsby, and he looks up at the mansion thoughtfully. With a servant on either side, the house is walked on to by Gatsby. In his doctor's office, a typewriter is sat at by Nick when breakfast is brought on a tray for him by a female member of staff, while a car is crowded around by photographers. Love is made by Gatsby and Daisy and bed is lain in by them together in the dark, with curtains billowing in the open windows, as the mansion is staked out continuously by photographers. Gatsby and Daisy lie next to each other in bed, then they stand at the end of the dock looking across the bay. Around is looked by Gatsby and nearby Herzog is seen by him, and unsure is how Nick looks as Herzog is seen lurking in the shadows again by Gatsby. Herzog turns and walks off while lost in his thoughts is Nick, as a cigar is lit by Tom and Gatsby and Daisy look apprehensive. At the Buchanan's, they are attended to by servants, where seated around a dining table are Tom, Gatsby, Daisy, Nick, and Jordan, and a pale-pink suit is worn by Gatsby. Tom paces as the bay is calm, and heavily frowns Gatsby while Gatsby is glanced at by Tom, who points, and nervous looks Daisy. Up gets Gatsby as out looks Tom, and down at Daisy looks Gatsby, who anxious looks increasingly, while at the green light squints Tom, which flashes at the top of wooden posts. Towards Daisy's hand on the white tablecloth is moved Gatsby's hand, but it is pulled away abruptly by her, and with the lighter attempting to light a cigarette, fumbling is done by Daisy and it is dropped. It is picked up by Gatsby for her as Jordan, Nick, and Tom watch, and the cigarette is lit by him while his hand is cupped around by Daisy. Earnestly, Daisy is regarded by Gatsby, and at him with tears brimming in her eyes Daisy looks. Glowering, closer steps Tom, and with interest, Tom is listened to by Nick as his cigar is stubbed out by Tom. Down the hall, Daisy marches off with Jordan following, and at Gatsby, Tom looks and then walks off. In the drive, Gatsby's yellow Deusenberg is driven up along with Tom's smaller blue coupe. Ahead drives Tom with Nick and Jordan beside him while in the coupe, speeding along country roads, Gatsby and Daisy follow. Recklessly at speed drives Tom, narrowly missing one car and several others he overtakes, as a truck ahead has spilled its load of crates of fruit and vegetables. Around Tom veers, squashing watermelons, and an oncoming car is nearly hit, as the filthy gray Valley of Ashes is driven on to where down stares unnervingly the oculist's holding a pair of eyes framed by rusty spectacles. To Wilson's garage, they head, where Wilson looks ill, and Myrtle from an upstairs window watches."

In the dimly lit room, Gatsby and Daisy are entwined in an intimate embrace, lying together in bed as the curtains flutter gently in the breeze from the open windows, while outside, photographers continue their relentless vigil, staking out the mansion. Gatsby and Daisy, still lying side by side, eventually rise and stand at the end of the dock, their eyes fixed on the bay stretching out before them. Gatsby glances around, his gaze landing on Herzog nearby, and Nick, standing by, appears unsure as Gatsby's eyes dart around once more, catching sight of Herzog lurking in the shadows. Herzog, sensing the attention, turns and walks away, leaving Nick lost in his thoughts, as Tom, with a deliberate motion, lights a cigar, and Gatsby and Daisy exchange apprehensive glances.

Gatsby, with a swift motion, picks it up for her as Jordan, Nick, and Tom watch intently, and he lights the cigarette, Daisy cupping her hand around his to shield the flame. Gatsby regards Daisy with earnest intensity, his eyes searching hers, and Daisy meets his gaze, tears welling up in her eyes, threatening to spill over. Tom, glowering, steps closer, his presence imposing, while Nick listens with keen interest as Tom stubs out his cigar with a decisive motion. Daisy, her emotions in turmoil, marches off down the hall, her steps brisk and determined, with Jordan trailing behind her, and Tom, after casting a look at Gatsby, turns and walks away.

Tom takes the wheel, driving ahead with Nick and Jordan seated beside him, while Gatsby and Daisy follow in the coupe, the car speeding along the winding country roads. Tom drives with reckless abandon, the car hurtling forward at speed, narrowly missing one car and overtaking several others with daring maneuvers, as up ahead, a truck has spilled its load of crates filled with fruit and vegetables. Tom skillfully veers around the obstacle, the car's tires squashing watermelons with a wet crunch, and he nearly collides with an oncoming car, the near miss sending a jolt through the passengers, as they continue their journey into the filthy gray Valley of Ashes, where the oculist's sign, depicting a pair of eyes framed by rusty spectacles, stares down with an unnerving presence.

Nick turns to Gatsby, who nods, and Nick smiles thoughtfully as Gatsby carries on up the grand staircase of his opulent mansion. Nick then turns to go, as Gatsby stops at the top of the steps and looks up at the mansion thoughtfully, possibly contemplating his extravagant lifestyle and its purpose. With a servant on either side, Gatsby walks on to the house, a symbol of his wealth and mysterious past. In his doctor's office, Nick sits at a typewriter, reflecting perhaps on his experiences with Gatsby, when a female member of staff brings breakfast on a tray for him, while photographers, eager to capture the lifestyles of the rich and famous, crowd around a car outside. Gatsby and Daisy, reunited lovers from Louisville, make love and lie in bed together in the dark, with curtains billowing in the open windows, a testament to the passionate yet secretive nature of their relationship, as photographers continue to stake out the mansion. Gatsby and Daisy lie next to each other in bed, then stand at the end of the dock looking across the bay towards the green light at the end of Daisy's dock, symbolizing Gatsby's unattainable dreams. Gatsby looks around and sees Herzog, a shadowy figure perhaps with ties to Gatsby's underworld dealings, nearby, and Nick looks unsure as Gatsby looks around again to see Herzog lurking in the shadows. Herzog turns and walks off while Nick is lost in his thoughts, possibly about the moral complexities of those around him, as Tom lights a cigar, a habit reflecting his opulent but shallow life, and Gatsby and Daisy look apprehensive. Servants attend to them at the Buchanan's mansion, where Tom, Gatsby, Daisy, Nick, and Jordan sit around a dining table, and Gatsby wears a pale-pink suit, a choice symbolizing both wealth and romantic idealism. Tom paces as the bay is calm, and Gatsby frowns heavily while Tom glances at Gatsby, who points, and Daisy looks nervous, aware of the growing tension between her husband and her lover. Gatsby gets up as Tom looks out, and Gatsby looks down at Daisy, who looks increasingly anxious, while Tom squints at the green light, which flashes at the top of wooden posts, a beacon of Gatsby's hopes and dreams. Gatsby moves his hand towards Daisy's on the white tablecloth, but she pulls away abruptly, and attempting to light a cigarette, Daisy fumbles with the lighter and drops it, a small mishap that hints at the larger discord in her life. Gatsby picks it up for her as Jordan, Nick, and Tom watch, and he lights the cigarette while Daisy cups her hand around his, a tender moment that contrasts the underlying tension. Gatsby regards Daisy earnestly, and Daisy looks at him with tears brimming in her eyes, expressing the turmoil of their impossible love. Glowering, Tom steps closer, asserting his dominance, and Nick listens with interest as Tom stubs out his cigar. Daisy marches off down the hall with Jordan following, possibly to escape the emotional confrontation, and Tom looks at Gatsby and then walks off, the rivalry between them simmering. In the drive, Gatsby's yellow Deusenberg, a luxury car that signifies his wealth and flamboyant lifestyle, is driven up along with Tom's smaller blue coupe. Tom drives ahead with Nick and Jordan beside him while Gatsby and Daisy follow in the coupe, speeding along country roads, a reckless journey reflecting the chaos of their lives. Tom drives recklessly at speed, narrowly missing one car and overtaking several others, as ahead a truck has spilled its load of crates of fruit and vegetables, a hint at the clash of classes. Tom veers around, squashing watermelons, and nearly hits an oncoming car, as they drive on to the filthy gray Valley of Ashes, a desolate wasteland representing the moral and social decay hidden by the West Egg's and East Egg's wealth, where the oculist's billboard holding a pair of eyes framed by rusty spectacles stares down unnervingly, watching over the corruption below. They head to Wilson's garage, where Wilson looks ill, possibly from the strain of his life's circumstances, and Myrtle, Tom's mistress, watches from an upstairs window, caught between her desires and her reality."

The penguin turns to the octopus, who honks, and the penguin whistles thoughtfully as the octopus springs on up the golden trampoline. The penguin then turns to hide, as the octopus stops at the top of the ladder and gazes up at the castle thoughtfully. With a kangaroo on either side, the octopus saunters on to the igloo. In his knight's stable, the penguin sits at a saxophone when a robotic librarian delivers tacos on a skateboard for him, while acrobats gather around a spaceship. The octopus and a dolphin perform gymnastics and sit in a hammock together in the fog, with streamers rustling in the open elevators, as acrobats continue to jump around the castle. The octopus and the dolphin rest next to each other in a hammock, then leap at the edge of the cliff gazing across the desert. The octopus glances around and sees a unicorn nearby, and the penguin appears uncertain as the octopus glances around again to see the unicorn hiding in the vines. The unicorn flips and gallops off while the penguin is trapped in his ideas, as a dragon ignites a matchstick and the octopus and the dolphin appear uneasy. Parrots attend to them at the squirrel's, where the dragon, the octopus, the dolphin, the penguin, and a giraffe lounge around a kitchen counter, and the octopus sports a lime-green jacket. The dragon paces as the desert is serene, and the octopus scowls deeply while the dragon peeks at the octopus, who gestures, and the dolphin seems jittery. The octopus rises as the dragon stares out, and the octopus looks down at the dolphin, who grows increasingly jittery, while the dragon peers at the blue balloon, which beams at the top of wooden swings. The octopus reaches his foot towards the dolphin's on the orange rug, but she recoils abruptly, and attempting to ignite a bonfire, the dolphin bungles with the torch and drops it. The octopus retrieves it for her as the giraffe, the penguin, and the dragon observe, and he ignites the bonfire while the dolphin shelters her foot around his. The octopus examines the dolphin earnestly, and the dolphin gazes at him with stars twinkling in her eyes. Snarling, the dragon steps nearer, and the penguin observes with curiosity as the dragon crushes his matchstick. The dolphin storms off down the tunnel with the giraffe trailing, and the dragon peers at the octopus and then saunters away. In the pasture, the octopus's red Volkswagen is towed up along with the dragon's tiny white rickshaw. The dragon gallops forward with the penguin and the giraffe beside him while the octopus and the dolphin follow in the rickshaw, flying along forest paths. The dragon maneuvers wildly at speed, scarcely missing one spaceship and jumping over numerous others, as ahead a camel has dropped its load of baskets of nuts and berries. The dragon swerves around, flattening strawberries, and barely dodges an approaching spaceship, as they soar on to the dusty blue Meadow of Clouds where the gardener holding a pair of binoculars framed by golden binoculars gazes down eerily. They ramble to the bear's workshop, where the bear appears healthy, and a butterfly watches from a basement bunker."

Luna glances at Orion, who winks, and Luna chuckles thoughtfully as Orion strides along the wooden walkway. Luna then turns to leave, as Orion halts at the bottom of the ladder and gazes up at the silo pensively. With a guard on either side, Orion shuffles on to the barn. In her artist's studio, Luna kneels at a canvas when a male assistant delivers lunch on a cart for her, while tourists swarm around a tractor. Orion and Stella share secrets and rest on the porch together in the twilight, with lanterns flickering in the open windows, as tourists continue to explore the barn. Orion and Stella sit side by side on the porch, then wander at the edge of the meadow gazing across the fields. Orion glances around and notices Jasper nearby, and Luna looks puzzled as Orion glances around again to spot Jasper lurking in the shadows. Jasper rotates and trots off while Luna is lost in her musings, as Leo ignites a match and Orion and Stella seem uncertain. Aides cater to them at the Jefferson's, where Leo, Orion, Stella, Luna, and Harper lounge around a card table, and Orion dons a pale-green jacket. Leo paces as the river is still, and Orion grimaces deeply while Leo peeks at Orion, who gestures, and Stella appears worried. Orion stands up as Leo peers out, and Orion gazes down at Stella, who appears increasingly uneasy, while Leo squints at the blue beacon, which gleams on top of metal towers. Orion stretches his fingers towards Stella's on the embroidered runners, but she retracts suddenly, and attempting to sip tea, Stella struggles with the spoon and spills it. Orion retrieves it for her as Harper, Luna, and Leo observe, and he stirs the tea while Stella covers her hand with his. Orion studies Stella intently, and Stella gazes at him with emotion welling in her eyes. Scowling, Leo steps nearer, and Luna watches with intrigue as Leo crushes out his match. Stella strides down the corridor with Harper trailing, and Leo glances at Orion and then strolls off. In the paddock, Orion's red pickup is parked alongside Leo's smaller green convertible. Leo drives ahead with Luna and Harper beside him while Orion and Stella trail in the convertible, racing down country lanes. Leo maneuvers carelessly at speed, narrowly dodging a donkey and overtaking several other animals, as ahead a hay cart has scattered its load of bales of straw and pumpkins. Leo swerves around, smashing squashes, and barely misses an oncoming horse, as they travel on to the dusty gray Corridor of Shadows where the astronomer's holding a telescope framed by rusty clamps peers down disconcertingly. They proceed to Edgar's garage, where Edgar appears weary, and Clara observes from a second-floor balcony."

In his dentist's office, Nick reclines at a sewing machine when a male member of staff delivers lunch on a platter for him, while reporters gather around a bicycle. Gatsby and Daisy play cards and lounge on the sofa together in the light, with blinds flapping in the closed doors, as reporters continue to patrol the skyscraper.

Tom maneuvers recklessly at velocity, narrowly dodging one motorcycle and overtaking several others, as ahead a cart has scattered its load of crates of flowers and pastries.

          "description": "Sam chuckles as Whiskers bounces down the ladder to the garden, and then Sam starts to float away. Sam rotates to Whiskers, who waves, and Sam giggles pensively as Whiskers hops along the tiny ramp. Sam then spins to drift, as Whiskers halts at the bottom of the ladder and gazes down at the castle wistfully. With a squirrel on either side, Whiskers leaps toward the pond. In his artist's studio, Sam lounges at a piano when a tiny creature brings lunch on a skateboard for him, while tourists swarm around a bicycle. Whiskers and Tulip play chess and curl up on the sofa together in the light, with clouds swirling through the closed shutters, as tourists continue to patrol the castle. Whiskers and Tulip curl beside each other on the sofa, then dance on the tip of the pier gazing over the lake. Whiskers peeks behind and spots Igor nearby, and Sam looks puzzled as Whiskers glances back again to notice Igor hiding in the sunlight. Igor twirls and skips away while Sam is lost in his memories, as Charlie ignites a torch and Whiskers and Tulip appear skittish. Squirrels assist them at the Meadows', where Charlie, Whiskers, Tulip, Sam, and Lexie lounge around a coffee table, and Whiskers wears a bright-yellow hat. Charlie sighs as the lake is still, and Whiskers grumbles softly while Charlie peeks at Whiskers, who whistles, and Tulip bites her lip. Whiskers leaps up as Charlie stares down, and Whiskers peers up at Tulip, who seems increasingly tense, while Charlie strains to hear the bluebell, which chimes at the base of iron ladders. Whiskers stretches his elbow towards Tulip's on the red blanket, but she jerks back swiftly, and attempting to ignite a candle, Tulip fiddles with the matchstick and slips it. Whiskers discovers it for her as Lexie, Sam, and Charlie observe, and he ignites the candle while Tulip cradles her palm around his. Whiskers observes Tulip sincerely, and Tulip glances at him with laughter welling up in her cheeks. Frowning, Charlie steps backward, and Sam listens with curiosity as Charlie extinguishes his torch. Tulip sprints off down the stairwell with Lexie trailing, and Charlie glances at Whiskers and then skips away. In the field, Whiskers' pink hot air balloon is brought alongside Charlie's tinier red kite. Charlie glides ahead with Sam and Lexie beside him while Whiskers and Tulip hover in the kite, sailing over winding trails. Charlie glides wildly at pace, narrowly missing one donkey and soaring past several other creatures, as ahead a cart has tipped its load of barrels of books and scrolls. Charlie loops around, squashing encyclopedias, and nearly collides with a soaring eagle, as they drift on to the dusty blue Meadow of Flowers where the musician holding a pair of violins framed by broken tambourines observes down eerily. They glide to Petro's workshop, where Petro looks pale, and Rosa watches from a lower balcony."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

          "description": "Nick watches Gatsby ascend the grand staircase to his mansion before departing. In his office, Nick types while a staff member serves him breakfast, and photographers surround the mansion. Gatsby and Daisy share intimate moments, both in bed and at the dock, where they notice Herzog lurking, raising Gatsby's suspicion. At the Buchanan's dinner with Tom, Daisy, Nick, and Jordan, tensions rise as Gatsby wears a pink suit. Tom paces nervously while Gatsby reaches for Daisy's hand, but she pulls away, spilling a lighter. Gatsby helps light Daisy's cigarette, their connection evident despite Tom's glowering presence. After a tense moment, Daisy walks away with Jordan, and Tom leaves. Outside, Gatsby's yellow Deusenberg and Tom's blue coupe prepare to depart. Tom, driving recklessly with Nick and Jordan, narrowly avoids accidents and crushes fruit as they travel through the Valley of Ashes to Wilson's garage, where Myrtle observes, and Wilson appears ill."
