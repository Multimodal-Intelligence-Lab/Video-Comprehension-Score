We are booming down to disclose a clergy in the foreground who stands belly-deep in the river, lowering a white-robed male back-down into the water. Behind him, a queue of robed vocalists lengthens steadily as people stream out of the forest.

The number of white-robed figures steadily increases, drifting through the dense woods, all of them strangely indifferent to the presence of the three men. They drift in a seemingly unending stream, moving through the foreground, the background, and even the campsite itself. Our perspective shifts downward to reveal a minister standing in the foreground. He is waist-deep in the river, gently easing a man dressed in a white robe backward into the water. Behind the minister, a line of robed singers continues to grow as more people stream out of the woods and join the procession. Pete, Delmar, and Everett emerge from their wooded surroundings and look down at the flowing river, where the white-robed people continue to drift past without acknowledging them. Delmar, eager and determined, wades out into the stream, cutting in line, reaching the minister as he holds his nose. The minister solemnly incants over him before lowering him into the water. Nearby, a small smoldering twig fire sends up wisps of smoke, while a bloodhound, held on a leash, circles into view, its tail wagging vigorously with excitement. We follow this determined dog as it waddles over to an abandoned tin of Dapper Dan pomade, its nose diligently sniffing the ground as it strains against its leash. Everett is driving, shaking his head with a bemused, patient smile while Pete, seated next to him, and Delmar, sitting in the back, are both soaking wet. Everett shakes his head and lets out a laugh as they pass a thirty-something black man dressed in worn but respectable go-to-meetin' clothes. This man stands by the roadside, waggling his thumb to hitch a ride as the car goes by. The man hurriedly grabs his battered guitar case as the car pulls over and trots up to meet the open window. Everett glances at the man through the rearview mirror as he pulls away, and Tommy merely shrugs, prompting Everett to narrow his eyes in curiosity as he scrutinizes the man. The car eventually arrives at a parking lot adjacent to a cement-block building, single-story in height, distinguished by a towering hundred-foot antenna and a handpainted sign. As the men exit the vehicle, Everett confidently snaps his suspenders and strides with purpose toward a portly, middle-aged man who wears dark glasses and grips a white cane. Everett grimaces momentarily, deep in thought, while the three singing convicts arrange themselves in a semi-circle behind Tommy. Tommy, playing his guitar, performs a vibrant and harmonized rendition of the song 'Man of Constant Sorrow' into a can microphone.

At the same time, Everett quickly scrambles up onto his own feet, his eyes darting anxiously as they track the movement of a procession. This procession is made up of people clad in white robes, who are trailing behind the tenor in a solemn line. The number of these white-robed figures continues to increase steadily as they drift through the dense woods, all of them maintaining a strange indifference to the presence of the three men nearby. They drift along in what seems like a never-ending stream, moving gracefully through the foreground, the background, and even passing directly through the campsite itself. As our perspective shifts downward, we are shown a minister, prominently standing in the foreground. This minister is waist-deep in the river, gently easing a man, who also wears a white robe, backward into the water. Behind the minister, a line of robed singers keeps growing longer as more individuals emerge from the woods to join the ongoing procession. Pete, Delmar, and Everett come into view as they emerge from their wooded surroundings and look down at the flowing river below them, where the white-robed figures continuously drift past, not acknowledging the three men in any way. Delmar, filled with eagerness and determination, wades out into the stream, cutting in line until he reaches the minister. As he holds his nose, the minister solemnly speaks over him before lowering him into the water. Nearby, a small, smoldering twig fire sends delicate wisps of smoke curling into the air, while a bloodhound, held securely on a leash, circles into view, its tail wagging vigorously with excitement. We follow this determined dog as it waddles over to an abandoned tin of Dapper Dan pomade, its nose diligently sniffing at the ground while it strains eagerly against its leash. Meanwhile, Everett is driving, shaking his head with a bemused, patient smile crossing his face. Sitting next to him is Pete, and Delmar is seated in the back, both of them noticeably soaking wet. Everett shakes his head again and lets out a laugh as they pass by a man, around thirty-something, dressed in worn but respectable go-to-meetin' clothes, standing by the roadside. This man raises his thumb to hitch a ride as the car drives past. He quickly grabs his battered guitar case as the car pulls over, and he trots up to meet Everett at the open window. Everett casts a glance at the man through the rearview mirror as he pulls away. Tommy merely shrugs, prompting Everett to narrow his eyes with curiosity as he scrutinizes the man.

Almost simultaneously, Everett scrambles up, his attention captured by the procession of white-robed people trailing behind a tenor. These robed figures continue to multiply, drifting through the woods with an increasing presence, seemingly oblivious to the existence of the three men. The stream of people, clad in white robes, begins to drift not only through the woods but also across the campsite, appearing in both the foreground and background. As the scene expands, a minister is revealed in the foreground, standing in the river, skillfully easing a white-robed man down into the water, submerging him gently. Behind this baptismal scene, the line of robed singers steadily expands, as more individuals emerge from the woods to join the ranks. Pete, Delmar, and Everett emerge from the wooded area, their gazes locked onto the river where the white-robed congregation continues to move past them. With determination, Delmar wades into the stream, boldly cutting into the line. He reaches the minister and prepares himself by holding his nose, allowing the minister to perform the incantation and submerge him into the water. Meanwhile, a nearby smoldering twig fire adds to the atmosphere, while a bloodhound on a leash enters the frame, vigorously wagging its tail. The dog's attention is captivated by the scent of an empty tin of Dapper Dan pomade. The hound, with its nose to the ground, strains against its leash, determined to follow the trail. In another scene, Everett drives the car, shaking his head with a smile that hints at forebearance. Pete and Delmar sit inside, both dripping wet, likely from their recent river experience. Everett's attention is momentarily captured by a thirtyish black man standing on the shoulder, dressed in worn go-to-meetin' clothes, eagerly waggling his thumb at the passing car. As the car pulls over, the man quickly grabs his battered guitar case and trots up to the open window. Everett, glancing into the rearview mirror, observes the man with a mix of curiosity and scrutiny as they pull away. Tommy offers a shrug, prompting Everett's eyes to narrow as he continues to study the newcomer. Their journey continues until the car pulls into the parking lot of a modest single-story cement-block building, distinguished by its hundred-foot antenna and handpainted sign. Upon exiting the car, Everett snaps his suspenders with an air of confidence and strides purposefully up to a portly middle-aged man, who, despite his dark glasses and white cane, exudes a certain authority. As Everett pauses to think, the three singing convicts, now arranged in a semi-circle behind Tommy, prepare to perform. Tommy plays his guitar with enthusiasm into a can microphone, delivering a spirited and harmonized rendition of 'Man of Constant Sorrow'. The performance concludes with Everett's whoop of appreciation, and he enthusiastically slaps Tommy on the back. Suddenly, a caravan comprised of two oversized cars pulls into the lot, prompting Tommy and the three convicts to burst from the station door, their excitement palpable. From the first car emerges a sixty-year-old man whose enormous seersucker pants are held up by suspenders and the expansive pressure of a burgeoning belly. Delmar, brimming with excitement, waves a fistful of money at the man. A large, shambling man, approximately thirty years old, follows him out of the car, adding another layer to the unfolding scene."

Pete, Delmar, and Everett emerge, watching as Delmar impulsively joins the line and undergoes baptism. Nearby, a bloodhound circles a smoldering fire, sniffing a Dapper Dan pomade tin. Everett, driving the car with a bemused smile, is accompanied by a wet Pete and Delmar. They pull over for a thirtyish man with a guitar case who catches a ride. As they continue, Everett scrutinizes the man in the mirror. The group arrives at a cement-block building with an antenna, where Everett confidently approaches a blind man as the group prepares to perform 'Man of Constant Sorrow' with Tommy's guitar. After the performance, they celebrate energetically until a caravan arrives, led by a sixty-year-old man, as Delmar waves money at him, followed by a large, shambling man."

There are more and more white robes drifting through the woods, all of them strangely oblivious to the three men, as if in a trance inspired by their spiritual devotion. The endless stream now drifts through the foreground, the background, and the campsite itself, which is nestled in the dense Mississippi woodland. We are booming down to reveal a minister in the foreground who stands belly-deep in the river, a common site for baptism ceremonies in the rural South, easing a white-robed man back-down into the water. Behind him, a line of robed singers, who have gathered from nearby towns for this event, lengthens steadily as people stream out of the woods. Pete, Delmar, and Everett emerge from the woods and gaze down at the river as white-robed people continue to drift past them, the quiet parting of the water blending with their hymns. Delmar wades out into the stream, cutting in line, and reaches the minister, holding his nose as the minister, following the tradition of the Baptist church, incantates over him and lowers him into the water. Nearby, a smoldering twig fire burns, its smoke wafting up as a bloodhound on a leash, a breed known for its keen sense of smell used often in tracking, circles into frame, its tail fiercely wagging. We follow it as it waddles over to an empty tin of Dapper Dan pomade, a popular men's hair product of the 1930s, nose to the ground and straining against its leash. Everett drives, shaking his head with a forebearing smile, reflecting on the unexpected turns of the day, while Pete, sitting next to him, and Delmar, in back, are both dripping wet. He shakes his head and laughs as a thirtyish black man in worn go-to-meetin' clothes, which are often reserved for Sunday worship in modest communities, stands on the shoulder, waggling his thumb at the passing car. The man grabs his battered guitar case, perhaps holding the instrument he uses for both livelihood and expression, as the car pulls over and trots up to the open window. Everett looks at the man in the rearview mirror as he pulls out, and Tommy shrugs, causing Everett's eyes to narrow as he studies the man, sensing a shared bond of mischief or adventure. The car pulls into the parking lot of a single-story cement-block building with a hundred-foot antenna and a handpainted sign, marking it as a local radio station offering a platform for grassroots talent. As the men get out of the car, Everett snaps his suspenders, a common 1930s accessory, and strides up to a portly middle-aged man who wears dark glasses and holds a white cane, suggesting he is blind yet deeply attuned to the music around him. Everett grimaces, thinking, as the three singing convicts form a semi-circle behind Tommy, who plays his guitar into a can microphone, performing a hot and harmonized version of 'Man of Constant Sorrow', a folk song that resonates with the hardships and yearnings of many during the Great Depression. When they finish, Everett whoops and slaps Tommy on the back just as a caravan of two oversize cars, possibly belonging to a political campaign or a traveling band, pulls into the lot, and Tommy and the three convicts burst out of the station door, whooping it up with a mix of relief and jubilation. A sixty-year-old man in enormous seersucker pants, a fabric choice for its breathability in warm climates, held up by suspenders and the outward pressure of a blooming belly gets out of the first car, as Delmar waves a fistful of money at him, signaling a successful transaction or bet won. A big shambling man of about thirty, likely an assistant or bodyguard, follows him out of the car, adding to the eclectic and lively scene."

There are more and more red capes floating through the sand dunes, all of them peculiarly unmindful of the six leopards. The infinite stream now floats through the rooftop, the courtyard, and the lemonade stand itself. We are zooming up to unveil a baker on the rooftop who stands shoulder-deep in the fountain, lowering a red-caped goat belly-up into the bubbles. Next to her, a chain of caped clowns extends steadily as owls gush out of the sand dunes. Charlie, Cynthia, and Harold pop out of the sand dunes and stare up at the fountain as red-caped owls persistently float past them. Cynthia paddles out into the flow, joining the queue, and reaches the baker, covering her eyes as the baker chants over her and raises her into the bubbles. Nearby, a flickering matchstick blaze smokes while a golden retriever on a harness spirals into view, its ears wildly flapping. We follow it as it scampers over to a rusty kettle of Blue Moon wax, ears to the sand and tugging against its harness. Harold paints, nodding his head with an accepting grin, while Charlie, reclining beside him, and Cynthia, in front, are both soaking dry. She nods her head and coughs as a fiftyish white woman in battered party attire waits on the runway, bouncing her foot at the passing train. The woman snatches her new drum case as the train stops and skips up to the closed hatch. Harold peers at the woman in the side mirror as he shuts off, and Maria giggles, causing Harold's lips to purse as he inspects the woman. The train stops in the sports hall of a five-story brick-brick tower with a two-foot drone and a scribbled billboard. As the leopards step out of the train, Harold zips his overalls and leaps up to a lanky young woman who wears sparkling earmuffs and grips a black paintbrush. Harold frowns, pondering, as the six marching acrobats form a triangle behind Maria, who strums her drum into an egg microphone, delivering a lukewarm and discordant version of 'Queen of Endless Joy'. When they conclude, Harold hollers and pats Maria on the arm just as a fleet of three tiny motorcycles halts in the yard, and Maria and the six acrobats dart out of the bunker entrance, shouting it out. A twenty-year-old girl in microscopic polyester boots fastened by zippers and the inward pull of a wilting tummy steps out of the last motorcycle, as Cynthia waves a bundle of confetti at her.

Pete, Delmar, and Everett appear from the meadow and gaze up at the pond as yellow-hatted people continue to float past them. Delmar swims out into the pond, breaking in line, and reaches the fisherman, pinching his lips as the fisherman recites over him and raises him into the air. Nearby, a crackling grass fire glows while a rabbit on a leash bounces into frame, its ears enthusiastically flapping.

Everett sings, shaking his head with a bemused smile, while Pete, sitting next to him, and Delmar, in back, are both colorful-dry.

We are zooming out to reveal a baker in the background who sits neck-high in the ocean, pulling a purple-coated elephant belly-up into the breeze. In front of him, a row of coated dancers widens gradually as elephants flood in from the mountains. Sam, Baxter, and Clyde stumble out of the mountains and stare up at the sea as purple-coated elephants continue to float past them. Baxter jogs into the puddle, jumping in the line, and greets the baker, pinching his elbow as the baker sings over him and lifts him into the breeze. Nearby, a flickering coal furnace crackles while a parrot on a string spirals into sight, its beak lazily pecking. We trail it as it skips over to a vacant can of Fancy Joe lotion, beak to the sky and pushing against its string. Clyde flies, nodding his mind with a tolerant frown, while Sam, lying behind him, and Baxter, in front, are both dripping dry. He nods his mind and cries as a fiftyish green crocodile in shiny work-out attire sleeps on the lake, winking its eyelid at the soaring plane. The crocodile holds its polished trombone case as the plane floats away and lumbers down to the closed door. Clyde glances at the crocodile in the side mirror as he floats away, and Jordan sneezes, prompting Clyde's ears to widen as he examines the crocodile. The plane floats into the airplane hangar of a three-story brick tower with a thousand-foot satellite and a glued message. As the owls shake out of the plane, Clyde twists his eyeglasses and hops down to a lanky youthful crocodile who carries light sandals and swings a dark ribbon. Clyde smirks, wondering, as the four dancing clowns form a triangle around Jordan, who dances his trombone into a hat speaker, delivering a cold and uncoordinated version of 'Tiger of Endless Joy.' When they stop, Clyde hollers and nudges Jordan on the arm just as a brigade of four tiny boats floats into the pier, and Jordan and the four clowns soar out of the radio tunnel, celebrating loudly. A twenty-year-old crocodile in minuscule leather boots held up by belts and the inner pull of a shrinking face splashes out of the last boat, as Baxter waves a sheet of corn at it. A small crawling crocodile of about eighty leaps out of the last boat."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
