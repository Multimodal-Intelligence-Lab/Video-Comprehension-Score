Once atop the vehicle, he quickly launches a rapid series of wet projectiles at Flint. In response, Flint delivers a powerful punch, dislodging Spider-Man from the roof. Spider-Man manages to cling on momentarily, but Flint strikes again, sending him hurtling into the truck. Amidst the chaos, as the van speeds toward an impending collision, Spider-Man swiftly acts, pulling the guards to safety by firing a thread out from the back, ensuring the van flips and crashes into a parked truck. Above, Flint observes with keen interest from the edge of a nearby building as Spider-Man emerges from the wreck of the red van, glancing around with urgency. Meanwhile, as Flint departs, the rescued guards find themselves gently descending from a web spanning across the street. With a heavy breath, Spider-Man makes his way to the edge of a building, removes his mask with a sigh of relief, and vigorously shakes his head to dislodge the sand entangled in his hair. He then sits down, removes his left boot, and shakes out yet more sand, ensuring he is free from the gritty residue. Transitioning to later in the evening, Peter, now smartly attired in a solemn suit with his dark hair perfectly arranged in a neat side parting, pauses just a few feet from the entrance of the upscale restaurant 'Constellation.' With a sense of anticipation, he carefully retrieves Aunt May's ring from his breast pocket. Nearby, Mary Jane approaches a newsstand in a state of agitation, her expression dark and stormy, before striding off in a huff. Once inside the restaurant, Peter is momentarily captivated by the lavish décor as diners and waiters bustle past him. Moving through the reception area, he is beckoned by a maitre d' standing behind a small counter. The maitre d', holding a pen on a silver platter and scrutinizing it with sharp, penetrating eyes, accepts the note Peter hands him. With a firm action, the maitre d' then guides Peter to a designated table before hastily retreating. As Peter snaps out of his contemplative state, he notices Mary Jane approaching in an elegant little black dress. Demonstrating his chivalrous side, he guides her to her seat, courteously pulling out the chair for her. Suddenly, his attention is caught by Gwen, a blonde woman smiling at him from afar. He acknowledges her with a wave, reciprocated by another wave from Gwen as she walks away. Misunderstanding the situation, the maitre d' signals for champagne service, but Peter quickly indicates his disapproval, shaking his head to dismiss the waiters. Despite Peter's gestures, Gwen's continued waves are perceived once more as an invitation, prompting the waiters to return, only to be waved off again by Peter's firm refusal. As Mary Jane makes her exit in frustration, the maitre d', undeterred, sets the champagne glasses on the table as a waiter brings over a champagne bucket. While a violinist begins to play a serenade, Peter, in quiet reflection, picks up Mary Jane's abandoned glass and carefully retrieves the ring from within using a fork. He then methodically dries the ring with a napkin, contemplating the events that have unfolded."

Flint, or Flint Marko, who is the Sandman and possesses the ability to transform his body into sand-like material, punches Spider-Man off the roof, and although Spider-Man clings on, Flint punches him into the truck. As the van, speeding through the bustling city streets, heads for a collision, Spider-Man pulls the guards out, firing a thread, a strong web line, out of the back of the van, which flints or swerves violently and crashes into a parked truck. Flint watches from the edge of a building above, his usual vantage point that gives him a strategic advantage, as Spider-Man staggers out of the red van, looking around frantically for any remaining threats. As Flint moves off, the rescued guards drop from a web, a soft but strong emergency landing support, spun across the street. Spider-Man wheezes up to the ledge of a building, pulls off his mask, revealing his identity as Peter Parker, and shakes sand, a remnant of his fight with Sandman, from his hair, then pulls off his left boot and shakes out some more sand. Later in the evening, Peter, dressed smartly in a sober suit with his dark hair swept across in a neat side parting, a style reminiscent of classic Hollywood leading men, stops a few feet away from the entrance of the renowned restaurant Constellation, famous for its celestial-themed décor, and pulls Aunt May's ring, a cherished family heirloom, out of his breast pocket. Looking agitated, Mary Jane, Peter's long-time love interest, strides up alongside a newsstand, the kind often seen on busy city streets offering an array of magazines and newspapers, and storms off with a face like thunder, indicating deep upset. Inside the restaurant, Peter takes in the opulent splendor, characterized by luxurious furnishings and ambient lighting, as diners and waiters, representing the bustling service of high-end dining, flip past him, walking across the reception area where he's summoned by a maitre d', a traditionally formal head waiter, behind a small counter. The maitre d' has brought a pen, an elegant fountain pen, on a silver platter, examining it with dark, beady eyes as Peter hands him a note, perhaps containing a special request or reservation confirmation. Clenching his fist, the maitre d' then leads Peter to a table before scurrying away with the efficiency expected in fine dining. Peter snaps out of his role play as he sees Mary Jane coming towards him in a little black dress, a classic choice symbolizing elegance. He shows her to her seat and chivalrously pulls out her chair for her, then spots simpering blonde Gwen, his lab partner and friend, waving at him and waves back. The maitre d' summons the champagne, adhering to the tradition of celebratory dining, but Peter hurriedly shakes his head, leading the maitre d' to wave the waiters away. Gwen waves at Peter as she walks away, and he waves back again. The maitre d' takes this as the signal, and helpless waiters are called off again as Peter shakes his head, signaling not to bring the champagne. The maitre d' bringing the champagne glasses passes Mary Jane as she storms out, upset perhaps by a misunderstanding. Peter stares after Mary Jane in shock as the maitre d' sets the glasses down on the table and the waiter brings a champagne bucket, a sign of the romantic atmosphere Peter intended. As a violinist serenades him, adding a touch of romance through live music, Peter picks up Mary Jane's glass and fishes the ring out of it with a fork, then dries the ring with a napkin, showing his intent for a proposal gone awry."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
