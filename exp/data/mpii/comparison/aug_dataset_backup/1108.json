A pristine alabaster vista appears as high-stepping pale steeds prance out of the snow-covered woodland, pulling attractive sleighs filled with pupils well-wrapped against the chill. In the Great Hall, now adorned with towering Christmas trees, the ceiling mirrors the climate outside, and vast snowflakes hover above the heads of the students sitting at the extended, gleaming dining tables. Harry and Ron are sitting by themselves at the end of one of the tables when Hermione carries her meal down the hall and sits across from them. She holds up two pastries. Later, followed by Harry, Ron peeks around a statue in the corridor, ensures the coast is clear, and lifts his crooked wand. Harry waves his wand, and the two pastries float into the air. Harry and Ron conceal themselves as Crabbe and Goyle emerge with armfuls of pastry. They see the floating pastries, snatch them, and commence to consume them, greedily smacking their lips and stuffing the pastries into their mouths. They abruptly stop chewing as their eyes roll up, and they both collapse backward and hit the floor. Later, in the girls' washroom, Hermione fills three goblets and hands one to Harry and one to Ron. They look at their thick sludge suspiciously and put the hairs into the concoction. Ron makes a face, and clinking goblets, they all drink at once. Ron takes a gulp and heads for the nearest cubicle, followed by Hermione. Harry drops his goblet and clutches his abdomen in agony. He lurches to the marble basin and leans on it. Looking down, he sees the skin on his hands begin to swell and blister, and when Harry looks into the mirror, his visage is also erupting. As he observes, he gradually turns into podgy Goyle. He lifts his hand and touches his beefy visage with plump fingers. Pleased with the metamorphosis, Harry grins, then turns and sees Ron coming out of the cubicle, transformed into chubby-faced, squat Crabbe. They gaze at one another. In a dim corridor, Percy Weasley spots them, and Draco Malfoy stares at Harry, then glowers at Percy, giving him a withering look. In the Slytherin common room, Draco slumps onto a leather couch. Looking around nervously, Harry and Ron sit across from him. Ron clenches his fist, and Harry nudges Ron. Draco stares at Harry, then gets to his feet and looks down at him menacingly. To Harry's relief, Draco withdraws. Ron looks at Harry with surprise, picks up a small package, and shakes it. Harry shakes his head, and Draco puts the package in his pocket. Ron springs up, and Harry cautions Ron, who looks at him in dismay as Harry touches his forehead where his scar is reappearing."

Harry's gaze lingers on the door for a moment before he shakes his head, trying to clear his thoughts. Outside, a pure white landscape unfolds, revealing a magical scene where high-stepping white horses emerge gracefully from the snow-covered forest. These majestic creatures trot with elegance, pulling behind them handsome sleighs filled with students who are bundled up warmly against the biting cold. Inside the Great Hall, the atmosphere is transformed with the festive decoration of tall Christmas trees, and the enchanted ceiling mirrors the wintry weather outside, with huge snowflakes gently floating above the heads of the students who are seated at the long, polished dining tables. At one of these tables, Harry and Ron sit together at the far end, somewhat isolated, when Hermione approaches, carrying her meal down the hall. She takes a seat opposite them and, with a smile, holds up two cakes as if offering a treat. Later, in a different part of the castle, Ron, with Harry following closely behind, cautiously peers around a statue in the corridor. He scans the area to ensure no one is around, then lifts his crooked wand with determination. In response, Harry waves his wand, causing the two cakes to float into the air, suspended by magic. The two boys quickly hide as Crabbe and Goyle appear, their arms laden with cake. Spotting the floating cakes, Crabbe and Goyle eagerly grab them and begin to eat, greedily smacking their lips and stuffing the cakes into their mouths with abandon. Their chewing suddenly halts as their eyes roll up, and they both collapse backward, hitting the floor with a thud. Later, in the girls' lavatory, Hermione carefully fills three glasses with a thick potion and hands one to Harry and another to Ron. They both eye the thick sludge with suspicion before dropping hairs into the potion. Ron grimaces at the sight, but they clink their glasses together in a show of solidarity and drink the potion all at once. Ron takes a swig and immediately rushes to the nearest cubicle, with Hermione following closely behind. Meanwhile, Harry drops his glass, clutching his stomach in agony as he staggers to the marble sink for support. He leans heavily on it, looking down in horror as the skin on his hands begins to bulge and bubble. When he glances up into the mirror, he sees his face erupting in a similar fashion. As he watches, his features gradually morph into those of the podgy Goyle. Tentatively, he lifts his hand and touches his newly transformed beefy face with plump fingers, feeling a sense of satisfaction with the transformation. Harry smiles at his reflection, then turns to see Ron emerging from the cubicle, now transformed into the fat-faced, dumpy Crabbe. They stare at each other in disbelief at their new appearances. In a dark corridor, Percy Weasley spots them, and Draco Malfoy fixes his gaze on Harry, then shifts his glare to Percy, giving him a withering look that sends a clear message. In the Slytherin common room, Draco slumps onto a leather sofa with an air of casual authority. Harry and Ron, feeling nervous, sit opposite him, trying to maintain their composure. Ron clenches his fist in a moment of tension, and Harry discreetly nudges him to stay calm. Draco's eyes lock onto Harry, and he rises to his feet, looking down at him with an ominous air. To Harry's relief, Draco eventually backs off, leaving Harry to exhale quietly. Ron, surprised by the turn of events, picks up a small parcel and gives it a shake, curious about its contents. Harry shakes his head in warning, and Draco, noticing the exchange, slips the parcel into his pocket. Suddenly, Ron springs up, and Harry quickly warns him, his voice tinged with urgency. Ron looks at Harry in dismay as Harry touches his forehead, feeling the familiar sensation of his scar reappearing, signaling the end of their transformation."

Oliver and Gary are sitting by themselves at the end of one of the tables when Emily carries her instrument down the corridor and sits across from them. She holds up two pies. Later, accompanied by Oliver, Gary peers around a monument in the passageway, makes sure the area is clear, and raises his bent baton. Oliver waves his baton, and the two pies ascend into the air. Oliver and Gary hide as Taylor and Jordan appear with armfuls of pie. They see the hovering pies, seize them, and begin to eat them, voraciously smacking their tongues and cramming the pies into their mouths. They suddenly halt chewing as their eyes roll back, and they both topple backward and slam onto the ground. Later, in the boys' greenhouse, Emily fills three mugs and hands one to Oliver and one to Gary. They look at their dense syrup suspiciously and put the feathers into the elixir. Gary makes a grimace, and clinking mugs, they all imbibe at once. Gary takes a gulp and heads for the nearest stall, followed by Emily. Oliver drops his mug and clutches his stomach in distress. He stumbles to the obsidian fountain and leans on it. Looking downward, he sees the surface on his limbs begin to swell and ripple, and when Oliver gazes into the window, his visage is also erupting. As he observes, he gradually transforms into stout Jordan. He raises his limb and touches his robust visage with chubby digits. Satisfied with the alteration, Oliver grins, then pivots and sees Gary emerging from the stall, transformed into round-featured, squat Taylor. They gape at each other. In a dim passageway, Percy Johnson notices them, and Lucas Black scrutinizes Oliver, then glowers at Percy, casting him a disdainful expression. In the Ravenclaw alcove, Lucas collapses onto a velvet hammock. Glancing around anxiously, Oliver and Gary sit across from him. Gary clenches his palm, and Oliver nudges Gary.

Luna and Neville are standing by themselves at the edge of one of the desks when Ginny drags her lunch across the room and stands opposite them. She raises two sandwiches. Later, followed by Luna, Neville peers over a painting in the hallway, ensures the path is clear, and twists his bent broomstick. Luna flicks her broomstick, and the two sandwiches glide through the air. Luna and Neville conceal themselves as Fred and George march with bundles of sandwiches. They notice the gliding sandwiches, snatch them, and begin to devour them, eagerly munching and cramming the sandwiches into their mouths. They suddenly halt munching as their eyes glaze over, and they both topple over forward and slump onto the ground. Later, in the boys' bathroom, Ginny pours three cups and hands one to Luna and one to Neville. They examine their thin potion skeptically and toss the feathers into the brew. Neville makes a grimace, and tapping cups, they all sip together. Neville gulps a mouthful and dashes for the closest stall, followed by Ginny. Luna drops her cup and grips her chest in discomfort. She lurches to the granite toilet and leans against it. Gazing down, she watches the skin on her arms begin to swell and ripple, and when Luna looks into the reflection, her face is also expanding.

Observing quietly, Luna and Neville perch across from her. Neville uncurls his fingers, and Luna taps Neville. Pansy glowers at Luna, then stands up and gazes down at her menacingly. To Luna's satisfaction, Pansy steps away. Neville glances at Luna with astonishment, picks up a tiny box, and rattles it. Luna tilts her head, and Pansy places the box in her bag.

Harry and Ron are resting by themselves at the edge of one of the benches when Hermione maneuvers her dessert up the alley and places herself across from them. She lifts two loaves. Later, trailed by Harry, Ron sneaks behind a monument in the hallway, verifies the path is open, and swings his straight staff. Harry flicks his staff, and the two loaves glide into the breeze. Harry and Ron crouch as Crabbe and Goyle arrive with heaps of cookies. They notice the gliding loaves, snatch them, and start to devour them, merrily humming and cramming the loaves into their ears.

Timmy and Max are lounging together at the beginning of one of the benches when Sally hauls her feast up the chamber and lounges across from them. She waves two pies. Later, trailed by Timmy, Max peeks around a fountain in the hallway, checks the setting is secure, and raises his bent cane. Timmy sways his cane, and the two pies ascend into the breeze. Timmy and Max scurry as Ike and Mike arrive with bundles of pie.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

          "description": "The giant departs, leaving Harry uncertain. A snowy landscape and sleighs emerge, leading students to the Christmas-decorated Great Hall. Harry, Ron, and Hermione sit together, and later, Harry and Ron use wands to levitate cakes, which Crabbe and Goyle eat before fainting. In the girls' lavatory, Hermione shares a potion with Harry and Ron, who drink it, transforming into Crabbe and Goyle. Harry experiences pain but successfully transforms. In a corridor, they encounter Percy Weasley and Draco Malfoy. In the Slytherin common room, Draco confronts them briefly before backing off. Ron discovers a parcel, with Harry warning him as his scar begins to reappear."
