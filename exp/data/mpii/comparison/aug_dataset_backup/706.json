The atmosphere is dense with sand as he rises to his feet, attempting to protect his visage. Minute particles of high-speed sand shoot into his pores and splinter into pieces, merging with his own molecules, imparting his inner composition a sand-like semblance. Flint's hand turns to sand, and his digits are carried off in a violent gust. His whole form shifts to sand and is devoured by the wind until he utterly dissolves. The officers arrive at the margin of the pit and gaze down to find the condensers decelerating and Flint nowhere to be seen. Peter sits solitary in a hospital passageway, gazing vacantly at the paper cup in his hand. He glances up and swiftly stands as a physician approaches. The dark-haired, bearded physician departs, leaving Peter appearing contemplative. With a hesitant step, he traverses the window of a private chamber and looks inside. Harry is lying in bed with a dressing wrapped around his cranium. He turns to face the entrance and beams as Peter steps inside. Mary Jane enters. Mary Jane and Peter step into the passageway. Peter appears relieved. In the chamber, the caregiver beams at Harry. Large stones roll and clatter against each other. Seen from farther away, the stones resemble pebbles, and from even farther away the pebbles reveal themselves as millions of grains of sand which sweep along the floor of the pit like waves on a shore. The sand forms a curving figure, almost like a human form. The sinuous figure rises up as though to stand, then slumps down again. The figure reshapes and gradually rises in the guise of a human trunk from the waist up. It's Flint, now changed into Sandman. Sandman elevates his limbs and inspects his hefty, paw-like hands. He glances down at his body of sand, then places his hands to his large, round head. Sandman gazes at the heap of sand beside him and notices the locket Penny gifted him lying nearby. He reaches out to grasp the locket but the loose sand of his hand just disintegrates around it. He reaches out once more and his hand becomes more human, with slender, agile fingers. He picks up the locket between his finger and thumb, then drops it into his palm. The locket falls open, unveiling Penny's likeness inside. Sandman's vacant eyes appear sorrowful as they gaze down at the likeness. He grips the locket in his fist and pulls himself up from the sand like a man climbing out of a marsh. He stumbles as he finds his footing, then slowly steps forward, gradually becoming more human until he appears exactly as he did before the transformation, right down to his brown hair, green and black striped t-shirt, and beige chinos."

As he impacts the ground, the air swirls with thick clouds of sand enveloping him in a dense, swirling mist. He painstakingly pushes himself up into a standing position, instinctively raising his hands to shield his face from the onslaught. In this chaotic moment, tiny grains of high-speed sand cascade onto his skin, embedding themselves into his pores with such intensity that they splinter into minuscule fragments. These particles fuse seamlessly with his very molecules, altering his internal structure, endowing it with a sand-like appearance. The transformation begins, and Flint's hand morphs into sand, his fingers disintegrating into the fierce gusts that whisk them away. His entire being succumbs to this metamorphosis as his body becomes a cascade of sand, which the unrelenting wind devours until he completely vanishes, dissolving into the air. Concurrently, police officers arrive at the pit's edge, peering down into the scene to find the capacitors gradually decelerating, yet Flint is nowhere in sight, rendering him a phantom in the swirling dust. Meanwhile, Peter occupies a solitary seat in a hospital corridor, his gaze fixated on the disposable paper cup cradled in his hands. As his mind races, he lifts his head, alerted by the approach of a doctor whose dark hair and beard suggest a man of authority and compassion. The doctor continues on his way, leaving Peter alone, steeped in contemplation. With a cautious step, Peter edges past a private room window and glances inside to find Harry lying serenely in a bed, his head swathed in a white bandage. As Peter steps inside, Harry turns his head, spotting Peter at the doorway, and offers a smile of recognition and friendship. Moments later, Mary Jane joins them, and together with Peter, they step back into the corridor. A sense of relief washes over Peter, his worries momentarily alleviated. Inside Harry's room, a nurse beams warmly at him, a silent testament to hope and healing. Meanwhile, in a distant location, large rocks begin to shift, rolling gently against one another, their movements producing a rhythmic clinking sound. Viewed from a greater distance, the rocks resemble gravel, and from an even further vantage point, this gravel reveals itself to be countless grains of sand. These grains sweep across the floor of the pit in a mesmerizing dance, akin to waves lapping at the shore. The sand gathers and begins to coalesce, forming a curving shape—an outline reminiscent of a human body. This undulating shape struggles, rising as though it seeks to stand before slumping back once more, only to reform again. Gradually, it rises, taking on the form of a human torso, emerging from the waist up. It is Flint, reborn as Sandman, asserting himself in this new guise. Sandman lifts his newly formed arms, inspecting his bulky, paw-like hands with a mixture of wonder and trepidation. As he surveys his body composed entirely of sand, he places his hands upon his large, rounded head, trying to process this extraordinary transformation. His gaze shifts to the mound of sand at his side, where he spots the locket that Penny once gave him. Determined, he extends his hand toward it, but the loose sand of his fingers fails him, crumbling away around the locket. Resolute, he reaches out once more, focusing his intent until his hand takes on a more human form, with slender, agile fingers capable of delicate movement. He captures the locket between his thumb and index finger, gently closing his grasp to drop it into his palm. The locket opens as it falls, and Penny's picture is revealed inside. Sandman's hollow eyes reflect a profound melancholy, fixated on the image of Penny, embodying all his lost hopes and dreams. He clenches the locket tightly within his fist, using it as an anchor to haul himself from the encircling sand, akin to a man extracting himself from the depths of a swamp. Upon finding his balance, he stumbles momentarily, gradually regaining his footing and stepping forward with increasing confidence. With each step, his form becomes more human, reverting to his original appearance—complete with his brown hair, familiar green and black striped t-shirt, and the beige chinos he once wore."

Tiny granules of high velocity sand fly into his pores and shatter into fragments, fusing with his own molecules, which eerily reminds one of the process by which silicosis, a lung disease caused by inhaling fine silica particles, occurs, giving his internal structure a sand-like appearance. Flint's hand becomes sand, and his fingers blow away in a fierce wind that sweeps through the arid landscape.

With a tentative step, he passes the window of a private room reserved for serious cases and looks inside. Harry is lying in bed with a bandage wrapped around his head, evidence of a recent accident or surgery. He turns to face the doorway and smiles as Peter steps inside, relieved to see a familiar face.

Sandman raises his arms and examines his bulky, paw-like hands with curiosity and a hint of nostalgia. He looks down at his body of sand, then holds his hands to his large, round head, feeling the gritty texture. Sandman looks at the mound of sand next to him and spots the locket Penny, his beloved daughter, gave him lying nearby. He reaches out to pick up the locket but the loose sand of his hand just crumbles around it, reflecting his struggle for control. He reaches out again and his hand becomes more human, with slim, mobile fingers. He picks up the locket between his finger and thumb, then drops it into his palm. The locket falls open, revealing Penny's picture inside, a poignant reminder of his past life. Sandman's hollow eyes look melancholy as they gaze down at the picture, filled with longing and regret. He clenches the locket in his fist and hauls himself up from the sand like a man climbing out of a swamp, determined and resolute. He stumbles as he finds his footing, then slowly steps forward, gradually becoming more human until he looks exactly as he did before the change, right down to his brown hair, green and black striped t-shirt, trademarked for its distinctive pattern, and beige chinos."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

          "description": "He tries to escape but is struck by a capacitor, causing him to fall onto the sand. Sand granules fuse with his body, transforming his structure to sand-like. Flint disintegrates in the wind until he vanishes. The police arrive to find the capacitors slowing and Flint gone. In a hospital, Peter waits anxiously and enters Harry's room, where Harry, bandaged, smiles at him. Mary Jane joins Peter, and he appears relieved. Meanwhile, sand grains in the pit merge into a human shape as Flint becomes Sandman, examining his sand-formed body. Spotting a locket from Penny, he struggles to pick it up until his hand becomes human-like. Sandman gazes at Penny's picture, appearing melancholic, before regaining human form and emerging from the sand."
