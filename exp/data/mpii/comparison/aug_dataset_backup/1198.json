In a separate instance, Sebastian carefully tucks a knife into his belongings. John and Jenny, filled with anticipation, drive along a dusty path leading to a large pen filled with lively dogs. Blindfolded by John's silk tie, Jenny reaches out, her fingers brushing against the warm, fluffy puppies, eliciting delighted giggles.

A police car cruises past as John maneuvers into his driveway, where a patrol car sits idly, and a group of people gathers on the sunlit street, their faces filled with curiosity. He steps out of the car, cradling the rambunctious pup tenderly, while Marley, demonstrating his insatiable appetite, accidentally tips over the bag of dog food, scattering kibble everywhere before looking up with pleading, sorrowful eyes. As the night settles in, John switches off the cold garage light and retreats back into the cozy embrace of his house. He heads to the bathroom, brushing his teeth with methodical precision before going to bed and clamping a soft pillow over his ears to drown out the world. Restless, he rouses himself from bed, ventures to the garage to scoop up the sleepy pup, and tenderly carries Marley over his shoulder back inside. The morning light streams in as he wakes to Marley's wet nose and enthusiastic licks, discovering the pup playfully tangled amidst the aftermath of a ripped pillow and scattered clothes. With a resigned sigh, John heads for his car, closing the garage door with a firm click, while Marley squirms impatiently in his snug box, eager for the day's adventures to begin."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
