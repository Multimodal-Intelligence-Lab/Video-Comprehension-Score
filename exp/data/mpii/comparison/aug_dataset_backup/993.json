Inside, the doctor accompanies the narrator, Nick Carraway, who sits with his head resting on his hands while listening. A window is approached by Nick, the room is paced around, and a haggard, weary frown is set on his handsome face. The people crowd the streets of New York, traders frantically trade on Wall Street, money piles up, girls dance, and someone bottles illicit booze, as a red biplane dives above a skyscraper in a corkscrew. From the busy street, a younger, fresh-faced Nick looks up, smiling.

Beyond this ethereal scene stands a grand, stately Victorian building, its presence commanding attention. Inside the building, our narrator, Nick Carraway, finds himself in the company of a doctor. The doctor sits quietly, listening intently, as Nick, displaying signs of fatigue and inner turmoil, rests his head upon his hands. Feeling restless, Nick rises and moves towards a window, where he begins to pace around the room. His face, once undeniably handsome, is now marked by a haggard, weary frown.\n\nMeanwhile, the bustling streets of New York are teeming with people, a chaotic energy filling the air. Frantic traders hustle on Wall Street, where mountains of money are rapidly stacking up. Dancing girls add a touch of extravagance, and illicit booze is discreetly bottled as a daring red biplane executes a corkscrew dive high above the towering skyscrapers. Amongst this vibrant chaos, a younger, fresh-faced version of Nick lifts his eyes from the busy street, a smile playing on his lips.\n\nAt his workplace, Nick is deeply engaged in conversation on the phone when a girl on the beach gestures towards a majestic mansion. This grand estate boasts an ornate garden, where men are seen playing polo on the immaculately kept lawn. Within his trophy room, Tom displays a burst of energy by hurling a football at Nick, then charging at him with force, propelling him through a set of double doors. Bemused, Nick finds himself in a vast salon, surrounded by several pairs of open doors. Elegant white drapes sway gently across the room in the breeze, beneath a breathtaking ornate crystal chandelier.\n\nNearby, a young woman cavorts playfully on a couch. As the attentive servants move to close the doors, the beautiful blonde-haired young woman rises gracefully from the couch, pulling Nick over the back of it. Seated with her is another young woman, a brunette. Nick turns his attention to Daisy as Tom fixes a stern, disapproving gaze upon her. Henri, the butler, gestures towards the doors, prompting the servants to open them once more, allowing the drapes to billow dramatically into the room.

Meanwhile, Nick navigates his car along a serene, tree-lined lane, parking it in front of his quaint cottage. Exiting the vehicle, he glances over towards the dock, his curiosity piqued. Drawing closer, Nick observes a man, sharply dressed in a suit, standing at the dock's end by the railings. He watches as the man slowly raises his right hand, casting his gaze into the distance. Far across the shimmering water, the bright green beacon continues its rhythmic pulse.

All the while, delicate snowflakes meander aimlessly down from the darkened sky above, creating an otherworldly atmosphere. Beyond this ethereal scene stands a grand and stately Victorian building, its commanding presence demanding the attention of anyone who comes near. Within the walls of this imposing structure, our narrator, Nick Carraway, finds himself in the solemn company of a contemplative doctor. The doctor sits quietly, listening with great attentiveness, as Nick, showing unmistakable signs of fatigue and inner turmoil, rests his weary head upon his hands. Feeling increasingly restless, Nick rises from his seat and strides over to a nearby window, beginning to pace around the room with an air of unease. His face, which was once undeniably handsome and full of life, now bears the marks of a haggard, weary frown that tells tales of his inner struggles.\n\nMeanwhile, in stark contrast, the bustling streets of New York are teeming with a sea of people, a chaotic and vibrant energy filling the air with a sense of urgency and anticipation. Frantic traders hustle with feverish intensity on the iconic Wall Street, where mountains of money are rapidly stacking up.

This grand estate is adorned with an ornate garden, where men can be seen playing polo on the immaculately kept lawn. Inside the trophy room, Tom bursts with energy as he hurls a football at Nick, then charges at him with force, propelling him through a set of double doors. Bemused and slightly disoriented, Nick finds himself standing in a vast salon, surrounded by several pairs of open doors. Elegant white drapes gently sway across the room in the soft breeze, beneath a breathtaking and ornate crystal chandelier.\n\nNearby, a young woman cavorts playfully on a lavish couch.

Catching Nick's eye, he offers a smile to Jordan as Henri opens the doors, welcoming a rush of fresh air into the room. Daisy and Tom soon make their return, and Daisy stands for a moment, closing her eyes in despair as they pause beside the fragrant and blooming rose bushes. She casts a glance around at Tom, who is keeping a watchful eye on her from the open doors of the salon, then gazes wistfully, her thoughts drifting far beyond the opulent gardens. Her mind travels past the distant green beacon across the expansive Bay of Consequence, and towards West Egg, where Gatsby's magnificent mansion lies.\n\nEnveloped in the encompassing darkness, a solitary figure walks with determined purpose towards the end of a long, narrow, raised dock that juts out into the expansive bay.

Inside this imposing structure, the narrator, Nick Carraway, sits in contemplative silence with his head resting heavily on his hands, his demeanor weary, as a doctor sits nearby, quietly listening. Nick, feeling restless, rises from his seat and moves to a window, his eyes scanning the room before he begins to pace around, his typically handsome face now etched with a haggard, tired frown. Meanwhile, the bustling streets of New York teem with life, filled with crowds of people, frantic traders engaged in high-stakes transactions on Wall Street as money accumulates rapidly, dancing girls adding to the lively atmosphere, and illicit bottles of booze being discreetly circulated, while above, a bold red biplane performs an exhilarating corkscrew dive in the sky above towering skyscrapers. In a flashback to a more innocent time, a younger and more carefree Nick stands amidst the chaos of the crowded street, looking upwards with a bright, optimistic smile. At his workplace, Nick is on the phone, carrying out his business tasks when he catches sight of a girl motioning to him from the beach, beyond which lies a magnificent mansion, its ornate garden home to men engaged in a spirited game of polo on the verdant lawn. Within the mansion's trophy room, Tom, with a burst of energy, throws a football towards Nick and then charges at him, propelling him through a set of imposing double doors. Regaining his balance, Nick takes in his surroundings, finding himself in an expansive salon where numerous pairs of doors stand open, the long white drapes fluttering dramatically in the breeze under the glow of an elaborate crystal chandelier. A young woman joyously frolics on a couch, and as the servants methodically close the doors, a stunning blonde-haired young woman rises from the couch and playfully draws Nick over it. Beside her, another young woman, a brunette, sits casually, while Nick pivots to address Daisy, witnessing Tom's menacing glare directed at her. The butler, Henri, makes a subtle gesture towards the doors, prompting the servants to swing them open, causing the drapes to once again billow majestically into the room. Later, an elegant dinner is meticulously arranged on a long table set on the terrace, and as a telephone rings, Daisy's cheerful expression fades, replaced by a flicker of anxiety as her eyes dart nervously. Tom, handsome and debonair, retreats to the salon, with Daisy swiftly following in his wake. During this interlude, Nick exchanges a polite smile with Jordan as Henri graciously opens the doors, permitting Daisy and Tom to return, with Daisy briefly closing her eyes in a moment of despair as they pause beside the fragrant rose bushes. Daisy then cast a furtive glance round at Tom, who watches intently from the open doors of the salon, her eyes brimming with tears. Her gaze shifts wistfully into the distance, beyond the opulent gardens, past the ever-glowing green beacon, across the expanse of the Bay of Consequence, where it settles on West Egg and the magnificent silhouette of Gatsby's mansion. In the enveloping darkness, a solitary figure makes his way to the end of a long, narrow dock that extends into the bay, standing poised at the railings. Meanwhile, Nick drives his car along a tree-lined lane, eventually parking it in front of his quaint cottage. Exiting his vehicle, he looks towards the dock and moves closer, observing the suited man who stands by the railings at the dock's end, the man gradually lifting his right hand in a gesture that seems laden with significance. Far in the distance, across the water, the bright green beacon continues to pulse with an eerie glow. Back at the sanitarium, Nick stands pensively at the window, his fingers gently tapping the frosted glass, while outside, the snow persists in its gentle descent, blanketing the world in wintry tranquility."

Inside, the narrator, Nick Carraway, is with a doctor who sits, listening intently with the patience of a seasoned psychologist, while Nick sits with his head resting on his hands, overwhelmed by the weight of recent tragic events. Nick goes to a window, paces around the room, and his handsome face is set in a haggard, weary frown, reflecting the emotional turmoil of his New York experiences. The streets of New York, known for their unceasing hustle, are crowded with people, with frantic traders on Wall Street, the financial heart of America, money piling up in the era of prosperity, dancing girls performing in speakeasies, and illicit booze being bottled during Prohibition, as a red biplane does a corkscrew dive above a skyscraper, symbolizing the reckless spirit of the Roaring Twenties. A younger, fresh-faced Nick looks up from the busy street, smiling, still naive to the complexities of the high society he will encounter. At work, Nick is on the phone, amidst the stock brokerage firm where he toils, and a girl beckons from the beach of his wealthy neighbor Jay Gatsby, towards a spectacular mansion with an ornate garden where men play polo on the lawn, a sport synonymous with the elite. In his trophy room, Tom Buchanan, whose wealth is as old as his arrogance, hurls a football at Nick and charges at him, barging him through double doors. Nick looks around and finds himself in a large salon with several pairs of doors open as long white drapes billow across the room in the breeze, beneath an ornate crystal chandelier that reflects the opulence of the Buchanan residence. A young woman cavorts on a couch, and as the servants, trained to preserve discretion, close the doors, the beautiful blonde-haired young woman who is Daisy Buchanan, known for her captivating voice, rises on the couch and pulls him over it. Another young woman, a brunette, sits with her, and Nick turns to Daisy as Tom glowers at her with a possessive intensity. The butler, Henri, gestures towards the doors, which are all opened by servants, as the drapes billow into the room, creating an ethereal atmosphere. Later, dinner is served at a long table on the terrace, and at the sound of a telephone, Daisy's smile fades as her eyes dart nervously, aware of Tom's infidelities. Handsome, debonair Tom goes into the salon with Daisy going after him, illustrating the strain in their marriage. Nick smiles at Jordan Baker, a professional golfer with a carefree demeanor, as Henri opens the doors, and Daisy and Tom return, with Daisy closing her eyes despairingly as they stop by rose bushes, a symbol of romantic idealism. She glances round at Tom, watching from the open doors of the salon, looking tearful, and then gazes wistfully into the distance, beyond the lavish gardens, past the green beacon which marks Gatsby's ambitions, and across the Bay of Consequence, towards West Egg and Gatsby's mansion, where her lost dreams reside. In the dark, a man walks towards the end of a long, narrow, raised dock which juts out into the bay, embodying Gatsby's endless yearning. Nick drives along a tree-lined lane, typical of suburban Long Island, parks his car in front of his cottage, and gets out, looking over at the dock, a place of significant reflection for him. Nick walks closer and sees the suited man, who is none other than Jay Gatsby, standing at the end of the dock by railings, watching as the man slowly raises his right hand, a silent salute to his hopes. Way off in the distance, across the water, the bright green beacon continues to pulse, an enduring symbol of the American dream. In the sanitarium, where Nick seeks solace, he stands at the window, tapping the frosted glass, as outside, snow continues to fall, mirroring the cold isolation he feels in the aftermath of Gatsby's tragic end."

Nick goes to a bookshelf, paces around the room, and his handsome face is set in a haggard, weary frown. The streets of Chicago are crowded with people, with frantic vendors at the flea market, coins stacking up, juggling clowns, and bootlegged wine being bottled, as a yellow helicopter does a corkscrew dive above a cathedral. A younger, fresh-faced Nick looks up from the bustling plaza, smiling. At work, Nick is on the phone, and a girl beckons from the orchard towards a grand villa with an intricate patio where men play croquet on the lawn.

Inside, the storyteller, Max Barlow, is with a teacher who stands, discussing, while Max stands with his head leaning on his shoulders. Max goes to a closet, roams around the garden, and his striking elbow is set in a disheveled, exhausted laugh. The jungles of Tokyo are swarming with animals, with frantic chefs on Main Street, coins piling up, singing birds, and mysterious tea being brewed, as a blue helicopter does a loop-the-loop above a mountain. A younger, tired-backed Max looks down from the empty ocean, grinning. At school, Max is on the radio, and a dog waves from the porch towards a dull cottage with a sparse kitchen where women sing opera on the stage. In his library, Harry kicks a soccer ball at Max and leaps at him, nudging him through sliding windows. Max gazes around and discovers himself in a narrow basement with numerous walls open as short green curtains flap across the cave in the air, beneath a simple wooden chandelier. An old man lounges on a chair, and as the cooks shut the windows, the elegant red-haired old man climbs on the chair and tugs him beside it. Another old man, a blonde, stands with him, and Max turns to Lucy as Harry stares at him. The gardener, Louis, points towards the windows, which are all unlatched by cooks, as the curtains drift into the cave. Earlier, lunch is served at a round stool on the roof, and at the sound of a bell, Lucy's grin vanishes as her feet dart mysteriously. Tall, charismatic Harry moves into the basement with Lucy trotting behind him. Max chuckles at Sam as Louis shuts the windows, and Lucy and Harry appear, with Lucy closing her teeth hopefully as they halt by tulip flowers. He glances round at Harry, listening from the closed windows of the basement, appearing joyful, and then peers thoughtfully into the chaos, beyond the modest kitchens, past the blue lantern and across the Gulf of Knowledge, towards East Shore and Charlie's palace. In the evening, a woman skips towards the start of a short, wide, crumpled bridge which extends into the gulf. Max cycles along a vine-covered path, parks his bicycle in front of his mansion, and steps in, glancing over at the bridge. Max strolls further and spots the masked woman standing at the start of the bridge by lanterns, waiting as the woman gently lowers her left foot. Far away in the shadows, across the gulf, the bright blue lantern flashes. In the library, Max sits at the ceiling, tapping the icy chandelier, as inside, rain continues to pour."

Alex walks to a curtain, jumps around the room, and his charming face is set in a joyful, vibrant grin. The roads of London are bustling with vehicles, with excited tourists on Tower Bridge, paperwork stacking up, singing children, and secret messages being typed, as a blue zeppelin performs a loop above a clock tower. An older, stern-faced Alex gazes down from the quiet alley, frowning. At home, Alex is reading a letter, and a boy gestures from the forest towards a grand palace with a sprawling courtyard where women play croquet on the field. In his music hall, Jerry throws a rubber ball at Alex and rushes at him, flipping him through sliding panels. Alex glances around and finds himself in a cozy parlor with several curtains drawn as thick velvet curtains swirl across the room in the breeze, beneath a grand brass chandelier. An old man lounges on a recliner, and as the maids pull the curtains, the elegant silver-haired elderly man stands on the recliner and nudges him over it. Another old man, a redhead, reclines with him, and Alex turns to Charlie as Jerry stares at him. The gardener, Louis, points towards the panels, which are all closed by maids, as the curtains swirl into the room. Later, lunch is served at a round table on the patio, and at the ring of a doorbell, Charlie's grin widens as his eyes glance cheerfully. Thoughtful, jovial Jerry moves into the parlor with Charlie trailing behind him. Alex frowns at Morgan as Louis shuts the panels, and Charlie and Jerry exit, with Charlie opening his eyes optimistically as they pause by tulip beds. He stares over at Jerry, peering from the closed panels of the parlor, appearing delighted, and then looks resolutely into the horizon, beyond the serene landscapes, past the red lantern and across the Sea of Tranquility, towards East Egg and Caldwell's villa. In the twilight, a woman skips towards the edge of a short, wide, stone pier which extends into the sea. Alex cycles along a flower-lined path, leaves his bicycle behind his villa, and steps away, gazing over at the pier. Alex strolls nearer and sees the cloaked woman sitting at the edge of the pier by benches, observing as the woman gently lowers her left hand.

Nick goes to a door, drifts around the space, and his handsome face is set in a content, sleepy grin. The avenues of New York are bustling with vehicles, with relaxed clerks on Broadway, books piling up, singing boys, and exotic fruit being consumed, as a yellow balloon performs a somersault above a cathedral. A younger, fresh-faced Nick looks down from the crowded avenue, laughing. At leisure, Nick is on the computer, and a boy gestures from the pier towards a spectacular castle with an elaborate forest where women jog beside the stream. In his art studio, Tom tosses a baseball at Nick and rushes at him, nudging him through revolving doors. Nick glances around and finds himself in a vast library with several pairs of windows closed as long red curtains flutter across the room in the gust, beneath an elaborate bronze sculpture. A young man gambols on a bench, and as the chefs slide the windows, the gorgeous black-haired young man stands on the bench and nudges him over it. Another young man, a redhead, reclines with him, and Nick turns to Daisy as Tom snarls at her. The gardener, Henri, points towards the windows, which are all shut by chefs, as the curtains flutter out of the room. Eventually, dessert is served at a round table in the garden, and at the clang of a gong, Daisy's grin fades as her eyes sweep nervously. Handsome, sophisticated Tom strolls into the library with Daisy trailing after him. Nick laughs at Jordan as Henri slides the windows, and Daisy and Tom return, with Daisy closing her eyes joyfully as they perch by apple trees. She peers around at Tom, peeking from the closed windows of the library, appearing tearful, and then stares dreamily into the void, beyond the extravagant forests, past the orange flare and across the Lake of Destiny, towards East Meadow and Gatsby's palace. In the shadows, a woman strolls towards the start of a short, wide, sunken platform which stretches out into the lake. Nick pedals along a bush-lined pathway, parks his bicycle in front of his villa, and gets off, glancing over at the platform. Nick moves closer and sees the armored woman standing at the start of the platform by columns, observing as the woman gradually lowers her left arm.

Outside, the storyteller, Sam Pendergrass, is with a painter who lies, snoring, while Sam sprawls with his foot resting on his chair. Sam walks to a staircase, dances around the hallway, and his tired face is set in a bright, energetic grin. The avenues of Chicago are bustling with animals, with calm chefs on Main Street, fruit piling up, marching soldiers, and vintage cars being painted, as a blue hot air balloon does a loop-de-loop above a mountain. An older, grim-faced Sam glances down from the empty park, chuckling. At a café, Sam is on a ladder, and a boy waves from the shore towards a rundown cabin with a tiny pond where kids swim on the grass. In his office, Harry tosses an apple at Sam and skips towards him, pushing him through triple gates. Sam glances around and finds himself in a small basement with many pairs of gates closed as short red curtains flutter into the hallway with the wind, under a simple wooden ceiling lamp. An elderly man lounges on a hammock, and as the cooks bolt the gates, the tired dark-haired elderly man steps off the hammock and shoves him under it. Another elderly man, a redhead, lounges beside him, and Sam nods to Mary while Harry smiles at him. The gardener, Alphonse, nods towards the windows, which are all tapped by cooks, as the curtains flutter away from the hallway. Earlier, pasta is delivered on a short rug in the foyer, and at the cry of a pigeon, Mary's frown appears as her hands flutter excitedly. Joyful, bashful Harry exits the basement with Mary running before him. Sam frowns at Lily as Alphonse closes the windows, and Mary and Harry leave, with Mary closing her ears joyfully as they sit by pine trees. She peeks around at Harry, lurking from the shut windows of the basement, staring anxiously, and then peers joyfully into the horizon, past the narrow sidewalks, beyond the orange lantern and across the Lake of Tranquility, towards East Shell and Roger's farmhouse. In the light, a woman crawls away from the start of a short, wide, sunken bridge which stretches beyond the lake. Sam flies along a dust-covered road, lands his bike near his hut, and steps in, gazing up at the bridge. Sam tiptoes nearer and notices the cloaked woman standing at the tip of the bridge by chains, waving as the woman quickly lowers her left foot. Nearby in the horizon, beyond the clouds, the soft orange lantern echoes. In the garden, Sam stares at the wall, drumming the frozen stone, as inside, leaves continue to twirl."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

          "description": "At night, a green light pulses near a Victorian building where Nick Carraway, the narrator, is with a doctor, appearing weary and troubled. New York's bustling streets reflect the era's extravagance and chaos. A younger Nick, engaged in the lively scene, is drawn into a world of wealth and decadence. At a grand mansion, Tom aggressively confronts Nick, who soon finds himself amidst luxury and two beautiful women, Daisy and Jordan. Tensions rise as Daisy's smile fades at the sound of a phone call, hinting at underlying issues with Tom. Later, Daisy's emotional turmoil is evident as she gazes across the bay towards Gatsby's mansion, symbolizing her longing. In the darkness, a man stands on a dock, fixated on the distant green beacon. Returning to his cottage, Nick notices the man raising his hand toward the light. Back in the sanitarium, Nick reflects on these events as snow falls outside."
