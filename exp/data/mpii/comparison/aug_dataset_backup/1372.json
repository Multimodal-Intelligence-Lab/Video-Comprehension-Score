He unlocks the entry portal, and within it is just as dim. He starts ascending the steps, perceiving murmurs and muted voices originating from upstairs. The elderly gentleman lingers outside the chamber where the dialogue is occurring and listens on as a serpent glides past him into the chamber. Wormtail stands in the threshold and gazes at the elderly gentleman, who appears horrified. A deafening enchantment is cast, and Harry awakens in a burst of alarm, agitated and still panicking. Hermione moves over to Ron's bed and they clasp hands, then stroll up the incline. The camera focuses in on a footwear atop the hillside and everyone is in a circle, placing their hands on the footwear. Harry dashes over and places his hand on the footwear, and there's a bright flash, suddenly dispatching them all soaring through the atmosphere. Everyone exults as Harry, Hermione, and the youthful Weasleys descend to the earth with a thud while Arthur, Amos, and Cedric descend more elegantly. Cedric assists Harry to his feet, and they traverse the meadow, observing a vast throng gathered and exclaiming, with canopies erected all over. They proceed into the throng, absorbing the vistas and approach a small shelter, where Amos and Cedric part and saunter off. They enter the shelter, which is many times larger on the inside than the exterior. They remove their feet from the table and place them back on immediately as Arthur has strolled past. The scene shifts up the hillside onto a large arena with a huge number of tiers where the Weasleys and Harry are locating their places as Lucius Malfoy and Draco stroll beneath them. The ceremonies commence with balloons flying and pyrotechnics igniting. Five verdant and alabaster figures soar through the atmosphere on their brooms leaving a colored trail behind them as a sparkling leprechaun materializes in the sky and starts cavorting, making everyone exhilarated. Five crimson figures appear this instance, with one executing a feat on a broom and another one appearing on the large display. Viktor Krum salutes to the throng, and Harry participates. Suddenly, the crowd is panicked and scurrying all over, and Harry is trampled senseless. The throngs have all departed, and a man ambles through the debris kicking at items. He casts a spell that causes a luminous flash, and a large spectral skull forms in the sky with a serpent slithering from it. The man grins wickedly, clearly deranged, as Harry stirs and observes him standing there, prompting Harry to flee. They gaze at the monstrous thing in the sky as Harry clutches his head in agony."

As he gingerly opens the front door, he finds that the interior remains as shrouded in darkness as the world outside. He starts to ascend the creaking stairs, and as he carefully does so, he hears soft whispers and hushed voices drifting down from the upper floor. The old man pauses right outside the room where the muted conversation is occurring, listening intently, as a snake silently slithers past him and into the dimly lit room. Wormtail stands with an ominous presence in the doorway, casting a menacing glance at the old man, who appears utterly terrified and frozen in fear. In a sudden, startling moment, a loud spell resonates through the air, and Harry jolts awake, a flash of panic enveloping him, leaving him feeling flustered, overwhelmed, and still gripped by a lingering state of panic. Hermione then makes her way over to Ron's bed, and they engage in a friendly handshake before they begin their journey walking up the hill together. The camera captures a close-up of a boot positioned at the very top of the hillside, and everyone gathers around it in a circle, placing their hands on the boot. Harry rushes over eagerly to join them, placing his hand firmly on the boot as well, and there's a brilliant, dazzling white flash that suddenly propels them all flying through the air.

They take their feet off the table momentarily, only to put them back on as soon as Arthur has walked past. The scene then dramatically pans up the hillside to reveal a large stadium boasting an impressive number of floors, where the Weasleys and Harry are in the process of eagerly finding their seats, while Lucius Malfoy and Draco walk purposefully below them. The ceremonies commence grandly with balloons soaring majestically into the sky and fireworks exploding in bursts of vibrant color. Five green and white figures gracefully fly through the air on their brooms, leaving a vibrant colored trail behind them, as a glittering leprechaun spectacularly appears in the sky and begins to dance, filling everyone with excitement and anticipation. This time, five red figures make their dynamic appearance, with one performing a daring stunt on a broom and another one appearing prominently on the large screen. Viktor Krum waves enthusiastically to the crowd, and Harry eagerly joins in, waving back. Suddenly, the crowd is thrown into a chaotic state of panic, rushing frantically in all directions, and Harry is trampled unconscious in the ensuing chaos. The once-crowded scene has dispersed entirely, and a man walks through the debris-strewn rubble, kicking at the remnants. He casts a spell that results in a bright flash, and a large ghostly skull forms ominously in the sky, with a snake ominously crawling from its gaping mouth. The man grins evilly, his demeanor clearly demented and sinister, as Harry stirs and witnesses him standing there, prompting Harry to flee in terror. They gaze up at the monstrous apparition in the sky, looming overhead, as Harry clutches his head in excruciating pain."

Meanwhile, an old man, with a cautious yet determined gait, approaches the house, his hand gripping a lit torch that flickers in the dimness. As he reaches the front door, he pushes it open, revealing an interior shrouded in darkness, mirroring the night outside. He steps inside, allowing his eyes to adjust to the gloom, and starts ascending the staircase, each footfall echoing softly. As he climbs, he becomes aware of whispers and hushed voices drifting down from above, their source hidden but unmistakably present. Outside the room where the murmured conversation unfolds, the old man pauses, straining to catch the words, while a snake silently slithers past him, slipping into the room with an eerie grace. Wormtail stands in the doorway, casting a glance at the old man, whose face is etched with terror. Suddenly, a loud spell reverberates through the air, jolting Harry awake in a flash of panic. His heart races as he sits up, flustered and still caught in the grip of fear. Meanwhile, Hermione crosses the room to Ron's bed, where they exchange a firm handshake, a silent agreement passing between them. Together, they make their way up the hill, their steps synchronized. The camera focuses on a boot perched atop the hillside, around which everyone gathers in a circle, each person reaching out to place a hand on it. Harry hurries over, extending his hand to join the others on the boot, and in an instant, a white flash envelops them, propelling them through the air. As they soar, cheers erupt from the group, and Harry, Hermione, and the young Weasleys land with a thump, while Arthur, Amos, and Cedric descend with more grace. Cedric offers Harry a hand, helping him to his feet, and together they traverse the field, their eyes taking in the massive crowd that has gathered, tents dotting the landscape. They weave through the throng, absorbing the vibrant atmosphere, and approach a small tent where Amos and Cedric part ways, disappearing into the crowd. Entering the tent, they find it surprisingly spacious, its interior far larger than its exterior suggests. They settle in, briefly lifting their feet off the table, only to replace them as Arthur walks by. The scene shifts, panning up the hillside to reveal a sprawling stadium with numerous floors, where the Weasleys and Harry locate their seats, observing as Lucius Malfoy and Draco pass below. The ceremonies commence with a burst of balloons and fireworks, filling the sky with color. Five green and white figures streak through the air on brooms, leaving a vibrant trail, while a glittering leprechaun materializes above, dancing and stirring excitement among the spectators. Next, five red figures appear, one executing a daring stunt on a broom, another magnified on the large screen. Viktor Krum waves to the crowd, prompting Harry to join in the enthusiastic response. Suddenly, chaos erupts as panic spreads through the crowd, people rushing in all directions, and Harry is caught in the tumult, trampled into unconsciousness. When he regains awareness, the once-bustling area is deserted, and a man strides through the debris, kicking at remnants. He casts a spell, unleashing a bright flash that conjures a large, ghostly skull in the sky, a snake slithering from its mouth. The man grins with a twisted satisfaction, his demeanor unhinged, as Harry, stirring from his daze, witnesses the scene and instinctively flees. He pauses to gaze at the monstrous apparition in the sky, clutching his head in pain as the reality of the situation sinks in."

He opens the front door, and inside it is just as dark, reminiscent of the tales of eerie silence that locals speak of. He begins climbing the stairs, hearing whispers and hushed voices rumored to be the ghosts of the former residents coming from upstairs. The old man waits outside the room where the conversation is taking place, listening intently as a snake, often associated with dark magic due to its symbolism in various mythologies, slithers past him into the room. Wormtail, a follower notorious for his treacherous past, stands in the doorway and looks at the old man, who looks terrified. A loud spell, possibly from the dark arts, is cast and Harry wakes up in a flash of panic, flustered and still panicking, as if escaping from a nightmare. Hermione goes over to Ron's bed and they shake hands, a gesture of mutual support and friendship, then walk up the hill. The camera homes in on a boot on top of the hillside, known to be a Portkey, and everyone is in a circle, putting their hands on the boot. Harry rushes over and puts his hand on the boot, and there's a white flash, suddenly sending them all flying through the air to their destination. Everyone cheers as Harry, Hermione, and the young Weasleys crash to the ground with a thump while Arthur, Amos, and Cedric, skilled at using Portkeys, come down more gracefully. Cedric helps Harry to his feet, embodying the spirit of sportsmanship, and they walk across the field, seeing a massive crowd gathered and cheering for the Quidditch World Cup, with tents set up all over. They walk into the crowd, taking in the sights of the international wizarding community, and approach a small tent, which, due to its enchantment, is many times bigger on the inside than the outside. Amos and Cedric separate and walk off, likely to meet fellow enthusiasts. They take their feet off the table and put them back on as soon as Arthur has walked past, obeying his fatherly authority. The scene pans up the hillside onto a large stadium, the venue of the world-famous Quidditch match, with a huge number of floors where the Weasleys and Harry are finding their seats as Lucius Malfoy and Draco, known for their ties to the dark arts, walk below them. The ceremonies begin with balloons flying and fireworks going off, showcasing wizarding entertainment at its finest. Five green and white figures, representing the Irish Quidditch team, fly through the air on their brooms leaving a colored trail behind them as a glittering leprechaun, an iconic symbol of Irish folklore, appears in the sky and starts dancing, making everyone excited. Five red figures appear this time, the Bulgarian team, with one performing a stunt on a broom and another one, Viktor Krum, a famous Seeker, appearing on the large screen. Viktor Krum waves to the crowd, and Harry joins in, excited to see his idol. Suddenly, the crowd is panicked and rushing all over, and Harry is trampled unconscious by the panicked stampede. The crowds have all gone, and a man, possibly a Death Eater, walks through the rubble kicking at things. He casts a spell that causes a bright flash, and a large ghostly skull with a snake crawling from it, known as the Dark Mark, forms in the sky. The man grins evilly, clearly demented and reveling in chaos, as Harry stirs and witnesses him standing there, leading Harry to run in fear. They look at the monstrous thing in the sky as Harry holds his head in pain, the scar that connects him to darker forces throbbing with intensity."

Five yellow spirits disappear this time, with one sketching a picture on a carpet and another one vanishing from the tiny painting. Luna Lovegood nods to the sea, and Draco abstains. Gradually, the sea is calm and flowing nowhere, and Luna is floating conscious. The waves have all stilled, and a child skips beneath the ripples whispering about things. She whispers a lullaby that prompts a quiet echo, and a tiny ethereal dolphin forms in the ocean with a rat swimming from it. The child giggles playfully, seemingly delighted, as Luna stirs and watches her skipping there, prompting Luna to skip.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
