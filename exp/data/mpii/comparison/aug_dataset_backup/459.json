Inigo aims for the Count's left shoulder, lunges true where the Count had struck him, and then his sword penetrates the Count's right shoulder, the identical location where Inigo was injured. The six-fingered weapon impacts, creating a gash hemorrhaging along one of Rugen's cheeks; the magnificent blade glints once more, leaving a similar gash on Rugen's other cheek. Inigo, moving nearly too swiftly for the eye to track, strikes one ultimate time, hitting exact center, and the sword is entirely through the Count. They are nearly motionless like that for a moment, then Inigo retracts his sword, and the Count collapses down, lying deceased. Rugen’s complexion is pale, and blood cascades from the similar slashes on his cheeks, with his eyes protruding wide, full of terror, while Inigo gazes at him. Westley reclines as prior, unmoving with his head on the headboard, Yellin's sword at his flank, as Buttercup is beside the bed, her eyes never leaving his visage. Humperdinck arrives in the chamber, gazing at them, and draws out his weapon. Westley rests there easily, speaks softly at first, clutching his sword, and then pauses, as a look of dread returns to Humperdinck’s eyes. Humperdinck attempts to mask the escalating dread inside him, while Westley stares at him and gradually starts to move, rotating his body, placing his feet on the ground, and standing with his sword in a combat stance. Prince Humperdinck, in a state of alarm, doesn’t know whether to urinate or wind his timepiece, eventually hurls his weapon to the ground. Westley speaks to Buttercup as Humperdinck sits, and as she sets to work, Inigo enters, glancing around. Humperdinck begins struggling with his bindings as they regard one another, then advance to the balcony, where Fezzik stands below, leading four immense pale steeds. He glances up to observe them on the balcony as Inigo, Westley, and Buttercup peer down at him. Fezzik extends his arms as Buttercup drifts through the sky, leaping from the balcony so Fezzik can seize her, and her descent, appearing in slow motion, resembles soaring."

The Count's right shoulder is then entered by his blade, in the same spot where Inigo was wounded. A slash bleeding along one of Rugen's cheeks is created by the six-fingered sword as it strikes; the great sword flashes again, and a parallel slash is left on Rugen's other cheek.

This failure pushes him to advance forward even more determinedly, while Count Rugen retreats rapidly, moving with increasing speed in circles around the table. Inigo, with expert and precise control, drives his sword towards the Count's left shoulder, thrusting it home with accuracy into the exact spot where the Count had previously wounded him in the past. Then, with deftness and precision, his blade skillfully finds its way to the Count's right shoulder as well, hitting the very places where Inigo himself had suffered injury.

With every ounce of concentration, he slashes with exceptional skill, each movement a precise dance, though none of his expertly executed blows penetrate his opponent's defenses. Determined, he presses forward, his body leaning in determination, as Count Rugen retreats with hurried steps, maneuvering quickly around the table to evade Inigo's relentless pursuit. Inigo targets the Count's left shoulder with focused precision, aiming his blade true and thrusting it home into the exact spot where the Count had once wounded him, experiencing a moment of personal vindication. Without pausing, he redirects his energy and his blade enters the Count's right shoulder, mirroring the spot where Inigo himself had been injured. The six-fingered sword swings with impeccable grace and strength, creating a slash across Rugen's cheek that immediately begins to bleed. Quickly and efficiently, Inigo maneuvers to create another strike, his sword a blur, and leaves a matching slash on Rugen's other cheek. With a speed that challenges the eye's ability to follow, Inigo delivers a final, decisive blow, hitting dead center; the thrust is so powerful and true that his sword passes cleanly through the Count. For a brief moment, they stand almost frozen in a macabre tableau, the intensity of the confrontation hanging in the air, until Inigo deliberately withdraws his sword, stepping back as Count Rugen succumbs to gravity and collapses, lying lifeless on the floor. Rugen’s skin takes on an ashen hue, blood vividly streaming from the parallel cuts on his cheeks, and his eyes, wide with fear, seem to bulge, conveying a final expression of terror as Inigo gazes at him. Meanwhile, Westley remains as still as before, his head resting against the headboard, Yellin's sword positioned by his side, while Buttercup remains steadfast at the bedside, her eyes focused intently on Westley’s face, filled with concern. Humperdinck enters the room, his gaze sweeping across the scene, his mind processing the unexpected tableau, and draws his sword with an air of bravado that belies his internal turmoil. Westley, lying comfortably despite the tension, begins to speak softly, his voice measured and calm, while his hand instinctively grips his sword. As he pauses, his words cut through the silence, instilling a renewed sense of fear in Humperdinck’s eyes that betrays the panic simmering beneath his facade. Humperdinck struggles internally, trying to conceal the fear that is rising within him, while Westley maintains his stare, slowly and deliberately shifting his body, turning with purpose until both feet rest firmly on the floor, and he rises to stand resolutely in a fighting stance. Overwhelmed by panic, Prince Humperdinck feels a chaotic indecision, torn between the impulse to flee or fight, until he gives in to fear and discards his sword onto the floor with a clatter. Westley turns to speak to Buttercup, his voice carrying a reassurance, as Humperdinck resigns himself to a seat, the tension in the room relaxing slightly as Buttercup sets to work on the task at hand. Inigo enters, his gaze sweeping across the room, taking in the aftermath and the company around him. Humperdinck, finding his hands occupied with bonds, begins a fruitless struggle for freedom as they all exchange glances, a silent understanding passing between them. Turning their attention to the balcony, they spot Fezzik standing below, a formidable presence, guiding four great white horses. As he glances upward, his eyes meet theirs, Inigo, Westley, and Buttercup look down, contemplating their next move. Demonstrating trust and courage, Buttercup ascends the balcony railing and launches herself into the air with an elegance that makes the moment seem to unfold in slow motion; she descends gracefully as if flying, her trajectory aimed at Fezzik's waiting arms that extend to safely catch her, completing the daring leap."

The seven-fingered dagger jabs, carving a dot dripping along one of Fabian's elbows; the petite dagger blinks again, marking a twin dot on Fabian's other elbow. Zara, gliding nearly too swiftly for the moon's gaze to catch, taps one concluding moment, striking bullseye, and the dagger is clean through the Count.

Gregory attempts to reveal the shrinking laughter outside him, while Oliver grins at him and lazily starts to glide, spinning his nose toward the sky, and flipping with his dagger in a swinging position. Duke Gregory, in a state of amusement, doesn’t know whether to skip or twist his ring, eventually releases his dagger to the sky. Oliver hums to Clementine as Gregory rolls, and as she flutters to play, Zara exits, whistling around.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
