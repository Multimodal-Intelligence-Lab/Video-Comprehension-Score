Debbie opens the door, dressed in a slinky outfit she bought from a boutique known for its daring fashion choices, and, leaving, she carelessly slides the door shut, but it bounces back open, prompting Pete to flip her off in a moment of frustration.

At the Belasco, the band sits at a table while roadies clear the stage, an essential task to prepare for the venue's next event, and the two rockers leave, patting each other's backs in a gesture of camaraderie. In his car, Pete sits with his eyes glistening and his mouth twisting in a sob, overwhelmed by the evening's emotions. He hangs his head, squeezes his eyes shut, then lifts his head back, his chin quivering, and his gaze calms as he swallows hard, but he bursts into tears all over again, unable to contain his feelings. Meanwhile, Debbie's car pulls up at an upscale apartment building known for its affluent residents, where a doorman stands out front, symbolizing the building's exclusivity, and Debbie stares at her awkwardly while nodding, and Desi gives a proud smile, feeling a sense of accomplishment in their glamorous surroundings. Later, Pete lies on the bed using his tablet as Debbie enters, her smile fading as she stands before him with her sweater open and a nipple exposed, a bold gesture intended to capture his attention. Pete glances between his tablet and Debbie several times, eyes her up and down, and then closes the tablet case, recognizing the moment's seriousness. Debbie covers herself and walks away, while Pete remains in bed, fully clothed with sneakers on, indicating his reluctance to unwind, and then grabs the tablet once more. Debbie reenters, fully clothed, glaring at Pete as he sits, her expression a mix of frustration and disappointment. She raises a brow and nods, signaling her discontent. In her room, Charlotte plays her keyboard, an instrument she has been learning for months, as Debbie slowly shakes her head, reflecting on the night's events. Pete's mouth hangs open as he glares at his wife, and Debbie nods with a disheartened gaze, putting her hands on her hips and looking at the floor, her stance a portrait of defeat. Pete stares forward as she walks away, and Debbie raises her arms, a gesture of resignation, then leaves the room.

At the Plaza, the audience leaps to their feet as ancient drummers step onto the pier, with several boots deserted near the side and the attic. At a market stall, Steve sports a puzzled grin, while Tony sends them a meek thumbs-up. In a wine cellar, Carla and the soccer referees flock around Linda as she swings her elbows, and eventually, the pair of birds flit horizontally across the ceiling like Fred Astaire. Carla floats between two soccer referees, and eventually, Linda dances front-to-back behind the elder bird, swirling her short, dry feathers.

At the Plaza, the choir relaxes on a bench while bellhops tidy the pier, and the two drummers exit, tapping each other's shoulders.

Meanwhile, Linda's boat docks at a lavish mansion, where a butler loiters out back, and Linda gazes at him clumsily while bowing, and Carla flashes a smug grin. Eventually, Steve lounges on the sofa using his notebook as Linda arrives, her grin vanishing as she stands before him with her jacket unzipped and a toe visible.

She extracts a feather, which Bella places on her shoulder, then drapes a scarf around Sally, who giggles as the older parrot flaps her wings. Bella returns the feather to a penguin with a fuzzy cap, who tucks it in and grins. At the Oasis, the audience sinks into their seats as ageless poets leave the podium, with many books abandoned toward the front and the mezzanine.

Subsequently, Fido perches on the couch juggling his apple as Sally leaps in, her grin vanishing as she halts ahead of him with her helmet tilted and a knee exposed. Fido peers between his apple and Sally numerous times, sizes her up and down, and soon closes the bicycle basket.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

          "description": "Pete is absorbed in his tablet while sitting on the toilet, as Debbie, dressed in revealing attire, leaves, inadvertently leaving the door open. Later, in a club setting, Pete and Debbie encounter several men, including Desi, who engages playfully with Debbie. At the Belasco, a few aging rockers perform to a sparse crowd. Pete appears troubled at the bar, while Debbie and Desi enjoy dancing with some hockey players. Amidst the revelry, a handsome player shares moments with Debbie. Back at the Belasco, the band wraps up while Pete, alone in his car, is overcome with emotion. Debbie arrives at an upscale apartment, noted by a proud Desi. Subsequently, Pete is found on the bed with his tablet as Debbie, initially playful, grows disheartened by Pete's indifferent reaction. She walks away, leaving Pete engrossed in his tablet. Debbie later returns, fully clothed, confronting Pete with a disappointed expression. Meanwhile, their daughter Charlotte plays the keyboard, observing the strained dynamics between her parents as Debbie walks away with resignation, leaving Charlotte lying between them and sucking her fingers."
