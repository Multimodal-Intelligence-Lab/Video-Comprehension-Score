At a Romani encampment in the rural area, gentlemen rehearse their equestrian abilities as Holmes and Watson arrive at the periphery of the encampment in an open coach. A gentleman approaches to grasp their horse while Watson calls over to a cluster of gentlemen and prods Holmes, who seems to be dozing. A Romani gentleman indicates a whiskered gentleman clutching a goose, and the Romani encircle Holmes and Watson, who grin courteously. The gentleman seizes it, then Watson clobbers him unconscious, causing the environment to become more tense. A gentleman opens his coat, revealing a dagger, and Sim pushes through the throng with her satchel, which the Romani have removed from Holmes. The gentleman Watson struck observes as they consume a repast, with Watson glancing up from his bowl and scowling while Holmes scowls at him. Sim hands the illustrations to the Romani gentleman, who passes them to Holmes, and Holmes tastes the scarlet blot before turning conspiratorially to Watson. Holmes sips from a proffered bottle as Watson rises and cavorts energetically with a Romani outside, with Sim participating too, while Holmes observes and jerks his shoulders in synchrony with the melody. At the castle residence of Mycroft Holmes, Mary enters a study and discovers him entirely unclothed. She takes the telegram and departs as Carruthers leaves, while Stanley, the dithering ancient butler, pivots around. Beneath a heavy sky in Paris, a coach with Imperata stenciled on the flank pulls up on a lateral street, and Sim, Holmes, and Watson are escorted from it into a structure where they pass two gentlemen wheeling a coat-of-arms shaped confection on a trolley. They are led into a bustling kitchen, navigating past chefs laboring at counters until they are halted and searched by another gentleman. Holmes observes a vacant baking tray, some regal icing in gold leaf laurels, a shield, and a periodical on a counter before he, Sim, and Watson are conducted down some stairs to appear in a sublevel chamber where a gentleman, Ravache, sits at a table with his back to them, dining. Watson inhales a slip of paper as Holmes and Sims take a seat. Ravache takes a draught of crimson wine, wipes his mouth with a serviette, sips his wine, and then shoots himself in the head. Upstairs in the kitchen, his associates hear the discharge and run off to investigate while Holmes stands, and Watson fires cautionary shots up the stairs as Holmes gazes into a niche."

Meanwhile, at a lively gypsy camp set amidst the expansive countryside, men are actively engaged in practicing their horse riding skills. It is at this point that Holmes and Watson arrive, driving up to the outskirts of the bustling camp in an open carriage.

A gypsy man gestures toward a bearded man clutching a goose, and soon after, the gypsy folk encircle Holmes and Watson, who return their attention with polite smiles. The man accepts the goose, and then Watson unexpectedly delivers a punch, knocking him unconscious, which causes the atmosphere to grow tense and uneasy. One man reveals a knife from inside his jacket, but then Sim pushes her way through the gathering crowd with her bag, which the gypsies have taken from Holmes. The gypsy who Watson struck keeps a close eye on them as they settle down to have a meal.

Nearby, a rough-looking fellow hovers with caution, staying close to another man who looks strikingly identical to him; both of them remain watchfully observant of Meinhard’s every movement. Meanwhile, at a lively and bustling gypsy encampment set amidst the vast, rolling countryside, men are actively and energetically engaged in honing their horse-riding skills. It is precisely at this moment that Holmes and Watson make their arrival, driving up to the outskirts of the bustling and vibrant camp in an open carriage. As they come to a stop, a helpful man steps forward promptly to hold their horse steady and secure. Watson calls out animatedly to a group of men, and at the same time, he gives Holmes a gentle nudge because Holmes seems to have dozed off into a light slumber. A gypsy man gestures toward a bearded individual who is clutching a goose, and soon after, the gypsy folk form a circle around Holmes and Watson, who in return, acknowledge them with polite, courteous smiles. The man graciously accepts the goose, but then, quite unexpectedly, Watson delivers a sudden punch, rendering him unconscious, suddenly causing the atmosphere in the camp to grow tense and palpably uneasy. One man, in response, reveals a sharp knife from inside his jacket, but then, Sim pushes her way assertively through the gathering crowd with her bag, which the gypsies have taken from Holmes. The gypsy who Watson struck maintains a keen and watchful eye on them as they begin to settle down to enjoy a meal. Watson looks up from his bowl with a frown etched on his face, casting a disapproving glance at Holmes, who returns the look with a rather menacing glare. Sim proceeds to hand over some detailed drawings to the gypsy man, who then passes them along to Holmes. In response, Holmes licks a red stain on the paper thoughtfully before turning to Watson with a conspiratorial look gleaming in his eyes. Holmes then takes a generous swig from a bottle offered to him, while Watson gets to his feet and enthusiastically bursts into a lively dance with a gypsy outside. Sim, full of spirit, joins in on the dance as well, while Holmes quietly observes, subtly shaking his shoulders to the infectious rhythm of the music. Over at the grand, opulent castle residence of Mycroft Holmes, Mary steps into the study and is quite taken aback to find Mycroft completely unclothed.

Sim, Holmes, and Watson are promptly ushered out from it and into a building where they pass by two men transporting a cake crafted in the grand shape of a coat-of-arms on a trolley. They make their way into a bustling, busy kitchen, maneuvering past chefs industriously working at their various stations, until they are halted and subjected to a meticulous search by another man. Holmes, with his keen eye for detail, takes note of an empty baking tray adorned with intricate royal icing in gold leaf laurels, a shield, and a newspaper placed on a worktop before he, Sim, and Watson are directed down a dimly lit stairway, emerging into a basement room where they find a man named Ravache seated at a table with his back turned to them, deeply engrossed in eating. Watson takes a curious sniff of a piece of paper as Holmes and Sim sit themselves down. Ravache drinks a mouthful of robust red wine, wipes his mouth carefully with a napkin, takes another deliberate sip, and then suddenly, without warning, shoots himself in the head. Upstairs, in the bustling, frantic kitchen, his coworkers hear the sound of the shot, prompting them to rush off in haste to investigate the alarming disturbance, while Holmes rises to his feet, and Watson fires a series of warning shots up the stairs as Holmes gazes intently into an intriguing alcove nearby."

As they arrive, a man steps forward to take hold of their horse, ensuring it remains steady. Watson calls out to a group of men, simultaneously giving Holmes a gentle nudge to rouse him from apparent slumber. A gypsy man draws attention to another bearded man clutching a goose, and soon the gypsies form a circle around Holmes and Watson, who respond with polite smiles despite the encroaching crowd. The bearded man accepts the goose, but Watson suddenly knocks him out cold, causing the atmosphere to shift and become tense. In the midst of the commotion, a man reveals a knife from inside his jacket. Sim manages to push through the crowd, retrieving her bag that the gypsies had taken from Holmes. The man whom Watson struck watches intently as Holmes and Watson sit down for a meal. Watson looks up from his bowl with a frown, meeting Holmes's displeased glare. Sim hands a set of drawings to the gypsy man, who promptly passes them to Holmes. Examining the drawings, Holmes tastes a red stain on them and then turns to Watson with a conspiratorial look. Accepting a bottle offered by the gypsies, Holmes takes a drink before observing with twitching shoulders as Watson energetically dances with a gypsy outside, soon joined by Sim. Meanwhile, at the castle residence of Mycroft Holmes, Mary enters a study only to find Mycroft completely naked.

Amidst the gloomy skies of Paris, a carriage marked with \"Imperata\" arrives on a side street. Sim, Holmes, and Watson alight from it and are swiftly ushered into a building. Inside, they pass by two men maneuvering a trolley with a cake shaped like a coat-of-arms. Navigating through a bustling kitchen, they weave past chefs diligently working at their stations until their progress is halted by another man who conducts a search. During the pause, Holmes's keen eyes note an array of items—a vacant baking tray, gold leaf laurel-decorated royal icing, a shield, and a newspaper—scattered across a worktop. Subsequently, Holmes, Sim, and Watson are directed down a staircase leading them into a basement room. Here, they find a man named Ravache seated with his back to them, engrossed in his meal. Watson inhales the scent of a piece of paper while Holmes and Sim take a seat. Without warning, Ravache gulps down some red wine, wipes his mouth with a napkin, takes another sip, and abruptly shoots himself in the head. Upstairs, the sound of the shot prompts his colleagues to abandon their tasks and rush to investigate. In response, Holmes stands up, and Watson fires warning shots up the stairs while Holmes remains transfixed, staring into an alcove."

At a gypsy camp in the countryside, a traditional Romani settlement where cultural skills are passed down through generations, men practice their horse riding skills as Holmes and Watson drive up on the outskirts of the camp in an open carriage. A man comes over to hold their horse while Watson, the famed doctor and chronicler of their adventures, calls over to a group of men and nudges Holmes, who appears to be asleep. A gypsy man indicates a bearded man holding a goose, a common livestock animal in these camps, and the gypsies surround Holmes and Watson, who smile politely. The man takes it, then Watson knocks him cold with a deft punch, causing the atmosphere to become more strained. A man opens his jacket, revealing a knife, a customary means of self-defense in these transient communities, and Sim, a companion known for her resourcefulness, pushes through the crowd with her bag, which the gypsies have taken off Holmes. The man Watson punched watches as they eat a meal of traditional Romani stew, with Watson looking up from his bowl and frowning while Holmes glares at him. Sim hands the drawings to the gypsy man, who passes them to Holmes, and Holmes licks the red stain, deducing it to be harmless, before turning conspiratorially to Watson. Holmes drinks from a proffered bottle of homemade wine as Watson gets up and dances energetically with a gypsy outside, with Sim joining in too, while Holmes watches and twitches his shoulders in time with the lively music.

They are led into a busy kitchen, making their way past chefs working at worktops laden with luxurious ingredients until they are stopped and searched by another man. Holmes notes an empty baking tray, some royal icing in gold leaf laurels, a shield, likely part of the cake decoration, and a newspaper on a worktop before he, Sim, and Watson are ushered down some stairs to emerge in a basement room where a man, Ravache, a notorious figure with rumored underworld connections, sits at a table with his back to them, eating. Watson sniffs a piece of paper imbued with a peculiar scent as Holmes and Sims sit down. Ravache takes a gulp of red wine, wipes his mouth with a napkin, sips his wine, and then shockingly shoots himself in the head. Upstairs in the kitchen, his colleagues hear the shot and run off to investigate while Holmes gets to his feet, and Watson fires warning shots up the stairs as Holmes stares into an alcove, perhaps piecing together an emerging pattern of evidence."

He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
