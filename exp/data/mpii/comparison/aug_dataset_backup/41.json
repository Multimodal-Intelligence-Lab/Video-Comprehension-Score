With surprising vigor, she thrusts her ice cream cone in his direction, causing the ice cream part to become dislodged and land with a precarious wobble alarmingly close to his lapel, right over the outside breast pocket of his suit. In the picturesque background, the majestic and iconic Cathedral of NOTRE DAME stands serenely as both REGGIE and DYLE step out from the confines of the elevator. He makes his way into his room, taking deliberate steps, while she heads purposefully into hers. Once inside, she pauses momentarily to adjust her hair in front of the mirror, ensuring everything is in place, before moving towards the door that connects her room with DYLE's adjacent one.

On the other side of the door, he calls out to her casually while he empties the contents of his pockets, preparing to settle in. He sits down, intending to remove his shoes, but his actions are suddenly interrupted by the sound of REGGIE's unexpected scream. He quickly races to the connecting door, urgency in his movements, pulls back the bolt, and rushes in without hesitation. As DYLE enters, he spins around just as the door is slammed shut behind him, and REGGIE, who had been standing strategically behind it, locks it and slyly slips the key into her pocket. He then moves toward the door that leads to the hallway, only to discover that it is locked as well. She smiles at him with a knowing, almost mischievous look.

She approaches the open door for a closer inspection of his actions as he takes out his handkerchief and begins to rinse it. He then opens his coat, glancing at a label inside, and playfully flicks a bit of water in her direction. He takes the nail-brush to scrub his watch and watch-band meticulously, holding up his wrist to show her the watch as if presenting a trophy. He starts to unbutton his suit, a gesture that prompts her to turn and leave the scene, slamming the door behind her for effect. The PHONE rings, disrupting the moment, and she answers it promptly. In a CLOSE SHOT, REGGIE is seen holding the phone, appearing as though the rug has been pulled out from under her, her face painted with worry. With a concerned expression, she slowly lowers the phone back to its cradle. Then, the bathroom door opens, and DYLE emerges, wrapped snugly in a large bath towel.

A searchlight positioned near the boat's bridge switches on and begins sweeping across the riverbanks.

She goes to the open door for a closer look as he takes out his handkerchief, monogrammed with his initials, and rinses it. He opens his coat and reads a label inside, checking for any damage. He flicks a little water in her face, then takes the nail-brush, an antique toiletry item found in older hotels, and scrubs his watch and watch-band. He holds up his wrist so she can see the watch, a classic timepiece by a renowned Swiss maker. He begins unbuttoning his suit with a calm precision. She turns and leaves, slamming the door after her.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby cafÃ©, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

          "description": "DYLE reluctantly takes an offered ice cream from REGGIE, accidentally dropping it near his pocket. They part ways after leaving the elevator, REGGIE entering her room and attempting to connect with DYLE through an adjoining door. Finding it locked, she knocks, prompting him to open it. REGGIE screams, prompting DYLE to rush in, only for her to trap him by locking the door. DYLE sits calmly, removes his shoes, and unexpectedly steps into the water fully dressed to REGGIE's surprise. She investigates, and he cleans his watch, flicks water at her face, and begins undressing. Annoyed, she leaves to answer a phone call that leaves her worried. DYLE emerges in a towel. Later, they dine on a riverboat as a searchlight surprises couples along the banks, leaving some embarrassed and others amused."
