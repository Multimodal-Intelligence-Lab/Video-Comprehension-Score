The woman appears at their entrance, and Ron observes he hasn't sufficient currency as Cho Chan approaches the cart. Harry and Cho gaze at each other and grin. Hermione observes Harry massaging his head. Four airborne stallions pulling a coach descend at Hogwarts, and the throngs cheer. A large vessel surfaces from beneath the water and nears too. A man dashes up the passage hobbling ridiculously, murmurs to Dumbledore, and departs the same way. A group of maidens dressed in azure perform up the passage and release butterflies, bow, and everyone claps. A succession of older lads stride up the passage, flourishing bo staffs with sparks, and exhale fire. They hug. The man positioned adjacent to Hagrid yelps when Hagrid jabs a prong into his hand. An unusual man stands in the entryway, conjures magic upwards to seal the ceiling, and tranquility is restored. This figure enters the chamber and starts moving, seeing Harry through his mechanical eye. He hobbles, wheezing as the throng is agitated and hissing. Dumbledore conjures magic over a box which melds into a chalice containing a blue blaze. A dubious figure enters the chamber where the chalice burns and shuts the door. He inscribes his name on the board as Mad-Eye hurls the chalk in rage, pops open a jar with an arachnid, and employs his wand to send it around the class, unsettling them. Draco chuckles, and Mad-Eye sends the arachnid onto Draco's visage. Mad-Eye has the arachnid over a pail of water, and it's squirming as Neville Longbottom rises. Mad-Eye begins tormenting the arachnid with magic, it squeaks, and Mad-Eye ceases. Neville is perturbed, and Mad-Eye picks up the arachnid, which is still making a noise. Hermione shakes her head as Mad-Eye utters a spell and the arachnid disintegrates. He approaches Harry's desk and takes a sip. They observe a lad on the stairs facing the pane, and Mad-Eye approaches Neville, patting him on the shoulder. Neville nods. Older scholars insert their names into the blaze, and others applaud, with Cedric among them. The twins come up cheering, leap inside the age boundary, do a high-five after placing their names into the blaze, but are hurled across the room when the blaze erupts.

At that moment, a lady appears in the doorway of their compartment, capturing the attention of Ron, who suddenly realizes he doesn't have enough money as Cho Chang, with her usual grace, walks up to the trolley. Harry and Cho exchange a glance that is filled with warmth and mutual recognition, each smiling subtly. Hermione, observing her friend closely, notices that Harry is rubbing his head as if in discomfort or deep thought. Meanwhile, at Hogwarts, a spectacular sight unfolds as four majestic flying horses land, skillfully pulling a grand carriage, to the delight of cheering onlookers. Not far from this scene, a large and impressive ship emerges dramatically from beneath the water's surface, making its way forward. As these events occur, a man rushes up the aisle of the venue with a comedic limp; he quickly whispers something to Dumbledore before retreating in the same humorous fashion. As if part of a grand performance, a group of girls, elegantly dressed in blue, dances gracefully up the aisle and enchantingly releases a flurry of butterflies into the air, delighting the crowd, who respond with applause. Subsequently, a series of older boys follow, walking with purpose up the aisle while brandishing bo staffs that emit bright sparks, before demonstrating an impressive feat of breathing fire, to which the onlookers respond with enthusiasm, embracing the spectacle. Meanwhile, the man seated next to the towering Hagrid yelps in shock when Hagrid accidentally stabs a fork into his own hand. Amidst the hubbub, a strange man stands intimidatingly in the doorway; he casts a spell upwards, which effectively seals the roof with magic, and in doing so, restores order and calm. This enigmatic character then strides into the room, taking in his surroundings while catching sight of Harry through his mechanical eye. He moves with a heavy limp, breathing laboriously, unsettling the crowd, which begins to boo. Dumbledore then casts an intricate spell over a box, transforming it seamlessly into a goblet that brims with a mesmerizing blue flame. Later, a mysterious and suspicious figure enters the room where the goblet burns, carefully closing the door behind him. He proceeds to write his name on the board; at the same moment, Mad-Eye, evidently frustrated, throws the chalk in anger, and then opens a jar containing a spider, which he sends scuttling around the class with the aid of his wand, creating a ripple of unease among the students. Draco, finding humor in the situation, laughs, prompting Mad-Eye to direct the spider onto Draco's face, causing further disturbance. Mad-Eye then dangles the spider precariously over a bucket of water, as the creature wriggles helplessly, with Neville Longbottom rising to his feet in anxiety. Mad-Eye commences a series of torturous spells on the spider, and its tormented squeals fill the room until he finally ceases. A visibly disturbed Neville watches as Mad-Eye picks up the still-noisy spider. Hermione, witnessing the scene, shakes her head in disapproval as Mad-Eye casts a final spell that disintegrates the spider into nothingness. He then purposefully approaches Harry's desk and takes a deliberate sip from his flask. As events unfold, they observe a boy standing on the stairs, gazing thoughtfully out of the window, and Mad-Eye approaches Neville, offering a reassuring pat on the shoulder, to which Neville responds with a nod of acknowledgment. Meanwhile, older students step forward to place their names into the enigmatic flame, earning applause from their peers, with Cedric among them. The twins, exuberant and full of energy, come up cheering loudly. They leap spiritedly inside the age line and jubilantly high-five each other after submitting their names into the flame, but are comically flung across the room when the flame suddenly fires up.

In response to the chaos, Arthur and others swiftly approach their location, their demeanor urgent and alert. Just then, a lady makes her appearance at their compartment door, catching their attention. Ron, in a flustered moment of realization, checks his pockets and discovers he lacks enough money, all while Cho Chang gracefully walks up to the trolley. At this moment, Harry and Cho's eyes meet, and they exchange a gentle, mutual smile that conveys a warm acknowledgment. Concurrently, Hermione notices Harry rubbing his head, a gesture suggesting he's in some discomfort or deep in thought. Meanwhile, as the scene shifts to Hogwarts, four majestic flying horses elegantly descend from the sky, pulling a carriage and landing smoothly, sparking a wave of cheers from the excited crowds gathered to witness the spectacle. Amidst this excitement, a large ship dramatically emerges from beneath the water, its approach adding to the grandeur of the scene. Suddenly, a man appears, running up the aisle with a peculiar, comical limp, making his way directly to Dumbledore. He leans in to whisper something presumably important into Dumbledore's ear before departing in the same humorous manner. Following this, a group of girls clad in elegant blue attire dance their way up the aisle with fluid grace, releasing a flurry of butterflies into the air as they bow to the audience, who respond with enthusiastic applause. Next, a series of older boys proceed up the aisle, brandishing bo staffs that emit sparks, creating a dazzling display as they breathe fire and, with camaraderie, embrace one another. As the festivities continue, a man seated next to Hagrid unexpectedly yelps in shock and pain when Hagrid accidentally stabs a fork into his hand. Amidst the commotion, a strange man stands imposingly in the doorway, casting a spell upwards that effectively seals the roof, restoring peace to the chaotic atmosphere. This intriguing character then enters the room, moving with purpose as he walks, his mechanical eye swiveling to lock onto Harry. As he limps and breathes heavily, the crowd's mood turns restless, and some begin to boo. In a display of control and focus, Dumbledore casts a spell over a box, which seamlessly melds into a goblet that ignites with a mesmerizing blue flame. In an atmosphere thick with anticipation, a suspicious character quietly enters the room where the goblet burns brightly, closing the door behind him. He proceeds to write his name on the board with deliberate strokes, simultaneously with Mad-Eye Moody, who in a fit of irritation throws the chalk in anger. Not stopping there, he pops open a jar containing a spider and uses his wand to set it in motion around the classroom, deliberately unsettling the students. The tension is palpable, and when Draco chuckles with amusement, Mad-Eye directs the spider onto Draco's face, escalating the tension further. As Mad-Eye holds the spider over a bucket of water, it wriggles in distress while Neville Longbottom stands visibly tense. With a cold determination, Mad-Eye uses his wand to torture the spider with magic, making it squeal in agony before he finally ceases. Neville appears visibly disturbed by the ordeal, prompting Mad-Eye to pick up the spider, which continues to make distressed noises. Hermione, with disapproval, shakes her head in response to Mad-Eye's actions. Mad-Eye then casts a spell, causing the spider to disintegrate into nothingness. He makes his way to Harry's desk, casually taking a sip from his drink as the classroom returns to a semblance of normalcy. This shift in focus reveals a boy standing on the stairs, facing the window, lost in thought. Mad-Eye approaches Neville, giving him a reassuring pat on the shoulder, and Neville responds with a nod, signifying his understanding or acceptance. Meanwhile, older students eagerly place their names into the blue flame, met with applause from their peers, with Cedric being among these participants. The Weasley twins, filled with excitement and mischief, come up cheering exuberantly. They deliberately jump inside the designated age line, executing a jubilant high-five after submitting their names into the flame. However, their antics backfire spectacularly as the flame erupts, flinging them across the room. They land with a thud, and as they get up, they find themselves humorously transformed, sporting full heads of grey hair and long beards, much to the amusement and surprise of those around them."

The lady, known as the trolley witch who provides snacks to students, appears at their door, and Ron realizes he hasn't enough money as Cho Chang, a student from Ravenclaw house, walks up to the trolley. Harry and Cho look at each other and smile, hinting at their mutual attraction. Hermione sees Harry rubbing his head, possibly from a recent scar-related pain. Four flying horses, which are winged creatures known as Thestrals, pulling a carriage land at Hogwarts, and the crowds cheer, anticipating the arrival of students from Beauxbatons Academy of Magic. A large ship emerges from under the water, a Durmstrang Institute's mode of magical transportation, and approaches too. A man, limping comically and known for his energetic entrances, runs up the aisle to whisper to Dumbledore, the revered headmaster of Hogwarts, and leaves the same way. A group of girls dressed in the sky-blue uniforms of Beauxbatons Academy dance up the aisle and release butterflies as part of their enchanting introduction, bow, and everyone applauds. A series of older boys, representing Durmstrang Institute, walk up the aisle, brandishing bo staffs sparking with enchantments, and breathe fire, demonstrating their skills in martial magic. They embrace in camaraderie. The man seated next to Hagrid, Hogwarts' gamekeeper who is half-giant, yelps when Hagrid accidentally stabs a fork into his hand, highlighting Hagrid's characteristic lack of finesse. A strange man stands in the doorway, casting magic upwards to seal the roof, and peace is restored. This character, Mad-Eye Moody, known for his magical prosthetic eye granting him 360-degree vision, enters the room and begins walking, seeing Harry through his mechanical eye. He limps, breathing heavily as the crowd is unsettled and booing due to his imposing presence. Dumbledore casts magic over a box, which transforms into the Goblet of Fire, a mystical artifact that selects champions for the Triwizard Tournament, and it contains a blue flame. A suspicious character enters the room where the goblet burns and closes the door. He writes his name on the board as Mad-Eye throws the chalk in anger, expressing his frustration, pops open a jar with a spider, and uses his wand to send it around the class, unsettling them. Draco Malfoy, a Slytherin known for his arrogance, laughs, and Mad-Eye sends the spider onto Draco's face, teaching him a lesson. Mad-Eye has the spider over a bucket of water, and it's wriggling as Neville Longbottom, a student known for his clumsiness but also bravery, stands. Mad-Eye begins torturing the spider with magic, it squeals in distress, and Mad-Eye stops, demonstrating the effects of the unforgivable curses. Neville is disturbed, and Mad-Eye picks up the spider, which is still making a noise. Hermione shakes her head in disapproval as Mad-Eye casts a spell and the spider disintegrates, emphasizing the harsh realities of dark magic. He approaches Harry's desk and takes a drink from his hip flask, rumored to contain Polyjuice Potion. They see a boy on the stairs facing the window, and Mad-Eye approaches Neville, patting him on the shoulder, trying to reassure him. Neville nods, although still shaken. Older students place their names into the flame, hoping to be selected as champions, and others applaud, with Cedric Diggory, a respected student from Hufflepuff, among them. The Weasley twins come up cheering, mischievously attempting to bypass the age restriction, jump inside the age line, do a high-five after putting their names into the flame, but are flung across the room when the flame fires up, enforcing the magical boundary. When they get up, they have full heads of grey hair and beards, a humorous consequence of their failed attempt."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
