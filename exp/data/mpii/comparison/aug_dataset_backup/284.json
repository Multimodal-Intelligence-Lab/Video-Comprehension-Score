This newcomer is Police Detective Lieutenant Thomas J. Doyle, the man Jeff phoned earlier in the day. He has a sense of humor. Jeff lifts his hand in a feeble parting gesture. He is an intelligent-appearing, well-dressed modern detective. Doyle paces a little. He goes up the steps to the door, putting on his hat, and pauses his hand on the door knob. From Doyle's viewpoint, Jeff answers, showing only the slightest irritation. Doyle, still at the door, starts to go out the door, and closes it behind him.

She glances around her for an instant. The silhouette of Stella is visible, gazing up toward Jeff's flat, and limbs extended in an impotent motion. Jeff drops the field glasses, dispirited. He lowers the spectacles and turns to Jeff. Filming towards the large pane, with the vicinity beyond, Jeff is as usual stationed in his wheelchair on the left of the window, but now turned towards a newcomer, the second individual standing near the sofa looking out the window with the field glasses. This newcomer is Police Detective Lieutenant Thomas J. Doyle, the individual Jeff phoned earlier in the day. He possesses a sense of wit. Jeff raises his hand in a frail farewell motion. He is a smart-appearing, well-dressed contemporary detective. Doyle strides a little. He ascends the steps to the door, donning his hat, and rests his hand on the door handle. From Doyle's perspective, Jeff responds, exhibiting only the slightest annoyance. Doyle, still at the entrance, begins to exit the door, and shuts it behind him. Doyle becomes engrossed in observing something out the window: Miss Torso, in dance attire, rehearsing her ballet on the exterior terrace. She is thrilling and appealing, and he even grins somewhat privately to himself at what he witnesses. Jeff grins at catching Doyle appreciating Miss Torso and observes Doyle's fascination. Taken aback at being noticed, Doyle moves swiftly away from the window, feigning insouciance. Jeff's expression grows grave as Doyle promptly gathers his reflections and returns to the case at hand. The camera retreats as Doyle goes back to his beverage, moves to the cupboard, picks up a felt headgear, pulls a note out of his pocket, and Jeff observes him closely. Doyle glances at Jeff with some smugness, dons his hat, and proceeds toward the door. The camera focuses on the telephoto lens camera, which fills the screen. Just beyond, there is a dish on which a lone sandwich rests. Jeff's hand comes in and picks it up. We follow up with the sandwich until Jeff's head fills the screen. Jeff is serious, and except for a small illumination in the kitchen, Jeff's apartment is in shadow. As he chews, he keeps his gaze on the vicinity. The camera pans slightly to the left, as we see the canine being lowered in its basket. Thorwald's apartment is in shadow as the sun has just set. We follow the basket down to the courtyard, which brings Miss Lonely Heart's apartment into view as she seems to be putting on the final touches of her cosmetics, prior to going out."

An intelligent-appearing, well-dressed modern detective, he is. A little pacing is done by Doyle. The steps to the door are gone up by him, a hat is put on by him, and the door knob is paused with his hand. From Doyle's viewpoint, the slightest irritation is shown by Jeff when he answers. Still at the door, Doyle starts to go out the door, and it is closed by him behind him. Something out the window becomes interesting to Doyle: Miss Torso, in ballet costume, practicing her dance on the outside balcony, is watched by him.

At this point, the form of Stella comes into view; she is casting her eyes upward towards Jeff's apartment, with her arms extended in a gesture that conveys helplessness. Feeling disheartened, Jeff lowers the binoculars, having lost some of his initial enthusiasm. He places the glasses down and turns his attention to Jeff. The camera, capturing the expansive scene through the large window with the bustling neighborhood in the background, focuses on Jeff, who is, as is typical, positioned in his wheelchair to the left of the window. His attention, however, is now directed toward a newcomer—another man standing close to the divan, peering out of the window through binoculars. This newcomer is none other than Police Detective Lieutenant Thomas J. Doyle, the very man Jeff had contacted earlier that day. Doyle is known for his sharp sense of humor, adding a unique flair to his persona. Jeff, in a somewhat weak yet acknowledging manner, raises his hand in a parting gesture that speaks of familiarity and respect.

From Doyle's perspective, Jeff responds with just a hint of irritation, suggesting a level of impatience. Remaining at the door, Doyle initiates his exit, gently closing the door behind him. However, his attention is captured by something outside the window: Miss Torso, clad in a ballet costume, is gracefully practicing her dance on the balcony. She exudes excitement and allure, prompting Doyle to smile to himself, almost secretly, as he observes the scene. Jeff, noticing this moment, smiles too, having caught Doyle in a moment of enjoyment as he watches Miss Torso.

Jeff, feeling disheartened by the scene, lowers his binoculars in a resigned manner and subsequently drops the glasses from his eyes, shifting his attention away. He then turns his focus toward Jeff, indicating a passing interaction. In the wide shot of the large window with the neighborhood sprawling beyond, Jeff remains seated in his wheelchair to the left of the window. Traditionally positioned there, he now turns his attention to the arrival of a newcomer. This newcomer is Police Detective Lieutenant Thomas J. Doyle, whom Jeff had contacted by phone earlier in the day. Doyle exudes a modern air, marked by an intelligent appearance and a well-dressed demeanor, and carries a sense of humor with him. Jeff lifts his hand in a weak farewell gesture, acknowledging Doyle's presence and participation. Doyle moves with casual intent, pacing briefly before ascending the steps to the door. He places his hat on his head and pauses with his hand resting on the doorknob for a moment of contemplation. From Doyle's vantage point, Jeff responds with only a hint of irritation, maintaining a composed exterior. Doyle, still positioned at the door, takes a step to exit and closes it behind him, sealing his departure. However, his attention is drawn back to the window, where Miss Torso, adorned in a ballet costume, is practicing her dance routine on the outside balcony. Her allure and desirability capture Doyle's attention, prompting a subtle, secretive smile to grace his face. Jeff, noticing Doyle's interest in Miss Torso, also smiles, subtly catching the detective in an unguarded moment of enjoyment. Startled by being observed, Doyle swiftly retreats from the window, adopting an air of casual indifference. Jeff's expression turns serious as Doyle collects himself and redirects his focus to the matter at hand. The camera shifts its focus as Doyle returns to his drink, makes his way to the sideboard, retrieves a felt hat, and pulls a slip of paper from his pocket, all under Jeff's watchful eyes. With a touch of smugness, Doyle glances at Jeff before donning his hat and heading toward the door once more. The camera's attention shifts to the camera with a long-focus lens, which dominates the frame. Just beyond its reach lies a plate with a solitary sandwich, inviting Jeff's hand, which reaches in to grasp it. As we follow the upward motion of the sandwich, Jeff's face gradually fills the screen, revealing a sober demeanor as he munches thoughtfully. Except for a faint kitchen light, the darkness engulfs Jeff's apartment, as he keeps a vigilant watch over the neighborhood. The camera pans slightly to the left, capturing the descent of a basket carrying a dog to the ground below. Thorwald's apartment is enveloped in darkness, the sun having just set, casting an appropriate ambiance. The basket's journey downwards reveals Miss Lonely Heart's apartment, where she appears to be applying the final touches of her makeup, clearly preparing for an evening out."

She looks about her for a moment. The figure of Stella, who works as a nurse and occasionally assists Jeff with his day-to-day needs, is seen, looking up toward Jeff's apartment, and arms outspread in a helpless gesture, as if signaling that she is out of options. Jeff, a photographer recovering from a broken leg, lowers the binoculars, discouraged. He lowers the glasses and turns to Jeff.

He is an intelligent-appearing, well-dressed modern detective, known for his methodical approach to solving cases. Doyle paces a little. He goes up the steps to the door, putting on his hat, which is a signature fedora, and pauses his hand on the door knob. From Doyle's viewpoint, Jeff answers, showing only the slightest irritation at Doyle's skepticism. Doyle, still at the door, starts to go out the door, and closes it behind him. Doyle becomes interested in watching something out the window: Miss Torso, a professional dancer known in the neighborhood for her lively balcony performances, in ballet costume, practicing her dance on the outside balcony. She is exciting and desirable, and he even smiles somewhat secretly to himself at what he sees. Jeff smiles at catching Doyle enjoying Miss Torso and notices Doyle's interest. Startled at being observed, Doyle moves quickly away from the window, affecting nonchalance, as if embarrassed by his moment of distraction. Jeff's face grows serious as Doyle quickly collects his thoughts and gets back to the case at hand. The camera moves back as Doyle returns to his drink, a habit he picked up from his father, who was also in law enforcement, moves to the sideboard, picks up a felt hat, pulls a slip of paper out of his pocket, and Jeff watches him intently. Doyle looks at Jeff with some smugness, puts on his hat, and goes toward the door. The camera concentrates on the long-focus lens camera, which fills the screen, a professional piece of equipment Jeff used during his career photographing for major magazines. Just beyond, there is a plate on which a solitary sandwich rests, a simple meal hastily prepared by Jeff's housekeeper. Jeff's hand comes in and picks it up. We pan up with the sandwich until Jeff's head fills the screen. Jeff is sober, and except for a small light in the kitchen, Jeff's apartment is in darkness. As he munches, he keeps his attention on the neighborhood, a collection of eclectic personalities and secrets. The camera pans slightly to the left, as we see the dog being lowered in its basket, a routine task performed by a neighbor who cannot walk their dog due to a disability. Thorwald's apartment is in darkness as the sun has just set, suggesting he might be out or hiding something. We follow the basket down to the yard, which brings Miss Lonely Heart's apartment into view as she seems to be putting on the final touches of her makeup, prior to going out, likely to one of her frequent solo nights out in search of companionship."

He raises the magnifying glass and turns to Max. Moving towards the narrow porch, with the park beyond, Max is predictably standing in his hammock on the left of the porch, but now facing a visitor, the third woman sitting near the fountain gazing at the porch with the telescope. This visitor is Journalist Patricia K. Smith, the woman Max emailed earlier in the evening. She has a sharp wit. Max waves his foot in a lethargic farewell movement. She is a perceptive-looking, casually-dressed vintage journalist. Smith wanders a bit. She walks down the path to the gate, adjusting her scarf, and rests her foot on the gate latch. From Smith's angle, Max responds, displaying only mild curiosity. Smith, still at the gate, prepares to leave, and shuts it behind her.

He places down the spectacles and turns to Frodo. Aiming toward the large gate, with the forest beyond, Frodo is as usual reclining in his hammock on the right of the gate, but now turned toward a traveler, the third elf standing near the throne peering out the gate with the telescope. This traveler is Merchant Sailor Captain Henry P. Longfellow, the person Frodo called earlier in the afternoon. He has a sense of mischief. Frodo raises his arm in a weary waving motion. He is a clever-looking, well-dressed contemporary sailor. Longfellow roams a bit. He descends the ladder to the hatch, donning his cap, and lingers his arm on the doorknob. From Longfellow's vantage point, Frodo replies, showing only the slightest irritation. Longfellow, still at the hatch, begins to leave through the gateway, and shuts it after him. Longfellow becomes curious about observing something out the gate: Miss Phoenix, in knight attire, performing her routine on the distant terrace. She is enthralling and alluring, and he even chuckles somewhat privately to himself at what he observes. Frodo grins at catching Longfellow admiring Miss Phoenix and notes Longfellow's intrigue. Surprised at being noticed, Longfellow swiftly shifts away from the gate, feigning indifference. Frodo's expression turns grim as Longfellow rapidly gathers his wits and returns to the quest at hand. The lens shifts back as Longfellow returns to his potion, strides to the pantry, grabs a silk cloak, extracts a slip of parchment from his pouch, and Frodo observes him closely. Longfellow gazes at Frodo with some arrogance, dons his cloak, and moves toward the hatch. The lens focuses on the long-range spyglass, which occupies the view. Just nearby, there is a goblet on which a single apple rests. Frodo’s arm reaches in and snatches it up. We tilt up with the apple until Frodo's face occupies the view. Frodo is solemn, and except for a small flame in the cave, Frodo's tower is in shadow. As he nibbles, he maintains his focus on the forest. The lens tilts slightly to the right, as we see the cat being lifted in its net. Merlin's tower is in shadow as the moon has just risen.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
