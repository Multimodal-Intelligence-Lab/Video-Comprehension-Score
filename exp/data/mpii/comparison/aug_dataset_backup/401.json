As the ferry churns steadily into the sunset, its engines part the water with relentless rhythm, we FADE UP into an elegant yet desolate Georgian room, its grandeur overshadowed by thick clouds of dust. Within these clouds, a lone figure emerges, vigorously hacking at a wall with a sledgehammer. It is Fergus, dressed in laborer's overalls and cloaked in dust, attacking the bricks on an outer wall with furious and relentless strokes, each strike echoing like the workings of a tireless machine. We witness the hammer's determined blows as it connects with the brittle wall, and watch as one brick, then another, obediently falls away. Daylight pierces through, illuminating the dust clouds and widening the hole with each subsequent brick that crumbles away. As more bricks yield to the force of his labor, a vibrant patch of green begins to emerge through the dusty haze. Gradually, Fergus's rhythm decelerates, the hammer resting from its task as the dust settles, unveiling a cricket pitch adorned with tiny sticklike figures darting across the lush field. Later, Fergus, now returning from his work, crosses the street with purposeful strides and steps through a white door. In the privacy of his space, he dresses with deliberate care, donning a cheap suit typical of a country boy in the throes of city life. He retrieves Jody's wallet from his overall trousers, flips it open with a moment's pause, and absorbs the sight of the soldier and Dil's picture before tucking it into his suit pocket securely. Fergus navigates down the street, eyes scanning for a particular address. A sign looms some distance ahead—MILLIE'S UNISEX HAIR. As crowds ebb and flow around him, he stands still, peering into the window, clutching the cherished picture in his hand. Through his vantage point, we glimpse Dil, prompting Fergus to step purposefully inside. Dil, finishing her shift, checks her watch, extinguishes a cigarette with a practiced motion, and moves towards him. She gently but confidently engages with his hair, guiding him to tilt his head back into the basin behind him, where her hands, adorned with purple nails, expertly knead his hair with hot water and shampoo, the texture of his hair softening under her touch. Fergus sits up as she skillfully cuts his hair, playfully imitating his accent, which draws laughter from him, a moment of shared amusement. Dil then raises his head, revealing his freshly styled hair, and holds up a mirror behind him, allowing him to admire the transformation, his reflection now resembling that of a young London stockbroker. With renewed confidence, Fergus merges into the flow of the crowd and discreetly ducks into a doorway. Emerging anew, Dil, now dressed in striking high heels and a very short skirt, her attire transformed into something more daring than what she wore in the salon, locks the glass door with a soft click. She strides down the street, crossing the road with purpose, and enters a pub called the Metro. Fergus, drawn in pursuit, follows her. Inside, Dil navigates through the bustling atmosphere and takes a seat at the bar, her presence commanding the space. Fergus approaches the bar with a sense of purpose and quietly takes his place beside her."

It is Gerald, dressed in chef's attire, blanketed in mist. It is dislodging the stones from an interior column, working energetically and unceasingly, like a gadget. We observe the column with the crowbar hitting it, and one stone tumbles away, then another. Moonlight spills through the layers of mist and the expanding gap as more stones tumble away. Through the layers of mist and the beams of moonlight we now discern a strip of blue. Its rhythm diminishes, and more stones tumble away. Then the crowbar ceases, and the mist begins to dissipate.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
