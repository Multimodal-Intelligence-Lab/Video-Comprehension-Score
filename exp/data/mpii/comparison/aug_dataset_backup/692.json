Peter arrives home, crosses to his Spider-Man costume hanging on a rail and reaches for it. He pauses and glances down at the battered black chest on the ground, crouches down, lifts the cover, and ponders the black spider outfit inside. Moments later, black-attired Spider-Man drops from a skyscraper, a strand flashes out from his wrist, and he swings across the metropolis. An overturned cab stands outside the blasted open entrances of a bank as Black Spider-Man lands on the avenue and notices a trail of sand slithering down the grating. Eddie Brock leaps out of an automobile, camera prepared, as Black Spider-Man rips the heavy grate from the earth and shatters Brock's camera, then leaps down the manhole. Brock glowers down the manhole shaft after Black-suited Spider-Man as escort vehicles begin arriving and stealthily removes another smaller camera. Flint Marko strides along the tracks of a subway passage, carrying two transparent sacks of banknotes when a gleam of light reveals Black Spider-Man scuttling along the ceiling behind him. Flint turns and glances up, but the shaft of light disappears, and he perceives nothing before he turns and carries on walking as Black Spider-Man hovers inverted before him. Spider-Man seizes Flint's hand, touches lines on a train, and leaps on Flint, causing him to tumble off the track into a deep tunnel and drop the cash onto a track far below. Black Spider-Man swings at Flint on a strand, but Flint takes him away to the platform of a train. Black Spider-Man swings away to the grid as an archway, flying back to drop kick Flint into the side of a train, grinding Flint's head against the side of the moving train like cheese on a grater. Flint drops to his knees, briefly becomes Sandman, and sends Black Spider-Man ricocheting between two moving trains. Spider-Man thumps Flint, knocking sandy lumps out of his visage, and both he and Flint descend a white shaft, landing on a conduit halfway down, which breaks, causing Flint to land in a muddy puddle adjacent to his cash. He reaches for it, but his arm has turned to moist sand, and he recoils in horror, observing as his hand disintegrates. Above him, Black Spider-Man lands on a ledge, swings down onto a massive water conduit, and tears up the conduit, causing jets of water to spring from the red apertures. Flint watches in horror as a flood of water sweeps him away down the concrete's loose, slamming him up against the grating as the water rushes past, dissolving his sandy physique."

He hesitates, the battered black trunk on the floor is looked down at by him, the lid is crouched down to be lifted by him, and the black spider suit inside is contemplated by him. Moments later, Spider-Man in a black suit is dropped from a skyscraper, a thread is flashed out from his wrist, and the city is swung across by him. An overturned taxi stands outside the blown open doors of a bank as the street is landed on by Black Spider-Man and a trail of sand slithering down the grating is seen. A car is jumped out of by Eddie Brock, camera ready, as the heavy grill is torn from the ground by Black Spider-Man and Brock's camera is smashed, then the manhole is jumped down.

          "description": "In a science lab, the small black globule, with a smooth and fluid motion, slips off the microscope's surface and begins to move directly toward Peter with a determined speed. Peter, noticing the globule's approach, quickly reacts by grabbing a nearby glass and swiftly traps the globule underneath it, ensuring it cannot escape. Later, Peter arrives home and walks across the room to where his Spider-Man suit is hanging on a rail. He reaches out to touch the suit but pauses, his hand hovering in mid-air as he hesitates. His gaze shifts downward to the battered black trunk on the floor. He crouches down, places his hands on the lid, and lifts it open, revealing the black spider suit inside. He takes a moment to contemplate the suit, his mind racing with thoughts. Moments later, in a seamless transition, Black-suited Spider-Man drops from the height of a towering skyscraper. As he descends, a thread shoots out from his wrist, and he uses it to swing gracefully across the cityscape. He soon arrives at a scene of chaos, where an overturned taxi is positioned outside the blown-open doors of a bank. Black Spider-Man lands on the street, his eyes catching sight of a trail of sand slithering down into a grating. At that moment, Eddie Brock jumps out of a car, his camera poised and ready to capture the unfolding events. Black Spider-Man, with a swift and powerful motion, tears the heavy grill from the ground and, in the process, smashes Brock's camera. Without hesitation, he jumps down the manhole, disappearing from view. Brock, frustrated, glares down the manhole shaft after the retreating figure of Black-suited Spider-Man. As escort cars begin to arrive at the scene, Brock discreetly retrieves a smaller camera from his pocket, determined to continue documenting the events. Meanwhile, Flint Marko strides confidently along the tracks of a subway tunnel, carrying two clear sacks filled with banknotes. A sudden flash of light reveals Black Spider-Man crawling stealthily along the ceiling behind him. Flint, sensing something, turns and looks up, but the shaft of light vanishes, leaving him to see nothing. He resumes his walk, unaware that Black Spider-Man is now hovering upside down in front of him. In a swift and calculated move, Spider-Man makes contact with Flint's fist, touches the stripes on a passing train, and leaps onto Flint, causing him to lose his balance and tumble off the track into a deep tunnel. The impact causes Flint to drop the money onto a track far below. Black Spider-Man, maintaining his momentum, swings at Flint on a thread, but Flint manages to take him away to the park of a train. Black Spider-Man quickly adapts, swinging away to the gird of an archway, and then flies back with precision to deliver a dropkick to Flint, sending him crashing into the side of a train. The force grinds Flint's head against the side of the passing train, akin to cheese on a grater. Flint drops to his knees, momentarily transforming into Sandman, and retaliates by sending Black Spider-Man ricocheting between two passing trains. Spider-Man, undeterred, thumps Flint, knocking sandy lumps out of his face. Both he and Flint fall down a white shaft, landing on a pipe halfway down. The pipe breaks under their combined weight, causing Flint to land in a muddy puddle close to his scattered money. As he reaches for the money, he realizes in horror that his arm has turned to damp sand, and he recoils, watching helplessly as his hand disintegrates. Above him, Black Spider-Man lands on a ledge, then swings down onto a massive water pipe. With a determined effort, he tears up the pipe, causing jets of water to burst forth from the red holes. Flint watches in terror as a torrent of water sweeps him away down the concrete sluice, slamming him up against the grating. The rushing water dissolves his sandy body, leaving him powerless against the force of the deluge."

Peter, known as Spider-Man in superhero circles, comes home, crosses to his Spider-Man suit hanging on a rail and reaches for it. He hesitates and looks down at the battered black trunk that once belonged to his uncle on the floor, crouches down, lifts the lid, and contemplates the black spider suit inside, which enhances his strength and agility. Moments later, black-suited Spider-Man drops from a skyscraper in New York City, a thread of specialized webbing flashes out from his wrist, and he swings spectacularly across the city. An overturned taxi, a common sight in superhero battles, stands outside the blown open doors of a bank as Black Spider-Man lands on the street and sees a trail of sand, suggesting the presence of his nemesis, Sandman, slithering down the grating. Eddie Brock, a rival photographer with a personal vendetta against Spider-Man, jumps out of a car, camera ready, as Black Spider-Man tears the heavy grill from the ground and smashes Brock's camera, then jumps down the manhole. Brock glares down the manhole shaft after Black-suited Spider-Man as escort cars start arriving and surreptitiously takes out another smaller camera, hoping to catch a scoop.

Black Spider-Man swings away to the gird as an archway, flying back to drop kick Flint into the side of a train, grinding Flint's head against the side of the passing train like cheese on a grater, a tactic to weaken him. Flint drops to his knees, briefly becomes Sandman, a transformation that allows him to reform his sandy body, and sends Black Spider-Man ricocheting between two passing trains. Spider-Man thumps Flint, knocking sandy lumps, which Flint uses to regenerate, out of his face, and both he and Flint fall down a white shaft, landing on a pipe halfway down, which breaks, causing Flint to land in a muddy puddle close to his money. He reaches for it, but his arm has turned to damp sand, and he recoils in horror, watching as his hand disintegrates due to the moisture. Above him, Black Spider-Man lands on a ledge, swings down onto a huge water pipe used for the city’s water supply, and tears up the pipe, causing jets of water to spring from the red holes.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
