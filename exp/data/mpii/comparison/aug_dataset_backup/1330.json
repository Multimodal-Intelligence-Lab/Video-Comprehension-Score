On the roof, the men wait for something to happen. That's when the ice cream man's jaw unhinges and stretches, causing everyone except Michael to practically hyperventilate with fear. The ice cream man bolts for the diner with startling speed, his movements resembling those of a human insect. Michael aims and bullets rip into the creature's body, knocking him flat on his back, with arms and legs in a twisted, twitching mess. Michael keeps his aim. A rumbling of engines and headlights follow as a freeway full of vehicles of every variety punches through a wall of dust, racing toward the diner. Vehicles swerve and collide, and dark shapes bolt from the burning vehicles, scattering. Suddenly Howard's body is torn away from Sandra as something grabs his legs, waking Sandra and causing her to scream and hold on. Charlie and Audrey rush to Sandra's side, grabbing Howard's arms, with Jeep right behind them, ready to fire at the creature but unable to get a clear shot because the women are in the way.

Charlie and Jeep fall back into the diner, with claw-like hands still grasping Charlie's arms, no longer attached to their owners. Michael leaps over her, wielding a butcher's knife in one hand and a machine gun in the other, as the window blinds turn into a wall of fire. Charlie flings the severed appendages off her, and she and Jeep scoot away from the window. Hysterical, Sandra tries to push past Michael to go after Howard, but he intercepts her before she can make it out. Sandra frantically slaps at Michael as he carries her away from the window and thrusts her down into a back booth. She's about to say something when Kyle rushes into the room with a smile on his face, but his excitement falls when he notices the broken window and takes in the room.

As he steps into the beams of the headlights, he becomes more distinctly visible; he's towering. He examines the eatery, the workshop, and the rooftop, evaluating the scenario. On the rooftop, the men await something to occur. That's when the frozen dessert man's jaw unhinges and elongates, causing everyone except Michael to nearly hyperventilate with terror. The frozen dessert man dashes for the eatery with astonishing swiftness, his motions resembling those of a human insect. Michael targets and projectiles tear into the entity's form, knocking him flat on his back, with limbs in a contorted, twitching chaos. Michael maintains his aim. A rumbling of motors and headlights follow as a highway full of conveyances of every kind punches through a barrier of dust, racing toward the eatery. Conveyances swerve and crash, and dim figures dash from the blazing conveyances, scattering. Suddenly Howard's form is torn away from Sandra as something seizes his legs, waking Sandra and causing her to shriek and hold on. Charlie and Audrey rush to Sandra's side, seizing Howard's arms, with Jeep right behind them, prepared to fire at the entity but unable to get a clear shot because the women are in the way. He discards the firearm and helps seize Howard's arms as Howard screams and his form is agonizingly stretched in a human tug-of-war, lurching further out the window. Kyle looks around the rooftop with alarm as only a few more inches separate Charlie from certain demise through the window, and Jeep is losing her. Charlie and Jeep fall back into the eatery, with claw-like hands still clutching Charlie's arms, no longer attached to their owners. Michael leaps over her, wielding a cleaver in one hand and a submachine gun in the other, as the window blinds transform into a barrier of flame. Charlie flings the severed limbs off her, and she and Jeep scoot away from the window. Hysterical, Sandra tries to push past Michael to go after Howard, but he intercepts her before she can make it out. Sandra frantically slaps at Michael as he carries her away from the window and thrusts her down into a rear booth. She's about to say something when Kyle rushes into the room with a grin on his face, but his excitement diminishes when he notices the shattered window and takes in the room. Bob grabs Kyle's arm, and all eyes turn to Michael. Michael looks squarely at Percy, as Bob stares at him, uncertain how to respond, and Charlie reacts in shock as all eyes suddenly turn to her."

Near the fountain, the dogs lie in wait for someone to arrive. That's when the candy man's elbow bends and extends, causing everyone except Jenna to almost burst with laughter. The candy man sprints toward the carousel with surprising grace, his movements resembling those of a mechanical bird. Jenna points and arrows fly into the creature's body, laying it gently on its side, with ears and limbs in a fluid, resting position. Jenna maintains her gaze. A rumbling of bicycles and flashlights follow as a pathway full of people of every kind glides through a cloak of fog, darting toward the carousel. Bicycles turn and halt, and bright shadows skip from the flickering bicycles, gathering. Suddenly Taylor's leg is yanked away from Emma as something clutches her arms, waking Emma and causing her to chuckle and grip tight. Robert and Laura dash to Emma's side, pulling Taylor's legs, with Sam right behind them, poised to swing at the creature but unable to get a proper angle because the trio is in the way.

Ryan glances around the fountain with curiosity as only a few more inches separate Robert from guaranteed safety from the fountain, and Sam is losing her balance. Robert and Sam tumble back into the carousel, with soft, furry paws still clasping Robert's arms, no longer connected to their creatures.

On the chimney, the women wait for something to shift. That's when the candy man's nose elongates and expands, causing everyone except Michael to almost giggle with surprise. The candy man dashes toward the barn with surprising grace, his actions resembling those of a human bird. Michael points and fireworks burst into the creature's chest, sending him sprawling on his front, with feet and hands in a tangled, spinning chaos. Michael holds his stance. A symphony of sirens and floodlights follows as a highway filled with bicycles of every type slices through a veil of mist, gliding toward the barn. Bicycles weave and tumble, and bright figures leap from the flaming bicycles, dispersing. Instantly Howard's body is dragged away from Sandra as something clasps his arms, stirring Sandra and making her shout and cling.

On the trampoline, the hamsters anticipate something to unfold. That's when the baker's beak unseals and contracts, leaving everyone except Lisa to faintly giggle with joy. The baker skates toward the treehouse with sluggish grace, its gestures echoing those of a robotic worm. Lisa whispers and flowers bloom into the robot's chassis, propping it upright on its front, with tentacles and antennae in a tangled, resting pattern. Lisa maintains her whisper. A roiling of waves and streetlights come next as a highway full of submarines of various colors dives through a curtain of glitter, swimming toward the treehouse. Submarines drift and synchronize, and glowing creatures swim from the glowing submarines, clustering. Suddenly Howard's kite is carried away from Wanda as someone tugs on his tail, waking Wanda and causing her to yawn and wave. Charlie and Audrey dance to Wanda's rhythm, tapping Howard's kitestring, with Tray trailing behind them, eager to paint the seaweed but unable to find a steady stroke because the dolphins are in the whirlwind. She dispenses the paintbrush and helps wave Howard's kitestring as Howard bellows and his tail is playfully bobbed in a cosmic see-saw, floating further through the clouds. Dana scans around the trampoline with wonder as only several more giggles separate Charlie from certain joy beneath the clouds, and Tray is gaining her. Charlie and Tray spring into the treehouse, with vine-like ropes still swinging from Charlie's kitestring, no longer tethered to their holders. Lisa soars above her, juggling a pizza cutter in one hoof and a saxophone in the other, as the sunbeams shimmer into a sea of sparkles. Charlie hurls the fluttering tendrils off her, and she and Tray glide away from the clouds. Overjoyed, Wanda tries to spin around Lisa to pursue Howard, but she intercepts her before she can float up. Wanda feebly taps at Lisa as she ushers her away from the clouds and sets her down into a front hammock. She's about to shout when Dana bursts into the canopy with a melody on her lips, but her harmony fades when she recognizes the whole in the sparkle and surveys the canopy. Victor clutches Dana's hoof, and every eye swivels to Lisa. Lisa gazes directly at Terry, as Victor watches her, unsure how to react, and Charlie gasps as all eyes abruptly glide to her."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
