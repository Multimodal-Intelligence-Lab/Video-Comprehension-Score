          "description": "Willie nonchalantly and with a casual air tosses a bottle over his shoulder, not bothering to aim, and shatters it against the windshield of a parked Mercedes. Completely unfazed by the destruction he has wrought, he leisurely ambles alongside Marcus as the two of them make their way toward the vibrant and bustling mall. Inside, a harried manager is engaged in the challenging task of trying to placate a thoroughly irritated Santa Claus. Meanwhile, Harrison, standing at a distance, catches sight of Willie and Marcus as they approach. During their walk, Willie takes a moment to gaze lustfully at someone, his vision obscured by the haze of cigarette smoke that surrounds him. In response to Willie’s behavior, Marcus winces in disapproval and gives him a shove to express his discontent. Meanwhile, in another part of the building, inside a slightly cramped office, Bob is seated across from a black man who takes a massive drag on his cigarette. The chief of security, while watching Bob intently, peels an orange, exuding an air of casual detachment.\n\nSimultaneously, down in front of the festive grotto, Marcus, always occupied and on the move, engages a crowd of eager and excited children, while Santa's chair remains noticeably vacant. Marcus turns to a female helper standing nearby, who is nonchalantly chewing gum. He rolls his eyes and shakes his head in a gesture of exasperation before refocusing his attention on the expectant children. Subsequently, Marcus heads backstage, where he discovers Santa in a deep, comatose slumber. Marcus proceeds to wake him roughly from his stupor. Santa, needing a quick pick-me-up, swiftly swigs from his bottle of grog. As Marcus makes his way back out front, he is met with the sight of children eagerly lined up inside the grotto. A chubby child with an ice cream cone takes a huge breath and unexpectedly sneezes all over Santa, drenching him. A small girl is next in line and takes her turn by sitting on the now snot-covered Santa's knee, followed by a boy with long hair. Santa impatiently shoos the boy away before casting a tired and weary glance over at Marcus.\n\nOutside the mall, a bus pulls up to a stop near a group of cool skater kids, and from it emerges a rotund boy with curly blonde hair. His presence immediately captures the attention of the skaterats. Attempting to maintain his dignity, Fat Ass walks on, but a skaterat mischievously throws a tin that bounces lightly off his hand. Keeping his eyes fixed ahead, Fat Ass determinedly waddles toward the mall entrance. Once inside, he arrives at the grotto, where Santa is seen impatiently munching on a handful of nuts. Marcus guides Fat Ass over to the now grumpy Santa, and without hesitation, Fat Ass proceeds to sit on Santa’s knee, staring intently at him, with boogies visibly dangling from his pudgy nose. He then playfully tugs on Santa's fake beard, adding to the mischief of the moment.\n\nAs the day gradually draws to a close, Fat Ass is seen sitting alone in the car park just outside the mall, watching as Willie and Marcus emerge from the building. Willie, with a dismissive gesture, gives Marcus the finger in a nonchalant farewell as he walks away, with Fat Ass continuing to observe the scene unfolding before him. Still dressed in his Santa suit, Willie finds himself sitting alone at the counter of a dimly lit bar. He lights a cigarette, chews some gum absently, and looks around resentfully at the sociable drinkers who are basking in the festive atmosphere. Taking a deep drag on his cigarette, his eyes fall on a bald Indian man with a goatee, who is staring at him with an unmistakably malevolent expression from across the bar. This prompts Willie to stare defiantly back at the man. The Indian man holds his hostile gaze for a moment before finally looking away. The barmaid approaches Willie, sniffing his empty glass with curiosity, and refills it with a practiced smile, giving him a sunny smile once more. Willie quickly downs his drink, and as the barmaid momentarily frowns at him, she then smiles, grins, laughs, and pours a shot for herself, indulging in a drink along with Willie."

Without a hint of concern, he leisurely ambles after Marcus, making his way toward a bustling mall where a manager is preoccupied with handling a frazzled, irritated Santa. As they approach, Harrison catches sight of Willie and Marcus from a distance. Willie, exuding an aura of indifference, takes a long drag from his cigarette, allowing the smoke to curl around his face as he gazes lustfully at someone in his line of vision. This earns a grimace from Marcus, who promptly winces and gives Willie a shove to keep him moving. Meanwhile, in an office setting, Bob is seated with a black guy who takes an impressive, deep drag on his cigarette, filling the air with smoke while the security chief, stationed nearby, maintains a watchful eye on Bob as he methodically peels an orange. Down in front of the grotto, Marcus is diligently entertaining a crowd of eager kids, while Santa's chair remains conspicuously empty, drawing curious glances. Frustration bubbling beneath the surface, Marcus turns to a gum-chewing female helper, rolling his eyes and shaking his head in exasperation before redirecting his attention back to the excited children. Determined to resolve the issue, Marcus heads backstage and discovers Santa in a comatose state, shaking him roughly to rouse him from his stupor. Santa, groggy but awake, takes a swig of his grog, preparing to face the day's demands as Marcus steps back out front. Inside the grotto, a line of children eagerly anticipates their turn with Santa. Among them, a particularly chubby kid with an ice cream cone takes a deep breath and inadvertently sneezes all over Santa, who now bears an unsightly mix of ice cream and mucus. A small girl settles onto snotty Santa's knee, quickly followed by a long-haired boy who receives a dismissive shooing from Santa before he turns his gaze toward Marcus for assistance. Outside, a bus pulls up at a nearby stop, catching the attention of a group of cool skater kids as a fat boy with curly blonde hair steps off. Attempting to maintain his dignity, the boy, dubbed Fat Ass, strides purposefully onward, only to have his composure disrupted when a skaterat hurls a tin that bounces off his hand. Resolute, Fat Ass keeps his eyes forward and waddles toward the mall, where he finds himself inside the grotto with a noticeably impatient Santa who is munching on nuts. Marcus guides Fat Ass over to the grouchy Santa, and as he plops onto Santa's knee, he stares intently at him, boogies dangling precariously from his nose. In a mischievous gesture, he reaches up and tugs on Santa's beard. As the day winds down, Fat Ass is perched in the car park outside the mall, observing as Willie and Marcus emerge. Willie, with a cavalier flick of his finger, gives Marcus the finger while walking away, leaving Fat Ass to watch him disappear into the distance. Later, Willie, still clad in his Santa suit, finds himself seated alone at a bar counter, lighting a cigarette and chewing gum as he surveys the festive gathering of social drinkers with a resentful expression. Taking a drag from his cigarette, his attention is drawn to a bald, goatee-bearded Indian guy who fixes him with a menacing stare across the bar, prompting Willie to meet the gaze defiantly before the Indian guy eventually looks away. The barmaid approaches, sniffing the empty glass before her, refilling it with practiced ease, and offering Willie a bright, sunny smile. Willie promptly knocks back his drink, prompting a series of expressions from the barmaid: she frowns, then transitions to a smile that evolves into a grin and ultimately a laugh as she decides to pour herself a shot alongside Willie’s."

Unconcerned, he ambles after Marcus towards a bustling shopping mall, a central hub for retail and entertainment, where a manager deals with an irritated Santa, part of the mall's seasonal festivities. Harrison, dressed in a sharp business suit, sees Willie and Marcus. Willie gazes lustfully at someone through his cigarette smoke, curling up from his imported, high-tar brand. Marcus, who is always cautious in public settings, winces and shoves Willie. In a dimly lit office, Bob sits with a black guy who takes a gargantuan drag on a cigarette, a common stress-relieving habit, while the security chief, a former police officer with a keen eye for detail, peels an orange. Down in front of the Christmas grotto, Marcus works a crowd of eager kids as Santa's chair remains conspicuously empty. Marcus turns to a gum-chewing female helper, a college student working part-time, rolls his eyes, shakes his head, and then turns to the kids. Marcus goes backstage and finds Santa comatose, rousing him roughly from a drunken stupor. Santa swigs his grog, a potent alcoholic mixture, as Marcus goes out front where kids are lined up inside the festive grotto. A fat kid with an ice cream takes a deep breath and sneezes over Santa. A small girl sits on snotty Santa's knee, followed by a boy with long hair, whom Santa shoos away before looking over at Marcus. A city bus pulls up at a bus stop near some cool skater kids, well-known for their rebellious and energetic lifestyle, and a fat boy with curly blonde hair steps off, catching the skaterats' attention with his awkward demeanor. Fat Ass tries to look dignified as he walks on, but a skaterat, known for their disdainful attitude towards outsiders, throws a tin that bounces off his hand. Eyes front, Fat Ass waddles towards the mall, and inside, he's in the grotto where Santa, cranky after a long day, impatiently munches nuts. Marcus leads Fat Ass over to surly Santa, and he sits on his knee, staring at him, with boogies dangling from his paunchy nose. He mischievously pulls Santa's fake, itchy beard. At the end of the day, Fat Ass is sitting in the car park outside the mall, surrounded by parked vehicles glistening in the evening light, as Willie and Marcus exit, and Willie gives Marcus the finger as he walks away, with Fat Ass watching him go. Still in his slightly disheveled Santa suit, Willie sits alone at the counter in a bar, a popular local dive known for its strong drinks, lights a cigarette, chews some gum, and looks resentfully around at the festive social drinkers merrily chatting away. He drags on his cigarette and notices a bald, goatee-bearded Indian guy, who seems familiar, giving him the evil eye across the bar, prompting Willie to stare back in defiance. The Indian guy, known for his stern demeanor, keeps his malevolent gaze on Willie before looking away. The barmaid, a cheerful young woman who has a knack for making her patrons feel welcome, comes over, sniffs his empty glass, refills it generously, and gives him a sunny smile. Willie knocks back his drink as the barmaid frowns in mild disapproval, then smiles, grins, laughs, and shares a shot with Willie, maintaining the bar's lively atmosphere."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
