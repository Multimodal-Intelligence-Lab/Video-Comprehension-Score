Colloredo is plainly unsettled by this welcome of his worker, grinning and inclining uncomfortably as they involve him in the small tribute. Mozart stands in the passage, out of the Archbishop's field of vision, inclining and chuckling, and fostering the acclamation for the Archbishop with directing motions. Abruptly annoyed, Colloredo signals to Arco, who advances and closes the portal, terminating the acclamation. Salieri, in this enormous space, is standing and gazing at the full score of the Serenade. Immediately, we again hear its melodious strains. Salieri scrutinizes the score of the Adagio in powerless captivation, but abruptly the music cuts off as Mozart stands before him and sets down the score. Mozart takes the score, bows, and strides swiftly out of the space, while Salieri gazes unintelligibly after the lively little figure. At a table sits Emperor Joseph II, consuming his meager meal and sipping goat's milk. He is a perceptive, neat man of forty, wearing a martial attire, encircled by his Chamberlain Johann Von Strack, Count Orsini-Rosenberg, Baron Von Swieten, First Kapellmeister Giuseppe Bonno, and Salieri, who wears proper black as typical. At a side-table, two Imperial secretaries employ quill pens and inkwells to transcribe everything of significance that is uttered. Salieri glances defiantly at Orsini-Rosenberg. In a gloomy space which serves as both a bedroom and a study, opposite an image sits Salieri at his desk, on which stands a stack of music paper, quill pens, and ink. He occasionally tries notes from the march he is composing on an open forte-piano with some difficulty, scratching notes out with his quill and ruffling his hair without a powdered wig. The Salesman places the second wig on Mozart's head, who pulls a face of uncertainty in the mirror and giggles. Mozart turns and enters the salon, where another assembly awaits him, comprising Von Strack, Orsini-Rosenberg, Bonno, Von Swieten, and Salieri in a chamber containing several gilded chairs and a forte-piano. All bow and say, \"Good morning, Your Majesty.\" The Emperor produces a paper, goes to the instrument, sits, and plays the initial bars of it, but plays an incorrect note. Mozart hurls himself to his knees and, to Joseph's discomfort, kisses the royal hand with zeal."

He occasionally attempts notes from the march he is attempting to compose on an open forte-piano, struggling somewhat, intermittently scratching notes out with his quill and ruffling his hair, notably untamed without a powdered wig. Meanwhile, a salesman places a second wig onto Mozart's head, prompting Mozart to make a doubtful face at his reflection in the mirror before letting out a giggle. Mozart then turns away from his reflection and enters the salon, where another group is eagerly awaiting him.

Colloredo is clearly discomfited by this reception of his employee, smiling and bowing uneasily as they include him in the small ovation, which reflects Mozart's growing fame and contentious relationship with his patron. Mozart stands in the corridor, out of the Archbishop's line of sight, bowing and giggling, and encouraging the applause for the Archbishop with conducting gestures that highlight his irreverent humor and charm. Suddenly irritated, Colloredo signs to Arco, his aide, who steps forward and shuts the door, ending the applause. Salieri, in this vast room filled with opulent decor typical of the period's aristocratic residences, is standing and looking at the full score of the Serenade, a form of music designed to entertain. Instantly, we again hear its lyrical strains, showcasing Mozart's genius in crafting melodies. Salieri reads the score of the Adagio in helpless fascination, but suddenly the music snaps off as Mozart stands before him and lays down the score, an action symbolizing both his dominance and playful nature. Mozart takes the score, bows, and struts briskly out of the room, while Salieri stares uncomprehendingly after the jaunty little figure, emblematic of his rival's mysterious brilliance. At a table sits Emperor Joseph II, the reform-minded ruler of the Holy Roman Empire who patronized the arts, eating his frugal dinner and sipping goat's milk, a nod to his personal asceticism and preference for simple living. He is an intelligent, dapper man of forty, wearing a military uniform, symbolizing his role as both a statesman and military leader, surrounded by his Chamberlain Johann Von Strack, Count Orsini-Rosenberg, Baron Von Swieten, First Kapellmeister Giuseppe Bonno, and Salieri, who wears decorous black as usual, reflecting the fashion of court musicians of the time. At a side-table, two Imperial secretaries use quill pens and inkstands, tools of the trade in the pre-industrial age, to write down everything of importance that is said. Salieri looks defiantly at Orsini-Rosenberg, a significant figure in the court's music administration. In a somber room which serves as both a bedroom and a study, typical of 18th-century accommodations for individuals of modest means, opposite an image sits Salieri at his desk, on which stands a pile of music paper, quill pens, and ink, essential for the manual composition of music. He occasionally tries notes from the march he is composing on an open forte-piano, a precursor to the modern piano, with some difficulty, scratching notes out with his quill and ruffling his hair without a powdered wig, which was fashionable but often uncomfortable. The Salesman puts the second wig on Mozart's head, who pulls a face of doubt in the mirror and giggles, an expression of his playful personality. Mozart turns and comes into the salon, where another group awaits him, consisting of Von Strack, Orsini-Rosenberg, Bonno, Von Swieten, and Salieri in a room containing several gilded chairs, indicative of the era's opulent furnishings, and a forte-piano. All bow and say, \"Good morning, Your Majesty,\" to the Emperor, acknowledging his presence with the courtly etiquette of the time. The Emperor produces a paper, goes to the instrument, sits, and plays the first bars of it, but plays a wrong note, an endearing humanizing moment for the ruler. Mozart throws himself to his knees and, to Joseph's discomfort, kisses the royal hand with fervour, a gesture of exaggerated deference that underscores his theatrical nature."

Suddenly perturbed, Colloredo waves to Arco, who approaches and opens the door, commencing the silence. Salieri, in this expansive room, is reclining and gazing at the full score of the Serenade. Instantly, we again see its lyrical notations. Salieri skims the score of the Adagio in helpless obsession, but suddenly the music fades away as Mozart skips before him and lifts up the score. Mozart grips the score, nods, and sashays calmly out of the room, while Salieri glares confusedly after the confident little figure.

Suddenly vexed, Leopold gestures to Gustav, who strides forward and closes the window, silencing the cheer. Beethoven, in this grand chamber, is sitting and examining the full score of the Concerto. Instantly, we again hear its harmonious chords. Beethoven scans the score of the Allegro in powerless wonder, but suddenly the sound cuts off as Bach stands before him and sets down the score. Bach takes the score, nods, and strides jauntily out of the chamber, while Beethoven gazes bewilderedly after the sprightly little figure. At a table sits King Louis XVI, enjoying his simple supper and sipping almond milk. He is a sharp, spry man of fifty, adorned in a naval uniform, surrounded by his Steward Friedrich Von Trapp, Duke Marsini-Rosenstein, Countess Von Berlin, Chief Conductor Franzisca Gallo, and Beethoven, who wears elegant gray as usual. At a side-desk, two Royal clerks use feather pens and inkpots to note down everything of significance that is uttered. Beethoven looks boldly at Marsini-Rosenstein. In a stark room which doubles as both a boudoir and an office, opposite a sculpture sits Beethoven at his bureau, on which rests a heap of manuscript paper, feather pens, and ink. He periodically experiments with notes from the sonata he is arranging on an open harpsichord with some effort, erasing notes with his quill and tousling his hair without a styled wig. The Hatter places the second wig on Bach's head, who makes a face of uncertainty in the mirror and chuckles. Bach pivots and enters the parlor, where another cluster awaits him, consisting of Von Trapp, Marsini-Rosenstein, Gallo, Von Berlin, and Beethoven in a chamber containing several ornate chairs and a harpsichord. All nod and say, \"Good morning, Your Highness.\" The King unfolds a parchment, approaches the instrument, seats himself, and plays the opening bars of it, but hits an incorrect note.

Suddenly annoyed, Colloredo gestures to Arco, who steps forward and draws the window closed, halting the cheers. Salieri, in this expansive arena, is sitting and observing the entire map of the Serenade. Instantly, we again hear its orchestral echoes. Salieri peruses the map of the Adagio in helpless wonder, but suddenly the sound cuts off as Mozart stands before him and places down the map.

Bach, in this enormous hall, is standing and glancing at the complete recipe of the Dessert. Instantly, we again smell its fragrant aromas. Bach examines the recipe of the Main Course in desperate wonder, but suddenly the scent vanishes as Beethoven stands before him and places down the recipe. Beethoven takes the recipe, nods, and marches cheerfully out of the hall, while Bach gazes bewilderedly after the lively little character. At a table sits King George III, munching his simple breakfast and sipping tiger's milk. He is a clever, neat man of forty, wearing a civilian suit, surrounded by his Advisor Johann Von Brick, Duke Fitz-Hummel, Lord Von Sweeten, Chief Librarian Philippon Blau, and Bach, who wears dignified grey as usual. At a corner-table, two Royal scribes use feather quills and ink wells to jot down everything essential that is mentioned. Bach looks boldly at Fitz-Hummel. In a gloomy chamber which serves as both a lounge and a library, beside a painting sits Bach at his bureau, on which lies a stack of blank pages, feather quills, and ink. He occasionally tests tunes from the ballad he is crafting on an open lute with some challenge, erasing lines with his feather and tousling his hair without a powdered cap. The Farmer places the spare cap on Beethoven's head, who makes a face of skepticism in the reflection and chuckles. Beethoven turns and walks into the parlor, where another assembly awaits him, consisting of Von Brick, Fitz-Hummel, Blau, Von Sweeten, and Bach in a chamber containing several silver stools and a lute.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Meanwhile, Mozart comically assesses wigs, eventually joining a salon gathering with Strack, Rosenberg, Bonno, Swieten, and Salieri.
