In a slow, deliberate motion, Lupin takes hold of the old parchment, which has transformed to display an unflattering caricature of Snape alongside a pair of potions. As Harry walks alongside Lupin, who is visibly fuming and gripping the map with a fierce intensity, he bears a silence weighted with thought. Harry, seemingly lost in his own world, lingers for a brief moment in the doorway, his eyes absently drawn to the waxing moon that is shimmering beyond the nearby window. He begins to turn away but hesitates, stopping in his tracks. Lupin, with the slightest moment of hesitation, eventually returns his attention to the papers before him. Meanwhile, as Professor Trelawney peers intently into Harry's crystal ball, Hermione's eyes roll in disbelief. Stung by the situation, Hermione attempts to retort but finds herself unable to utter even a single word. Rising rather gracelessly, she leaves the room, knocking her crystal ball to the floor in the process. Harry watches with a curious glance as the ball rolls slowly out through the doorway. Ron, noticing the event, stops momentarily, throws a glance at Harry, then moves on. As Harry watches Ron and others leave, his eyes catch sight of Hermione's crystal ball lying on the landing. With a considerate gesture, Harry sets Hermione's crystal back onto its stand. Just as he is about to leave, the smoke inside the crystal unexpectedly darkens. Leaning in closer, Harry observes the shape that forms before his eyes, and it is unmistakably Sirius Black. Suddenly, a shadow slides across the glossy surface of the crystal, and a hand abruptly grabs Harry by the shoulder. He wheels around, discovering the source, and stiffens. When the hand rises, she blinks and finds herself staring at her own hand resting on Harry's shoulder—Professor Trelawney's hand. Harry shakes his head in what seems like a bid to clear his thoughts. Clearly unsettled by his encounter and Trelawney's peculiar behavior, Harry hastens down the stairs, and the scene gradually fades out. SWOOK! SWOOK! We fade back in to the moving point of view of a crow, gliding effortlessly to join its flock as they circle around the feet of a pot-bellied man, the Executioner, who is sitting introspectively in the courtyard. As he methodically sharpens his axe—SWOOK! SWOOK!—the scene shifts to show Harry, Ron, and Hermione hurrying past with brisk, purposeful strides. The Executioner glances up, and we witness Harry leading Ron and Hermione with determined steps toward Hagrid's hut. Hermione and Ron pause to look and see Draco Malfoy, accompanied by Crabbe and Goyle, lurking ominously within a cluster of towering monolithic menhirs. Binoculars in hand, they are spying on Hagrid, who stands in his pumpkin patch, tossing dead ferrets to Buckbeak. In a flurry of motion, Malfoy stumbles back against a tree, cross-eyed and filled with fear as Hermione sharply jabs the tip of her wand under his nose. Surprised by Ron's words, she turns, nods, and—SMACK!—as quick as lightning, delivers a powerful looping right punch to Malfoy's jaw, knocking him flat on his back. Stunned and disoriented, Malfoy leaps to his feet and takes flight, with Crabbe and Goyle huffing and puffing as they follow behind him. The trio, unperturbed, makes their way down the gentle slope and moves past Buckbeak, who is lazily chewing on a ferret with satisfied indifference. Watching Buckbeak with a protective eye, Hagrid stands by his window. Harry and Ron take their seats, and the trio quietly slips into a stand of trees, leaving Hagrid's hut to glimmer desolately in the fading light of the dying sun. At that elevated moment, high up in the clock tower, a solemn bell begins to toll, marking the passage of time in the evening air."

In a slow and deliberate motion, Lupin takes hold of the old, worn parchment, which has undergone a transformation to reveal an unflattering caricature of Snape next to a pair of potions. As Harry walks alongside Lupin, who is visibly fuming and gripping the map with a fierce intensity born of frustration, he bears a silence heavy with thought and reflection. Harry, seemingly lost in his own world, lingers for a brief moment in the doorway, his eyes absently drawn to the waxing moon shimmering beyond the nearby window.

As Lupin steps forward, he reaches out and takes hold of the parchment, which has now transformed to show an unflattering caricature of Snape alongside a depiction of a pair of potions. Harry finds himself walking beside a visibly angry Lupin, who clutches the map tightly in his fist. Harry moves quietly and briefly pauses in the doorway, his gaze wandering absently to the waxing moon that shimmers brightly beyond the window, prompting him to begin turning away, though he ultimately hesitates. Lupin also hesitates for a slight moment before returning his attention to the papers in front of him. Trelawney, in the meantime, focuses her eyes on Harry's crystal ball. Seeing this, Hermione rolls her eyes in exasperation. Feeling stung by Trelawney’s gesture, Hermione starts to respond but finds herself at a loss for words, unable to articulate a reply. Rising from her seat with little grace, she exits the room, inadvertently knocking her crystal ball to the floor in the process. Harry looks on with curiosity as the ball rolls slowly away from the doorway. Ron pauses, glances at Harry with a subtle inquiry, then proceeds to leave. Harry watches both Ron and the others depart before noticing Hermione's crystal ball lying on the landing. Intent on tidying up, Harry picks up the crystal and sets it back on its stand. As he prepares to leave, the smoke inside the crystal suddenly darkens and catches his attention. Leaning in closer, Harry examines the shape that forms within the crystal—it is unmistakably Sirius Black. At that exact moment, a shadow moves across the glossy surface of the crystal and a hand unexpectedly grips Harry's shoulder, prompting him to wheel around and identify the source. Harry stiffens at the sight, only to find himself blinking as the hand is revealed to be Trelawney's, resting upon his shoulder. With a shake of his head, Harry, clearly unsettled by this encounter, quickly makes his way down the stairs, signaling a transition to the next scene as we fade out. A sudden \"SWOOK! SWOOK!\" noise cuts through, and we fade up with the moving perspective of a crow as it gracefully glides toward a flock circling at the feet of a pot-bellied man—the Executioner—who is sitting in the courtyard. With a rhythmic \"SWOOK! SWOOK!\" sound, he methodically sharpens his axe, a scene that abruptly transitions to Harry, Ron, and Hermione hurrying past the courtyard. The Executioner looks up, observing as Harry leads Ron and Hermione towards Hagrid's hut. Hermione and Ron direct their attention to Malfoy, who, along with Crabbe and Goyle, lies hidden within a cluster of imposing menhirs. Binoculars in hand, they are spying on Hagrid, who occupies himself in the pumpkin patch, throwing dead ferrets to Buckbeak. With a sudden stumble, Malfoy recoils against a tree, his eyes crossing with terror as Hermione, quick to act, thrusts the tip of her wand beneath his nose. Her surprise is evident when she turns to find Ron addressing her. With a nod of acknowledgment, Hermione swiftly delivers a looping right punch to Malfoy's jaw, sending him sprawling flat on his back. Stunned by the unexpected blow, Malfoy scrambles to his feet and bolts away, with Crabbe and Goyle struggling to keep up, puffing heavily behind him. Together, the trio makes their way down the slope, passing Buckbeak, who chews on a ferret with an air of idle satisfaction. Hagrid stands by the window, watching Buckbeak with a contemplative gaze. Meanwhile, Harry and Ron find a place to sit, and the trio quietly slips into a cluster of trees. Beyond them, Hagrid's hut glimmers in solitude under the fading light of the sun. A bell begins to toll from high within the clock tower, marking the passage of time in the quiet scene."

Lupin takes the parchment, which now displays a rather unflattering caricature of Snape and a pair of potions, resembling those in the Hogwarts Potions classroom. Harry walks beside a fuming Lupin, who grips the map fiercely, a relic known as the Marauder's Map revealing hidden passages and people’s whereabouts within Hogwarts. Harry walks silently and lingers briefly in the doorway, absently eyeing the waxing moon that glimmers beyond the window, an omen of Lupin's upcoming transformation, then starts to turn away but stops. Lupin hesitates ever-so-slightly, then returns to his papers, likely preparing for the next class. As Trelawney, the divination professor with a penchant for dramatic predictions, eyes Harry's crystal, Hermione rolls her eyes. Stung, Hermione starts to reply but seems incapable of a single word, her logical mind clashing with Trelawney’s mystical approach. Rising gracelessly, she exits, knocking her crystal ball to the floor. Harry watches curiously as the ball rolls slowly out the doorway. Ron stops, glances at Harry, then moves off. Harry watches him go, along with the others, then spies Hermione's crystal ball lying on the landing. Harry sets Hermione's crystal back on its stand and starts to go, when the smoke within the crystal suddenly darkens, a sign of impending danger. Leaning close, Harry watches the shape that appears. It is unmistakable: Sirius Black, the infamous escaped prisoner from Azkaban rumored to be after Harry. Just then, a shadow crawls the glossy surface of the crystal, and a hand snatches Harry's shoulder. He wheels, finds, and Harry stiffens. When it rises, she blinks, eyes the hand that lies upon Harry's shoulder—her hand, belonging to Trelawney, known for her dramatic entrances. Harry shakes his head, clearly unsettled by his encounter with Trelawney, Harry hastens down the stairs, and we fade out. SWOOK! SWOOK! We fade up on a moving POV of a crow as it glides to the flock circling the feet of a pot-bellied man, the Executioner, tasked with Buckbeak's fate, sitting in the courtyard. As he sharpens his axe—SWOOK! SWOOK!—we cut to Harry, Ron, and Hermione hurrying past. The Executioner looks up, and we see Harry leading Ron and Hermione toward Hagrid's hut, the warm, rustic abode of their gentle half-giant friend. She and Ron look and see Malfoy, along with Crabbe and Goyle, lurking within a grouping of monolithic menhirs, ancient stones that add to the mystical aura of the grounds, binoculars in hand, spying on Hagrid, who stands in the pumpkin patch, tossing dead ferrets to Buckbeak, the proud Hippogriff. Malfoy stumbles back against a tree, cross-eyed with fear as Hermione jabs the tip of her wand under his nose, when she turns, surprised Ron's spoken to her. Hermione nods, then—SMACK!—quick as lightning, lands a looping right to Malfoy's jaw, putting him flat on his back. Stunned, he leaps to his feet and runs, Crabbe and Goyle huffing and puffing behind. The trio makes their way down the slope and past Buckbeak, chewing on a ferret with idle satisfaction. Hagrid stands by the window watching Buckbeak, likely worried about the creature’s impending hearing. Harry and Ron sit, and the trio slips silently into a stand of trees. Beyond them, Hagrid's hut glimmers desolately in the dying sun, a silent witness to their adventures. High in the clock tower, a bell begins to toll, marking the hour and echoing through the castle grounds."

Sprout places Poppy's pebble back on its pedestal and starts to leave, when the mist within the pebble abruptly deepens. Leaning closer, Sprout studies the figure that emerges.

He and Olive glance and spy Almond, along with Fig and Nutmeg, sneaking within a cluster of towering sculptures, telescopes in hand, observing Paisley, who stands in the flower bed, flinging deflated balloons to Wallaby. Almond staggers back against a boulder, cross-eyed with dread as Poppy jabs the tip of her marker under his chin, when she pivots, startled that Olive's addressed her.

Dumbledore hesitates ever-so-briefly, then shifts to his book. As Flitwick inspects Neville's flask, Luna sighs. Excited, Luna begins to sing but seems incapable of a single note.

He and Ginny glance and see Snape, along with Pansy and Blaise, hiding behind a cluster of colossal boulders, parchment in hand, observing Filch, who kneels in the cactus patch, feeding live cats to Fawkes. Snape tumbles forward against a bush, wide-eyed with awe as Luna dangles the edge of her book above his head, when he turns, shocked Neville's whispered to him. Luna shrugs, then—THUMP!—sluggish as ice, misses a spinning left to Snape's chest, placing him softly on his feet. Impressed, he sinks to his knees and dances, Pansy and Blaise giggling and laughing ahead. The duo makes their way up the hill and beyond Fawkes, nibbling on a cactus with fierce determination. Filch leans by the curtain watching Fawkes. Neville and Ginny stand, and the duo glides loudly into a group of rocks. Behind them, Filch's shed glows brilliantly in the rising moon.

When it ascends, she blinks, examines the hand that rests upon Alex's arm—her hand. Alex shakes his head. Clearly startled by his meeting with Johnson, Alex rushes down the hallway, and we fade out. WHIRR! WHIRR! We fade up on a soaring view of a falcon as it drifts to the flock scurrying around the legs of a slender woman, the Gardener, reclining in the atrium. As she polishes her spade—WHIRR! WHIRR!—we cut to Alex, Neville, and Rachel rushing by. The Gardener glances up, and we observe Alex guiding Neville and Rachel toward Falco's cottage. She and Neville glance and spot Fergus, alongside Cale and Link, hiding among a collection of towering stones, telescopes in hand, observing Falco, who stands in the orchard, tossing live mice to Sunwing. Fergus trips backward into a bush, startled with fright as Rachel prods the tip of her staff under his chin, when she rotates, bewildered that Neville's spoken to her. Rachel agrees, then—WHACK!—swift as a breeze, delivers a sweeping uppercut to Fergus's cheek, dropping him flat on his back. Shocked, he bounds to his feet and dashes, Cale and Link panting and puffing behind. The group navigates their path down the incline and past Sunwing, gnawing on a mouse with calm contentment. Falco stands by the arch watching Sunwing. Alex and Neville settle, and the group slips quietly into a cluster of shrubs. Beyond them, Falco's cottage flickers forlornly in the setting light. High in the church tower, a bell starts to chime."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

          "description": "Snape notices Lupin in the shadows as Lupin examines a parchment showing Snape's caricature. With a tense grip on the map, Lupin walks with Harry, who briefly pauses at a waxing moon but continues on. Trelawney and Hermione have a tense moment, leading Hermione to leave, knocking over her crystal ball. Ron and Harry observe, with Harry placing the ball back on its stand. The smoke inside unexpectedly reveals Sirius Black's image, unsettling Harry when Trelawney's hand surprises him. Disturbed, Harry rushes down the stairs. We shift to see a crow fly to an Executioner sharpening his axe as Harry, Ron, and Hermione hurry by. They spot Malfoy and his cronies spying on Hagrid, who is feeding Buckbeak. Hermione confronts Malfoy and punches him, sending him running with Crabbe and Goyle. The trio retreats past Buckbeak and into trees, observing Hagrid's hut in the fading light as a clock tolls in the distance."
