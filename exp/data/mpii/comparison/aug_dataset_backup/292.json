Jeff, who is still staring out the window, has a look of sudden discovery on his face and calls quickly, turning halfway around and pointing. We see Lisa moving behind him toward the shelf as he adds, then he turns back to the window, holding out his right hand to the side, waiting for the box and viewer. The camera pulls back a little as Lisa comes up and places the box and viewer in his hand. Jeff opens the box, which contains color slides, and holds one or two of the slides up to the light as Lisa looks down at him curiously and Stella comes forward from the background.

The camera withdraws a little as Lisa comes up and places the container and viewer in his hand. Jeff opens the container, which contains color transparencies, and holds one or two of the transparencies up to the illumination as Lisa looks down at him curiously and Stella comes forward from the backdrop. He squints out through the viewer, then looks away a moment without it before looking back through the viewer. Jeff takes the viewer from his eye, hands it to Lisa, who raises it to her eye.

A look of sudden discovery is seen on Jeff's face, who is still staring out the window, and he quickly calls, halfway turning around and pointing. Lisa is seen moving behind him toward the shelf as an addition is made by him, then the window is turned back to by him, with his right hand held out to the side, waiting for the box and viewer. A little is pulled back by the camera as the box and viewer are placed in his hand by Lisa as she comes up. The box is opened by Jeff, containing color slides, and one or two of the slides are held up to the light by him as Lisa looks down at him curiously and Stella comes forward from the background. The viewer is squinted out through by him, then it is looked away from a moment without it before it's looked back through the viewer. The viewer is taken from his eye by Jeff, and it is handed to Lisa, who raises it to her eye. Through the viewer, the identical view out of the window is seen by us, then the viewer moves away, and the same scene is left with us but not quite so still, as a slight breeze stirs the foliage.

A sigh of relief is experienced by both of them, and something is handed to her by Jeff as a little is knitted by Stella's brow, seeing something, and the long-focus lens is reached for by her. It is lifted to her eye by her, and a small brown bottle is opened, taking out four red capsules which are placed on the white tablecloth of her little table in Miss Lonely Hearts' apartment, where a candle is burning in a holder, and other lamps also light the apartment.

As this happens, Stella also pivots simultaneously, effectively interrupting Lisa in the process. Meanwhile, Jeff, still seated and remaining completely fixated on the view outside the window, suddenly experiences a look of discovery manifesting on his face. With urgency, he quickly calls out, turning halfway around in his chair and pointing with a sense of urgency. We observe Lisa as she purposefully moves behind him toward the shelf while he continues speaking intently, then he shifts his focus once again back to the window, extending his right hand to the side, expectantly waiting for the box and viewer to be handed to him. The camera subtly pulls back slightly as Lisa approaches his side, placing the box and viewer into his eagerly waiting hand. Jeff then proceeds to open the box, which contains a meticulously organized collection of color slides, and he carefully holds one or two of these slides up to the incoming light.

Jeff squints attentively through the viewer, then momentarily looks away from it before promptly returning his gaze through the viewer once more.

Meanwhile, Jeff remains fixated on the view outside, his expression shifting to one of sudden realization. He quickly calls out, his voice urgent, as he turns halfway around, his finger extending to point at something of interest. Lisa, moving with purpose, steps behind him toward the shelf, her actions synchronized with Jeff's words. Jeff then redirects his attention back to the window, his right hand extending to the side, palm open and expectant, waiting for the box and viewer. The camera subtly pulls back, capturing the moment as Lisa approaches and gently places the box and viewer into his waiting hand. With a sense of anticipation, Jeff opens the box, revealing a collection of color slides nestled inside. He carefully selects one or two slides, holding them up to the light, his eyes narrowing in concentration as Lisa watches him with curiosity, and Stella advances from the background, drawn into the unfolding scene. Jeff squints through the viewer, his gaze intense, then momentarily shifts his focus away, only to return his eye to the viewer once more. Satisfied, he lowers the viewer from his eye and passes it to Lisa, who eagerly raises it to her own eye. Through the viewer, the identical view out of the window is revealed, a scene of stillness subtly animated by a gentle breeze stirring the foliage. Jeff looks up, meeting Lisa's puzzled expression, and together with Stella, they all ease back, a sense of awe enveloping them as Lisa, her gaze still fixed outside, speaks softly. Suddenly, Stella begins to chuckle, her amusement bubbling up, but her demeanor quickly shifts to seriousness as she addresses the unspoken question hanging in the air, while Jeff's eyes shift to Stella, seeking understanding. As Lisa continues speaking, Jeff's attention is drawn to a new development, and Lisa suddenly appears at the ground floor door below Thorwald's apartment, her body tense as she hides and presses back against the wall. Above, in the corridor, Thorwald returns, his frustration evident, and steps out onto the fire escape directly above Lisa. Aware of his presence, Lisa immediately retreats into the doorway, disappearing down the lower corridor as Thorwald inspects his fire escape. A collective sigh of relief escapes both Lisa and Jeff, the tension dissipating momentarily.

She lifts it to her eye, her focus shifting as she opens a small brown bottle, extracting four red capsules, which she carefully places on the white tablecloth in Miss Lonely Hearts' apartment. The room is softly illuminated by a candle burning in a holder, accompanied by other lamps casting a warm glow. Miss Lonely Hearts, dressed in modest street clothes, exudes a sense of tranquility as she sits at the table. By the candlelight, she opens a black-covered book, her eyes scanning the fine print. She leans over the book momentarily, then glances up at the capsules before returning her attention to the text, while the voices of Stella and Jeff are heard in the background. Miss Lonely Hearts descends the stairs, her movements deliberate, as Lisa approaches Jeff and Stella, joining them in their shared moment of intrigue."

We spot Harvey walking behind her toward the piano as Marge adds, then she swivels back to the mirror, extending her left hand to the ceiling, hoping for the candle and telescope. The camera zooms out slightly as Harvey comes forward and places the candle and telescope in her hand. Marge opens the candle, which holds tiny maps, and lifts one or two of the maps up to the breeze as Harvey glances down at her perplexedly and the parrot hops forward from the shadows. She blinks through the telescope, then dismisses it briefly without it before peering back through the telescope. Marge removes the telescope from her gaze, passes it to Harvey, who lifts it to his gaze. Through the telescope, we glimpse the mirrored scene out of the curtain, then the telescope shifts away, and we are left with the mirrored reflection but not quite so silent, as a gentle wind stirs the curtains. Marge glances up to a confused Harvey, and all three retreat in wonder as Harvey, still peering out, remarks something. Abruptly, the parrot starts to snicker, but its beak straightens as it answers their unvoiced query while Marge observes the parrot. Midway through Harvey's monologue, Marge begins chiming in, and Harvey suddenly appears at the first-floor hatch beneath Baker’s, crouching and leaning against the trunk anxiously. In the lane overhead, Baker arrives flustered and exits onto the ladder landing directly over Harvey, who senses her and quickly withdraws into the hatch, vanishing down the upper alley as Baker examines her ladder. There's a breath of ease from both, and Marge hands something to him as the parrot's eyes narrow slightly, seeing something, and it reaches for the short-scope binoculars. It raises them to its beak and opens a small green canister, extracting four blue candies which it arranges on the red blanket of its tiny desk in Mr. Lonely Tunes' studio, where a lantern glows in a sconce, and other torches also illuminate the studio. Mr. Lonely Tunes is dressed in lively night attire and appears wholly serene as he reclines at the desk, and by the glow of the lantern, continues to skim a white-bound diary and study it. The script is tiny, and he leans over it briefly, glances at the candies, and goes back to the diary while the parrot and Marge are heard offstage.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
