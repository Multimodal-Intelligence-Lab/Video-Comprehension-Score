Ryan turns to Kara, who raises her eyebrows, urging him to go in. Jim looks up from the book, and Ryan shuts the door, his eyes roving before he sits down and shrugs.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby cafÃ©, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

          "description": "Ryan and Kara visit the Sunday School room, where Ryan hesitates before entering to see Jim, dressed in formal attire, reading a children's book. Kara encourages him, and they join Julie, who is being comforted by bridesmaids. Jim consoles Julie, and they share a warm hug. Meanwhile, guests receive the order of service and take seats in the church. In the vestry, Alex helps Ryan with his suit as the ceremony begins. Julie, escorted by Jim's uncle, walks down the aisle, culminating in an exchange of vows and rings with Jim. The couple lights candles and kisses, sparking applause as they exit. At the reception, guests celebrate, and Alex and Ryan share a joyful connection, dancing and laughing. Julie throws her bouquet, caught by a bridesmaid, while Alex and Ryan continue to enjoy the evening. As guests leave, Ryan gives Alex a bouquet, and they share a kiss in the hotel lift. The next day, at the airport, Alex smiles at Ryan before departing. Back in Omaha, Ryan returns to his empty apartment, hangs his clothes, and continues his work with Natalie, walking past cubicles where workers engage in video calls."
