The gentleman hangs up the telephone, swings his feet out of bed, spears his slippers, and reaches for his robe simultaneously. He shuffles drowsily to the door as Gideon exits his chamber and proceeds to the lift. The cage is present; he opens the door, enters, closes the sliding grill, and presses a button. The cage begins descending, but Gideon begins sneezing. Suddenly, the lift halts between floors and the lights extinguish, then just as abruptly, the lights return and the lift resumes descending. Gideon shakes his head and reclines, whistling once more until the cage arrives at his level and starts passing it, leaving him bewildered. The night porter, asleep behind the desk, does not perceive as the lift continues past the lobby level toward the cellar and out of view. Quietness follows as the motor ceases, then a series of sneezes culminates with a terrifying scream. Rudely roused, the night porter sprints to the lift shaft as his shoes squeak. He gazes upward, perceives nothing, then glances downward, presses the call button, and the motor initiates. An instant later, the cage materializes and halts; the night porter opens the gate, pulls back the grill, and the camera rushes past him to capture Gideon. Gideon's body sits on the floor of the cage in a monstrous, sprawling position resembling a puppet with its strings severed, except Gideon has no strings to sever—only a throat cut from ear to ear.

He takes a sack to the bed, dumps out the contents, and begins scrutinizing the items one by one, taking one out of an envelope before putting on his spectacles to read it. He hands her the spectacles, and she peers through them."

          "description": "As everyone at the table rises together, they stand at the rail, their eyes fixed on the scene before them in anticipation. A woman, lifting herself on her tip-toes for better reach, leans towards a man and plants a gentle kiss on his lips. He remains passive, simply looking at her without any reaction. Unperturbed, she leans in once more and kisses him again; this time, he responds slightly more, adding a hint of acknowledgment. As she moves in for yet another kiss, he gently stops her, indicating a pause in their quiet exchange. Meanwhile, in a different setting, a man concludes his phone conversation by hanging up and swinging his feet from the comfort of his bed. He reaches out to slip his feet into his waiting slippers and simultaneously extends his arm to grab his robe, readying himself for the next steps of his day. Moving sluggishly, he shuffles towards the door, his movements still carrying the weight of sleep. At this moment, Gideon exits his room and strides towards the elevator. Approaching the cage, he opens the door, steps inside, and closes the sliding grill behind him before pressing the designated button to descend. As the elevator begins its downward journey, Gideon starts sneezing abruptly. Suddenly, the elevator halts between floors, plunging into darkness as the lights flicker out. Then, just as suddenly, the lights flicker back on, and the elevator resumes its descent. Gideon shakes his head, trying to clear it, and leans back, producing a whistle to fill the silence until the cage surpasses his intended floor, leaving him baffled. Meanwhile, the night porter, immersed in slumber behind the desk, fails to notice the elevator bypassing the lobby and continuing its descent toward the basement, drifting out of sight. Silence envelops the scene as the motor ceases, only for the silence to be broken by a succession of sneezes that culminate in a horrifying shriek. Jolted from his sleep, the night porter dashes to the elevator shaft, his shoes squeaking with urgency. He glances upward, seeing nothing before shifting his gaze downward, pressing the call button out of reflex. The motor kicks back into action, and within moments, the cage reappears and comes to a halt. The night porter quickly opens the gate, slides back the grill, and the camera rushes past him to capture the chilling sight of Gideon. Gideon's body rests unnaturally on the cage floor in a grotesque sprawl reminiscent of a puppet abandoned by its puppeteer, except Gideon has no strings—only a throat slashed from ear to ear. In a tight shot, Grandpierre's face displays a mix of fury and bewilderment as the camera draws back, revealing Reggie and Adam standing in their bathrobes. Reggie merely shrugs, exchanging a look with Adam, as Grandpierre pivots on his heel and departs. Together, Reggie and Adam make their way down the hall toward their respective rooms. Before ending his phone conversation, Adam pauses to contemplate Tex’s words, then glances over his shoulder, allowing a soft smile to form. Satisfied, he hangs up the phone and proceeds to Reggie’s door. Meanwhile, Reggie slips back into her robe, approaches the connecting door, and undoes the bolt, swinging it open to invite Adam inside. Adam carries a bag to the bed, tipping it over to release its contents, which spill out in a casual heap. He begins to scrutinize the items one by one, taking one from an envelope and pausing to put on his glasses for a closer inspection. He then hands the glasses to Reggie, who takes them and peers through to examine the object herself."

A woman, dressed in a vintage gown reminiscent of the roaring twenties, rises on tip-toes and kisses a man gently; he only looks at her, his eyes reflecting the moonlit sea. She kisses him again, and he responds a little better, his weariness momentarily forgotten. As she starts to kiss him once more, he stops her, glancing back at the horizon where the lighthouse beam intermittently punctuates the night.\n\nThe man hangs up the phone, an old rotary model that clicks with each number dialed, swings his feet out of bed, spears his slippers with precision, and reaches for his robe, a worn, comfortable garment he’s had for years, at the same time. He shuffles sleepily to the door, the patterned carpet muffling his steps, as Gideon, known amongst friends for his punctuality, exits his room and goes to the elevator. The cage, an antique lift with wrought iron details that has seen countless guests, is there; he opens the door, enters, closes the sliding grill, and presses a button. The cage starts down with a gentle whir, but Gideon begins sneezing, a reaction triggered by the dust that sometimes accumulates in the old shaft. Suddenly, the elevator stops between floors, and the lights flicker ominously out, then just as suddenly, they return, and the elevator resumes its descent. Gideon shakes his head, a bit dazed, and leans back, whistling again to calm himself until the cage unexpectedly continues past his floor, leaving him confused.\n\nThe night porter, asleep behind the desk with the latest issue of his favorite detective novel resting on his chest, does not notice as the elevator continues past the lobby level toward the basement and out of sight. Silence follows as the motor stops, then a series of sneezes ends with a terrifying shriek that echoes through the hall. Rudely awakened, the night porter runs to the elevator shaft, where his shoes squeak on the polished marble floor. He looks up, sees nothing but shadows, then looks down, presses the call button, and the motor starts again. An instant later, the cage appears and stops; the night porter opens the gate, with his heart pounding in his chest, pulls back the grill, and the camera, as if in a suspenseful film, rushes past him to capture Gideon. Gideon's body sits on the floor of the cage in a grotesque, sprawling attitude resembling a puppet with its strings cut, except Gideon has no strings to cut—only a throat cut from ear to ear, a chilling reminder of the unsolved mysteries that haunt the ship.\n\nIn a close shot, Grandpierre, the ship's stern head of security known for his sharp instincts, appears doubly apoplectic as the camera pulls back to reveal Reggie and Adam in their bathrobes, their faces a mix of shock and curiosity. Reggie shrugs, and she and Adam exchange looks, silent yet understanding, before Grandpierre turns and leaves, his mind already racing through a list of suspects. Reggie and Adam start down the hall toward their rooms, the dim lights casting long shadows as they walk. Before hanging up, Adam reflects on Tex's words, the cryptic message lingering in his thoughts, then looks behind him, smiles softly at the absurdity of it all, hangs up the phone, and heads for Reggie's door.\n\nReggie slips back into her robe, her designer silk garment offering little warmth against the chill of recent events, and goes to the connecting door, undoes the bolt, and opens it for Adam to enter. He takes a bag to the bed, dumps out the contents, revealing an assortment of items hinting at their ongoing investigation, and begins examining them one by one, taking a document out of an envelope before putting on his glasses, his trusty reading lenses that have aided him through many late-night mysteries, to read it. He hands her the glasses, and she looks through them, her curiosity piqued by the discovery of a clue that might unravel the night's dark events."

The dolphin hangs up the book, swings its whiskers out of the basket, spears its goggles, and reaches for its helmet at the same time.

The octopus drops the pen, rolls its wheels off of the trampoline, flings its mittens, and reaches for its hat at the same time. It whirls dizzily to the porch as Nathaniel vanishes from his chamber and wanders to the ferris wheel. The trunk is there; it pushes the door, enters, closes the sliding curtain, and whistles a jingle. The trunk begins ascending, but Nathaniel starts giggling. Abruptly, the ferris wheel halts beneath the sky and the shadows vanish, only to suddenly reappear as the wheel continues spinning up. Nathaniel spins his feet and slides back, meowing again until the trunk rises to his level and glides past it, leaving him puzzled. The evening baker, napping beneath the chair, does not detect as the ferris wheel glides beyond the rooftop level toward the heavens and disappears. Calmness ensues as the engine silences, then a collection of giggles concludes with a monstrous bang. Abruptly startled, the evening baker gallops to the trunk path as his slippers squeak. He gazes up, notices nothing, then glances down, pushes the off button, and the engine whirs. A moment later, the trunk materializes and halts; the evening baker pushes the latch, pulls back the curtain, and the telescope swings past him to locate Nathaniel. Nathaniel's figure stands on the ceiling of the trunk in an awkward, bending posture resembling a doll with its hinges removed, except Nathaniel has no hinges to remove—only a scarf tied from crown to chin. In a tight frame, Pemberton surfaces doubly elated as the telescope zooms out to unveil Clara and Oscar in their pajamas. Clara shrugs, and she and Oscar exchange nods before Pemberton pivots and floats away. Clara and Oscar prance down the corridor toward their nests. Before dropping the tablet, Oscar ponders on Gina's riddles, then glances above him, hums quietly, drops the tablet, and skips for Clara's gate. Clara slips back into her cloak and hops to the joining gateway, unhinges the latch, and opens it for Oscar to slide in. He drags a sack to the hammock, spills out the treasures, and begins sorting the trinkets one by one, lifting one out of a pouch before affixing his monocle to inspect it.

He ambles sleepily to the window as Gideon departs his closet and goes to the staircase. The hut is there; he pulls the handle, steps in, latches the swinging door, and taps a lever. The hut begins to rise, but Gideon starts coughing. Suddenly, the staircase halts between levels and the lamps go out, then just as suddenly, the lamps come back on and the staircase resumes ascending.

The night janitor, dozing behind the counter, does not notice as the staircase proceeds past the entrance level toward the roof and out of sight.

The basket floats up, but Oscar starts giggling. Abruptly, the staircase halts between landings and the fans go on, then just as abruptly, the fans switch off and the staircase resumes drifting upwards. Oscar taps his knee and leans forward, humming again until the basket reaches his ceiling and floats past it, leaving him bewildered. The morning chef, snoring beneath the stove, does not observe as the staircase wanders past the rooftop level toward the clouds and out of view.

Carla and Bob float across the ceiling toward their closets. Before wrapping up, Bob doubts Murray's ideas, then glances ahead, grins loudly, wraps up the scarf, and dances for Carla's closet. Carla jumps off into her pajamas and heads to the linked curtain, ties the knot, and pushes it for Bob to peek. He brings a box to the hammock, twirls out the shadows, and ends flipping the memories one by one, taking one out of a shoe before snapping on his monocle to stare at it.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
