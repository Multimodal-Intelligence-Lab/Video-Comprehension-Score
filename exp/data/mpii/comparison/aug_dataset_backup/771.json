Her eyes dart around quickly, and she soon spots his jacket lying haphazardly nearby. Taking a moment to compose herself, she inhales deeply before plunging beneath the surface of the water. Meanwhile, Noah is swimming away with determination, and deep underwater, Jackson is also swimming purposefully, using a torch to cast an illuminating path through the murky waters. He notices something intriguing below. Briefly surfacing for air, Jackson then plunges back underwater as the enormous ark relentlessly continues its journey, floating majestically towards the towering, snow-capped peak of Everest. In another part of the ark, Adriane activates the monitor, which displays an image of Jackson within the confines of the chamber, attempting to free Tenzen's entangled power drill. Jackson looks upwards and perceives a light cutting through the water, and then he spots Noah. Noah joins his father beneath the waves, and together, the light beam from his torch reveals the power drill hopelessly caught around the gears. Surfacing together, father and son emerge from the water while Kate remains motionless, gaping in stunned silence into the surrounding darkness as Tenzen, addressing his family, shakes his head in sheer disbelief. As the water level steadily rises, Nina glances upwards and catches sight of a giraffe visible through the grill in the ceiling above. Jackson, still submerged, battles to free the power drill while the ark collides against the side of a glacier, scraping anxiously against the mountain. Simultaneously, Laura and Lily are buffeted by the violent shaking as the ark draws nearer to Everest's imposing presence. Abruptly, the fumes from the hydraulic chamber are ceased. Triumphantly, Jackson wrenches the cable free, setting the gears in motion, and the gate begins to close. He releases the drill just as a part of the mountain shatters into pieces, threatening a potential collision. The ark fiercely strikes Everest, while those on the bridge witness an avalanche of snow cascading downwards, but the ark perseveres on its voyage, gradually moving away from Everest's daunting shadow. Noah resurfaces in the hydraulics chamber directly in front of Kate, and both mother and son duck beneath the water, rising together moments later. On the bridge and in the zoological bay, people listen intently, clinging to the pipes, and peer into the oppressive darkness. A torchlight beam subtly shines underwater, and then Jackson surfaces. Kate and Noah embrace tightly and lovingly, while Anheuser looks around at the assembly on the bridge, who are cheering and hugging one another in jubilant relief. Scotty warmly embraces Professor West, and as Kate and Noah continue to hug, Jackson shoots a glance across to Nina and Tenzen, who offer him a thumbs-up, which Jackson acknowledges with a nod. The group continues to tread water as the ark presses onward on its significant voyage, moving resolutely away from the world's highest mountain. In his private quarters, Adriane is engrossed in working diligently on a laptop, with Laura seated behind him, entirely absorbed in her book. Adriane removes his glasses, smiling warmly at her, while Laura closes her book, returning his smile, and they both rise to their feet. He approaches her, and they grow so close to kissing before he suddenly pulls back. She wraps her arms around his neck and kisses him more deeply and with greater passion. Meanwhile, Lily spots little Caesar, and Alec Karpov graciously hands Lily the dog. Jackson then moves towards Kate as the massive door slowly opens, revealing hundreds of people standing there, staring out in awe as daylight begins to flood the ark’s interior. Lily, cradling Caesar, and Noah, gripping his mother's hand, stand closely beside Kate, with Jackson standing protectively just behind her."

Meanwhile, Noah is swimming away, his movements swift and purposeful. Underwater, Jackson is also swimming, using a torch to illuminate his path through the murky depths. As he moves, the beam of light from his torch reveals something of interest. Jackson surfaces momentarily to catch his breath, then dives back underwater, all while the ark continues its journey towards Everest. In another part of the ark, Adriane turns on a monitor, which displays Jackson in a chamber where he is struggling to free Tenzen's power drill. Jackson glances upwards and notices a light, which turns out to be Noah. Noah then joins his father underwater, and together, their combined torch beams reveal the drill entangled in the gears. The father and son duo surface for air, while above water, Kate stands in shock, staring into the darkness. Tenzen, addressing his family, shakes his head in a gesture of resignation or disbelief. As the water level continues to rise, Nina looks up and catches sight of a giraffe through the grill in the ceiling. Meanwhile, Jackson is still underwater, working tirelessly to free the power drill as the ark makes contact with a glacier, causing it to scrape against the mountain. Laura and Lily are jostled by the impact, and as the ark nears Everest, the fumes from the hydraulic chamber are abruptly cut off.

Meanwhile, Noah, an experienced swimmer trained in rescue operations, swims away, and underwater, Jackson swims using a torch designed for deep-sea exploration for illumination, spotting something. Jackson surfaces momentarily to get a breath of air, then dives back underwater as the ark, a massive vessel built to survive extreme catastrophic events, floats towards Everest, the highest peak on Earth at 8,848 meters. Adriane turns on the monitor, part of the cutting-edge surveillance system, showing Jackson in the chamber struggling to free Tenzen's power drill, a vital tool for mechanical repairs. Jackson looks up and sees a light from Noah, and Noah joins his father underwater, where his torch beam shows the drill wrapped around the gears critical to the ark’s propulsion system. Father and son surface while Kate, overwhelmed by the situation, gapes and stares into the blackness as Tenzen addresses his family in a reassuring tone and shakes his head. The water level rises with alarming speed, and Nina glances up, seeing a giraffe beyond the grill in the ceiling, part of the ark’s onboard zoo designed to preserve animal species. Jackson is underwater as the ark thumps into a glacier, a testament to nature's harshness, attempting to pry the power drill free while the ark scrapes against the mountain, causing vibrations throughout the structure. Laura and Lily, both biologists who contributed to the ark’s design, are buffeted by the shake, and as the ark approaches Everest, the fume from the hydraulic chamber, crucial for maintaining the vessel's balance, is cut. Jackson wrenches the cable free, the gears start to turn, and the gate begins to close, preventing water from flooding the lower decks. He releases the drill, and part of the mountain breaks in pieces, a perilous cascade, as the ark moves ever closer to a collision. It strikes Everest, and those on the bridge see an avalanche of snow descend, but the ark continues on its voyage, built to withstand even the most formidable challenges, away from Everest. Noah surfaces on the hydraulics chamber in front of Kate, and mother and son duck under the water, then resurface. Those on the bridge and in the zoological bay, designed to protect diverse species, listen, hanging on the pipes, and look into the darkness.

The group is still treading water as the ark continues on its voyage away from the world's highest mountain. Adriane, a skilled technician, works on a laptop in his quarters with Laura sitting behind him reading a book about survival strategies. Adriane takes off his glasses, a common gesture of relief, and smiles, Laura closes the book and smiles, and they are both on their feet. He walks over to her, and they get so close to kiss before he makes to move away. She puts her arms around his neck and kisses him more intensely, reflecting their deep connection. Meanwhile, Lily spots little Caesar, a resilient dog who has survived the journey, and Alec Karpov, a zoologist responsible for the welfare of animals on board, hands Lily the dog. Jackson approaches Kate as the massive door opens, a symbol of new beginnings, and hundreds of people stand staring out as daylight starts to flood the interior, representing hope and a fresh start. Lily, holding Caesar dearly, and Noah, clutching his mom's hand tightly for comfort, stand beside Kate with Jackson directly behind her, ready for what comes next."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Jackson, underwater with a torch, spots something, and as the ark heads toward Everest, Adriane sees Jackson in the chamber freeing a drill. Noah joins him, revealing the drill tangled in gears. Meanwhile, rising water levels and the ark's impact with the glacier add tension. Jackson frees the cable, enabling the gates to close and preventing collision with Everest. The ark strikes Everest, triggering an avalanche, but continues its journey. Noah and Kate reunite, while joy spreads among those on the bridge. Jackson nods to Nina and Tenzen's thumbs up. In Adriane's quarters, a tender moment between him and Laura unfolds. Amid these reunions, the ark's massive door opens, welcoming daylight. Together, Lily, holding Caesar, Noah, and Kate stand, with Jackson behind them."
