The wagon driver and the Foreman are attempting to raise the wagon off the crushed individual, but it is too weighty, and the soil is too pliable. Valjean, Javert, and Javert's aide all hasten to assist, but they cannot obtain a proper grip in the squishy earth. Fauchelevent shrieks as the wagon gradually descends in the muck. He hurls himself under the wagon at this higher end and steadies himself to elevate it from underneath. At one end, the wheels of the wagon have ceased descending because the terrain is firmer here. Valjean proceeds to aid Fauchelevent. Valjean maintains Javert's stare, daring him to speak further. Javert is not yet assured enough to proceed. Fantine advances down the stairs, striving to disregard the mariners. They notice Fantine, misjudging her for a harlot. The mariners then see harlots begin to emerge from the dimness of depot entrances. The few men in the avenue select their harlots and vanish by the conclusion of the refrain. A man vending dentures stands by his wagon and we hear snippets of his sales pitch. Fantine descends the stairs with cropped hair, ridiculed by the voices of the harlots on either side. Fantine moves towards the tooth man. A procurer and the chief harlot observe her advancement as the organ-grinder churns out the melody. Fantine glances towards the tooth man and the chief harlot. The procurer shoves her down. She grasps Fantine's cheeks and forces open her mouth to examine her teeth. She opens her mouth, and the pincers enter as everyone gathers around to observe.

Fantine gazes up, a rivulet of blood in one corner of her mouth. The harlots cluster around her, hands reaching out to draw her into their world.

Both Valjean and Javert hastily rush out together, crossing the expanse of the factory yard and moving quickly down the muddy, uneven track that lies beyond, only to uncover that a cart, heavily loaded with its burdens, has unfortunately tipped over onto the cart driver, Fauchelevent. Fauchelevent is a worker who had been seen earlier, taking a rest on a crate. The unfortunate cart driver, along with the Foreman, are desperately struggling to lift the massive cart off the poor, crushed man beneath, but their efforts prove futile as the cart remains too heavy to budge and the ground remains frustratingly too soft to provide any support. Valjean, along with Javert and Javert's assistant, all rush forward to offer their help, but they find themselves unable to gain a sufficient grip on the spongy, unstable ground. Fauchelevent cries out in agony as the weight of the cart slowly causes it to sink deeper into the mud. In a bold attempt, he throws himself beneath the cart at the higher end and braces himself, attempting to lift it from underneath. At one end, the wheels of the cart have ceased their sinking motion due to the ground being firmer in that particular spot. Valjean steps in to assist Fauchelevent further.

Both Valjean and Javert, in a hastened manner, rush out together, their feet moving briskly across the broad expanse of the factory yard. They continue quickly down the muddy, uneven track that lies just beyond the yard. It is here, upon this treacherous track, that they uncover a tragic scene: a cart, heavily loaded with its burdens, has unfortunately tipped over onto the cart driver, Fauchelevent. Fauchelevent, a worker who had been observed earlier taking a rest on a crate, is now in a dire predicament. The unfortunate cart driver, who is caught beneath the massive weight of the cart, along with the Foreman, are both desperately struggling with all their might to lift the overwhelming mass off the poor, crushed man beneath it. However, their efforts prove to be utterly futile, as the cart remains too heavy for them to budge, and the ground underneath them remains frustratingly soft, failing to provide any support. Valjean, accompanied by both Javert and Javert's assistant, rushes forward with the intent to offer their assistance, but they find themselves similarly challenged. The spongy and unstable ground makes it nearly impossible for them to gain a sufficient grip. As Fauchelevent cries out in agony, the weight of the cart slowly causes it to sink even deeper into the mud. In a bold and daring attempt, Fauchelevent throws himself beneath the cart at the higher end and braces himself, exerting all his strength as he attempts to lift it from underneath. At one end, the wheels of the cart have fortunately ceased their sinking motion, thanks to the ground being somewhat firmer in that particular spot. Valjean steps in, determined to assist Fauchelevent even further. He holds Javert's gaze with intensity, daring him to voice any further remarks. Javert, however, is not yet confident enough to assert more at this moment. Meanwhile, Fantine cautiously descends the steps, doing her utmost to ignore the sailors who mistakenly identify her as a whore. In the sailors' line of sight, though they remain unaware, actual whores begin to emerge from the shadowy recesses of the warehouse doorways. As the chorus concludes, the few men lingering in the street select their whores and quickly vanish with them. Nearby, there is a man selling dentures, standing beside his cart, and fragments of his lively sales pitch float through the air, catching the attention of passersby. Fantine, now with her hair cut short, walks down the steps, enduring the scorn and mockery from the voices of whores on either side of her path. She makes her way purposefully towards the tooth man. Observing her progress are a pimp and the head whore, both watching intently while an organ-grinder churns out music in the background. Fantine gazes towards both the tooth man and the head whore. Suddenly, in an unexpected and forceful action, the pimp pushes her down. The head whore seizes Fantine's cheeks with a firm grip, forcefully opening her mouth to inspect her teeth. As her mouth opens wide, pincers are inserted, and a crowd of onlookers gathers around, watching the scene with rapt attention. Fantine lets out a scream, filled with pain, as her first tooth is extracted from her mouth. The pimp prowls among the whores, his eyes inspecting them to ensure they are all fit for business. His gaze and presence advance toward Fantine. Fantine looks up, with a small trickle of blood visibly seen at one corner of her mouth. The whores cluster around her, with their hands reaching out in an attempt to draw her into their world. On the decaying warship nearby, more whores emerge from the gaps in the hull, joining in to sing the chorus.

The whores, under the commanding orders of the head whore, perform for Fantine's benefit, all the while leading her towards the hulk. The haunting sound of whore songs echoes all around, from the warehouse doorways, on top of the ship's spars, winding around the figureheads, and emanating from the rotting ship itself. The pimp, with a commanding presence about him, leads the captain down the path lined with whores to where Fantine stands, clothed in a dirty, disheveled white dress."

Meanwhile, Valjean and Javert swiftly exit the factory yard, their pace quickening as they traverse the muddy track beyond. Their destination comes into view: a scene of distress where a heavily laden cart has toppled, pinning the cart driver, Fauchelevent, the very worker who was previously seen taking a restful pause on a crate. The cart driver, alongside the Foreman, is desperately attempting to lift the oppressive weight of the cart off the crushed man, but their efforts are thwarted by its enormous weight and the softness of the ground beneath them. In a bid to assist, Valjean, Javert, and Javert's assistant all rush forward, their intent clear, yet they find themselves struggling, unable to gain the necessary leverage on the spongy earth. Fauchelevent lets out a piercing scream, a sound filled with agony and urgency, as the cart continues its slow descent into the mud. In a bold and desperate maneuver, he throws himself under the higher end of the cart, positioning his body to brace and lift it from beneath. Fortunately, at this end, the wheels have ceased their sinking progression, owing to the harder ground in that area. Valjean moves with determination to assist Fauchelevent, his actions deliberate and resolute. As he does so, he locks eyes with Javert, his gaze unwavering and challenging, daring Javert to voice any further thoughts. However, Javert, not yet possessing the confidence to articulate more, remains silent. Meanwhile, Fantine makes her way down the steps, her focus intent on ignoring the leering sailors nearby. The sailors, however, spot Fantine and, in their misguided assumptions, mistake her for a whore. Soon after, actual whores begin to emerge from the obscurity of warehouse doorways, casting shadows in the dim light. The men dotted along the street make their choices among the whores and gradually vanish from sight by the end of the chorus. Nearby, a man peddling dentures stands beside his cart, his sales pitch echoing intermittently in the background. As Fantine descends the steps, her once flowing hair now cropped short, she endures the mocking jabs of the whores flanking either side of her path. Resolute, she heads toward the tooth man, while the pimp and the head whore observe her progress, the organ-grinder's music providing a grim soundtrack to the scene. Fantine's gaze shifts towards both the tooth man and the head whore, her apprehension palpable. Abruptly, the pimp shoves her down with force, and in a humiliating display, the head whore seizes Fantine's cheeks, prying open her mouth to scrutinize her teeth. With her mouth forcibly opened, the pincers are inserted, drawing a crowd as onlookers gather to witness the grim spectacle. Fantine's scream pierces the air as the first tooth is pulled from her mouth. As this happens, the pimp moves among the whores, conducting his inspection to ensure they are all ready for business, eventually closing in on Fantine. Fantine glances upward, the metallic taste of blood evident from the trickle pooling at the corner of her mouth. The whores surround her, their hands reaching out, pulling her into their world of despair. On a decaying warship nearby, additional whores appear from the gaps in the hull, their voices joining in song for the chorus. One of the whores, identified as Whore 3, bites into her fingertip, using the blood as makeshift rouge on Fantine's cheeks. The whores, under the head whore's direction, perform theatrically for Fantine's benefit, guiding her towards the derelict hulk. Meanwhile, whores sing from multiple vantage points: the shadows of warehouse doorways, the spars of ships, and even the figureheads, their bodies writhing atop the rotting vessel, their voices a haunting chorus. The pimp leads a captain through the throng of whores towards Fantine, who stands amidst them wearing a stained and tattered white dress."

Valjean and Javert hurry out across the factory yard, a bustling place of industrial activity, and down the muddy track beyond to discover a heavily laden cart has toppled onto the cart driver, Fauchelevent, known in the town for his hardworking nature. The cart driver and the Foreman, who oversees all factory operations, are trying to lift the cart off the crushed man, but it is too heavy, and the ground is too soft due to recent rains. Valjean, who possesses exceptional strength, Javert, and Javert's assistant, a young officer learning the ropes, all hurry to help, but they cannot get a proper purchase in the spongy ground. Fauchelevent screams as the cart slowly sinks in the mud, threatening his life. He throws himself under the cart at this higher end and braces himself to lift it from beneath, demonstrating his resolve to live. At one end, the wheels of the cart have stopped sinking because the ground is harder here, likely supported by buried stones. Valjean goes to help Fauchelevent with an air of determination. Valjean holds Javert's gaze, challenging him to say more, as they share a complicated past. Javert is not yet confident enough to continue, still processing the intense situation. Fantine, who has recently fallen on hard times, presses on down the steps, trying to ignore the sailors, known for their rowdy behavior. They spot Fantine, mistaking her for a whore, a common occurrence for women in her desperate position. The sailors then see whores start to appear from the shadows of warehouse doorways, dark and hidden from the bustling streets. The few men in the street choose their whores and disappear by the end of the chorus, indicating the transactional nature of the scene. A man selling dentures, crucial for those who have lost teeth in an era before modern dentistry, stands by his cart and we hear fragments of his sales pitch. Fantine walks down the steps with short hair, having sold her long locks for money, mocked by the voices of the whores on either side. Fantine heads to the tooth man, hoping to make money by selling her teeth. A pimp, who controls the local sex trade, and the head whore, respected among her peers, watch her progress as the organ-grinder, a common street performer, grinds out the music. Fantine looks towards the tooth man and the head whore, uncertain about her future. The pimp pushes her down, asserting his dominance. She grabs Fantine's cheeks and forces open her mouth to inspect her teeth, checking their value. She opens her mouth, and the pincers go in as everyone gathers round to watch, enthralled by the grim spectacle. Fantine screams as the first tooth is removed, a painful reminder of her desperate situation. The pimp is passing among the whores, checking that they are all fit for business, maintaining control over his enterprise. He moves in on Fantine. Fantine looks up, a trickle of blood in one corner of her mouth, a testament to her recent ordeal. The whores cluster around her, hands reaching out to draw her into their world, where survival means losing one's dignity. On the rotting warship, a derelict symbol of forgotten glory, more whores appear out of the gaps of the hull to sing the chorus, their voices echoing the despair of their lives. Whore 3 bites her fingertip and applies her blood as rouge to Fantine's cheeks, a gesture of initiation. The whores perform for the benefit of Fantine on the orders of the head whore, as the head whore leads her towards the hulk, a large abandoned ship beached on the shore. Whores sing from the warehouse doorways, from on top of the spars of the ships, writhing around figureheads, wooden carvings often seen on the prow of ships, and from the rotting ship. The pimp leads the captain, a man of power and authority, down the middle of the whores to Fantine who wears a filthy white dress, a remnant of her lost innocence."

He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Despite their attempts, the cart sinks into the mud, and Valjean aids Fauchelevent, challenging Javert with his determination. Meanwhile, Fantine, mistaken for a prostitute, descends stairs and confronts mockery from onlooking sailors and whores. She approaches a tooth vendor, is overpowered by a pimp, and forcibly has a tooth removed amid jeering spectators. The whores surround Fantine, drawing her into their world while performing suggestively. Fantine, now with blood at the corner of her mouth, is led by the head whore towards a decaying warship as the chorus of whores sings around her."
