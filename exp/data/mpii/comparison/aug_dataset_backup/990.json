She's sitting on a plush sofa, a dressing gown over her nightdress, reading an old classic novel. Benjamin, in his cozy dressing gown, heads towards the kitchen, then turns back to her. He goes through to the kitchen, equipped with retro appliances, and Elizabeth stares after him, closes the fashion magazine she was reading, and gets to her feet. She peers into the kitchen, where Benjamin is busy making the tea with a calming routine, and walks in as Benjamin looks up. Elizabeth opens her mouth as if about to say something meaningful. Benjamin goes over to her worktop, which is cluttered with spices and teas, and picks up two intricately designed Russian tea glasses and their holders, puts the fly-ridden honey pot down, and carries the tea glasses and the teapot over to a small rustic table. Elizabeth takes a seat as Benjamin pours the tea, fragrant with hints of bergamot. Benjamin sits down, and they eye each other across the table, their expressions softening. Elizabeth wags her forefinger, gently reminding him of an inside joke, and Benjamin checks on the teapot. Elizabeth looks a little awkward as he pours her a cup, which she sips thoughtfully, savoring the warmth. They share a smile, sip their tea, and both smile again, feeling a quiet connection.

He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
