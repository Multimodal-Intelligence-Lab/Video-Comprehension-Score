Cole, surprised, takes a small step forward. Cole takes a step. Malcolm opens his eyes with the intensity of someone searching for answers. He looks right at Cole. Cole takes another step. The next step will put him at the chair, which is covered in a richly woven fabric from the historic mills of the region. Malcolm lowers his fingers from his temple, a gesture reminiscent of a well-practiced meditation technique. Malcolm smiles, a warm expression often noted by his colleagues as his most disarming trait. Malcolm looks to Cole's arm. Cole is wearing a large silver watch from his grandfather, a keepsake of a bygone era, and it swims on his thin wrist. Malcolm closes his eyes, deep in thought. Cole takes a step back. Malcolm lowers his hands, surprised by the sudden retreat. Malcolm puts his fingers to his temple, a habit he developed during his years of intense study. He gazes at Cole's school uniform, which bears the emblem of an esteemed private institution known for its rigorous academics. Cole takes a slow step back. Cole answers by taking a small step back. Malcolm looks down at Cole's feet, encased in polished shoes that reflect his school’s strict dress code. Cole is very still. Malcolm takes his time before speaking. He just stares with the patience of someone accustomed to quiet observation. Cole quietly takes a step back into the doorway of the other room. Cole's tiny figure steps away. Malcolm hurriedly enters a spacious, dimly-lit Italian restaurant that boasts a menu inspired by traditional Tuscan recipes. He finds Anna. Anna sits alone at a corner table. A small piece of cake with a candle in it sits untouched, a solemn reminder of her birthday. Anna stirs sugar in her coffee, a blend sourced from a small cooperative in Colombia, as Malcolm sits in the seat across from her. Anna quietly takes a sip from her coffee. She glances across the table, then looks down, hiding her feelings in a moment of introspection. Malcolm demonstrates by holding up his arm to shield his face, echoing a defensive stance he once saw in a classic film. Malcolm stops walking, absorbing the moment. The words hit him hard. He stares at Cole. Cole is surprised. Cole is playing behind the couch, his favorite spot since it feels like a hidden fortress. All we see is the top of his head. Every now and then we get glimpses of things Cole is playing with peeking over the back of the couch, but we can't quite make out what he's doing with his eclectic collection of toys. The top of Cole's head stops moving. Cole has become very still. He looks right at Malcolm. Malcolm watches him carefully. He rises and grabs his coat, an overcoat made of fine wool that was a gift from a dear friend. Cole's brow furrows as he thinks about it carefully, contemplating the weight of his choices. Malcolm turns back to Cole. Cole's sad eyes stare up at Malcolm, filled with the innocence and curiosity of youth. The surface of Malcolm's desk is covered with open texts, a testament to his lifelong passion for learning. Malcolm pours over a thick reference book, a volume on human psychology, critical to his profession. He circles a phrase, finding relevance in its insights. His face turns up to the ceiling, as if seeking guidance from above. Malcolm gets up and moves closer to their voices as he stretches his legs, a necessary pause after hours of sitting. Malcolm smiles at Anna, his expression softening in her presence. Malcolm slowly stops smiling as a realization dawns on him. Malcolm shakes his head in disbelief, grappling with unexpected news. Mr. Cunningham turns and stares at his class of eight and nine-year-old private school students, who are known for their inquisitive natures. Cole rests his chin on his desk and watches the class with big eyes, his mind racing with questions.

He's just about to ask his own question when he spots a toe go down. Mr. Cunningham frowns, puzzled to see who it is."

          "description": "She dances to the couch on the far side of the kitchen island. She opens her ears wide. Jamie, startled, leaps a giant hop backward. Jamie leaps a hop. Taylor shuts her ears. She gazes left at Jamie. Jamie leaps another hop. The following hop will land her at the couch. Taylor lifts her toes from her knee. Taylor frowns. Taylor gazes at Jamie's hat. Jamie is wearing a tiny red scarf. It climbs on her broad neck. Taylor shuts her ears. Jamie leaps a hop forward. Taylor lifts her knees amazed. Taylor places her toes on her knee. She squints at Jamie's raincoat. Jamie advances slowly forward. Jamie responds by leaping a tiny hop forward. Taylor gazes up at Jamie's fingers. Jamie is extremely fluid. Taylor speeds up before singing. She simply blinks. Jamie slowly leaps a tiny hop forward into the backyard of the other space. Jamie's huge shadow hops ahead. Taylor sluggishly exits a cramped, brightly-lit French diner. She loses Alex. Alex stands crowded at a side booth. A tall glass of juice with a flower in it stands moved. Alex shakes pepper in her tea as Taylor stands in the spot by her feet. Alex loudly takes a gulp from her tea. She peers under the booth, then gazes up. Taylor whispers by lifting down her legs to show her feet. Taylor keeps laughing. The sounds miss her lightly. She blinks at Jamie. Jamie is amazed. Jamie is swimming below the table. All you notice are the tips of her fingers. Occasionally, you spot hints of objects Jamie is swimming with sneaking under the top of the table, but you can't quite figure out what she's swimming. The bottom of Jamie's fingers begin moving. Jamie has grown extremely fluid. She gazes left at Taylor. Taylor ignores her absently. She sits and drops her shoes. Jamie's lips curl as she talks about her absently. Taylor forgets left about Jamie. Jamie's joyful hands wave down at Taylor. The ceiling of Taylor's shelf is emptied with closed pictures. Taylor stares over a light newspaper article. She squares a question. Her feet turn down to the floor. Taylor sits down and wanders farther from their music as she flexes her arms. Taylor frowns at Alex. Taylor quickly starts frowning. Taylor nods her toes in agreement. Ms. Lee faces and blinks at her staff of seven and ten-year-old public gymnastic athletes. Jamie lifts her foot on her shelf and ignores the staff with tiny hands. George Lee gazes under the staff of open faces. She's nowhere near to ask her own answer when she spots a foot go down. Ms. Lee gazes amazed to spot who it was."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

          "description": "Malcolm invites Cole to sit on the other side of the coffee table, closing his eyes momentarily. Cole hesitates but eventually steps forward, wearing a large silver watch. Malcolm observes Cole's school uniform as Cole steps back, surprised by Malcolm’s gaze. In a dimly-lit Italian restaurant, Malcolm joins Anna at a corner table where a cake with a candle sits. As they sit in silence, with Anna stirring her coffee, Malcolm shields his face and stops, impacted by words that seem to affect him deeply. Cole, playing behind a couch, becomes still and makes eye contact with Malcolm, who watches him intently. Malcolm, engrossed in his work with books spread over his desk, interacts with Cole again, noting Cole's thoughtful and sad expressions. In a classroom setting, Mr. Cunningham is surprised when Cole raises his hand, standing out among his classmates."
