In a rage, SMEAGOL pounces at FRODO, who topples backward, perilously near to the brink of the chasm, as GOLLUM plummets over FRODO's physique and descends to the base of the gorge. FRODO, overwhelmed with fatigue, totters down the sheer steps of CIRITH UNGOL, full of regret at his handling of SAM, and collapses to his knees. FRODO lands on soft verdant turf and observes sunlit visions of woods. In a blurry vision, GALADRIEL strides towards him, barefoot, and leans down, extending her hand. For a moment, FRODO gazes at her, conflicted, not wishing to proceed and wanting to recline, but he knows what he must do. FRODO is raised to his feet, once more in the dim, rank passageways of the pass of CIRITH UNGOL, and he proceeds. Blazing projectiles pour down on the metropolis as GROND crashes against the MINAS TIRITH gate, sending a tremor through the city. GANDALF, on SHADOWFAX, commands several hundred Gondorian infantry through the streets. PIPPIN observes as FARAMIR's insensate form is borne on a litter by DENETHOR's attendants, led by DENETHOR. It has the feel of a funeral as an iron door squeals open and FARAMIR's cortege enters a broad arched hall where lamp light casts large silhouettes upon the veiled walls. Rank after rank of marble crypts are discernible in the faint light, with each tomb having a reposed figure sculpted in stone, hands clasped. DENETHOR addresses his attendants. The gate shatters with a boom under GROND's colossal heft. Behind the gates, the Gondorian infantry are apprehensive. GANDALF rallies the line of archers as they await in front of the grand doors, their bravery faltering with each crash. Abruptly, the fearsome head juts into MINAS TIRITH. Within seconds, the gate is broken, and immense cave trolls enter into the first circle of MINAS TIRITH under the archway that no adversary had ever traversed. Rows of marksmen discharge a volley of arrows, but the trolls persist in battering the foot soldiers with their colossal clubs. Orcs flood through the aperture, and the intense, close-quarters fight spills into infernos and charred, smoking structures. With a bellow, GANDALF leads a counteroffensive on SHADOWFAX, followed by several hundred Gondorian infantry, as thousands of orcs flood in through the city gates, and the first tier is breached. FRODO lurches through the pass of CIRITH UNGOL, the burden of the ring pulling at his neck. He advances, driven by a bleak determination, and starts ascending a stone stairway that climbs through a narrow defile."

Frodo, a hobbit on a perilous quest to destroy the Ring in the fires of Mount Doom, looks at Sméagol in shock and gets to his feet, while Sméagol, torn between his dual personalities, stares at Frodo in disbelief. In a fury, Sméagol lunges at Frodo, who falls backwards, dangerously close to the edge of the precipice, as Gollum tumbles over Frodo's body and falls to the bottom of the ravine in the treacherous landscape of Mordor. Frodo, overcome with exhaustion from the journey that began in the peaceful Shire, stumbles down the steep stairs of Cirith Ungol, a pass guarded by the deadly giant spider Shelob, full of remorse at his treatment of Sam, his loyal companion and friend. Frodo falls to his knees and lands on soft green grass, seeing sun-drenched images of trees, a stark contrast to the barren lands he has traversed. In a hazy image, Galadriel, the Elven Lady of Lothlórien renowned for her wisdom and beauty, walks towards him, barefoot, and leans down, offering her hand. For a beat, Frodo stares at her, torn, not wanting to go on and wanting to lie down, but he knows what he must do, spurred by the duty to save Middle-earth. Frodo is lifted to his feet, once again in the dark, rank tunnels of the pass of Cirith Ungol, and he goes on. Flaming missiles rain down on the city of Minas Tirith, the capital of Gondor, as Grond, the massive battering ram named after Morgoth's hammer, thuds against the Minas Tirith gate, sending a vibration through the city. Gandalf, the wise and powerful wizard also known as Mithrandir, on Shadowfax, the lord of all horses gifted with incredible speed, leads several hundred Gondorian foot soldiers down through the streets. Pippin, a young hobbit caught in the war for Middle-earth, watches as Faramir's unconscious body is carried on a stretcher by Denethor's servants, led by Denethor, the Steward of Gondor who has been driven to madness. It has the atmosphere of a funeral as an iron door creaks open and Faramir's procession enters a wide vaulted chamber where lantern light throws great shadows upon the shrouded walls. Row upon row of marble tombs in the Hallows are visible in the dim light, with each tomb having a sleeping form carved in stone, hands folded in an eternal rest. Denethor turns to his servants. The gate splinters with a boom under Grond's mighty weight. Behind the gates, the Gondorian foot soldiers are fearful. Gandalf rallies the line of bowmen as they wait in front of the great doors, their courage wavering with each crashing. Suddenly, the fearsome head of Grond protrudes into Minas Tirith. Within moments, the gate is smashed, and giant cave trolls, bred for war by Sauron, enter into the first circle of Minas Tirith under the archway that no enemy had ever passed. Rows of archers fire off a volley of arrows, but the trolls, resistant to injury owing to their thick skin, continue to smash the foot soldiers with their giant clubs. Orcs, the twisted servants of Sauron, swarm through the opening, and the pitched, hand-to-hand battle spills into flames and blackened, smouldering buildings. With a roar, Gandalf leads a counterattack on Shadowfax, followed by several hundred Gondorian foot soldiers, as thousands of orcs swarm in through the city gates, and the first level is breached. Frodo staggers through the pass of Cirith Ungol, the weight of the ring dragging at his neck like an anchor of doom. He moves forward, fueled by a grim resolve, and starts climbing a stone staircase that climbs through a narrow pass leading to the dreaded land of Mordor, where his quest will finally end."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

GOLLUM tumbles over him and falls into a ravine. Exhausted, FRODO stumbles down CIRITH UNGOL's steep stairs, remorseful about SAM, and collapses on soft grass. He sees GALADRIEL approaching in a hazy vision, who offers her hand. FRODO, torn but resolved, rises back in the dark tunnels of CIRITH UNGOL and continues his journey. Meanwhile, MINAS TIRITH is under siege. GANDALF, on SHADOWFAX, leads soldiers as GROND pounds the gate, causing fear among the defenders. PIPPIN watches FARAMIR, carried unconscious by DENETHOR's servants into a funereal chamber of marble tombs. The gate finally splinters, and cave trolls breach MINAS TIRITH, followed by orcs. GANDALF and the troops launch a counterattack, but the city’s first level is overrun. FRODO, burdened by the ring, struggles through CIRITH UNGOL, climbing a stone staircase with grim determination."
