          "description": "The camera, with a deliberate and gradual motion, begins to pull back. It slowly unveils the scene, starting with the sight of a butcher knife that is unmistakably stained with blood and tightly gripped in his hand. Continuing its backward movement, the camera captures more of the developing situation as it unfolds. Standing at the scene are Mother and Father, looking directly toward the viewpoint of the camera, their expressions initially masked with puzzlement that soon evolve into a gradually intensifying sense of horror. The camera's lens cranes upwards, moving past the figures of his parents, who remain fixed in their positions. It traces upwards from their figures to the neighborâ€™s house, eventually reaching a high-angle perspective that offers a view of the entire neighborhood. In the background, the ominous and escalating sounds of police sirens echo as they begin to resonate from a distance. \n\nIn the enveloping darkness, a pair of headlights emerge. They cut through the rain that is steadily pouring down on a lonely stretch of highway. It becomes clear that a station wagon is moving along, emitting a quiet hissing sound as it travels across the slick, wet surface of the road. Inside the vehicle, seated in the passenger seat next to her is Sam Loomis, a clinical psychiatrist by profession. Marion, a woman appearing to be in her thirties, is at the wheel, driving. Sam, a rugged and tough-looking man in his forties, is deeply absorbed in leafing through the pages of a manila folder, his focus intense. He steals a glance over at Marion, who is lighting up a cigarette. She then vigorously shoves the matches back into their pack and carelessly tosses it onto the dashboard, an action that captures Loomis's attention as he continues to stare at the cigarette pack. Both of them look forward, gazing intently down the road. \n\nThere appears a male patient standing by the roadside, an untamed-looking man appearing to be in his sixties, dressed in a stark white gown, with his intense gaze fixed on the station wagon. Marion reacts by slowly decelerating the car and carefully maneuvering it to the roadside. Loomis makes his exit quickly, jumping out of the car with urgency. Through the windshield, we observe Loomis as he races toward the patient, pausing to converse with him briefly before he hurries back. The camera transitions, smoothly following Laurie as she walks along a residential street. She is cradling a large bundle of school books in her arms, carrying them carefully as she moves. \n\nAcross an adjacent backyard, Tommy Doyle, an eight-year-old boy with tousled brown hair and notably bright blue eyes, rushes toward her, holding his own books. He eventually catches up to her, and together, they continue their walk side by side along the street. Their path leads them to the front of the old, two-story Myers house, which sits set back from the street. Laurie raises a key in her hand, indicating her intention. She walks through the front gate and makes her way toward the porch, eventually reaching the front entrance. There, she bends down, lifting the welcome mat, and discreetly places the key underneath it. Through a window covered in frost, we catch a glimpse of Laurie as she bends over the welcome mat. Unexpectedly, a dark silhouette, the outline of a man, leans forward, intensely observing her actions. As Laurie returns to join Tommy at the street, the shadowy figure continues to watch before gradually retreating back into the unseen interior of the house. \n\nLaurie and Tommy resume their walk down the street. Suddenly, Tommy breaks away from their stride and dashes across the street. We continue to watch Laurie, who walks into the distance, disappearing down the street. Near the camera, a dark shape enters the frame, closely scrutinizing Laurie as she eventually vanishes around the corner. Loomis reaches his car, unlocking it and getting inside. He starts the engine and then drives away from the sanitarium. Eyes fixed on his departure, Wynn watches him leave, before hurrying back into the building. Laurie finds herself seated quietly at the back of a classroom filled with high school students, lost in thought."

          "description": "The scene begins with the camera slowly pulling back to unveil a blood-stained butcher knife held firmly in his hand. As it continues to pull back, we're introduced to a growing panorama where Mother and Father are seen standing still, their eyes locked onto the point of view. Initially, their expressions are marked by puzzlement, which gradually transforms into a slow, dawning horror as they continue to stare. The camera tilts upwards, shifting past the parents who remain standing motionless, and travels further up from the neighbor's house. It ascends to a high vantage point, capturing an expansive view of the entire neighborhood below. Meanwhile, in the distance, the faint yet distinct sounds of police sirens begin to rise, adding an ominous layer to the unfolding scene. As night envelops a lonely stretch of highway, two headlights pierce through the darkness, backlighting the relentless rain that cascades down. The camera reveals a station wagon moving steadily along the slick, wet road surface. Inside the vehicle, seated in the passenger seat, is Sam Loomis, a clinical psychiatrist marked by his tough demeanor, deep into his forties. Next to him, gripping the steering wheel, is Marion, a thirty-year-old who maneuvers the car with practiced focus. Loomis, absorbed in thought, methodically flips through the pages of a manila folder resting on his lap. As Marion drives, she momentarily shifts her attention to light a cigarette. Expertly, she strikes the match, ignites the tobacco, and then casually shoves the matches back into their pack, tossing it with a swift motion onto the dashboard where it lands with a soft thud. Loomis's gaze momentarily fixes on the tossed cigarette pack before both their attentions are drawn to the road ahead. There, by the roadside, stands a male patient, a wild-looking man in his sixties wearing a stark white gown. His eyes are fixed intently on the advancing station wagon. Observing this, Marion intuitively eases her foot off the accelerator, decelerating the vehicle and carefully maneuvering it to a halt on the roadside. Responding with urgency, Loomis springs out of the car. Through the windshield, we witness Loomis dashing over to the patient, engaging in a brief exchange of words before hastily returning to the vehicle. As the camera transitions to Laurie, it follows her as she traverses a tranquil residential street, her arms encumbered by an unwieldy bundle of school books. Simultaneously, across a backyard, young Tommy Doyleâ€”an eight-year-old boy characterized by his tousled brown hair and striking blue eyesâ€”can be seen sprinting energetically, his own books clutched tightly to his chest. He catches up to Laurie, and together, they continue their walk along the street. Their journey leads them to the front of the old, imposing two-story Myers house, which is set back discreetly from the street. Laurie pauses to hold up a key, scrutinizing it momentarily, before proceeding through the front gate and beginning her ascent towards the porch. Her steps are deliberate as she moves up the front porch, bends down to lift the welcome mat, and carefully places the key underneath. Peering in through a frosted window, we observe Laurie in the act of bending over the mat. Suddenly, a dark shape materializes, the indistinct outline of a man who leans forward silently, his gaze trained intently on her actions. As Laurie makes her way back to Tommy at the street, the figure silently retreats, blending back into the recesses of the house's interior. Laurie and Tommy resume their walk along the street, moving in tandem until Tommy breaks stride, darting across the street with youthful exuberance. Laurie continues walking, her form growing smaller as she ventures down the street, eventually disappearing in the distance. Close to the camera, the dark shape re-emerges into the frame, his eyes locked on Laurie as she rounds the corner and vanishes from sight. Meanwhile, Loomis reaches a car, smoothly unlocking it with practiced efficiency. He slides into the driver's seat, starts the engine with a decisive turn of the key, and drives away from the sanitarium. From a window, a figure identified as Wynn watches Loomis's departure, and with a quick turn, hurries back inside the building. The scene transitions to reveal Laurie seated quietly at the back of a classroom filled with high school students, her presence a calm contrast to the earlier tension."

Two headlights appear in the darkness, backlighting the rain that pours down on a lonely strip of highway, infamous for numerous late-night accidents due to poor visibility. A station wagon hisses along the wet road surface. Next to her in the passenger seat is Sam Loomis, a clinical psychiatrist renowned for his controversial theories on criminal psychology. Marion, 30, drives. He is a tough-looking man in his forties who flips through pages in a manila folder containing notes on a patient he has been tracking for years. Loomis glances at Marion as she lights a cigarette from a brand recently banned in several states for health violations. She shoves the matches into the pack and tosses it on the dashboard. Loomis stares at the cigarette pack, which is cluttered with warning labels. They look up ahead.

Across a backyard Tommy Doyle, an eight-year-old boy with tousled brown hair and bright blue eyes, known for his love of horror stories, comes running with his books. He catches up with her, and they walk along down the street widely regarded as the safest in town. They walk up to the front of the old, two-story Myers house, rumored among locals to be haunted, set back from the street. Laurie holds up a key which she had collected from the real estate agent earlier that morning. Laurie walks through the front gate and starts up toward the porch. Laurie strolls up to the front porch. She bends down, lifts the welcome mat, and places the key under it. Through a frost window, which distorts the view, we see Laurie bending over the welcome mat.

As she walks back to Tommy at the street, the shape moves to watch them, then fades back into the interior of the house. Laurie and Tommy continue walking down the street. Tommy breaks stride and runs across the street toward his house, eager to tell his mother about his day. We see Laurie walking off down the street in the distance. Close to camera, the dark shape moves into frame, watching Laurie disappear around the corner. Loomis reaches a car and unlocks it, his trusty Ford sedan that has been with him for years. Loomis gets in the car. Loomis starts up the car and pulls away from the sanitarium known for its high-security measures. Wynn, the administrator of the institution and an old acquaintance of Loomis, watches him go, then hurries back into the building. Laurie sits at the back of a classroom of high school students, who are engrossed in a lecture about Shakespeare's tragic heroes."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby cafÃ©, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

          "description": "The camera reveals a blood-stained butcher knife, then pulls back to show Mother and Father in growing horror, as police sirens rise in the distance. On a rainy highway, Marion drives a station wagon with psychiatrist Sam Loomis, who flips through a folder. They spot a wild-looking patient in a white gown on the roadside. Marion stops, and Loomis speaks briefly with the patient before returning to the car. Meanwhile, Laurie walks with Tommy Doyle, an eight-year-old boy, along a residential street. They approach the old Myers house, where Laurie leaves a key under the welcome mat. A dark shape watches her from inside the house. Laurie and Tommy continue walking, with the shape observing them before fading back inside. Loomis departs from the sanitarium as Laurie attends her high school class."
