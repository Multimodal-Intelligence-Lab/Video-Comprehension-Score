Suddenly, the wind dies down and a soft, gentle snow begins to fall. A police car pulls up on the roadway behind him, and Bert comes into the scene. George backs away and gets set to hit Bert again but then touches his lips with his tongue, wipes his mouth with his hand, and laughs happily, his rapture knowing no bounds. He practically embraces the astonished Bert and then runs at top speed toward town. George's wrecked car is smashed against a tree. He comes running into shot, sees the car, lets out a triumphant yell, pats the car, and dashes on. He turns and runs through the falling snow up the main street of the town, passing some late shoppers on the street. As he runs, he notices that the town is back in its original appearance. George notices a light in Potter's office window and races across the street, where Potter is seated working at his desk with his goon by his side. George pounds on the window and runs off as Potter looks up from his work. The lights are on, the Christmas tree is fully decorated with presents stacked around, and Carter the bank examiner, a newspaper reporter and photographer, and a sheriff are waiting in the hall for George. George comes dashing in the front door, grabs his hand and shakes it, and the photographer sets off a flash bulb. George runs to the kitchen, gets no answer, and comes running back to the hall where the three children are at the top of the stairs in their pajamas. George starts to run up the stairs, and the old familiar knob on the banister comes off in his hand, which he kisses lovingly before putting it back and continuing up the stairs. George hugs the kids as Zuzu comes running out of her bedroom and he crushes her to him. As Mary comes through the door breathless and excited, the four men are watching with open mouths. Mary races up the stairs, where George meets her in a fierce embrace, and they embrace tearfully. He stops her with a kiss and she leads him excitedly down the stairs. Mary leads George, who is carrying a couple of the kids on his back, to a position in front of the Christmas tree. She runs toward the front door and flings it open as ad lib sounds of an excited crowd can be heard. Uncle Billy, face flushed, covered with snow, and carrying a clothes basket filled with money, bursts in.",

He frantically scans his surroundings, his eyes darting as he leans over the bridge railing, his face a picture of desperation and prayer as he sobs quietly. In a sudden shift, the wind calms, replaced by a delicate, gentle snowfall that begins to blanket the scene softly. At that moment, a police car arrives silently behind him on the roadway, catching his attention as Bert emerges into view. George, initially startled, instinctively backs away, preparing himself to retaliate against Bert once more. However, a realization strikes him, prompting George to pause, touch his lips with his tongue, and wipe his mouth with a hand that now trembles with joy. He erupts into laughter, the sound filled with uncontainable happiness, signifying his newfound elation. With a spontaneous burst of joy, George embraces the bewildered Bert with enthusiasm before propelling himself forward, running swiftly toward the heart of the town. As he races along, he spots his damaged car, which is crushed against a tree, and lets out a victorious shout. He pauses briefly to affectionately pat the car, a symbol of his past struggles, before continuing his dash through the snow-covered main street. As George speeds by, he overtakes several late-night shoppers, noting with relief that the familiar town has returned to its original state. His gaze shifts to a light in Potter's office window, compelling him to sprint across the street where Potter sits at his desk, accompanied by his goon. George pounds defiantly on the window, catching Potter's attention as the latter looks up from his work, then hurriedly moves on without waiting for a reaction. The scene shifts to George entering his home, illuminated by festive lights and adorned with a fully decorated Christmas tree, encircled by neatly stacked presents. Awaiting him in the hall are Carter the bank examiner, a newspaper reporter, a photographer, and a sheriff, each a figure of authority and interest. George enters the front door with a rush of energy, extends his hand vigorously for a handshake, and the photographer captures the moment with a bright flash. He rushes to the kitchen, calls out, receives no reply, and quickly returns to the hall, where his three pajama-clad children wait eagerly at the top of the stairs. George bounds toward them, eager to embrace his family, but as he ascends the stairs, the beloved old banister knob detaches once again into his hand, which he kisses with affection and restores to its place before continuing upward. He envelops the children in a warm embrace, his love evident as Zuzu runs out of her bedroom directly into his arms, where he holds her tightly. As Mary enters, breathless and excited, the four onlookers stare, mouths agape, at the heartwarming reunion. Mary rushes up the stairs, meeting George with an intense, teary embrace, which he interrupts with a heartfelt kiss before she guides him eagerly downward, her excitement palpable. With children clinging playfully to George's back, she leads him to stand proudly in front of the glowing Christmas tree. She hurries to the front door, flings it wide open, and the cheerful sounds of an excited crowd flood into the room. In a spirited entrance, Uncle Billy appears, his face flushed with excitement, covered in snow, and triumphantly carrying a clothes basket brimming with money."

Suddenly, the wind dies down and a soft, gentle snow, characteristic of a serene Christmas Eve, begins to fall.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
