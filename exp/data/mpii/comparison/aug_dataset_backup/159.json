It halts them all as Gandhi rotates and gazes at him grimly. Patel and Azad, together with Pyarelal and now the towering figure of Abdul Ghaffar Khan, are observed there for the first time among Gandhi’s close-knit circle. A constabulary chief approaches Gandhi, demanding his focus. The camera sweeps to an impoverished district of craftsman residences in constricted alleys, where flames, the noises of sporadic gunfire, plundering, shrieks, the growl of constabulary vehicles, and sporadic sirens generate an environment of disorder. Yet outside one dwelling, an automobile, military jeep, constables, a few servicemen, and a cluster of individuals form a small enclave of tranquility. On the roof of this dwelling, a silhouette peers down at the tumultuous alleys below. Azad, Tahib, a Muslim whose dwelling it is, Mirabehn, and Pyarelal are also present with Abdul Ghaffar Khan. A thronging mob of flaming-torch-bearing juveniles, greatly outnumbering the constables and servicemen, shout up at the roof while brandishing dark standards, some sullied with blood, and daggers still moist with blood. Nehru lowers his head under the heft of these encumbrances, clutching his temples as he muses gravely, and nods in recognition. Noises of tumult and plundering reverberate in the adjacent alleys as a crowd of individuals assemble, many of them juveniles with dark standards, aligning along the structure. Azad ushers Nehru and Patel under the canopy awning, where Gandhi reclines curled on his side, inscribing while Pyarelal takes sheets from him, both disregarding the disorder around them. Gandhi appears weary, occasionally tightening his jaw in agony as a physician sits near the foot of the cot and Abdul Ghaffar Khan is beyond him. Near the other edge of the canopied area, Mirabehn sits with Bourke-White, murmuring softly, but ceases on noticing Nehru and smiles a relieved salutation, knowing Gandhi’s sentiments for him. Bourke-White gazes at Nehru and Patel before slowly reaching for her camera."

This unforeseen event nearly brings him to an abrupt halt while he is in the process of moving steadily toward the door. The entire scene seems to suspend in time, casting a veil of stillness over the surroundings as Gandhi deliberately turns his head and fixes Patel with a gaze marked by a bleak expression. Patel and Azad, now accompanied by Pyarelal and the imposing figure of Abdul Ghaffar Khan, make their presence known for the very first time amongst the intimate circle that gathers around Gandhi. At this moment, a police commissioner confidently steps forward, approaching Gandhi with a determined demeanor, as he asserts himself with the clear intent to demand Gandhi's full attention.\n\nThe camera, in a fluid motion, shifts its focus to reveal a poor quarter, an area where humble artisan dwellings line the narrow, winding streets. The atmosphere here is electric, charged with chaos, as fires blaze fiercely, sporadic gunfire echoes sharply in the air, and the cacophony of looting, terrified screams, the roar of police vehicles, and the occasional wail of a siren fills the ears. Yet, outside the confines of one particular house, there lies a small island of relative calm, created by the presence of a stationed car, an army jeep, policemen, a few soldiers, and a gathering of people. Perched on the roof of this house, someone peers prudently down at the tumultuous, frenetic streets below. Present at this vantage point are Azad; Tahib, the Muslim owner of the house; Mirabehn; Pyarelal; and Abdul Ghaffar Khan. A surging, fervent group of young men, torches in hand and far outnumbering the police and soldiers, collectively shout up at the roof. They brandish ominous black flags, some of which are visibly stained with red blood, while knives glint menacingly, their blades still wet with fresh blood.\n\nNehru lowers his head, weighed down by the heavy burden of these deeply troubling circumstances, and he grips his temples, reflecting with somber thought. He nods subtly in a gesture of acknowledgment, understanding the full gravity of the situation at hand. The sounds of rioting and looting persist in echoing through the nearby streets as another mass of people assembles, with many among them being youths vigorously waving black flags, positioning themselves strategically along the building's perimeter. Meanwhile, Azad carefully guides both Nehru and Patel under the sheltering canopy awning, where they observe Gandhi lying curled up on his side. Despite the surrounding chaos, Gandhi writes with a steadfast diligence, and Pyarelal dutifully collects the pages from him, both appearing almost oblivious to the turmoil enveloping them. Gandhi looks weary, his jaw clenching occasionally as if tightened by pain. A doctor is seated near the foot of the cot, while Abdul Ghaffar Khan is positioned just beyond him.\n\nSituated near the opposite edge of the canopied area, Mirabehn sits closely with Bourke-White, whispering quietly to each other. However, she abruptly stops her conversation when she catches sight of Nehru, her face breaking into a relieved, warm smile to greet him, fully aware of Gandhi’s deep feelings for Nehru. Bourke-White then fixes her sharp gaze on Nehru and Patel for a lingering moment before she deliberately reaches for her camera, intent on capturing the intensity and emotion of this significant moment."

Here, the environment is alive with the flicker of fires, the jarring sounds of sporadic gunfire, the chaos of looting, piercing screams, and the persistent roar of police vehicles punctuated by occasional sirens, all contributing to an atmosphere of disarray.

On the rooftop of this house, a solitary figure looks down at the chaotic streets below. Present alongside Azad are Tahib, a Muslim who owns the house, Mirabehn, and Pyarelal, all situated with Abdul Ghaffar Khan. Below, a large, angry group of torch-bearing youths, significantly outnumbering the police and soldiers, shout menacingly up at the roof, brandishing black flags, some stained ominously with blood, and knives still dripping with fresh blood. Amidst this scene, Nehru stands, anguish evident as he lowers his head, struggling under the weight of the ongoing crisis, gripping his temples in deep contemplation before nodding in solemn acknowledgment. The unsettling sounds of rioting and looting continue to reverberate through the adjacent streets, where a gathering mass of people, many young and bearing black flags, align along the building. Within this tension, Azad guides Nehru and Patel under a protective canopy awning, where Gandhi lies curled on his side, focused on writing while Pyarelal receives the pages from him, both seemingly detached from the surrounding chaos.

Newton, Johnson, a Muslim whose house it is, Curie, and Smith are also present with Hercules. A surging gang of torch-bearing youths, far outnumbering the firefighters and nurses, shout up at the roof while wielding black flags, some stained with blood, and knives still wet with blood. Einstein lowers his head under the weight of these burdens, gripping his temples as he thinks solemnly, and nods in acknowledgment.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
