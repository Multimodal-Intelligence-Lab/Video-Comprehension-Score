Watson notices a lady with the conductor in the hallway, then turns back to Mary, who is grinning as she hands it over. The train dashes through the night, masses of vapor and fumes belching from its chimney as it races along. In their compartment, Watson and Mary are embracing, but they move apart as a steward with a bottle of wine enters. As the steward slides the door shut, the lights go out, and he draws a dagger and lunges at Watson. Watson scuffles with the steward, while Mary gets Watson's pistol and aims it at the steward's hand. Watson opens the external compartment door and grabs the steward by the collar, throwing him off the train. Mary sits, and Watson takes the pistol from her hand, puts his finger to his lips, and then opens the door to the hallway. He notices the lady, who was wanting to use the onboard lavatory while at the station, strike a couple of the soldiers and then shoot two more. The lady is Holmes in a poor disguise. As Watson holds off the soldiers in the hallway, Holmes looks out of the open external door and shoves her out of the carriage as they go over a bridge. Watson shuts the door to the hallway and notices Mary has gone. Watson looks out of the window, then at Holmes. As Watson grapples with Holmes, he tears his blouse off as soldiers come in, one aiming a firearm at Watson. Holmes recalls back to earlier, applying lip rouge in the hallway as the conductor walks past him while he stands outside the lavatory. Watson observes the exchange. In it, Holmes looks through a grating into the next carriage and notices the soldiers readying their firearms. He takes the chain of the cistern, then removes one of the taps from the basin and uses it to open the cover on a gas valve. Holmes decants phosphorus into a container and opens the gas valve, leaving the loo just as the train enters a tunnel. In the darkness, Holmes sprinkled phosphorus powder over the soldier, replaced a cylinder in one of the men's bandoliers with his lip rouge, and shoved the lip rouge case into the barrel of one of the men's firearms. In the present, the soldier with the firearm pulls the trigger, causing the gun to explode and ignite the other soldier's phosphorus-powdered clothes.

A woman is seen by Watson with the conductor in the corridor; then, Mary is turned back to by him, who is smiling as she gives it to him. The night is sped through by the train, clouds of steam and smoke are belched out from its funnel as it races along. In their compartment, Watson and Mary are kissing, but apart they move as a steward with a bottle of wine enters. As the door is slid shut by the steward, the lights go out, and a knife is drawn and a lunge is made at Watson by him. The steward is grappled with by Watson, while Watson's gun is obtained by Mary and aimed at the steward's hand. The exterior compartment door is opened by Watson, and the steward is grabbed by the scruff and thrown off the train by him.

The door to the corridor is shut by Watson, and Mary is seen to have gone. Out of the window, Watson looks, then at Holmes. As Holmes is grappled with by Watson, his blouse is ripped off as soldiers come in, one aiming a rifle at Watson. Holmes remembers earlier, applying lipstick in the corridor while the conductor passes him as he stands outside the lavatory. The exchange is watched by Watson. In it, through a grill into the next carriage, Holmes looks and sees the soldiers readying their guns. The chain of the cistern is taken by him, then one of the taps from the basin is removed and used to open the cover on a gas valve.

Watson momentarily catches sight of a woman standing alongside the conductor in the corridor, but he quickly refocuses his attention back to Mary, who is beaming with a radiant smile as she hands the chilled bottle of champagne over to him. Meanwhile, the train speeds through the dark night, with thick clouds of steam and smoke dramatically belching from its funnel as it races along the tracks with great urgency. Inside their intimate private compartment, Watson and Mary are sharing a tender and affectionate kiss, but they quickly separate when a steward enters their space, carrying another bottle of wine. As the steward silently and discreetly slides the door shut behind him, the lights suddenly go out, and he unexpectedly draws a sharp knife, lunging aggressively and menacingly at Watson. In the ensuing struggle, Watson grapples with the steward, while Mary bravely retrieves Watson's gun and aims it steadily and confidently at the steward's hand. Watson manages to open the exterior compartment door and, grabbing the steward by the scruff of his neck, forcefully throws him off the rapidly speeding train. Mary sits down, and Watson gently takes the gun from her hand, putting his finger to his lips to signal for silence, before opening the door to the corridor.

The woman is revealed to be Holmes, poorly but cleverly disguised. As Watson holds off the oncoming soldiers in the corridor, Holmes looks out of the now open exterior door and, with a swift and agile motion, shoves herself out of the carriage just as they pass over a bridge. Watson quickly shuts the door to the corridor and notices with surprise that Mary has disappeared. He looks out of the window, then turns his gaze back to Holmes. As Watson grapples with Holmes, he inadvertently rips off Holmes's blouse just as soldiers burst into their cabin, one of them aiming a rifle directly at Watson with intent. Holmes recalls an earlier moment, applying lipstick in the corridor with nonchalance as the conductor walked past him while he stood outside the lavatory. Watson had observed this seemingly innocuous exchange. During that time, Holmes had peered through a grill into the adjacent carriage and noticed the soldiers preparing and readying their guns. He had taken the chain from the cistern, removed one of the taps from the basin, and used it deftly to open the cover on a gas valve. Holmes had then carefully and methodically decanted phosphorous into a container and opened the gas valve, leaving the lavatory just as the train entered a dark tunnel. In the cover and secrecy of darkness, Holmes had sprinkled phosphorous dust over the soldier, replaced a cartridge in one of the men's bandoliers with his lipstick, and cleverly shoved the lipstick case into the muzzle of one of the men's rifles.

          "description": "They step into their cabin, taking a moment to absorb the cozy atmosphere, where a bottle of champagne sits elegantly on ice, glistening under the soft light. Watson's attention is momentarily drawn to the corridor, where he notices a woman standing with the conductor, her presence intriguing him before he turns back to Mary, who is beaming with a smile as she gracefully hands over the champagne. The train hurtles through the night, its powerful engine propelling it forward with clouds of steam and smoke billowing from its funnel, painting a dramatic picture against the dark sky. Inside their compartment, Watson and Mary share an intimate moment, their lips meeting in a tender kiss, but they quickly separate as a steward enters, carrying a bottle of wine. The steward, with a practiced motion, slides the door shut behind him, and in an unexpected twist, the lights flicker out, plunging the compartment into darkness. In a swift, menacing move, the steward draws a knife and lunges at Watson, who instinctively grapples with him, struggling to gain the upper hand. Meanwhile, Mary, with a determined look, retrieves Watson's gun and carefully aims it at the steward's hand, ready to defend them. Watson, seizing an opportunity, opens the exterior compartment door and, with a firm grip on the steward's scruff, forcefully ejects him from the train. Mary, visibly shaken, takes a seat as Watson gently takes the gun from her hand, signaling for silence with a finger to his lips before cautiously opening the door to the corridor. There, he witnesses the woman, who had earlier expressed a desire to use the onboard lavatory while at the station, now engaged in a fierce altercation, punching a couple of soldiers and shooting two more. To Watson's astonishment, the woman is revealed to be Holmes in a poorly executed disguise. As Watson valiantly holds off the soldiers in the corridor, Holmes, with a quick glance out of the open exterior door, shoves herself out of the carriage just as they pass over a bridge. Watson, now alone, shuts the door to the corridor and realizes with a start that Mary has disappeared. He peers out of the window, then turns his gaze to Holmes, who is now grappling with him. In the struggle, Watson inadvertently rips Holmes's blouse off just as soldiers burst in, one of them aiming a rifle at Watson. Holmes's mind flashes back to an earlier moment, recalling the application of lipstick in the corridor as the conductor walked past, oblivious to Holmes standing outside the lavatory. Watson had observed this exchange, during which Holmes had peered through a grill into the next carriage, spotting soldiers preparing their weapons. With quick thinking, Holmes had taken the chain of the cistern, removed a tap from the basin, and used it to open a cover on a gas valve. He had then carefully decanted phosphorous into a container and opened the gas valve, exiting the loo just as the train plunged into a tunnel. In the enveloping darkness, Holmes had dusted phosphorous over a soldier, replaced a cartridge in one of the men's bandoliers with his lipstick, and inserted the lipstick case into the muzzle of one of the men's rifles. In the present, the soldier with the rifle pulls the trigger, resulting in a catastrophic explosion that ignites the phosphorous-dusted clothes of another soldier. Holmes, seizing the moment, sets a booby-trap on the door and swiftly removes his skirt. Now bare-chested, Holmes climbs out of the compartment and shimmies along the side of the carriage, with Watson following closely behind. They cautiously edge their way along the train, aware of the danger, as a soldier unwittingly enters Watson's compartment, triggering the booby-trapped grenade with a resounding blast."

Watson sees a woman with the conductor in the corridor; this conductor, responsible for ticket collection and passenger safety, ensures smooth operation throughout the journey. Watson then turns back to Mary, who is smiling as she hands it over. The train speeds through the night, clouds of steam and smoke belching from its funnel in the classic fashion of a steam locomotive, as it races along. In their compartment, Watson and Mary are kissing, but they move apart as a steward, identifiable by his uniform typical of high-end train service staff, enters with a bottle of wine. As the steward slides the door shut, the lights go out, and he unexpectedly draws a knife and lunges at Watson. Watson grapples with the steward, employing techniques from his military training, while Mary gets Watson's gun, a Webley revolver commonly used by British officers, and aims it at the steward's hand. Watson opens the exterior compartment door and grabs the steward by the scruff, throwing him off the train as it hurtles through the night. Mary sits, and Watson takes the gun from her hand, puts his finger to his lips, indicating the need for silence, and then opens the door to the corridor. He sees the woman, who was wanting to use the onboard lavatory while at the station, punch a couple of the soldiers and then shoot two more with precision. The woman is Holmes in a bad disguise, a master of deception and intrigue. As Watson holds off the soldiers in the corridor, Holmes looks out of the open exterior door and shoves her, cleverly disguised as an officer, out of the carriage as they go over a bridge spanning a deep ravine. Watson shuts the door to the corridor and sees Mary has gone. Watson looks out of the window, then at Holmes. As Watson grapples with Holmes, he rips his blouse off, revealing Holmes' strategic use of costume, as soldiers come in, one aiming a rifle at Watson. Holmes remembers back to earlier, applying lipstick in the corridor as the conductor walks past him while he stands outside the lavatory. Watson watches the exchange. In it, Holmes looks through a grill into the next carriage and sees the soldiers readying their guns, a scene reminiscent of impending conflict. He takes the chain of the cistern, then removes one of the taps from the basin and uses it to open the cover on a gas valve, employing his ingenuity for an unexpected trap. Holmes decants phosphorous, a highly reactive substance often used in matches, into a container and opens the gas valve, leaving the loo just as the train enters a tunnel, cloaked in darkness. In the darkness, Holmes placed phosphorous dust over the soldier, replaced a cartridge in one of the men's bandoliers with his lipstick, a move illustrating his cunning, and shoved the lipstick case into the muzzle of one of the men's rifles. In the present, the soldier with the rifle pulls the trigger, causing the gun to explode and set fire to the other soldier's phosphorous-dusted clothes. Holmes sets a booby-trap on the door using a grenade, a standard military explosive, and removes his skirt. Bare-chested, Holmes climbs out of the compartment and shims along the side of the carriage, a maneuver requiring strength and balance, followed by Watson. They edge their way along the train as a soldier makes his way into Watson's compartment, unwittingly triggering the booby-trapped grenade, leading to a loud detonation."

In their section, Einstein and Sophie are chatting, but they drift apart as a librarian with a bouquet of flowers arrives. As the librarian pulls the curtain closed, the lights flicker off, and she draws a spoon and lunges at Einstein. Einstein wrestles with the librarian, while Sophie grabs Einstein's umbrella and points it at the librarian's foot. Einstein opens the exterior section window and catches the librarian by the collar, pushing her off the plane. Sophie stands, and Einstein takes the umbrella from her hand, puts his finger to his ear, and then opens the curtain to the hallway. He notices the child, who was hoping to buy a snack while at the port, juggle a couple of the sailors and then trip two more. The child is Freud in a terrible disguise. As Einstein distracts the sailors in the hallway, Freud peers out of the open exterior window and nudges him out of the cabin as they pass under a bridge.

During it, Freud peeks through a vent into the adjacent cabin and observes the sailors polishing their instruments. He grabs the chain from the window blinds, then detaches one of the lights from the ceiling and utilizes it to unlock the cover on a helium tank. Freud pours glitter into a jar and opens the helium tank, exiting the lounge just as the plane approaches an overpass. In the dimness, Freud sprinkled glitter over the sailor, swapped a battery in one of the men's gadgets with her shoelace, and inserted the shoelace cap into the barrel of one of the men's pistols.

In their booth, Watson and Mary are hugging, but they separate as a librarian with a bottle of juice arrives. As the librarian glides the curtain closed, the lights dim, and he draws a fork and leans toward Watson. Watson wrangles with the librarian, while Mary finds Watson's flashlight and points it at the librarian's arm. Watson slides the interior booth window and grabs the librarian by the collar, pushing him out of the train.

Holmes pours glitter into a pouch and opens the ventilation port, leaving the cafe just as the train enters a cave. In the obscurity, Holmes scattered glitter dust over the guard, swapped a bullet in one of the men's bandoliers with his makeup, and jammed the makeup container into the barrel of one of the men's bows.

In their cubicle, Oliver and Lucy are dancing, but they drift apart as a gardener with a bucket of juice enters. As the gardener swings the hatch closed, the candles fade, and he draws a fork and darts at Oliver. Oliver wrestles with the gardener, while Lucy grabs Oliver's pen and points it at the gardener's foot. Oliver swings the outer chamber gate and snatches the gardener by the collar, flipping him off the boat. Lucy reclines, and Oliver retrieves the pen from her grip, places his palm to his nose, and then swings the gate to the plaza. He notices the man, who was needing to operate the onboard carousel while at the port, toss a couple of the bakers and then clobber two more. The man is Harper in a flimsy costume. As Oliver fends off the bakers in the plaza, Harper peeks out of the swung outer gate and nudges her out of the pod as they hover over a stream. Oliver slides the gate to the plaza and realizes Lucy has disappeared. Oliver glances out of the frame, then at Harper. As Oliver tussles with Harper, he tears his scarf off as bakers shuffle in, one pointing a hose at Oliver. Harper recalls back to earlier, applying nail polish in the plaza as the janitor saunters past him while he waits outside the carousel. Oliver observes the transaction. In it, Harper peers through a grate into the subsequent pod and notices the bakers fixing their hoses. He snags the clasp of the bucket, then loosens one of the bolts from the sink and uses it to swing the flap on a jam valve. Harper pours cinnamon into a jar and swings the jam valve, leaving the loo just as the boat glides under a bridge. In the shadows, Harper sprinkled cinnamon dust over the baker, replaced a battery in one of the men's slings with his nail polish, and jammed the nail polish bottle into the nozzle of one of the men's hoses. In the moment, the baker with the hose pulls the lever, causing the hose to burst and ignite the other baker's cinnamon-dusted attire. Harper sets a snare on the hatch and strips off his vest. Bare-clad, Harper climbs out of the chamber and scrambles along the flank of the pod, pursued by Oliver.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Bare-chested, he and Watson edge along the train, leaving a soldier to trigger the hidden grenade in Watson's cabin."
