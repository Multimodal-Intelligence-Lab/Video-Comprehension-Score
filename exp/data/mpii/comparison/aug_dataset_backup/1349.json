On the opposite aspect of the glass, Nelec, briefly confused and panting heavily, relocates from the coach entrance to the sealed glass dividing him from the children; he attempts the grip, but it won't release for him either. Joe and Nelec are eye-to-eye, and Joe perceives the dread in Nelec's gaze, recognizing that this is his destiny. Somehow, Nelec takes a moment to gaze into Joe's visage to quietly atone. Instantly, Joe knows he's about to observe this man's life conclude. Nelec rotates as the entity is breaking the coach entrance, battering at it to enlarge it so it can enter. Joe strikes again, as does the entity, while Nelec exhausts his ammunition. Joe strikes again, and crash — the pane shatters! Glass fragments cascade down on the lads, who shield their faces, as Cary glimpses the entity. With all the lads assisting, Joe hoists himself up outside the coach, peering out to observe the entity just fifteen feet away, concentrating on the entrance. Joe strives to ascend onto the top-side of the coach frighteningly down the passage toward him. As the entity descends upon him, in the hushed moment before the ultimate leap, Nelec eerily and silently conveys his dread. Standing is difficult for heartsick Louis with his injured legs — suddenly Jack is there, performing the role of Air Force. As the two Warriors proceed, Jack drapes Louis' arm over his shoulders and proceeds in the alternate direction, with Louis glancing over at him, bewildered. On Louis' face is a startled shimmer of optimism. Moments later, tight on a pouch, Joe withdraws his mother's pendant, having retrieved it from Overmyer's deceased form. Cary hoists his knapsack. They turn to glimpse a vehicle arriving swiftly, and Joe examines the forthcoming vehicle behind him. The vehicle arrives — it's Donny. He exits his vehicle, frantic- and red-eyed, exceptionally delighted to see them. Donny glances at Joe, as if it pains to contemplate. Joe maneuvers while Donny is slumbering, with the other lads in the rear. Joe swiftly veers left into a driveway, but from the direction they just departed, more tanks and military transports approach, and Joe's eyes grow wide — they're trapped. Gunfire persists as Joe and the lads exit the vehicle rapidly and dash across the avenue, weaving between the vast military transports."

In that fleeting instant, Joe understands that he is about to witness the tragic end of Nelec's life.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
