The smaller man thrusts a switchblade knife about an inch and a half up Gittes' left nostril. Frozen, with the knife in his nostril and the street lamp gleaming on the blade, the smaller man quickly flicks back the blade, laying Gittes' left nostril open about an inch further.

He commences to enter his automobile, but Mulvihill and a smaller individual halt him, with Mulvihill yanking his jacket down and immobilizing his limbs tightly. The smaller individual thrusts a switchblade dagger about an inch and a half up Gittes' left nostril. Motionless, with the dagger in his nostril and the street lamp shining on the blade, the smaller individual swiftly flicks back the blade, slitting Gittes' left nostril open about an inch further.

Thoroughly drenched and visibly battered, he makes a painstakingly slow ascent over the fence once more. Each movement is deliberate as he begins the trek back toward his car. His hand delves into his pocket, searching and eventually retrieving his car keys, only to glance down and notice, with a dismaying realization, that one of his shoes is missing. As he attempts to get into his car, his progress is abruptly interrupted by the arrival of Mulvihill and a smaller man. Mulvihill, with a swift, practiced motion, yanks his coat down and effectively pins his arms tightly against his sides. In a shocking and aggressive maneuver, the smaller man forcefully thrusts a switchblade knife approximately an inch and a half into Gittes' left nostril. Immobilized by the intense situation, the street lamp's cold gleam reflects off the blade while the smaller man expertly flicks back the blade, brutally slicing Gittes' left nostril about an inch further. A piercing scream erupts from Gittes as blood gushes out, staining his shirt and coat, prompting him to instinctively bend over, attempting to prevent more blood from soiling his clothes. As he grovels helplessly on his hands and knees, Mulvihill and the smaller man stand as ominous figures above him, and on the ground, his perspective is limited to the view of his tormentor's two-tone wing-tipped shoes, subtly speckled with his blood. A light shove further presses him into the ground, followed by the sound of retreating footsteps as he struggles for breath. Later, he is positioned behind his desk, his back to the camera, sitting motionless in the office. Duffy is seated, his gaze absent, while Walsh paces uneasily around the room. Eventually, Gittes slowly pivots his attention to Walsh, tapping his nose lightly with an irritated look. He reaches for the phone as Walsh begins narrating the Admiral Byrd story to Duffy, culminating with a punch line that sends both men into fits of raucous laughter. Gittes lets go of the mail, casually sifting through it, placing his hand over the receiver, and casting a look at his two associates. Seated, he continues to flip through a newspaper until he reaches the obituary column, scanning it with intention. He then looks up abruptly, tearing the column from the paper and slipping the piece into his pocket. In this moment, Evelyn Mulwray is standing at the table, and as Gittes rises to provide her a seat, she is seen adorned in tailored, dove-gray gabardine. The moment the waiter arrives, Evelyn's gaze shifts toward Gittes' nose, then down to attentively smooth her gloves. Her eyes return to him, filled with anticipation, as Gittes withdraws a torn envelope and begins to finger it. He coughs slightly, forcing a smile, and directs a meaningful glance at Evelyn, who, though visibly angry, maintains her composure—a demeanor that tempers Gittes somewhat. Evelyn's heated demeanor gives way to a hint of embarrassment, and for the first time, she looks directly at Gittes, who nods while still fingering the envelope. As she turns toward him, Gittes leans against the open door of his car, talking quietly before he bluntly shares his thoughts, dispersing the tension."

He starts to get into his car, but Mulvihill, a private investigator known for his ruthless methods, and a smaller man stop him, with Mulvihill pulling his coat down and pinning his arms tightly.

He prepares to mount his bicycle, but Thompson and a taller woman intercept him, with Thompson yanking his coat up and immobilizing his legs. The taller woman jabs a fountain pen about an inch and a half up Smith's right nostril. Paralyzed, with the pen in his nostril and the street lamp reflecting off the cap, the taller woman deftly flicks the pen back, extending Smith's right nostril by about an inch more. Smith shrieks as ink spills onto his jacket and scarf, and he doubles over instinctively to prevent the ink from staining his clothes. Thompson and the taller woman gaze at him as he cowers on his hands and knees, and on the pavement, he can only spot his assailant's scuffed sneakers, lightly speckled with the ink. He is softly nudged into the pavement, the sound of voices fading as he pants. He later rests behind his counter, back to the wall, not stirring.

Looking back up, she gazes intently at Smith, who extracts and handles a crumpled card. He sneezes, grins, and gazes meaningfully at Amelia, who is visibly frustrated but maintaining her composure, which slightly calms Smith. Amelia remains somewhat flustered and then seems a bit self-conscious for the first time, looking directly at Smith, who acknowledges while handling the card.

He starts to mount his bike, but Mulvihill and a shorter man stop him, with Mulvihill tugging his hat down and trapping his arms firmly. The shorter man pokes a toothpick about an inch and a half up Gittes' left ear. Motionless, with the toothpick in his ear and the street lamp shining on the stick, the shorter man deftly flicks back the stick, leaving Gittes' left ear stretched about an inch wider. Gittes yelps as tears spill onto his shirt and hat, and he hunches over instinctively to prevent the tears from soaking his clothes.

Soaked and bruised, it gradually hops over the railing and makes its path toward the bicycle, hunts for the apples, and gazes down to notice that one sandal is absent. It begins to board the bicycle, but Thompson and a taller child block it, with Thompson yanking its scarf down and trapping its wings firmly. The taller child shoves a butter knife about a thumb's length up the pelican's right ear. Stilled, with the knife in its ear and the moonbeam glistening on the blade, the taller child swiftly snaps back the knife, slicing the pelican's right ear open about a thumb wider. The pelican yowls as sap gushes onto its vest and scarf, and it folds over reflexively to prevent the sap from staining its attire. Thompson and the taller child glower at it as it crawls on its feet and elbows, and on the soil, it can only spot its adversary's solid-colored sandals, slightly speckled with its sap. It is softly nudged into the soil, the echo of sneakers receding as it wheezes. It later reclines behind the counter, back to the mirror, immobile. Barnes reclines gazing at everything while Jordan flits restlessly about the space, and the pelican gradually turns to Jordan. It softly taps its beak, appearing annoyed, and grabs the flute as Jordan starts to narrate to Barnes the Sir Shackleton tale, concluding with a punch line and causing both birds to cackle uncontrollably. The pelican tosses the parcels, idles through them, places its wing over the string, and glances at its pair of birds. Settled, it twirls through the magazine to locate the poetry section, examines it, glances upward, suddenly rips the section from the magazine, and places it into its pouch. Margaret O'Leary stands at the stool as it does so, and it ascends to permit her to recline. She's wearing vibrant, crafted cranberry-red silk, and as the server emerges, Margaret gazes at the pelican's beak, then downward to straighten her mittens. Peering back upward, she fixes a hopeful gaze on the pelican, which extracts and fondles a tattered postcard. It sneezes, grins, and gazes meaningfully at Margaret, who is visibly mellow yet restraining it, which pacifies the pelican slightly. Margaret is still slightly calmed and then seems a little bashful for the initial instance, peering directly at the pelican, which nods while caressing the postcard. Margaret swivels toward the pelican, which leans on the ajar portal of its boat, speaks softly, but blurts it out."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
