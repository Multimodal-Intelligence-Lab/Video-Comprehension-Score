Cal drives along a dark street with Jessica in the passenger seat, who gazes down uncomfortably before she glances up at Cal, who’s focused on the road. She hangs her head and gazes down again, and with trepidation, she glances at him again but looks away again. He shakes his head, she nods, and he smiles. Cal claps a hand over his mouth, puts a hand to his head, and then pulls up outside a house. Jessica frowns and nods, as she, tall and slightly gangly, stands outside a house and watches as Cal drives off, her brow pinched forlornly. People are leaving the upmarket bar where Hannah and Liz were, while Cal sits at the bar, resting his head on his hand, and stares down glumly, drumming his fingers on the countertop. Cal smiles gently and turns to look at a woman on his left, leaning towards her as she turns to him, but he shakes his head. She’s talking to her friend as Cal taps his glass on the bar and laughs at his own joke, looking over at Jacob, who’s making a bunch of women laugh. Cal sucks his drink through a straw as a balding man makes his way through an open-plan office and knocks on a glass door where his colleague fakes surprise. Cal heads out as his colleague pats him, and he closes his eyes as everyone in the office gives him a round of applause. It’s raining outside, with two chairs and a table in a pretty garden with white and red rose bushes, along with a wooden bench and a climbing frame. Cal stands by a rental truck and stares ahead, solemn-faced, as Emily pinches the bridge of her nose with tears welling in her eyes, and she nods. He looks her in the eye, she reels slightly, their gaze lingers, then Cal gets in the driver’s seat of a rental truck, closes the door, and Emily watches as Cal reverses. She walks along by the truck, her arms folded, then looks down. Cal’s back at the same bar, which is busy with people chatting, and he sits alone at the counter, drinking a vodka cranberry through a straw. He spots Jacob opposite him, eating a burger and chips alone at the bar, and Jacob wipes his mouth with a napkin and then gets up. Jacob puts on his suit jacket and glances over at Cal, who quickly lowers his gaze and sips his drink as Jacob makes his way over to a table of young women and starts chatting to them. Cal shakes his head disapprovingly and lets out a sigh as a middle-aged man in a shirt and tank top comes in.",

Cal steers along a murky road with Jessica in the copilot spot, who peers down uneasily before she peeks up at Cal, who’s intent on the route. She lowers her head and peers down again, and with apprehension, she peeks at him again but glances away anew. He shakes his head, she nods, and he grins. Cal places a hand over his mouth, places a hand to his head, and then halts outside a residence. Jessica scowls and nods, as she, tall and somewhat lanky, stands outside a residence and observes as Cal departs, her brow furrowed dejectedly. Individuals are departing the upscale tavern where Hannah and Liz were, while Cal sits at the tavern, leaning his head on his hand, and gazes down dismally, tapping his digits on the bar. Cal grins softly and turns to glance at a woman on his left, inclining towards her as she turns to him, but he shakes his head. She’s conversing with her companion as Cal taps his glass on the tavern and chuckles at his own quip, glancing over at Jacob, who’s causing a group of women to chuckle. Cal sips his beverage through a straw as a balding gentleman makes his progress through an open-plan work area and raps on a glass door where his associate feigns amazement. Cal departs as his associate pats him, and he shuts his eyes as everyone in the work area gives him a round of cheers. It’s drizzling outside, with two seats and a table in a lovely garden with white and crimson bloom bushes, along with a wooden bench and a climbing apparatus. Cal stands by a rental vehicle and stares forward, solemn-faced, as Emily pinches the bridge of her nose with tears welling in her eyes, and she nods. He looks her in the eye, she reels slightly, their gaze lingers, then Cal climbs into the driver’s seat of a rental vehicle, closes the door, and Emily watches as Cal reverses. She strides along by the vehicle, her arms crossed, then gazes down. Cal’s back at the same tavern, which is bustling with individuals chatting, and he sits solo at the bar, sipping a vodka cranberry through a straw. He notices Jacob opposite him, munching a sandwich and fries alone at the tavern, and Jacob wipes his mouth with a serviette and then stands up. Jacob dons his suit coat and peeks over at Cal, who quickly lowers his gaze and sips his beverage as Jacob makes his way over to a table of young women and begins chatting to them. Cal shakes his head disapprovingly and releases a breath as a middle-aged gentleman in a shirt and vest comes in."

Her head is hung by her, and she gazes down again, and with trepidation, she glances at him again but looks away again. His head is shaken by him, she nods, and a smile is given by him. A hand is clapped over his mouth by Cal, a hand is put to his head, and then he pulls up outside a house. Jessica frowns and nods, as she, tall and slightly gangly, stands outside a house and watches as he drives off, her brow pinched forlornly. The upmarket bar where Hannah and Liz were is left by people, while Cal sits at the bar, resting his head on his hand, and stares down glumly, drumming his fingers on the countertop. A gentle smile is given by Cal, and he turns to look at a woman on his left, who is leaned towards by him as she turns to him, but his head is shaken. Her friend is talked to by her as Cal taps his glass on the bar and laughs at his own joke, looking over at Jacob, who makes a bunch of women laugh. His drink is sucked through a straw by Cal as a balding man makes his way through an open-plan office and knocks on a glass door where surprise is faked by his colleague. Cal heads out as he is patted by his colleague, and his eyes are closed by him as a round of applause is given to him by everyone in the office. Outside, it is raining, with two chairs and a table in a pretty garden with white and red rose bushes, along with a wooden bench and a climbing frame. A rental truck is stood by Cal, and ahead is stared at by him, solemn-faced, as the bridge of her nose is pinched by Emily with tears welling in her eyes, and a nod is given by her. Her eye is looked in by him, she reels slightly, their gaze lingers, then the driver’s seat of a rental truck is occupied by Cal, the door is closed, and Emily watches as he reverses. By the truck, she walks along, her arms folded, then a downward look is cast by her. The same bar, busy with people chatting, is revisited by Cal, who sits alone at the counter, drinking a vodka cranberry through a straw. Opposite him, Jacob is spotted by him, eating a burger and chips alone at the bar, and his mouth is wiped with a napkin by Jacob, who then gets up. His suit jacket is put on by Jacob and a glance is given by him over at Cal, who quickly lowers his gaze and sips his drink as over to a table of young women Jacob makes his way and starts chatting to them. Cal disapproves and shakes his head, letting out a sigh, as a middle-aged man in a shirt and tank top comes in."

He manages a gentle smile and turns his attention to a woman seated on his left, leaning slightly towards her as she turns to face him, but he shakes his head, indicating a change of mind or a refusal.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
