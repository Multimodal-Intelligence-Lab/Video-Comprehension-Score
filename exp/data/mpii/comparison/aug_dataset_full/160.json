As Gandhi extends his hand towards Nehru, it trembles slightly, and with considerable effort, he turns to gently pat their joined hands with his other hand. Eventually, Gandhi's gaze shifts towards Patel, who is seated nearby, close to the head of the cot, creating a sense of equal footing among the three of them. Outside the covered area, Bourke-White is strategically crouched, her camera carefully framing the three of them together. Gandhi's face softens into a smile as he reaches out to touch hands with him, then thoughtfully shakes his head. However, Nehru harbors a conviction that he possesses an antidote to that pervasive despair, a sentiment that Bourke-White captures, her lens capturing the evident sense of elation displayed on Nehru's face. From her unobtrusive vantage point, she lowers the camera to rest against her mouth, poised and waiting for Gandhi's response. Gandhi slightly nods to Nehru, acknowledging the news with a mixture of sad wistfulness, and casts a glance at Patel, recognizing together that their belief in persuading Gandhi to abandon the fast was fundamentally misguided. Nehru turns back with palpable lack of confidence, but his expression is tinged with deep concern, while Gandhi manages a smile, though pain is clearly etched into his eyes, and he reaches out to touch Nehru's hand. Nehru gazes at him intently, feeling a sudden surge of fear that Gandhi truly means it, and Patel, Mirabehn, Azad, Bourke-White share in this unsettling realization. Beyond this intimate scene, an outside broadcast truck sits parked within the usual crowd, which has now swelled significantly, including a noticeably larger presence of women.

This gentle act prompts Gandhi to pause mid-writing, his attention drawn to Nehru, who looks at him in a way that nearly brings tears to Gandhi's eyes. As they lock eyes, Gandhi extends his hand towards Nehru, his fingers trembling slightly with the emotional weight of the moment. He then uses his other hand, turning it over with visible effort, to pat the top of their joined hands. This gesture is shared before Gandhi's gaze shifts to Patel, who is seated near the head of the cot, completing a triangle of connection among them. Meanwhile, outside the canopied enclosure, Bourke-White crouches low, her camera carefully framing the scene that includes the three pivotal figures. With an expressive smile, Gandhi reaches out to touch hands with Nehru again, only to subtly shake his head. Nehru, sensing a deeper meaning in Gandhi's gesture, feels that he possesses an antidote to Gandhi's despair. Bourke-White captures this moment intricately, her lens capturing the elation that washes over Nehru's face. Holding her camera close to her mouth, she waits for Gandhi's reaction, her anticipation palpable from her discreet vantage point. Gandhi nods in acknowledgment of Nehru's news, his nod carrying a heavy dose of sad wistfulness. He turns his head slightly, exchanging a glance with Patel. Both men recognize a shared understanding: their hope to dissuade Gandhi from his fast was misguided. Nehru, turning back towards Gandhi, carries only concern, his confidence dwindled. Gandhi, in return, offers a smile touched with agony and reaches out to place a comforting hand on Nehru's. As Nehru studies Gandhi's face, a sudden fear grips him—fear that Gandhi is resolute. This realization dawns simultaneously on Patel, Mirabehn, Azad, and Bourke-White, as they too are overtaken by the gravity of the situation. Beyond the intimate circle, an outside broadcast truck is parked amongst a growing throng that includes more women than before. The crowd extends from Gandhi's location, spreading along the street and pressing against the walls, a silent sea of individuals too entranced or terrified to move. Among them are the uneasy faces of Godse, with Apte and Karkare positioned nearby, their presence adding to the tension. Nehru rises, casting a steady gaze over the crowd, his face a mask of seething anger. Surrounded by the chaos, a magazine lies on the ground with its cover showing an image of men rioting, diagonally intersected by a cut-out of Gandhi on his cot—a stark reminder of the turmoil. Mirabehn stands and leaves the magazine where it lies, moving towards Nehru and Suhrawardy as Azad gently directs them into the sheltered area, while Abdul Ghaffar Khan sits quietly in the background, a silent observer. Mirabehn addresses Nehru softly, her words intended to soothe, leading him to glance towards Gandhi for reassurance. At that moment, the doctor, who is monitoring Gandhi's pulse once again, offers no glimmer of hope as he looks back at Nehru and Mirabehn, then steps away. Nehru approaches the side of the cot, where Gandhi greets him with a weak smile and an outstretched hand, revealing his enduring struggle. Gandhi looks past Nehru to Suhrawardy, who gives a supportive nod, then returns his gaze to Nehru, providing a whimsical smile and a gentle touch—a gesture that conveys unchanged resolve. Nehru gazes back, feeling a sense of hopelessness as he becomes acutely aware of the immense crowd and the faint outlines of distant smoke rising from buildings, stark reminders that they remain in Calcutta, where peace has yet to prevail."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
