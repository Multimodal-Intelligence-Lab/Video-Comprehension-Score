Then the velocity increases to regular as Howard's form detonates, projecting streams of dark liquid toward Sandra. At that instant, Percy twirls around her, shielding her from the spray, which impacts him in the rear. Percy thrusts Sandra back into the eatery, and the entrance slams shut behind them. Percy frees Sandra, letting her stagger hysterically into the space, where Kyle and Jeep seize her, forcing her to the floor. Charlie turns to glance at Percy, still standing with his back to the entrance, breathing heavily.

After a moment, Audrey toggles the safety back on, hands the firearm over to Kyle, and stares into the encompassing red void, her expression growing distant, seeming to have aged years overnight. She smiles at this admission and leans in, as if something beyond sensual craving has seized control.

That's when the world hits slow motion; Howard is a few feet away, alive but for a brief moment, as Sandra races toward him, with Percy, the former athlete whose quick reflexes are instinctual, just behind her. Then the speed accelerates to normal as Howard's body explodes, a traumatic event that the small town will remember for generations, spraying streams of dark fluid toward Sandra. At that moment, Percy spins around her, shielding her from the spray, which hits him in the back. This act of heroism is a testament to his past as a first responder. Percy pushes Sandra back into the diner, and the door slams closed behind them, echoing the terror of the situation.\n\nPercy releases Sandra, letting her stumble hysterically into the room, where Kyle and Jeep, who have been preparing for just such an emergency thanks to their military backgrounds, grab her, forcing her to the ground.

She catches a look at herself in the diner’s cracked mirror, runs her hand along the curvature of her belly, thinking of the child she must now protect, and tears well up in her eyes as fear and anger overtake her. She stamps out the cigarette in frustration as Jeep sees the strain on her face, understanding the silent burden she carries. After a long beat, as Jeep considers her, she turns to him, bitterness overtaking her, and Jeep's face hardens, shaped by the responsibility thrust upon him. He gets up, looking hurt and frustrated from Charlie, and then walks away, leaving Charlie to stare after him, disturbed and surprised by his unexpected response.\n\nOutside, the invisible sun is sinking beyond the desert horizon as Kyle and Audrey are bundled together on the roof of the diner, a strategic point offering a panoramic view of any approaching danger, keeping watch, with Kyle showing her how to hold the MP5, a submachine gun favored by law enforcement agencies for its reliability. Audrey points the gun out into the haze like she's been holding one all her life, prompting Kyle's surprised look at her hidden proficiency. After a moment, Audrey switches the safety back on, hands the gun over to Kyle, and stares into the surrounding red nothingness, her expression growing distant, seeming to have aged years overnight, haunted by memories only she knows. She smiles at this confession and leans in, as if something beyond sensual need has taken over, signaling a deeper bond formed by their shared ordeal.\n\nJust then, the spotlights illuminating the roof sign come to life, casting a reassuring glow over the station, the gas pumps light up down below, ready to refuel passing travelers if they dare stop, the station's fluorescents flicker on, and Bob’s TV glows with bright rolling static, a relic from the era of analog signals.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
