Meanwhile, Drover emerges from the back door, prompting Sarah to abruptly halt and keep her back turned to him, avoiding any interaction. As Drover reaches the porch, he pivots slowly, taking a deliberate moment to cast a lingering look at her before he continues his stride towards Magarri and the waiting horses. Sarah’s emotions swell, evident in her eyes brimming with tears, compelling her to spin on her heel and retreat back inside the house as Drover mounts a horse and rides away. In a different scene, Nullah's dog aggressively intercepts a police officer giving chase to him, and Nullah gradually turns his head to meet the gaze of a half-naked black tracker. Concurrently, Callahan discovers Fletcher amidst the dim ambiance of the movie theater. In a stark turn of events, King George is violently thrown into a prison cell as Nullah is forcibly taken away. Meanwhile, Sarah navigates her vehicle through the bustling crowds gathered on the wharf, where troopships densely line the Darwin harbor. In this chaotic environment, Nullah is clustered among a group of half-caste children being herded onto ships, while his grandfather from within his cell becomes aware of the situation. Sarah’s car journeys past rows of disciplined, marching soldiers, with Nullah’s eyes fixed intently on a white boy present among them. As both military personnel and civilians surge toward the wharf, Sarah halts her car at a barrier, promptly stepping out. In the ensuing commotion, Callahan forcibly pulls the white boy away as a priest seizes Nullah. The sight of crocodile-skin boots halting before him draws Nullah’s gaze upward to confront Fletcher's face, now looming above him. With urgency, Sarah pushes her way through the dense throng of people on the wharf, against the backdrop of ships’ funnels releasing plumes of smoke. Meanwhile, the priest escorts Nullah toward a boat poised to depart as Fletcher watches with cunning interest. As Sarah dashes down the length of the wharf, Nullah breaks free from the priest’s grip, sprinting to the stern of the boat. The small vessel, separating from the shadows cast by the massive liners evacuating the harbor, gradually makes its way out to sea. From aboard, Nullah looks up at Sarah, their eyes meeting as Fletcher smirks observantly. Nullah raises a hand, waving to Sarah, who has come to a stop at the wharf's edge. Beside her, Fletcher leans nonchalantly on the railing, exchanging a smug look with her before jauntily walking away. As the boat retreats further, Nullah remains at the back, casting a final look up at the priest, while Sarah clings to the wharf railing in a state of desolation, attempting to stifle her sobs. The children's boat continues its path between towering, grey navy vessels. Overhead, a Japanese fighter plane skims ominously through the clouds, heading toward an undisclosed island. On a balcony, overlooking the scene, Sarah steps out and surveys the harbor, her eyes eventually finding Drover, who stands contemplatively beside a tree. As he begins to whistle, Magarri’s stare fixes on Drover, whose discomfort is palpable as he hesitantly places a hand on the tree, prompting Magarri to turn away, leaving Drover alone with tears pooling in his eyes. In the meantime, on the opposite riverbank where they have made camp, vehicles kick up a trail of dust into the air. As dawn breaks, clouds crowd the sky while fighter planes launch from an aircraft carrier. Mission Island sits serenely beneath the overcast sky, cradled by the grey sea. Inside a dormitory on the island, children lie peacefully asleep until Nullah suddenly awakens, startled from his slumber. Elsewhere, Fletcher, with a sardonic smile etched across his face, replaces the phone receiver in his office, which offers a commanding view of the entirety of Darwin."

          "description": "Nullah, a young Aboriginal boy with a deep connection to his heritage, stares into the distance as Sarah rides up to the house on her old mare, which had been a gift from her father, a local rancher. Drover, known throughout the region as a rugged cattle driver, comes out the back door, and she freezes, keeping her back to him. On the porch, built from native timber by local craftsmen, he turns slowly and looks at her, then walks towards Magarri and the horses, who are tethered under the shade of a wide eucalyptus, as her eyes fill with tears. She whirls around and goes back indoors as he rides away towards the open plains. Nullah's dog, a loyal Australian Kelpie, attacks a cop chasing him during his escape from capture, and he turns slowly to look into the eyes of a half-naked black tracker, a man skilled in bushcraft and often employed by the authorities to find escaped convicts. Callahan finds Fletcher at the movies in Darwin’s historic cinema, which had recently survived a cyclone. King George, a respected elder known for his wisdom, is flung into a cell as Nullah is dragged away in a harsh crackdown on mixed-race children. Sarah drives through crowds on the wharf where troopships, some of which had traveled all the way from Sydney, crowd Darwin harbor. Nullah is with a group of half-caste children, who were often forcefully taken from their families as part of the Stolen Generations policy, being shipped out as his grandfather hears in his cell. Sarah drives past lines of marching troops, a sign of the escalating tensions of World War II, while Nullah stares at the white boy, a child of a local dairy farmer. Troops and civilians swarm towards the wharf, and Sarah stops at a barrier, erected by local authorities for crowd control, and gets out of the car. Callahan drags the white boy away as a priest pulls Nullah, who is one of many taken to Christian missions. Crocodile boots, a luxury item made from the leather of reptiles found in Northern Australia, stop in front of him, and Nullah looks up into Fletcher's face. Sarah barges her way anxiously through the crowd on the wharf as smoke rises from ships' funnels, signaling their imminent departure. The priest, a member of a missionary group known for their work in the outback, leads Nullah to a waiting boat while Fletcher observes slyly, knowing the pain he's caused. As Sarah runs down the wharf, Nullah runs to the stern of the boat. The small boat pulls out of the shadow of the huge liners evacuating the town, which is bracing for a possible Japanese attack. The boy looks up at Sarah, and Fletcher grins triumphantly. Nullah waves to Sarah, who stops at the end of the wharf. Fletcher leans on the railing next to her as the boat sails away into the open ocean. He turns smugly to her, grins, and saunters off with an air of victory. On the back of the boat, Nullah turns and looks up at a priest, who is known for his stern demeanor, as Sarah leans on the wharf rail in despair, trying to control her sobs. The children's boat sails away from the wharf between huge, grey navy vessels, part of the fleet assembled to defend the coastline. A Japanese fighter, one of many patrolling the skies, skims through the clouds towards an island in the Pacific. Sarah steps out onto the balcony of her wood-paneled room and looks out over the harbor. She looks across at Drover, who's standing thoughtfully by a tree, a remnant of the mangrove forest that used to thrive in the region. As he whistles, Magarri stares at Drover, who looks uncomfortable and tentatively lays his hand on the tree. Magarri turns away, conscious of the cultural importance of trees in his heritage, and tears fill Drover's eyes. Their vehicles, rugged trucks built for the harsh terrain, raise a cloud of dust on the other side of the river they are camping next to. Clouds fill the sky as fighters take off at dawn from an aircraft carrier, ready to face the impending threat. Mission Island sits peacefully in the grey sea, beneath the cloudy sky, a picture of serenity amid turmoil. The children are asleep in their dormitory, made of corrugated iron to withstand the elements, when Nullah wakes up with a start. Smiling unpleasantly, Fletcher hangs up the phone in his office overlooking the whole of Darwin, confident in his manipulative schemes."

Concrete's cat pounces on a teacher chasing it, and it pivots gradually to gaze into the eyes of a fully-clothed white carpenter. Callahan discovers Walker at the concert. Queen Georgia is tossed into a garage as Concrete is pulled away. Juniper pedals through flocks on the bridge where sailboats cram Byron bay. Concrete is with a swarm of full-breed ducks being flown in as its cousin smells in its garage. Juniper cycles past rows of jogging dancers while Concrete gazes at the red girl. Dancers and spectators swarm towards the bridge, and Juniper halts at a hurdle and gets out of the van. Callahan yanks the red girl away as a singer pushes Concrete. Flamingo heels halt in front of it, and Concrete gazes up into Walker’s toes. Juniper nudges her way cheerfully through the forest on the bridge as fog descends from trees’ branches. The singer guides Concrete to a waiting bus while Walker monitors craftily. As Juniper sprints down the bridge, Concrete dashes to the bow of the bus. The large bus rolls into the brightness of the giant bicycles importing the farm. The frog peers up at Juniper, and Walker laughs. Concrete signals to Juniper, who halts at the start of the bridge. Walker leans on the barricade next to her as the bus cruises away. It pivots arrogantly to her, chuckles, and strides off. On the top of the bus, Concrete pivots and gazes up at a singer as Juniper leans on the bridge fence in delight, trying to manage her cheers. The ducks’ bus drifts towards the bridge beside tiny, black commercial ships. An Italian submarine glides through the water towards a peninsula. Juniper moves out onto the rooftop and gazes out over the bay. She gazes across at Wanderer, who’s sitting joyfully by a flower. As it hums, Umbra glares at Wanderer, who feels thrilled and eagerly places its foot on the flower. Umbra pivots towards, and sunlight fills Wanderer’s face. Their airplanes raise a blanket of steam on the same side of the mountain they are picnicking next to. Mist empties the land as submarines dive off at night from a space station. Operation Mountain lies chaotically in the black sand, above the clear land. The dogs are awake in their classroom when Concrete dozes off with a rest. Frowning gladly, Walker adjusts the light in its tower overlooking the park of Byron."

On the deck, he pivots lazily and glances at her, then skips towards a koala and the bicycles as her eyes fill with raindrops. She twirls around and dances back indoors as he flies away. Nullah's cat gnaws at a clown chasing him, and he spins quickly to look into the eyes of a fully dressed white tracker. Aardvark discerns Fletcher at the circus. King George is hurled into a basket as Nullah is hauled away. A penguin swims through crowds on the beach where sailboats fill Darwin lagoon. Nullah is with a flock of multicolored doves being carried out as his ancestor listens in his basket. A penguin swims past lines of marching penguins while Nullah gazes at the grey pelican. Penguins and aristocrats march towards the beach, and a penguin halts at a fence and dives out of the submarine. Aardvark drags the grey pelican away as a juggler lifts Nullah. Cowboy boots shuffle in front of him, and Nullah peeks up into Fletcher's grin. A penguin weaves her way nervously through the swarm on the beach as fog billows from balloons' nozzles. The juggler guides Nullah to a waiting train while Fletcher examines cautiously. As a penguin dashes down the beach, Nullah dashes to the bow of the train. The tiny train glides out of the shadow of the towering sailboats departing the island. The duckling squints up at a penguin, and Fletcher snickers. Nullah signals to a penguin, who halts at the brink of the beach. Fletcher lounges on the platform beside her as the train rolls away. He swivels arrogantly to her, laughs, and strolls off. On the stern of the train, Nullah spins and gazes up at a musician as a penguin leans on the beach railing in distress, trying to suppress her giggles. The ducklings’ train glides away from the beach between massive, blue cargo ships. A Chinese dragon swoops through the mist towards a mountain. A penguin leaps out onto the terrace and scans the horizon over the lagoon. She peers across at a giraffe, who's pondering carefully by a shrub. As he hums, a koala squints at a giraffe, who feels uneasy and delicately pats the shrub. The koala spins away, and thunder fills a giraffe's ears. Their blimps stir a mist of rain on the opposite side of the ocean they are tenting next to. Mist swamps the atmosphere as fairies soar at dusk from a spacecraft. Balloon Island sits tranquilly on the blue ocean, beneath the misty firmament. The ducklings are dreaming in their barracks when Nullah springs up with a giggle. Frowning humorously, Fletcher tosses away the banana in his cabin overlooking the whole of Darwin."

Soldiers and civilians flock towards the boardwalk, and Sarah stops at a fence and steps out of the jeep. Callahan pulls the white girl away as a sailor tugs Nullah. Leather sandals pause in front of him, and Nullah glances up into Fletcher's grin. Sarah weaves her way excitedly through the throng on the boardwalk as steam curls from boats’ chimneys. The sailor guides Nullah to a waiting cart while Fletcher watches eagerly. As Sarah sprints down the boardwalk, Nullah dashes to the bow of the cart. The little cart rolls out from the shadow of the gigantic yachts evacuating the village. The girl glances up at Sarah, and Fletcher sneers. Nullah salutes Sarah, who halts at the edge of the boardwalk. Fletcher reclines on the fence next to her as the cart glides away. He turns cheerfully to her, smirks, and strolls off. On the bow of the cart, Nullah rotates and gazes up at a sailor as Sarah leans on the boardwalk fence in sorrow, attempting to suppress her giggles. The children’s cart glides away from the boardwalk between enormous, teal cargo ships. A Japanese helicopter hovers through the rain towards a prairie. Sarah strides out onto the patio and peers out over the lake. She glances over at Drover, who’s standing quietly by a bush. As he hums, Magarri glares at Drover, who appears uneasy and carefully places his foot on the bush. Magarri spins away, and joy fills Drover’s eyes. Their wagons stir a puff of sand on the side of the hill they are lounging beside. Stars fill the sky as helicopters lift off at sunset from a submarine. Adventure Island rests calmly in the azure lake, beneath the starry sky. The children are awake in their playroom when Nullah drifts off with a sigh. Frowning kindly, Fletcher picks up the violin in his cabin overlooking the entirety of Darwin."

          "description": "Balloon drifts into the foreground as Laura sails into the barn. Trader slips out the side gate, and she halts, shielding her face from him. On the veranda, he pivots quickly and glances at her, then strides towards Jingo and the zebras as her vision blurs with rain. She spins around and strides back indoors as he pedals away. Balloon's cat nibbles a janitor scolding him, and he pivots quickly to gaze into the ears of a fully-dressed blue magician. Henderson discovers Turner at the circus. Emperor Ming is tossed into a locker as Balloon is wheeled away. Laura floats through parades on the pier where submarines flood Sydney bay. Balloon is with a colony of orphaned penguins being flown out as his sibling listens in his locker. Laura skims past files of marching bands while Balloon gapes at the pink girl. Marchers and spectators flood towards the pier, and Laura pauses at a checkpoint and exits the bus. Henderson hauls the pink girl away as a sailor lifts Balloon. Elephant slippers pause in front of him, and Balloon peers up into Turner's nose. Laura elbows her route eagerly through the swarm on the pier as fog ascends from ships' chimneys. The sailor directs Balloon to an idling van while Turner watches slyly. As Laura rushes down the pier, Balloon dashes to the bow of the van. The diminutive van rolls out of the cloak of the gigantic cruise ships abandoning the city. The girl peers down at Laura, and Turner chuckles. Balloon flutters to Laura, who rests at the tip of the pier. Turner lounges on the barricade beside her as the van glides away. He swivels arrogantly to her, chuckles, and struts off. On the roof of the van, Balloon pivots and peers up at a sailor as Laura leans on the pier fence in anguish, striving to contain her hollers. The penguins' van glides away from the pier amidst colossal, rusty cargo freighters. An American glider drifts under the fog towards a peninsula. Laura emerges onto the terrace and peers out over the bay. She peers across at Trader, who's standing pensively by a bush. As he hums, Jingo gazes at Trader, who feels awkward and gingerly places his foot on the bush. Jingo swivels away, and rain fills Trader's vision. Their bicycles kick up a mist of confetti on the far side of the gorge they are picnicking beside. Fog fills the atmosphere as gliders soar at dusk from a naval base. Sanctuary Isle floats silently in the rusty ocean, beneath the foggy atmosphere. The penguins are napping in their nursery when Balloon jolts awake with a shiver. Grinning coldly, Turner disconnects the telegram in his workshop overlooking the entirety of Sydney."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

          "description": "Nullah gazes as Sarah arrives. Drover appears, causing her to pause, and tears fill her eyes as he leaves. Nullah's dog fends off a cop, and Nullah encounters a black tracker. King George is jailed while Nullah is taken away. Sarah drives through Darwin's crowded harbor, witnessing Nullah among half-caste children being shipped out. In the chaos, Callahan and a priest separate the children, with Fletcher observing slyly. Sarah anxiously pushes through the crowd but arrives too late to stop the boat carrying Nullah. As the boat departs, Fletcher smugly watches Sarah's despair. A Japanese fighter approaches an island while Sarah looks over the harbor and Drover across the water. Drover, emotional, stands by a tree with Magarri. Fighters take off at dawn, and children sleep on Mission Island. Nullah awakens with alarm, while Fletcher smiles unpleasantly in his office overlooking Darwin."
