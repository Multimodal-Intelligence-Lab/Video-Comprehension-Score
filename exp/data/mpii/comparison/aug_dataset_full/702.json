Harry nods with a silent understanding, and Peter gets to his feet, ready to face the challenges ahead. They spin round to face their enemies, a team effort reminiscent of their shared battles against evil forces. Venom, the malevolent symbiote once bonded with Eddie Brock, flies at Peter with lethal intent. Harry, using his Goblin-enhanced strength, swings Peter like a club to hit Sandman, the once petty thief turned massive sand creature thanks to a particle accelerator accident. He blasts Sandman's arm with flames from his sky stick, a high-tech piece of gear designed for agile aerial maneuvers. Sandman tries to grab Harry, but the monster's huge arm shatters like glass, a testament to his unstable form. Jameson, the blustery editor of the Daily Bugle known for his vendetta against Spider-Man, is in the crowd below. He tries to take a photograph, desperate for a scoop, but the camera's empty. Jameson glares at the girl, his frustration palpable. Peter and Harry duck Sandman's huge fists, their reflexes honed by countless battles. Above them, the cab plummets towards Mary Jane, who has been a constant source of motivation and concern for Peter. The cab misses her by a hair's breadth. She hangs on by a thread, literally and figuratively, as she often does in Peter's life. Harry and Peter fly towards her on the sky stick, weaving past the sandy hulk with the precision of seasoned heroes. The thread breaks, and Mary Jane tumbles, echoing many perilous moments she's faced before. Peter slues the sky stick round. Being onto each other, they surf past Sandman, and Peter leaps off the sky stick and catches her, his acrobatic skills saving her once again. The watching crowd go wild, the age-old fascination with heroics igniting their cheers, as he swings away on a thread carrying Mary Jane in his arms and lands back on the half-built skyscraper. He nods through his torn mask, a familiar gesture of reassurance despite his battered state. Sandman grabs at Harry, his determination undeterred by his crumbling form. Peter kicks sand in Sandman's eyes, a tactic as old as the playground but effective nonetheless. Sandman lumbers round, bemused, then punches Peter with his massive arm, sending him flying up to one of the upper floors of the half-completed building, a testament to the ongoing development of New York's skyline. He's out of Sandman's reach but not out of danger. He fires rockets from the sky stick. They hit their target, and the enormous sand creature staggers back, crumbling and disintegrating, his unstable form no match for the onslaught. As his huge left arm crumples into the ground leaving out of dust, the crowd whoop their delight, celebrating the temporary victory. High up on the skyscraper, Peter, his Spider-Man mask badly torn, his eye and mouth quite visible, looks around for Venom, aware of the ongoing threat. As Peter turns his way and that, Venom grabs him from above, using the element of surprise to his advantage, and hurls him into a girder, the impact resonating with the metal. Peter falls on his face, vulnerable and exposed. Venom lassos his wrists with two black threads, exhibiting the symbiote's versatile powers, and holds him to his knees. He whacks him with an iron bar, the brutality of the attack underscoring Venom's ruthless nature. He hits him twice more, ripping the mask right off, laying bare Peter's identity. Venom holds the jagged metal bar to Peter's neck, a threat that highlights the stakes of their confrontation. Venom's tendrils engulf Brock's face, reminding Peter of the duality between host and symbiote. As he goes to stab Peter, a pumpkin bomb cuts into him, a signature explosive famously used by the Osborn family. Harry flies up, his loyalty to Peter unwavering. Venom snatches the sky stick from under him, shifting the battle's dynamics. As Harry falls, he gets a rack of long metal tubes that fall to the floor, a cacophony of clattering metal. Peter still trapped watches as Venom puts his hands to his ears and seems to half-disintegrate, reacting to the sonic disruption from the falling tubes. Peter remembers hitting himself on the bell, its vibrations key to detaching the symbiote, when he tried to tear the black suit off, a desperate act of liberation. Venom leaps down Peter, wielding the sky stick as a weapon, an ironic twist given its original purpose. Harry steps in between them, his protective instincts overriding his own safety. Harry looks down at the two blades protruding through his chest, a mortal wound marking his ultimate sacrifice. Venom hoists him up into the air and tosses him away, a final act in the deadly dance between hero and villain."

Robinson's in the throng below. He attempts to sketch a portrait. The sketchpad's blank. Robinson scowls at the boy. Oliver and Lucas evade Mudman's enormous paws. Above them, the chair plunges towards Sarah. The chair misses her. She clings on by a hair. Lucas and Oliver glide towards her on the hoverboard, dodging past the gritty giant. The hair snaps, and Sarah spirals. Oliver steers the hoverboard sideways. Holding onto each other, they sail past Mudman, and Oliver vaults off the hoverboard and grabs her. The observing masses cheer as he swings away on a hair carrying Sarah in his embrace and lands back on the unfinished tower. He winks through his ripped helmet. Mudman reaches for Lucas. Oliver kicks mud in Mudman's face. Mudman staggers around, flustered, then smacks Oliver with his gigantic leg, sending him soaring to one of the elevated floors of the partially-built structure. He's out of Mudman's grasp. He launches arrows from the hoverboard. They strike the mark, and the colossal mud figure reels back, collapsing and dissolving. As his gigantic right leg collapses into the earth leaving a pile of debris, the spectators cheer their joy. High atop the tower, Oliver, his hero mask badly shredded, his eye and mouth clearly visible, scans the area for Phantom. As Oliver turns this way and that, Phantom snatches him from above and flings him into a beam. Oliver crashes on his belly. Phantom binds his wrists with two dark strands and forces him to his knees.

Oliver recalls slamming himself on the chime when he struggled to remove the dark outfit. Phantom leaps down on Oliver, wielding the hoverboard as a tool. Lucas steps before them. Lucas glances down at the two blades jutting through his abdomen. Phantom raises him high into the air and flings him aside."

          "description": "Harry extends a leg, and Peter taps it softly. Harry winks, and Peter hops to his knees. They twirl around to observe their friends. Venom glides toward Peter. Harry twirls Peter like a frisbee to hit Sandman. He washes Sandman's leg with water from his rocket sled. Sandman attempts to tickle Harry, but the creature's massive leg disintegrates like mist. Jameson's in the crowd above. He tries to paint a portrait. The easel's empty. Jameson grins at the boy. Peter and Harry dodge Sandman's tiny feet. Beneath them, the plane drifts towards Mary Jane. The plane misses her. She balances on a string. Harry and Peter float towards her on the rocket sled, zigzagging past the sandy giant. The string snaps, and Mary Jane glides. Peter twirls the rocket sled forward. Latching onto each other, they glide past Sandman, and Peter dives off the rocket sled and grasps her. The watching crowd cheers as he dances away on a cord carrying Mary Jane in his arms and lands back on the unfinished bridge. He winks through his fractured shield. Sandman tickles at Harry. Peter throws pebbles in Sandman's ears. Sandman stumbles around, puzzled, then taps Peter with his tiny hand, sending him floating up to one of the upper levels of the half-done structure. He's out of Sandman's sight. He launches balloons from the rocket sled. They miss their target, and the enormous sand creature stumbles forward, solidifying and expanding. As his massive right leg solidifies into the ground leaving hints of mist, the crowd cheers their amusement. High up on the bridge, Peter, his Spider-Man mask roughly cracked, his cheek and nose quite visible, glances around for Venom. As Peter turns this way and that, Venom nudges him from below and sends him into a beam. Peter lands on his back. Venom entangles his ankles with two red cords and pins him to his elbows. He caresses him with a wooden rod. He taps him twice more, shredding the mask completely. Venom holds the smooth glass shard to Peter's chin. Venom's tentacles uncover Brock's face. As he goes to pat Peter, a watermelon bomb slices through him. Harry jumps down. Venom seizes the rocket sled from under him. As Harry tumbles, he grabs a coil of short plastic rods that tumble to the ceiling. Peter still ensnared watches as Venom covers his mouth with his hands and seems to half-solidify. Peter remembers kicking himself on the drum when he tried to attach the red suit on. Venom springs up Peter, brandishing the rocket sled as a trophy. Harry slides in beside them. Harry peers down at the two buttons glistening through his shirt. Venom lifts him up into the air and flips him away."

          "description": "Benny stretches out a paw, and Carlos grips it lightly. Benny shakes his head, and Carlos drops to his hands. They roll around to face their allies. Phantom glides at Carlos. Benny swings Carlos like a bat to hit Boulder. He zaps Boulder's leg with water from his cloud plank. Boulder attempts to snatch Benny, but the creature's tiny leg disintegrates like sand. Lenny's in the congregation above. He attempts to draw a sketch. The notepad's blank. Lenny squints at the boy. Carlos and Benny dodge Boulder's tiny toes. Beside them, the bucket soars towards Tina. The bucket misses her. She dangles on by a rope. Benny and Carlos glide towards her on the cloud plank, twisting past the rocky giant. The rope snaps, and Tina plunges. Carlos swivels the cloud plank around. Being onto one another, they glide past Boulder, and Carlos jumps off the cloud plank and grabs her. The observing audience cheers as he swings away on a vine carrying Tina in his paws and lands back on the half-finished monument. He shakes through his tattered veil. Boulder snatches at Benny. Carlos kicks rocks in Boulder's nose. Boulder twirls around, puzzled, then smacks Carlos with his tiny leg, sending him soaring down to one of the lower levels of the half-constructed tower. He's outside of Boulder's grasp. He launches fireworks from the cloud plank. They strike their aim, and the colossal stone creature wobbles back, cracking and dissolving. As his tiny right leg crumbles into the air leaving out of mist, the congregation cheer their excitement. Low down on the monument, Carlos, his Bat-Man veil mostly shredded, his nose and ears quite showing, scans around for Phantom. As Carlos turns his head and this, Phantom seizes him from below and flings him into a beam. Carlos crashes on his back. Phantom binds his ankles with two white ropes and pins him to his elbows. He hammers him with a wooden rod. He taps him twice more, peeling the veil right off. Phantom presses the blunt wooden rod to Carlos's shoulder. Phantom's vines wrap Blake's hair. As he goes to jab Carlos, a citrus fruit smashes against him. Benny glides down. Phantom grabs the cloud plank from below him. As Benny descends, he snatches a stack of short wooden rods that roll to the ceiling. Carlos still confined watches as Phantom puts his feet to his knees and seems to partly dissolve. Carlos recalls bumping himself on the gong when he struggled to remove the white cloak. Phantom jumps up Carlos, brandishing the cloud plank as a shield. Benny stands in behind them. Benny glances up at the three arrows jutting through his back. Phantom lifts him down into the ground and drags him away."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Harry uses his sky stick to attack Sandman, whose attempts to grab Harry fail as his arm shatters. Meanwhile, Jameson in the crowd below finds his camera empty. As Sandman swings at them, Peter and Harry narrowly avoid his massive fists. Above them, Mary Jane is in peril as a cab nearly hits her, but the duo manages to rescue her just in time. The crowd cheers as Peter swings away with Mary Jane. Back on the skyscraper, Sandman crumbles after Peter's rocket attack. Meanwhile, Venom ambushes Peter, restraining and battering him, ripping his mask off. When Venom is about to finish Peter, a pumpkin bomb intercedes. Harry tries to help but falls after Venom snatches his sky stick. Recalling a previous encounter with the suit, Peter observes Venom disoriented by sound. As Venom advances with the sky stick, Harry selflessly intervenes but is mortally wounded, saving Peter in the process."
