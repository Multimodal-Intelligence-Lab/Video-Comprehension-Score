In another scene, a man garbed in a sleek green flight suit maintains his balance as he stands confidently atop a levitating glider, exuding an air of control. Norman, meanwhile, turns his attention toward Strom, watching intently as the general takes his leave, the action leaving Norman deep in thought and introspection. Inside the cozy environment of a suburban house, Peter's Uncle Ben carefully grips a light bulb, initially loosening and then removing the old one before inserting and securing a new bulb, emitting a soft glow throughout the room. Concurrently, Peter, with a demeanor of distraction, departs from his concerned Aunt May and Uncle Ben, who remain downstairs, and ascends slowly up the stairs, eventually reaching his room. Once inside, he methodically removes his shirt and vest, revealing his slender build, and catches a wavering glimpse of himself in the tall mirror before allowing his body to collapse onto the bed. Not finding comfort there, he rolls onto the floor, feeling the cool surface beneath him, before extending his arm to grasp a tartan blanket from the bed, hauling it over himself for warmth and solace. His mind, however, is a storm of vivid images: spiders creeping, DNA strands intertwining and splitting, helixes being severed and rejoined, all accompanied by an overwhelming surge of invisible power coursing through his consciousness. Meanwhile, over at Oscorp, Norman is engaged in his own transformative process. He strips to the waist, exposing his bare torso, and receives a small bottle from Strom, raising it to his lips and gulping down its contents with resolve before discarding the bottle onto the floor with a careless toss. With determination, he lifts open the metal cover on the sliding trolley and lies down, positioning himself for the next step. Strom, maintaining a methodical focus, secures the manacles snugly over Norman's chest, legs, and upper arms, ensuring he remains firmly attached to the trolley. Strom's expression is stern as he rushes to the control panel, setting the trolley in motion as it glides smoothly into a large glass chamber. The chamber doors slide shut with a mechanical hiss, and the trolley transitions from a horizontal to a vertical position, leaving Norman firmly locked in place. Norman and Strom exchange a meaningful glance as the former nods, signaling readiness. Strom, with steady hands, pushes a switch, watching a large file pour a green liquid that transforms into vapor, rising within the chamber and enveloping Norman entirely. As the gas level increases, Strom attentively monitors a computer-generated image, tracking Norman's physiological responses, particularly noting the heart rate climbing to 140. Suddenly, Norman's body convulses violently, prompting Strom to react swiftly, rushing to the control panel and venting the gas chamber in an urgent attempt to stabilize the situation. Norman's head shakes vigorously, his eyes rolling back to reveal only whites before his heart goes still, flat-lining ominously. Acting with immediacy, Strom enters the chamber, attempting to revive Norman by administering heart massage from a standing position. The tension breaks as Norman's pulse returns, his eyes snapping open with intense alertness, and in a surge of newfound strength, he wraps his hand around Strom's throat, propelling him through the chamber's glass with sheer force. Now free from restraint, Norman leaps out, exuding strength and control. Simultaneously, in a contrasting scene, Peter awakens from a fragmented sleep, lifting himself off the floor, somewhat disoriented, and instinctively reaches for his spectacles. He places them on, only to remove them swiftly, puzzled by the sudden clarity of his vision without them. He tries once more, putting them on and removing them again, holding them up to his face, perplexed yet fascinated by the revelation that his vision is perfectly clear without the aid of his glasses, a discovery that marks a significant change."

Meanwhile, a man in a green flight suit, reminiscent of military aviation gear, stands on a levitating glider, a cutting-edge piece of technology designed for personal aerial mobility. Norman, deeply involved in experimental projects at Oscorp, turns to Strom as the general, a high-ranking military officer overseeing defense contracts, walks away, leaving Norman pensive about their ambitious and risky endeavors. In a suburban house, typical of a quiet American neighborhood, Peter's Uncle Ben changes a light bulb in the modest living room. Meanwhile, Peter, leaving his concerned aunt and uncle downstairs who worry about his recent struggles, absently makes his way upstairs to his room. He strips off his shirt and vest, revealing his skinny frame that belies his recent changes, wavering in front of a tall mirror, then collapses on his bed before rolling onto the floor. He grabs the tartan blanket, a keepsake from his family's Scottish heritage, from the bed and hauls it over himself. Flashing through Peter's mind are images of spiders, DNA, a helix being split, and another part being fused, a visualization of the transformative process he is undergoing, sending a surge of power through his body. At Oscorp, a major conglomerate known for its advanced technological developments, Norman strips to the waist and takes a bottle from Strom, gulping down its contents, a serum meant to enhance physical and mental capabilities. He flings the bottle to the floor, lifts open the metal on the sliding trolley, and lies down on it, ready for the next phase of the transformation. Strom fastens the manacles over Norman's chest, legs, and upper arms, firmly attaching him to the trolley to ensure his safety during the procedure. The grim-faced Strom hurries to a control panel as the trolley glides into a large glass chamber, designed for controlled experiments. The doors slide closed, the trolley raises from horizontal to vertical, and Norman remains firmly locked in, bracing for the transformation. Strom looks on as Norman nods to him, signaling his readiness. Strom pushes a switch and watches as a large file containing a green liquid, the catalyst for Norman's metamorphosis, empties, vapor rising in the chamber and engulfing Norman. Strom observes a computer-generated image of the green gas level in the chamber rising and monitors Norman's physiology as his heart rate increases to 140 beats per minute, indicative of the stress the body is under. Norman's body convulses, prompting Strom to run to the panel and vent the gas chamber to prevent fatal consequences. Norman's head shakes, showing only the whites of his eyes before he flat lines momentarily. Strom enters the chamber and attempts heart massage while standing up, using emergency medical procedure training. The pulse returns, Norman's eyes flash open, revealing a newfound intensity, and he grabs Strom by the throat, flinging him through the glass of the chamber with newfound strength. Now freed, Norman leaps out strong, his transformation complete. Meanwhile, Peter wakes from his fitful sleep, a result of his body's adaptation, and picks himself up off the floor, reaching for his spectacles. He puts them on, then quickly takes them off, trying again before removing them once more, realizing that his vision has corrected itself, a side effect of his altered DNA. He holds them up in front of his face, realizing that when he looks through them everything is blurred, but when he moves them away his vision is clear, a startling discovery of his new abilities."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
