A baby is held by him, and Marley is snapped at, whose paws are up on the breakfast table, taking an interest in Patrick's food. The implication is frowned at by John, and the moment captures the camera. At night, his old blue Honda is driven back home by him, and their new people carrier is parked up behind. He glances gloomily up, and Jenny holding the baby with Marley bouncing around playfully is seen through a window. Thoughtfully, he leans back in the driving seat. He is spotted sitting in the car by Jenny and gestured to, being asked if indoors is where he's actually going to come. Out of the car, he gets reluctantly. A blank expression is worn by him as he sits. Side by side at the table, Jenny and Patrick sit glumly as the baby is seen to by John. Patrick's food is eyed by Marley, as a book is tried to wrestle away from him by her. His head is shaken by John as the book is savaged by Marley. Later, the baby is tucked into his cot by Jenny, who then goes over to kiss Patrick, who's snug in his little bed. The blinds are shut, and the room is left by her, the door eased closed behind her. Softly, she walks on bare feet to her and John's room, where Marley lies on the bed. A pillow is put next to the dog by her, and she lies down on her back. Her lap holds Marley's head as he gently wags his tail. Her hands are clapped to her face in frustration, and to the boys' room, she stomps as Marley blunders excitedly from one window to another, a lamp knocked over and a blind pulled down in the process. The baby is put in his high chair by her, and Patrick is knocked over by Marley. Home is gotten by John, and on the sofa, a toy is chewed by Marley. A bag of dog food is handed to Sebastian by him. A pile of boxes is present, and the city is looked out at by him as Sebastian nods awkwardly. Back home, the sofa is dozed on by Jenny when John walks in.

Parked prominently in the driveway is a large, shiny, and impressively new car that glistens in the sunlight. Without any hint of a smile, he bends down to pick up the newspapers that are scattered haphazardly on the drive. With a baby cradled securely in his arms, he snaps at Marley, who has mischievously placed his paws up on the breakfast table, showing a keen and persistent interest in Patrick's food. John frowns deeply at the implication of Marley’s behavior, and this moment is captured vividly on camera.\n\nLater, as night falls, he returns home driving his old but ever-reliable blue Honda and parks it directly behind their new, spacious people carrier. With a gloomy expression on his face, he glances upwards and, through a nearby window, observes Jenny holding the baby closely while Marley bounces around playfully. Thoughtfully, he leans back in the driver’s seat, lost in contemplation. Noticing him sitting in the car, Jenny gestures to him, inquiring with her gestures if he has any intention of coming indoors. With reluctance, he eventually gets out of the car, his expression remaining blank and unreadable. Jenny and Patrick sit glumly side by side at the table as John moves to attend to the baby. Marley is stationed next to Patrick, casting a hopeful eye on his food, while she tries to wrest a book away from him. John shakes his head in disapproval as Marley savages the book with enthusiasm.\n\nLater on, Jenny gently tucks the baby into his cozy and comfortable cot, then lovingly goes over to kiss Patrick, who is nestled snugly in his little bed. She carefully shuts the blinds and quietly leaves the room, easing the door closed behind her with a soft click. She walks lightly on bare feet to her and John’s bedroom, where Marley is lying comfortably on the bed. She places a pillow next to the dog and lies down on her back. Marley rests his head tenderly in her lap, gently wagging his tail in contentment.

He unsmilingly bends down and picks the newspapers up off the drive, a daily routine for the suburban homeowner trying to stay informed in the digital age. Holding a baby, he snaps at Marley, who's paws up on the breakfast table and taking an interest in Patrick's food, much like a typical dog's behavior when tempted by human meals. John frowns at the implication, and the moment's captured on camera by the security system they recently installed to monitor the energetic dog. He arrives back home at night, driving his old blue Honda, a reliable model known for its longevity, and parks up behind their new people carrier, popular for its spaciousness and family-friendly design. Gloomily, he glances up, and through a window, sees Jenny holding the baby with Marley bouncing around, playfully, as if unaware of his chaotic impact on the household. He leans back thoughtfully in the driving seat. Jenny spots him sitting in the car and gestures to him, asking if he's actually going to come indoors, their usual signal when she's ready for a hand with the evening routine. He gets reluctantly out of the car. He sits with a blank expression, a symptom of their recent, unspoken tensions. Jenny and Patrick sit glumly side by side at the table as John goes and sees to the baby. Marley is next to Patrick, eyeing his food, as she's trying to wrestle a book away from him, a classic tug of war. John shakes his head as Marley savages the book, turning the battle into shreds of paper. Later, Jenny tucks the baby into his cot, a modern take on the traditional crib, then goes over to kiss Patrick, who's snug in his little bed, covered with superhero-themed sheets. She shuts the blinds and leaves the room, easing the door closed behind her, mindful not to disturb the children. She walks softly on bare feet to her and John's room, where Marley is lying on the bed, having claimed it as his own. She puts a pillow next to the dog and lies down on her back. Marley lies with his head in her lap, gently wagging his tail in rhythm with her breathing. She claps her hands to her face in frustration and stomps to the boys' room as Marley blunders excitedly from one window to another, knocking over a lamp, an antique gift from John's parents, and pulling down a blind in the process. She puts the baby in his high chair, typically used for feeding infants, and Marley knocks Patrick over, adding to the day's chaos. John gets home, and Marley's chewing a toy on the sofa, a recent purchase intended to distract him from the furniture. He hands a bag of dog food to Sebastian, their teenage neighbor who helps out with Marley. There's a pile of boxes, remnants of their recent move, and he looks out of the window at the city, a sprawling metropolis filled with skyscrapers and opportunity, as Sebastian nods awkwardly, unsure of what to say. Back home, Jenny's dozing on the sofa when John walks in. He sits opposite her, and she eyes him, shaking her head, a silent communication borne of years together. He smiles quizzically at her. Jenny's holding a newborn baby, smiling as a nurse pushes her in a wheelchair, a moment captured during their hospital discharge. Colleen sleeps in a swinging seat as the rest of the family and Marley play ball in the pool, relishing the simple joys of family time. He picks up the phone in the kitchen and walks back outside wearing a towel, a sign that he just finished cleaning the pool. John runs on the beach with Marley, and they jog past a tanned young woman in a skimpy bikini, a typical sight in beach towns known for their lively and diverse beachgoers. John stops for a breather, contemplating the peacefulness of the waves."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

After work, he sees Jenny with the baby and Marley playing. He reluctantly goes inside, finding Jenny and Patrick glum at the table, Marley eyeing food, and Jenny struggling with the baby. Later, Jenny tucks the baby into bed and joins John, frustrated by Marley’s antics. Marley causes chaos, knocking things over while Jenny manages the children. John returns home with dog food, sharing a quiet moment with Jenny who shakes her head at him in disappointment. As their family, including a newborn, enjoys time in the pool, John reflects outside. He and Marley later jog on the beach, passing a young woman. John takes a break, contemplating amidst the chaos of family life."
