Meanwhile, Ismay stands near the collapsible lifeboat, casting a quick but discerning glance at the crowd of anxious passengers who have gathered on the lower side of the bridge. After a brief moment of consideration, he turns his attention back to the collapsible. As Murdoch turns his attention away, Ismay seizes this opportunity to slip quietly and discreetly into a seat on the collapsible. Murdoch, upon noticing this move, finds himself staring intently at his mate, who is gazing purposefully ahead. With a stern, unwavering expression, Murdoch glowers at his mate while motioning downward with both arms, signaling the seamen to lower the collapsible. As it begins its descent below the deck, Ismay glances upward apprehensively. Nearby, Lightoller swiftly acts, grabbing a young girl and placing her securely in a lifeboat with care. Rose turns her attention fully to Jack, while Cal shifts his gaze, moving it from Jack to Rose with focus. In a sudden, decisive motion, Cal removes the blanket that had been wrapped snugly around Rose and thrusts it at Jack. He then takes off his own coat and gently places it around Rose's shoulders with tenderness. He starts to tenderly caress Rose's hair, but her instinctive reaction is to back away from him, prompting Jack to step up protectively to her side. A crewman then firmly grabs Rose and begins to guide her toward the lifeboat, with Jack and another crew member assisting her as she climbs carefully into the boat. As the lifeboat starts to lower gradually, Rose turns and reaches out, grasping Jack's outstretched hand, but the crewman pushes Jack back, causing the lifeboat to jerk slightly. Standing at the rail, both Cal and Jack gaze intently and with deep focus at Rose as the lifeboat descends steadily toward the water, and Rose stares back with a mix of emotions at Jack. Jack shifts his gaze from Cal to the descending boat below, while Rose looks around, her eyes glancing up at the ropes running carefully through the pulleys, and then back again at Jack.

Rose gazes back up at Jack, who stands firmly beside Cal, as another bright flare shoots into the dark sky above them, briefly illuminating Rose's face in stark light. More streaking flares cascade in brilliant arcs across the sky above Jack, and suddenly, with a determined, daring leap, Rose steps confidently to the edge of the lifeboat, jumps decisively from it, and hangs precariously from the ship's rail several decks below Jack. Two crew members quickly act, pulling her on board without delay, and she runs with urgency along the deck, while Jack turns and runs rapidly along the main deck, weaving quickly past passengers and crew members.

At the bottom of the stairs, Rose runs eagerly into his welcoming arms, and they embrace passionately, sharing a fervent kiss and then hugging tightly. Cal, standing on an upper landing, gazes down at them intently. Lovejoy steps promptly up to Cal, glances swiftly down, and then grabs Cal's shoulder firmly, pulling him away with urgency. As they step away from the railing, Cal suddenly makes a quick decision and grabs Lovejoy's gun from its holster, charging aggressively toward the stairs, pulling Rose away as she and Jack make their escape, with Cal tearing down the stairs in hot pursuit."

As Murdoch turns his attention elsewhere, Ismay seizes the opportunity to discreetly slip into a seat on the collapsible, while Murdoch's gaze inadvertently lands on his mate, who is staring intently ahead. Murdoch's expression hardens into a glower directed at his mate, as he gestures downward with both arms, signaling the seamen to lower the collapsible. As the lifeboat begins its descent below the deck, Ismay's eyes flicker upward, catching a glimpse of the scene above. In a swift motion, Lightoller reaches out, gently grabbing a young girl and carefully placing her into a lifeboat. Nearby, Rose turns her attention to Jack, while Cal's eyes shift between Jack and Rose, assessing the situation. With a decisive motion, Cal removes the blanket wrapped around Rose and thrusts it toward Jack, before shrugging off his own coat and draping it over Rose's shoulders. He reaches out to caress Rose's hair, but she instinctively recoils from his touch, prompting Jack to step forward protectively. A crewman intervenes, taking hold of Rose and guiding her toward the lifeboat, while Jack, along with another crew member, assists her in climbing into the boat. As Rose settles into the lifeboat, she turns back, her hand reaching out to grasp Jack's outstretched hand, but a crewman pushes Jack back, and the lifeboat jerks as it begins to lower. Standing at the rail, Cal and Jack watch intently as Rose descends toward the water, her eyes locked on Jack's. Jack's gaze shifts from Cal to the descending lifeboat, while Rose's eyes scan her surroundings, taking in the ropes running through the pulleys, before returning her focus to Jack. In the lifeboat, Rose notices a young girl beside her waving to her father, while her sister cries, and a crew member on deck shouts orders, his arms raised in command. Rose's gaze returns to Jack, who stands beside Cal, as a flare suddenly shoots into the dark sky, momentarily illuminating Rose's face. More flares streak across the sky above Jack, casting brief flashes of light, and in a sudden, impulsive decision, Rose steps to the edge of the lifeboat, leaps from it, and clings to the ship's rail several decks below Jack. Two crew members quickly pull her back on board, and she takes off running along the deck, while Jack turns and races along the main deck, weaving past passengers and crew members. Rose continues her sprint along the lower deck, as Jack rushes inside, descending the grand staircase with urgency. At the bottom of the stairs, Rose collides into his arms, and they embrace tightly, sharing a passionate kiss before hugging each other closely. Overhead, Cal watches them from an upper landing, his expression unreadable. Lovejoy steps up to him, casting a glance downward, before grabbing Cal's shoulder and pulling him away from the scene. As they move away from the railing, Cal's hand darts to Lovejoy's holster, retrieving the gun, and he charges toward the stairs, intent on pursuing Rose and Jack, who are fleeing in haste, with Cal tearing down the stairs in hot pursuit."

Meanwhile, Ismay, the managing director of the White Star Line, stands by the collapsible lifeboat, glancing at a crowd of passengers on the lower side of the bridge before turning back to the emergency vessel. While Murdoch, the ship's First Officer tasked with loading lifeboats, turns away, Ismay slips into a seat on the collapsible, and Murdoch finds himself staring at his mate, a fellow officer, who gazes ahead. Murdoch glowers at his mate while motioning downward with both arms, signaling the seamen to lower the collapsible, and as it drops below the deck, Ismay glances up, perhaps second-guessing his decision. Lightoller, the ship's Second Officer known for his strict adherence to protocol, grabs a young girl and places her in a lifeboat. Rose turns to Jack, her fellow passenger and confidant during the voyage, while Cal, Rose's affluent and controlling fiancé, glances from Jack to Rose. Cal pulls off the blanket wrapped around Rose and shoves it at Jack before removing his own coat, a symbol of his wealth, and placing it around Rose's shoulders. He starts to caress Rose's hair, but she backs away from him, and Jack steps up to her, ready to defend her. A crewman, tasked with ensuring safety aboard the lifeboat, grabs Rose and guides her toward the lifeboat, and Jack, along with another crew member, helps Rose climb into the boat. Rose turns and grasps Jack's outstretched hand as the crewman pushes Jack back and the lifeboat jerks, signifying its descent. Standing at the rail, Cal and Jack gaze at Rose as the lifeboat lowers toward the frigid Atlantic waters, and Rose stares back at Jack, torn between two worlds. Jack looks from Cal, his rival for Rose's affection, to the descending boat, while Rose looks around, up at the ropes running through the pulleys, a critical part of the lifeboat's lowering mechanism, and back at Jack. Rose sees a young girl next to her waving to her father while her sister cries, as a crew member on deck yells orders with arms raised out at his sides, trying to maintain order amidst the chaos. Rose gazes back up at Jack, who stands beside Cal, as another flare, a distress signal for nearby ships, shoots into the dark sky above them and briefly illuminates Rose's face. More streaking flares cascade in the sky above Jack as the Titanic sends out SOS signals, and suddenly Rose, driven by her determination, steps to the edge of the lifeboat, leaps from it, and hangs from the ship's rail several decks below Jack. Two crew members pull her on board, ensuring her safety, and she runs along the deck, searching for Jack, while Jack turns and runs along the main deck, past passengers intent on survival and crew members scrambling to maintain order. Rose runs along the lower deck, as Jack rushes inside and runs down the grand staircase, the opulent centerpiece of the ship. At the bottom of the stairs, Rose runs into his arms, and they embrace, kiss, and then hug, a reunion in the face of disaster. Cal gazes down at them from an upper landing, angered and frustrated. Stepping up to him, Lovejoy, Cal's valet and confidant, glances down, grabs Cal's shoulder, and pulls him away, knowing the severity of their situation. As they step away from the railing, Cal grabs Lovejoy's gun from its holster, an act of desperation, and runs toward the stairs, pulling Rose away as Rose and Jack flee, determined to escape the sinking ship, and Cal tears down the stairs after them, a man driven by jealousy and fear."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
