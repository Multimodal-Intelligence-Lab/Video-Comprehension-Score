As Reggie exits her chamber and proceeds to the lift, she observes that it is occupied after pressing the button, so she proceeds to the stairway and starts descending. Between the landings, the stairway coils around the open lift shaft, and as Reggie descends the stairway, the enclosure with Adam inside ascends into sight. For a moment, she pauses and their gazes meet before Reggie begins sprinting downstairs. Adam presses the emergency halt button and begins the enclosure's descent. As Reggie exits the stairway, passes the lift gate, and heads toward the foyer, the enclosure is a few feet behind her. Reggie continues to sprint between the first landing and the foyer, with the lift following. A cab stands by the curb as Reggie exits the inn and sprints to it.

Reggie halts for a moment at a sign indicating two different routes, with an arrow for each. The camera pans sharply, 180 degrees, to capture Adam rounding the bend in hot pursuit. Reggie begins down the platform, glancing behind her every few steps, and suddenly glances up in astonishment to see Adam across the tracks on the opposite platform; he has evidently made the incorrect turn back in the corridor. They gaze at each other for a moment before a chime rings, heralding the arrival of a train. Adam turns, running back through the exit behind him, as the approaching train can be heard. As the train pulls in and comes to a stop, the officer opens the portal for Adam and escorts him out. Adam turns once more to glance at Reggie as he goes, then quickly returns to the exit portal and glances at the platform. From Adam's perspective, featuring him as he rushes from the carriage, he finds his path obstructed by five nuns in large, white butterfly bonnets, taking him a few precious seconds to maneuver around them. He stands on the platform as the train portals slam shut, the latches click, the whistle sounds, and the train departs. He glances around in all directions for some indication of Reggie.

Without wasting any time, she hurries toward the door. As Reggie exits her room, making her way to the elevator, she notices that it is already in use when she presses the button. Consequently, she decides to take the stairs and begins her descent. The staircase winds around the open elevator shaft between landings, and as Reggie makes her way down, the elevator cage containing Adam comes into view. For a brief moment, she pauses, and their eyes lock before Reggie starts quickly running downstairs again. Adam, reacting swiftly, pushes the emergency stop button and starts the cage moving downward.

Reggie continues to sprint, traveling the space between the first landing and the lobby while the elevator follows closely. Outside the hotel, a taxi is parked by the curb, ready and waiting, as Reggie dashes out to reach it. Meanwhile, Adam tries unsuccessfully to maneuver past him to catch a glimpse of Reggie but gives up and turns back, sprinting toward the ticket booth.

Without a moment to lose, she quickly makes her way toward the door, determined and brisk. As Reggie exits the confines of her room and heads toward the elevator, she observes that it is already in use when she presses the call button. Consequently, without hesitation, she opts for the staircase and promptly begins her descent. The staircase winds its way around the open shaft of the elevator between the landings, and as Reggie descends, the elevator cage, within which Adam stands, gradually comes into her view. She pauses momentarily, their eyes meeting briefly, before Reggie swiftly resumes her hurried pace down the stairs. Reacting with similar urgency, Adam presses the emergency stop button and sets the cage in motion to descend. As Reggie reaches the bottom of the staircase, passing the elevator gate, and heads into the lobby area, the elevator approaches just a few feet behind her. Reggie continues her rapid sprint, covering the distance between the first landing and the lobby while the elevator trails closely. Outside the hotel, a taxi is conveniently parked by the curb, prepared and waiting, as Reggie dashes out to reach it. Meanwhile, Adam, in his attempt, unsuccessfully tries to maneuver past an obstacle to glimpse Reggie but ultimately gives up and turns back, racing toward the ticket booth. The camera captures Reggie as she speeds through the nearly deserted passageway, her footsteps resonating sharply against the tile and concrete walls.

Reggie exits her room with urgency and heads to the elevator, pressing the button and realizing it's currently occupied, prompting her to make a swift decision to take the stairs. As she begins her descent, she notices the stairs wrapping around the open elevator shaft, and as she progresses downward, the elevator cage carrying Adam ascends into view. Pausing momentarily, their eyes lock in a silent exchange before Reggie resumes her hurried pace down the staircase. Meanwhile, Adam reacts by pressing the emergency stop button, initiating the descent of the elevator cage. Upon reaching the bottom of the stairs, Reggie moves past the elevator gate and starts toward the lobby, aware that the cage is trailing only a few feet behind. She maintains her momentum, moving briskly between the first landing and the lobby, where the elevator continues to follow in her wake. Once outside the hotel, Reggie spots a taxi waiting by the curb, dashing toward it with determination. Adam, attempting to catch a glimpse of Reggie, ultimately concedes and pivots back toward the ticket booth in a bid to catch up. The camera captures Reggie as she sprints through the nearly deserted passageway, her footsteps echoing off the tiles and concrete walls, while vibrant advertising posters blur by in a whirlwind of letters, figures, and colors. She momentarily hesitates at a crossroads marked by a sign with arrows pointing in two different directions. As she deliberates, the camera swiftly swings 180 degrees to reveal Adam rounding the corner in an earnest chase. Reggie embarks down the platform, casting nervous glances over her shoulder, only to suddenly look up in shock upon seeing Adam across the tracks on the opposite platform, an indication that he misjudged his way in the passageway. They share a brief, intense gaze until a bell tolls, alerting them to the train's imminent arrival. Adam pivots again, racing back through the exit behind him just as the sound of the approaching train heightens. As the train arrives and halts, a gendarme opens the door for Adam, escorting him out. Adam glances back at Reggie one last time before swiftly turning toward the exit, redirecting his focus to the platform. From Adam's perspective, he is momentarily impeded by a group of five nuns in expansive, white butterfly hats, which cost him several crucial seconds as he maneuvers around them. He stands on the platform as the train doors clatter shut, the latches secure, the whistle shrills, and the train begins its departure. Frantically, he scans his surroundings for any indication of Reggie's presence but finds nothing. Entering an abandoned area, he discovers with incredulity that there's no trace of Reggie.

As Reggie, staying in a Parisian hotel known for its art deco charm, leaves her room and goes to the elevator, she notices that it is in use after pressing the button, so she goes to the stairs and starts down. Between the landings, the stairs curve around the open elevator shaft, designed with intricate wrought iron, and as Reggie comes down the stairs, the cage with Adam inside rises into view. For a moment, she stops and their eyes meet before Reggie starts running downstairs. Adam, quick to act in tense situations due to his background in law enforcement, pushes the emergency stop button and starts the cage down. As Reggie comes off the stairs, passes the elevator gate, and starts toward the lobby, the cage is a few feet behind her. Reggie continues to run between the first landing and the lobby, with the elevator following. A taxi stands by the curb as Reggie leaves the hotel and runs to it, its driver accustomed to late-night pickups in bustling city areas. Adam tries to look past him to see Reggie but gives up and goes back toward the ticket booth, usually manned by a sleepy attendant during night shifts, on the run. The camera leads Reggie as she runs through the nearly empty passageway of the metro station, her footsteps echoing against the tile and concrete walls, typical of 1960s transport architecture. The jumble of advertising posters passes rapidly, forming a moving band of letters, women, cartoons, and colors, reflecting post-war commercial exuberance. Reggie pauses for a moment at a sign indicating two different directions, with an arrow for each, a common sight in the labyrinthine Paris Metro network. The camera pans sharply, 180 degrees, to pick up Adam rounding the corner in hot pursuit. Reggie starts down the platform, looking behind her every few steps, and suddenly looks up in surprise to see Adam across the tracks on the opposite platform; he has evidently made the wrong turn back in the passageway. They stare at each other for a moment before a bell rings, announcing the arrival of a train, one of the iconic locomotives that whiz through the city's heart. Adam turns, running back through the exit behind him, as the approaching train can be heard. As the train pulls in and comes to a stop, the gendarme, a symbol of French public security, opens the door for Adam and escorts him out. Adam turns once more to look at Reggie as he goes, then quickly returns to the exit door and looks at the platform. From Adam's point of view, featuring him as he hurries from the car, he finds his way blocked by five nuns in large, white butterfly hats, a distinctive headdress associated with the Daughters of Charity. It takes him a few precious seconds to work his way around them. He stands on the platform as the train doors slam shut, the latches click, the whistle blows, and the train pulls out with a mechanical grace typical of the era's technology. He looks around in all directions for some sign of Reggie. As Adam enters the deserted area, there is, miraculously, no sign of Reggie. The camera pans to a phone booth, where we see Reggie's hand reaching up to dial a number, the rotary dial slowly spinning, preserving her anonymity for just a little longer."

As Julian departs his office and heads to the conveyor belt, he realizes it is in motion after tapping the lever, so he heads to the escalator and floats up. Between the galleries, the escalator spirals around the empty carousel, and as Julian floats on the escalator, the crate with Bella inside descends into sight. For an instant, it pauses and their glares lock before Julian starts gliding upward. Bella tugs the panic lever and begins the crate up. As Julian rises off the escalator, swings by the carousel gate, and glides toward the courtyard, the crate is several inches above him. Julian continues to glide between the third gallery and the courtyard, with the carousel trailing. A bicycle rolls by the mailbox as Julian exits the museum and glides toward it. Bella attempts to peer beyond her to spot Julian but relents and goes forward toward the snack stand, on the glide. The lens guides Julian as he soars through the nearly vacant corridor, his sneakers tapping against the glass and marble tiles. The chaos of campaign placards flashes quickly, forming a sliding pattern of numbers, robots, puzzles, and shapes. Julian halts briefly at a placard indicating two separate routes, with a fin for each. The lens swivels swiftly, 180 degrees, to capture Bella veering around the nook in warm pursuit. Julian starts along the terrace, glancing behind every couple of strides, and suddenly raises his head in disbelief to spot Bella across the ramps on the opposing terrace; she has apparently taken the incorrect path in the corridor. They glare at one another for a moment before a siren wails, signaling the arrival of a ferry. Bella pivots, gliding back through the arch behind her, as the nearing ferry can be detected.

Bella glances once more to spot Julian as she leaves, then briskly returns to the archway and glimpses at the terrace.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby cafÃ©, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
