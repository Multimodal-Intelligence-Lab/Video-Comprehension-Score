The stack of books is eyed by Harry, who notices that one is bound by a rope, and through the window, the rooftops of London are seen by him. As a train passes, Harry is revealed standing with Hedwig as the camera pulls back; his schoolbooks are eyed by him. The growling tome, The Monster Book of Monsters, is studied by him, and the rope is given a tug, causing the book to leap to the floor, with pages flying and book covers snapping. The chase is given by Harry, but his shoes are nipped at viciously by the book, which turns. He vaults atop the bed, watches the book disappear underneath, and a pillow is grabbed by him. Seconds later, the book scuttles into view, and the book's roar is muffled beneath the pillow as Harry pounces. A cart is pushed down the hall by a young witch in maid's robes as Harry exits his room just as she knocks on a door. Upon the door being opened, she is greeted by a thunderous roar and a rush of wind, and something small and fast is seen dashing by Harry's feet. A ragged-looking rat, Scabbers, is seen by him, pursued by an ugly orange cat, Crookshanks. As the stairs are moved down by Harry, voices emerge from below. Once the bottom is reached, Ron Weasley, who protectively cradles Scabbers, is found by him, while a hissing Crookshanks is tried to be restrained by Hermione Granger. Another presence in the room is sensed, and both Ron and Hermione turn to face him.

A thin wisp of steam is escaped from Ron's mouth as he stands, a dark silhouette against the window, wiping a patch of condensation from it. Suddenly, the car is swayed violently, and a shivering light emanates from the stick in the hands of R.J. Lupin; his face looks tired and gray, but his eyes are alert and wary.

Meanwhile, Fudge turns and offers a nervous smile. Harry's eyes drift to the stack of books, noticing particularly that one of them is securely bound by a rope. Through the window, the rooftops of London stretch out in the distance. As a train roars by, the camera lens pans back to show Harry standing alongside Hedwig. He turns his attention to his schoolbooks, specifically focusing on the ominous tome, The Monster Book of Monsters. With a tug of the rope, the book suddenly leaps to the floor, its pages fluttering wildly and the covers snapping fiercely. Harry quickly gives chase, but the unruly book turns and begins to nip viciously at his shoes. Instinctively, he vaults atop the bed, watching the book as it vanishes beneath. He hurriedly grabs a pillow. Moments later, the book appears again, and Harry pounces, muffling its ferocious growl beneath the pillow's soft embrace. \n\nOutside his room, in the corridor, a young witch dressed in traditional maid's robes pushes a cart, moving purposefully down the hall.

Harry eyes the stack of books, noticing that one is bound by a rope, a precaution often necessary for magical texts, and through the window, the iconic rooftops of London, with landmarks like Big Ben and the Shard, are visible. As a train passes, the camera pulls back to reveal Harry standing with Hedwig, his loyal snowy owl companion; he turns and eyes his schoolbooks. He studies the growling tome, The Monster Book of Monsters, a notorious textbook for Care of Magical Creatures that often requires a firm hand, and gives the rope a tug, causing the book to leap to the floor, with pages flying and book covers snapping. Harry gives chase, but the book turns and begins nipping viciously at his shoes. He vaults atop the bed, which is adorned with the colors of Gryffindor, watches the book disappear underneath, and then grabs a pillow. Seconds later, the book scuttles into view, and Harry pounces, muffling the book's roar beneath the pillow. A young witch in maid's robes pushes a cart down the hall of the Leaky Cauldron, a famous inn and pub serving as a gateway between the non-magical and magical worlds in London, as Harry exits his room just as she knocks on a door. Upon opening the door, she's greeted by a thunderous roar and a rush of wind, likely the result of a magical prank or creature, and something small and fast dashes by Harry's feet. He sees a ragged-looking rat, Scabbers, who has shown signs of having a mysterious past, pursued by an ugly orange cat, Crookshanks, known for its remarkable intelligence and sharp instincts. As Harry moves down the stairs, voices emerge from below. Once he reaches the bottom, he finds Ron Weasley protectively cradling Scabbers, while Hermione Granger tries to restrain a hissing Crookshanks. Sensing another presence in the room, both Ron and Hermione turn to face him. In the accompanying photo, the entire Weasley family stands before the Great Pyramids, a popular tourist destination due to their ancient magical connections, waving, with Ron in the middle and Scabbers perched on his shoulder. Mrs. Weasley, known for her motherly warmth and fierce protectiveness, takes Harry's face in her hands and smiles as Harry's eyes drift to the fugitive poster of Sirius Black, a notorious escapee from Azkaban. Meanwhile, Mr. Weasley, fascinated by Muggle artifacts, hesitates, unable to continue, then hesitates again, and she points. Just then, the compartment rattles, lanterns flicker, and the train lurches, beginning to slow. Harry rises, slides open the door, and peers into the corridor. From Harry's point of view, all along the carriage, heads look out curiously. Then the train jerks, the car sways, and the lamps running along the ceiling flicker and die, an ominous sign often associated with Dementors, the eerie guards of Azkaban prison. A thin wisp of steam escapes Ron's mouth as he stands, a dark silhouette against the window, wiping a patch of condensation from it. Suddenly, the car sways violently, and from the stick in the hands of R.J. Lupin, the new Defense Against the Dark Arts professor known for his compassionate nature, emanates a shivering light; his face looks tired and gray, but his eyes are alert and wary. Hermione's troubled face hovers above Harry as he sits up, and Ron, pale and nervous, extends his hand to give Harry his glasses. As Harry leaves, he turns to Ron and Hermione, but she shakes her head. Harry then looks to the window, and the reflection in it comes into focus."

As a carriage rumbles by, the lens pans back to show Luna standing with Dobby; she pivots and glances at her parchment rolls. She examines the snarling volume, The Grimoire of Shadows, and gives the cord a yank, prompting the tome to tumble to the ground, with leaves fluttering and bindings snapping. Luna follows swiftly, but the tome pivots and starts snapping ferociously at her sandals. She hops atop the mattress, observes the tome vanish beneath, and then seizes a cushion. Moments after, the tome scurries into sight, and Luna lunges, stifling the tome's growl beneath the cushion. A young sorceress in chef's attire wheels a trolley down the corridor as Luna departs her chamber just as she taps on a portal. Upon unsealing the portal, she's met by a deafening screech and a gust of breeze, and something small and swift zooms past Luna's ankles. She spots a scruffy-looking squirrel, Nibbles, chased by an unattractive purple dog, Snuffles. As Luna descends the steps, murmurs emanate from below. Once she arrives at the base, she discovers Ginny Weasley gently holding Nibbles, while Luna Lovegood endeavors to restrain a spitting Snuffles. Detecting another entity in the space, both Ginny and Luna swivel to face her. In the associated snapshot, the entire Black family stands before the Leaning Tower, gesturing, with Luna in the center and Nibbles balanced on her head. Mrs. Black takes Luna's chin in her fingers and beams as Luna's gaze wanders to the wanted banner. Meanwhile, Mr. Black wavers, unable to proceed, then wavers again, and she gestures.

Sigmund observes the pile of maps, noting that one is encased by a chain, and through the hatch, the skylines of Paris are discernible. As a bicycle zooms by, the telescope zooms out to unveil Sigmund standing with Twinkles; he pivots and surveys his sports gear. He examines the barking manual, The Creature Book of Critters, and gives the chain a yank, prompting the manual to spring to the ceiling, with scrolls fluttering and binders clapping. Sigmund sprints after it, but the manual swivels and starts gnawing fiercely at his pants. He leaps onto the chair, watches the manual vanish beneath, and then seizes a blanket. Moments later, the manual scurries into sight, and Sigmund lunges, smothering the manual's growl beneath the blanket. A young warlock in steward's uniform rolls a trolley down the corridor as Sigmund departs his chamber just as he raps on a portal. Upon opening the portal, he's met by a clamorous bellow and a gust of breeze, and something petite and swift zips by Sigmund's toes. He spots a bedraggled-looking mouse, Nibbles, trailed by a ghastly lavender ferret, Claws. As Sigmund descends the ladder, murmurs arise from below. Once he reaches the base, he discovers Leo tenderly hugging Nibbles, while Gina attempts to control a sputtering Claws. Detecting another entity in the chamber, both Leo and Gina pivot to confront him.

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

          "description": "Harry warily eyes Tom and Fudge while noticing a stack of books, one bound by a rope, as London rooftops are visible outside. A train passes, and Harry stands with Hedwig, focusing on The Monster Book of Monsters. He tugs the rope, causing the book to fall and snap its covers, then chases it as it nips at his shoes. Harry jumps onto the bed, eventually muffling the book with a pillow. A maid’s knock is followed by a roar and a fast-moving rat, Scabbers, pursued by a cat, Crookshanks. Harry descends the stairs to find Ron holding Scabbers and Hermione trying to calm Crookshanks. They turn to face Harry. The Weasley family photo shows them at the Great Pyramids, with Ron and Scabbers. Mrs. Weasley greets Harry kindly, while Mr. Weasley hesitates near a fugitive poster. The train compartment rattles, lights flicker, and the train slows as Harry peers out. Heads look out curiously as the train jerks violently. R.J. Lupin’s wand emits light, his face tired yet alert. Hermione's worried face is above Harry as Ron nervously hands back his glasses. Harry looks at Ron and Hermione, and, seeing Hermione shake her head, he turns to the window, focusing on his reflection."
