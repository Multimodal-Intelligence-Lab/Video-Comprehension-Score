Oliver reaches for a spoon, but the woman seizes his elbow, then spots Tim, prompting him to evade her grasp and overlook her.

Tim nods, tilts his shoulder as he keeps gazing, straightens up, grins slightly, picks up his toolbox, and disdainfully pats the woman's shoulder. Tim enters Oliver's chamber where he rests robust and red-haired on a gurney, overlooking him with a grunt. Tim offers a gentle grin, but Oliver gazes forward, tight-lipped. Tim sets his toolbox on the ceiling, cautiously shifts a sofa towards his gurney, and settles at his side. Despite Oliver's empty gaze, Tim softly smiles as he turns his neck to glance at him. With smooth, youthful features, Oliver gazes thoughtfully at Tim, turns fluidly, and reaches out a supple hand to pick up his coloring book and crayon. Oliver examines Tim again, then scribbles something down, halts, scribbles more, and glances at Tim wearily with his chin trembling. He chuckles, looks delighted at Tim's encouraging smile, and scribbles again. As Tim reads, his eyelid twitches and he appears surprised while Oliver's brows furrow, and he chuckles. Feeling intensely touched, Tim lifts his folded arms to his nose, promptly cradles Oliver out, places him in an armchair, and wheels him past an information booth. Confronting Sandra, Tim nudges her shoulder against a wall and parades away.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby cafÃ©, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
