Dressed in a silk kimono, she comes out and is looked at by him as extraordinarily beautiful, and toward him, she is drawn as her face and neck begin to be kissed by him.

Fergus, with a gentle touch, trails his hand down the curve of her throat, and she, in response, guides him with an eager hand behind a softly draped curtain leading toward the bed. There, she draws him down alongside her, their lips meeting in a passionate and fervent kiss. After a moment, she rises and makes her way into the bathroom, leaving Fergus lying there, contemplating the picture as he listens to the soothing sound of running water. Shortly after, she reappears, now adorned in a luxurious silk kimono, looking exceptionally beautiful. Fergus feels a magnetic pull towards her and begins to plant tender kisses on her face and neck. Softly murmuring her objections, she gently whispers no as his hands slide the wrap from her shoulders, only to pause. The kimono slips off and gently drapes onto the floor with a soft, whisper-like sound, and at this moment, the camera follows its descent, focusing closely to reveal the unexpected truthâ€”that she is, in fact, a man. Stunned into silence, Fergus remains seated, immobilized, his gaze fixed on her in disbelief, unable to utter a single word. She lets out a peculiar, almost nervous laugh and reaches out with a tentative hand to touch him, but he reacts sharply, slapping her hand away, before bolting upright and rushing to the bathroom. She grabs at his feet in a desperate attempt to hold him, but he kicks her away, making a frantic dash into the bathroom, where he succumbs to his emotions and vomits into the tub. As the door slams shut with finality, she lights a cigarette, sitting on the couch clad in her kimono once more, presenting a striking image of femininity despite the faint trace of blood that tinges her lips. When Fergus eventually emerges from the bathroom, she looks up from her spot on the couch, her face betraying a glimmer of hope as he makes to leave. Attempting to prevent his departure, she grabs at him in a plea, but he wrenches free, causing her to tumble to the ground. Fergus sits down as Col turns to him, but when he reaches to touch her arm, she swiftly pulls it away and, without another word, strides into the gathering crowd, making her way toward the door. Fergus exits as well, stepping outside the confines of Dil's place, where the blinds in her room remain drawn, yet a light burns brightly inside. From the street, we catch a glimpse of her silhouette as she paces back and forth behind the blinds, cigarette smoke curling in the air.

As she draws nearer to the construction site, a chorus of whistles erupts from those around. Hearing the commotion of whistles, Fergus looks out in surprise and sees Dil making her way toward the site.

It is there that she draws him down alongside her, and their lips meet in a passionate and fervent kiss that seems to speak volumes. After a fleeting moment, she rises and makes her way into the bathroom, leaving Fergus lying there, absorbed in contemplation, as he listens to the soothing sound of running water coming from the other room.

As Fergus gently runs his hand down the length of her throat, a delicate shiver seems to traverse her skin. She seizes his hand with a subtle urgency, guiding him behind a curtain toward the bed, where the world momentarily disappears as she pulls him down, their lips meeting in a fervent, passionate kiss. After a lingering moment, she stands up and quietly walks into the bathroom. Fergus remains on the bed, his eyes fixated on a picture, his ears attuned to the soft, soothing rhythm of running water. Emerging from the bathroom, she is now dressed in an exquisite silk kimono, her beauty seemingly magnified, and he is irresistibly drawn to her, beginning to place gentle kisses on her face and neck. As his hands tenderly slip the wrap from her shoulders, she softly murmurs, \"no,\" causing him to pause. The kimono descends gracefully to the floor, the fabric whispering against the air, and as the camera follows, it reveals in a poignant close-up that she is, in fact, a man. Fergus sits, immobilized, stunned into silence, his eyes locked onto her in disbelief. She emits a peculiar, almost vulnerable laugh, and reaches out to touch him, but in a moment of raw emotion, he swats her hand away, rising abruptly to flee to the bathroom. Desperately, she tries to hold him back by grabbing his feet, but he shakes her off, rushing into the bathroom and succumbing to his turmoil by retching into the tub. Meanwhile, she lights a cigarette, a thin trail of smoke curling into the air as Fergus slams the door shut behind him. Seated on the couch, she wraps the kimono around herself once more, her appearance undeniably feminine, with a faint trace of blood on her mouth. The bathroom door opens, revealing Fergus, who hesitates, and she glances up at him, a flicker of hope in her eyes, but as he starts to leave, she reaches out to stop him. He pulls away from her grasp, causing her to stumble and fall to the floor. Fergus sits as Col turns toward him, reaching out to tenderly touch her arm, but she pulls away sharply, striding purposefully into the crowd toward the door. Fergus eventually leaves the place, stepping outside and noticing the blinds drawn in Dil's room, with the light illuminating her silhouette as she paces back and forth behind the blinds, smoking a cigarette. In a nearby scene, a man uses a pole to remove a large number six from a massive scoreboard, replacing it with a number nine. Beneath this display, Dil is visible walking across a verdant lawn toward the building where Fergus is engaged in his work. Fergus is in the midst of fitting a new window into a completed wall, and through the undulating glass, cricketers can be seen on the field, their forms distorted by the movement. Across the pitch, Dil approaches with a lunch basket in hand, her outfit a daringly short skirt paired with high heels. As she nears the work site, a chorus of whistles erupts from the onlookers. Hearing the commotion, Fergus looks up to see Dil nearing the site, and in a moment of distraction, he accidentally drops the window, resulting in the glass shattering into pieces. The whistling continues unabated as Dil steps into the site's lift, which begins to ascend. Meanwhile, Deveroux and Franknum are seen climbing a ladder toward Fergus, and amidst their exchange, Fergus can still hear the amplified chorus of wolf whistles echoing around him."

Fergus, whose touch is gentle despite the intensity of the moment, runs his hand down her throat, and she draws him behind a curtain toward the bed, pulling him down as they kiss passionately. She then walks into the bathroom, and Fergus lies there, looking at the picture of her that captures an earlier, carefree moment, listening to the sound of running water that echoes in the small, tiled space. She comes out dressed in a silk kimono, a traditional Japanese garment known for its elegance, looking extraordinarily beautiful, and he draws her toward him, beginning to kiss her face and neck. She murmurs no as his hands slip the wrap down from her shoulders, then stop abruptly. The kimono falls to the floor gently, with a whisper that seems to signify a delicate moment shattered, and the camera travels with it, revealing in a close-up that she is a man, a revelation that challenges Fergus's understanding of identity. Fergus sits there, frozen, staring at her, saying nothing as the weight of this new reality settles in. She gives a strange little laugh, a nervous response that betrays her vulnerability, and reaches out to touch him, but he smacks her hand away, overwhelmed and confused, then gets up and runs to the bathroom. She grabs his feet, desperate to reconnect, but he kicks her away, runs into the bathroom, and vomits into the tub, a visceral reaction to his emotional turmoil. She lights a cigarette, the smoke curling around her as Fergus slams the door shut, a symbolic barrier between them. She sits on the couch, the kimono round her once more, looking very much like a woman, with a trace of blood on her mouth that hints at the recent struggle. Fergus comes out of the bathroom, and she looks up, some hope in her face, as he makes to go. She grabs him to stop him, but he pulls away, and she falls to the floor, her longing unfulfilled. Fergus sits as Col turns to him, and he touches her arm, but she whips her arm away, carrying her wounded pride and walks into the crowd, toward the door, disappearing into anonymity. Fergus leaves and walks outside Dil's place, a modest apartment in a bustling neighborhood, where the blinds in her room are down, and the light is on inside. We see her outline, pacing up and down behind the blinds, smoking a cigarette, a solitary figure lost in thought. A man, part of a cricket match in full swing, removes a large number six from a huge scoreboard with a pole and replaces it with a number nine, signaling a change in the game. Below the scoreboard, we see Dil walking across a lawn toward the building where Fergus is working, a construction site that symbolizes new beginnings. Fergus is fitting a new window into the finished wall, and on the pitch, we see cricketers distorted through the moving glass of the window, their lively energy contrasting with his internal struggle. Across the pitch, Dil walks with a lunch basket in her hand, dressed in a very short skirt with high heels, her appearance causing a stir. As she approaches the site, a chorus of whistles breaks out, a crude acknowledgment from the workers. Fergus, hearing the whistling, stares out and sees Dil moving toward the site, his heart caught between past and present. He drops the window, and the glass shatters, a symbol of his fractured state. As the whistles continue, we see Dil in the site's lift, which rises up, elevating her above the noise and chaos below. Meanwhile, we see Deveroux and Franknum, colleagues well-known for their gossiping nature, climbing up a ladder toward Fergus, and through this conversation, Fergus can hear the chorus of wolf whistles increasing, a soundtrack to his confusion and unresolved emotions."

The refrigerator then walks into the attic, and the envelope lies there, looking at the painting and listening to the sound of running marbles. The refrigerator comes out dressed in a wool poncho, looking extraordinarily colorful, and the envelope draws it toward itself, beginning to hug its frame and elbow. The refrigerator murmurs no as the envelope's pens slip the shawl down from its branches, then pause. The poncho falls to the floor gently, with a murmur, and the camera travels with it, revealing in a close-up that the refrigerator is a guitar. The envelope sits there, frozen, staring at the refrigerator, saying nothing. The refrigerator gives a strange little chuckle and reaches out to touch the envelope, but it smacks the refrigerator's handle away, gets up, and runs to the attic. The refrigerator grabs its wheels, but it kicks the refrigerator away, runs into the attic, and sings into the drum. The refrigerator lights a candle as the envelope slams the door shut. The refrigerator sits on the rug, the poncho round it once more, looking very much like a cello, with a trace of ink on its lid. The envelope comes out of the attic, and the refrigerator looks up, some hope in its lid, as the envelope makes to go. The refrigerator grabs it to stop it, but it pulls away, and the refrigerator falls to the carpet. The envelope sits as the clock turns to it, and it touches the refrigerator's pedal, but it whips its pedal away and walks into the gallery, toward the exit. The envelope leaves and walks outside the canvas's studio, where the blinds in its room are down, and the flame is on inside. We see its outline, pacing up and down behind the blinds, smoking a candle. A giraffe removes a large number five from a tiny calendar with a basket and replaces it with a number seven. Below the calendar, we see the canvas walking across a meadow toward the cave where the envelope is painting. The envelope is fitting a new brick into the finished mural, and on the meadow, we see acrobats distorted through the moving glass of the brick. Across the meadow, the canvas walks with a picnic ribbon in its pedal, dressed in a very tall hat with soft slippers. As it approaches the cave, a chorus of bells breaks out. The envelope, hearing the bells, stares out and sees the canvas moving toward the cave. It drops the brick, and the glass shatters. As the bells continue, we see the canvas in the cave's elevator, which rises up.

He then glides into the garden, and the turtle sprawls there, glancing at the postcard and humming to the rhythm of chirping crickets. He returns adorned in denim jeans, appearing remarkably handsome, and she guides him beside her, initiating a conversation while patting his shoulder. He mutters yes as her fingers tug the blanket from her toes, then still. The jeans drift to the carpet softly, with a murmur, and the camera zooms with it, disclosing in a close-up that he is a woman. The turtle reclines there, stunned, gazing at him, uttering nothing. He emits a peculiar small chuckle and extends to nudge her, but she brushes his hand aside, stands up, and strolls to the garden. He seizes her ankles, but she nudges him away, races into the garden, and coughs into the flowerbed. He dons a hat as the turtle shuts the gate firmly. He reclines by the hearth, the jeans around him once more, looking very much like a man, with a speck of paint on his cheek. The turtle exits the garden, and he gazes down, some skepticism in his eyes, as she prepares to leave. He seizes her to halt her, but she shrugs away, and he trips to the rug. The turtle reclines as Deveroux turns to her, and she taps his shoulder, but he flinches his shoulder away and strides into the throng, toward the atrium. The turtle departs and wanders outside Deveroux's room, where the drapes in his studio are up, and the fan is off inside. We envision her silhouette, spinning up and down behind the drapes, chewing a gumdrop. A woman extracts a large number three from a massive clock with a stick and swaps it with a number eight. Beneath the clock, we glimpse Deveroux ambling across a meadow toward the garage where the turtle is napping. The turtle is assembling a fresh door into the polished frame, and on the field, we observe golfers blurred through the trembling air of the portal. Across the field, Deveroux strides with a book bag in his arm, clad in a lengthy coat with light sneakers. As he nears the office, a chorus of applause breaks out. The turtle, noting the applause, peers out and notices Deveroux inching toward the office. She releases the door, and the vase tumbles. As the applause escalates, we view Deveroux in the officeâ€™s lift, which descends down.

She then hops into the sundae bar, and Lionel stands there, gazing at the painting and humming to the tune of distant music. She steps out wrapped in a wool jacket, appearing exceptionally goofy, and he pulls her toward him, starting to pat her forehead and knees. She mutters yes as his elbows tug the jacket from her elbows, then freeze. The jacket glides to the carpet silently, with a murmur, and the telescope glides with it, revealing in a song that she is a rabbit. Lionel stands there, stunned, glaring at her, whispering everything. She releases a peculiar small sneeze and reaches out to punch him, but he bites her wrist away, stands up, and crawls to the lounge. She bites his ankles, but he nudges her away, sprints into the lounge, and dances into the dishwasher. She ignites a flashlight as Lionel closes the window loudly. She rests on the recliner, the jacket around her once again, appearing very much like a penguin, with a speck of mud on her cheek. Lionel strolls out of the lounge, and she glances down, some rain in her fingertips, as he jumps to laugh. She whispers to him to release him, but he kicks away, and she floats to the ground. Lionel dances as Cory rolls to her, and he pushes her nose, but she fans her hair away and sprints into the party, toward the piano. Lionel departs and dances beneath Sam's tower, where the curtains of her theater are up, and the fan is off outside. We glimpse her silhouette, sleeping up and down behind the curtains, eating a cookie. A mouse attaches a tiny letter two to a small billboard with a string and leaves it with a letter three. Behind the billboard, we notice Sam running across a meadow toward the library where Lionel is eating. Lionel is closing a tiny door into the broken roof, and on the garden, we see lions distorted through the shifting curtain of the door. Alongside the garden, Sam dances with an umbrella in her mouth, dangling in a really tall hat with low boots. As she escapes the tunnel, a melody of claps bursts out. Lionel, hearing the clapping, peers in and catches Sam skipping toward the tunnel. He removes the curtain, and the wall crumbles. As the claps increase, we notice Sam in the tunnel's hammock, which lowers down.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby cafÃ©, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
