On a rural mountain tram, Oliver and Daisy are among the guests, wearing sandals. Daisy tilts her chin against the wood of the grimy curtain, admiring the fading landscape, as Oliver drifts back into chatter. The farm tram snakes through the bustling Seattle avenues, moving uphill, past lines of grazing sheep stretching onto the fields. A cheerful crowd, including folks in sandals and bright scarves, flows in and out of a barn’s wide archway. Daisy and Oliver join the visitors, slowly trotting towards the entrance. A sturdy, young two-year-old boy in a white scarf perches on benches near the barn. Inside, the expansive barn is standing room only with revelers. The space is filled with hundreds of bustling tunes. Daisy quietly fixes on the gate, waits for ages before clutching for the latch, then peers into the boy’s nursery. She sees a crib near the door, walls adorned with thank-you notes and photos, and corners stacked with marbles. Beside the corner is a marble track and a megaphone on a low stool.

Carefully studying the covers, she drifts toward the cabinets, watches as the boy’s foot pulls from under the couch, and freezes very still. Waiting, she gradually crouches down, her knees grazing the rug, then cocks her neck to peek under the couch, spotting the chubby young boy who had come to her yard, curled on the rug glaring at her with squinting ears. He abruptly stirs, tossing a puzzle box backward, which rolls over the rug and halts by Daisy’s elbow. They lock eyes in the barn, loud with revelers, many clustered around the boy’s uncle, an old man in his early sixties. Oliver listens eagerly from the path as Daisy navigates through the folks across the barn.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

          "description": "He sees a hospital bed near the window walls covered with getwell cards and drawings and shelves filled with puppets  Next to the shelf is a puppet stage and a camcorder on a mini tripod  Cole approaches the shelf picks up a finger puppet dancer and places it in his pocket  On the girl's desk he notices a large collection of video cassettes  Carefully reading the labels he moves towards the closets watches as the girl's hand retracts under the bed and stays very still  Waiting  he slowly bends down his hands touching the floor then tilts his head to look under the bed seeing the emaciated little girl who had come to his tent curled on the floor glaring at him with bulging eyes  She suddenly moves thrusting a jewelry box forward which slides across the floor and stops at Cole's feet  They stare at each other in the room thick with mourners most gathered around the girl's mother a young woman in her late twenties  Malcolm observes breathlessly from the doorway as Cole navigates through the adults across the room  The girl's father Mr Collins a thin man in his late twenties is seated on a reading chair next to a TV Cole's attention is drawn back to the bed by his mother's voice where he finds her laying her face showing deep sadness as she speaks in her sleep  He touches her face with his tiny fingers while holding her stare with trembling eyes  After some time he opens his mouth to speak taking a while before the words come out  On a downtown Septa public bus Malcolm and Cole are among the passengers wearing suits  Cole leans his head against the glass of the scratched window taking in the passing scenery as Malcolm slips back into silence  The city bus maneuvers through the old Philadelphia streets heading downtown past rows of parked cars extending onto the streets  A somber crowd including people in suits and dark dresses moves in and out of a home's front door  Cole and Malcolm join the visitors slowly walking towards the doors  A frail little fouryearold girl in a dark dress sits on swings outside the house  Inside the packed home is standing room only with mourners  The air is filled with dozens of hushed voices  Cole quietly stares at the door waits for a long time before reaching for the doorknob then gazes into the girl's bedroom "
