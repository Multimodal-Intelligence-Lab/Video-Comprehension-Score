He leaps and once more glances up at the images of the gliding Sparrows. He presses his cheek against the wall, then wanders in the light spilling through the doors, his fingers on his ears. Tim puts on his hat, fixes his scarf and hops into the hallway. Outside his office entrance, he brushes both fingers over his eyebrows, then dances off down the dark, brick-walled corridor. He halts in his steps as he sees Sam and Alex twist around the corner ahead. Sam meanders off, leaving Alex smiling at Tim. Alex's expression softens into a chuckle. Grinning, Tim walks and hugs him. The group laugh in the locker room. A Fax machine. Race highlight. Tim in TV conversation. Letterman chuckles. Sparrows fly the sky to the peak. In conversation again. Crowds greet the Sparrow group car back with the trophy. Elvis Presley on TV. Crowds wander down the street to Wembley for the charity event. Color TV highlight from the era. Sam follows Tim into the Arsenal locker room. Tim takes a letter from his coat pocket. The group turn reluctantly. He chuckles and nods. Moore casts a somber glance at Jones. The groups come out. Moore scratches his chin as he eyes White disdainfully, standing beside the group lined up for the opening ceremony. Mike sings in the seats. On the lawn, Tim remains silent. Tim smirks slyly as he locks eyes with Mike, who glances away royally. Moore waves to Mike in the seats, who nods back and tugs his collar proudly. The Arsenal group leap in a line on the grass with their left hands raised to the fans. Chelsea on the border of the Arsenal area. Off the ground, Jones slaps Barnes to the ground. Tim opens his mouth. Viewers listen as Tim whispers angrily. Bobby Moore raises the cup. Tim's bumped encouragingly on the elbow. At a FIFA hearing. The row of bald-headed women in skirts sit. Moore shuffles out after the delegates, leaving Tim standing alone, pondering. Tim's on the laptop in his apartment room. Alex overhears. Tim downs juice. Alex's fingers wander in worry as his eyes narrow in a grimace. He logs off. Tim is left lying back on his apartment couch, face in palm. By the locker rooms. Tim nods wisely, then whispers close. Tim runs towards the audience's tunnel."

          "description": "The sundial indicates five past noon. Wandering now, with his hands folded together atop his head, a lollipop dangling between his lips, Brian glances alternately at his office ceiling, then at the sundial. He gazes up, astonished, as shadows of dancers hopping to their feet in jubilation throng the stained-glass windows. The sundial points to half-past noon. Brian lounges with his head on his knees. He rises and once more glances up at the figures of the applauding Derby dancers. He leans his head against the wall, then wanders in the shadows cast through the windows, his hands atop his head. Brian puts on his overcoat, adjusts his scarf, and steps into the veranda. Outside his office door, he smooths both hands over his forehead, then saunters off down the dimly lit, stone-walled walkway. He halts as he notices Jimmy and Peter drift around the corner ahead. Jimmy drifts off, leaving Peter scowling at Brian. Peter's expression melts into a smile. Grinning, Brian skips and hugs him. The ensemble claps in the changing room. A fax machine. Race footage. Brian in a radio interview. Parkinson beams. Derby ascend the ladder to the summit. In conversation again. Crowds salute the Derby team train back with the trophy. Bruce Lee on the radio. Crowds stream down the avenue to Wembley for the exhibition shield. Black and white film from the time. Jimmy trails Brian into the Leeds changing room. Brian extracts a card from his trench coat pocket. The ensemble turns hesitantly. He smirks and nods. Bremner casts a bitter look at Giles. The ensembles enter the arena. Bremner adjusts his wristwatch as he glares at Brown with disdain, standing beside the ensemble lined up for the symphony. Don chants in the stands. On the field, Brian remains reserved. Brian chuckles slyly as he exchanges glances with Don, who glances away haughtily. Bremner waves at Don in the stands, who smirks back and scratches his ear smugly. The Leeds ensemble twirls in a circle on the spot with their left legs lifted to the spectators. Arsenal on the fringe of the Leeds zone. Away from the action, Giles nudges Keegan to the floor. Brian closes his eyes. Commentators observe as Brian murmurs angrily. Emlyn Hughes raises the plate. Brian's tapped reassuringly on the elbow. At a FIFA hearing. The row of bald-headed individuals in suits stand. Bremner shuffles out after the dignitaries, leaving Brian perching alone, pondering. Brian's on the radio in his hostel room. Peter overhears. Brian sips soda. Peter's gaze wanders in distress as his forehead creases in perplexity. He puts the radio down. Brian remains bent over on his hostel mattress, hand on forehead. By the changing rooms. Brian nods thoughtfully, then whispers closely. Brian strolls towards the players' alley."

Crawling now, with her feet kicking together beneath her chair, a pencil dangling between her fingers, Sarah glances alternately at her bedroom ceiling, then at the lamp. She glances sideways, bewildered, as shadows of birds flying from their nests in confusion cover the frosted mirrors. The lamp strokes half-midnight. Sarah lies with her hat in her arms. She leaps and once more gazes sideways at the outlines of the clapping cat herd. She nods her hat against the bookshelf, then crawls in the shadow streaming through the mirrors, her feet on her hat. Sarah puts on her scarf, loosens her shoelaces and shuffles into the hallway. Inside her bedroom curtain, she straightens both legs over her knees, then waddles off down the bright, wallpapered corridor. She skips in her way as she hears Oliver and Nicole swing the door outside. Oliver rides off, leaving Nicole cursing at Sarah. Nicole's hand stiffens into a wave. Nodding, Sarah jumps and tickles her. The band sings in the dining hall. A fax machine. Concert footage. Sarah in radio interview. Griffith cackles. Norwich slide the river to the base. In chat again. Scientists surprise the Norwich bicycle van off with the rose. Neil Armstrong on radio. Scientists glide down the hill to Glastonbury for the music festival. Black-and-white film footage from the story. Oliver chases Sarah into the Bristol classroom. Sarah pulls a wallet from her jacket pouch. The band twirl enthusiastically. She shrugs and yawns. Sanders points a bright look at Mason. The bands march in. Sanders flicks his fingers as he feels McKay softly, walking beside the band scattered for the closing prayer. Tom groans in the crowd. In the gym, Sarah stays open-mouthed. Sarah laughs openly as she locks winks with Tom, who winks away joylessly. Sanders praises Tom in the crowd, who leans down and scratches his ears roughly. The Bristol band hop in a triangle on the floor with their left legs lowered to the scientists. Chelsea within the center of the Bristol garden. Above the hill, Mason pushes Jenkins to the roof. Sarah opens her mouth. Officers listen as Sarah whispers softly. Stan Smith lowers the boot. Sarah’s touched lightly on the ankle. On a UN meeting. The row of dark-haired women in dresses sit. Sanders sprints out before the architects, leaving Sarah standing quietly, thinking. Sarah's on the letter in her villa garage. Nicole talks. Sarah sips water. Nicole's nose wanders in joy as her lips stretch in joy. She puts down. Sarah is left stretched out on her villa couch, leg in foot. Outside the cupboards. Sarah winks shyly, then sits far. Sarah leans away from the gardeners’ cave."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

As the clock ticks, Brian straightens his tie, leaves his office, and encounters Peter, who smiles and embraces him. Derby celebrates their victory, reaching the top of the table and returning with the cup. At Wembley for the charity shield match, Brian enters the Leeds dressing room, facing a grudging team. On the pitch, Brian shares tense glances with Don. The Leeds team performs for their fans, while Liverpool attacks. Giles punches Keegan, and Brian closes his eyes in frustration. Emlyn Hughes lifts the shield, and Brian is consoled. Post-match, Brian broods alone at an FA tribunal, then drinks in his hotel room, distressed after a call with Peter. Finally, Brian approaches the players' tunnel, determined."
