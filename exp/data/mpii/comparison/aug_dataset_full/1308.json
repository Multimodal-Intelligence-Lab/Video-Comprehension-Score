As he opens the door wide, he is greeted by the sight of Audrey standing quietly in the dimly lit hallway. With a subtle nod, Audrey acknowledges David, who finds himself fixated on his wife as she begins to cry uncontrollably, tears streaming down her distraught face. She attempts to wipe the tears away with her hands, but they are too plentiful to manage effectively. Audrey nods once more, descends the stairs while still wiping her face, and David watches somberly as she fades into the shadows below. The vast expanse of the stadium unfolds into a picturesque, clear blue sky, with a line of eager ticket holders winding their way towards two bustling turnstiles where the dedicated stadium staff is busy tearing tickets. Positioned to one side, David Dunne stands alongside two other vigilant security guards, closely observing the enthusiastic fans decked out in their Eagles-themed clothing and accessories. Nearby, a group of animated girls carries a homemade banner, prompting David to tilt his head to read the message carefully. His gaze shifts to a woman cradling a newborn baby in her arms; he notices the infant is adorably dressed in an Eagles uniform. Suddenly, the walkie-talkie on David's hip crackles to life, and he quickly detaches it to listen intently. As he navigates through the crowd, he accidentally bumps into a man wearing a distinctive army jacket, glancing back momentarily before continuing on his way. David makes his way over to a fellow security guard posted near the turnstiles and assumes his position close to the gate, facing the throng of spectators. Elijah approaches him and watches as the security team diligently pats down random male attendees passing through the turnstiles. The man in the green army jacket shuffles forward in the line wearing an inscrutable expression, watching the pat-down procedures ahead of him. David keeps a close eye on him as he progresses to being twenty people away from the turnstile, then fifteen, and eventually just ten. The man suddenly coughs, stepping out of the line abruptly, and Elijah observes as the distinctive green army jacket blends seamlessly into the thick crowd, disappearing as the man retreats from the stadium vicinity. In a shadowy, unlit arched concrete passageway, sunlight streams in from the stadium, casting elongated shadows across the space. Elijah stands alone, patiently waiting in the ground tunnel until David makes his entrance, joining him and handing over a ticket.

He carefully inserts the new clipping among the others, treating the entire collection with utmost care as he places it back onto the highest shelf. With a sense of urgency, he exits the cramped, confined closet space. As David swings the door wide open, he is greeted by the sight of Audrey standing quietly in the dimly lit hallway that surrounds him. With a subtle nod of acknowledgment, Audrey communicates to David, who stands transfixed, observing his wife as she begins to cry uncontrollably. Tears stream down her distraught face, overflowing to the point that her attempts to wipe them away with her hands prove futile, overwhelmed by their sheer volume. Audrey gives another nod, descending the stairs as she continues to brush away the tears from her face, while David watches with a heavy heart, his gaze following her as she gradually fades into the enveloping shadows below. The vast expanse of the stadium opens up dramatically under a picturesque, clear blue sky. A line of eager ticket holders winds its way patiently toward the two bustling turnstiles, where the dedicated stadium staff is actively engaged in the process of tearing tickets. Positioned strategically to one side, David Dunne stands with two other attentive security guards, keenly observing the enthusiastic fans around them, all decked out in their Eagles-themed clothing and accessories. Nearby, a lively group of animated girls carries a homemade banner, catching David's attention, prompting him to tilt his head to carefully read the message it bears. His gaze then shifts to a woman who is gently cradling a newborn baby in her arms; he notices with a smile that the infant is adorably dressed in a tiny Eagles uniform. Suddenly, the walkie-talkie situated on David's hip crackles to life with static, prompting him to quickly detach it and listen with focused intent. As he navigates his way through the bustling crowd, he inadvertently bumps into a man sporting a distinctive army jacket, casting a brief backward glance at him before continuing on his path. David proceeds to make his way over to a fellow security guard positioned near the turnstiles, situating himself close to the gate, facing the large throng of incoming spectators. Elijah approaches him, observing as the security team methodically pats down random male attendees as they pass through the turnstiles. In the line, the man wearing the green army jacket shuffles forward with an inscrutable expression, watching intently as the pat-down procedures unfold ahead of him. David maintains a vigilant watch over the man, noting his progress as he approaches, first twenty people away from the turnstile, then down to fifteen, and eventually just ten. Without warning, the man coughs loudly, stepping out of line in an abrupt manner, and Elijah observes as the distinctive green army jacket merges inconspicuously into the dense, bustling crowd, disappearing as the man retreats from the stadium's vicinity. In a shadowy and dimly lit arched concrete passageway, sunlight filters through from the stadium, casting long, elongated shadows across the space. Elijah stands alone, waiting patiently in this ground-level tunnel until David finally arrives, joining him and handing over a ticket. Elijah fixes his gaze on David, who exhales in a measured and deliberate manner while maintaining steady eye contact. As David's walkie bursts to life with a flurry of noise, the two men remain perfectly still, enveloped within the confines of the tunnel. David turns away, beginning to move down the hallway, speaking over his shoulder, as Elijah closely watches the silhouetted figure of David Dunne jog into the depths of the tunnel's enveloping darkness. Seated behind the wheel inside a uniquely customized car, Elijah is parked in the stadium's parking lot.

He carefully returns the collection to its original spot on the top shelf and exits the cramped space of the closet. With a hand reaching out, he opens the door, revealing the dimly lit hall where Audrey stands waiting. As he steps back into the hallway, Audrey acknowledges him with a nod. David, momentarily transfixed, watches intently as Audrey's composure breaks and she begins to cry, tears slipping down the contours of her face. She attempts to manage the stream of tears with her hands, but the flow is relentless. Audrey nods again, her gesture imbued with unspoken understanding, and she makes her way down the staircase, her hands still working to clear her face of tears. David remains rooted to his spot, his eyes following her as she gradually disappears into the enveloping shadows below. The scene shifts to the expansive stadium, its immense structure opening under an immaculate blue sky. Outside, a line forms with eager ticket holders snaking towards the entrance where the stadium crew diligently rips tickets. David Dunne stands apart from the bustling queue, flanked by two fellow security guards, their collective gaze trained on the parade of fans, all adorned in Eagles merchandise. Among the crowd, a group of young girls hoists a homemade banner, catching David's eye, prompting him to tilt his head for a clearer view of the message. He then fixates on a woman holding a tiny, uniform-clad newborn, taking in the sight of the infant dressed in Eagles gear. Suddenly, the walkie-talkie clipped to David's hip crackles to life, pulling him from his observations. As David absorbs the transmission, he inadvertently bumps into a man in line donned in an army jacket. He momentarily glances back at the man, his curiosity fleeting, as he resumes his path. David strategically moves towards a fellow guard stationed near the turnstiles, setting his position at the gate and facing the thronging crowd. Elijah, arriving next to him, watches as their colleagues engage in random pat-downs of men progressing through the turnstiles. David’s attention zeroes in on the man in the green army jacket as he inches closer to the checkpoint, progressing from being the twentieth person in line to fifteenth, and then tenth. The man discreetly coughs, steps out of the line intentionally, and Elijah observes as the green army jacket vanishes into the dense crowd, slipping away imperceptibly from the stadium. In the dimness of a concrete passageway, sunlight filters through from the stadium, casting elongated shadows across the tunnel. Elijah stands waiting alone in the subterranean corridor when David enters, joining him and passing a ticket into his hand. Elijah looks over at David, who releases a steady breath, reciprocating Elijah's gaze. When David's walkie-talkie erupts with sudden noise, both men freeze, listening intently to the static. David pivots, initiates his walk down the passageway, and continues to converse over his shoulder with Elijah, who watches as David's silhouette fades, jogging deeper into the tunnel's enveloping darkness. Later, inside a uniquely customized car situated in the stadium's parking lot, Elijah sits behind the wheel. Every surface inside the vehicle—the dashboard, steering wheel, and gear shift—is covered in a layer of thin foam padding, ensuring that each corner and hard surface is carefully safeguarded."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
