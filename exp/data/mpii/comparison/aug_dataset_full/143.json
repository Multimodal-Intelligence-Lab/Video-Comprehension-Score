He directs his gaze toward the tumultuous scene, his eyes narrowing as he processes the unfolding chaos. A group of men launch themselves with determination at a breach situated at the top of the wall, clinging precariously as they scramble for a foothold, their fingers scraping against the rough surface. Some gradually vanish over the other side, while a few valiant individuals straddle the wall, extending their hands to help women and children caught in the swirling tide of the crowd below. Observing the scene, Dyer casts a glance, devoid of emotion, at the panel, a man caught in the shock of realizing the grave repercussions of an action he once believed deserving of commendation. The Advocate, standing across from him, regards him with disbelief, more a reflection of Dyer's demeanor than the content of his words. He fixes his gaze on the panel with the air of a reasonable man articulating a sensible argument, albeit oblivious to the evasiveness and thinly veiled embarrassment in their response, which only deepens his retreat inward as he reflects on the situation. In the public section, a muted reaction ripples through the audience. Meanwhile, the Indian barrister pauses, locking eyes with Dyer momentarily before lowering his gaze to his notes, his disposition for the first time tinged with uncertainty. A slight tremor of distaste flickers momentarily among the panel members, quickly suppressed, as Dyer shifts his gaze toward them abruptly, prompting the Advocate to momentarily halt. He offers a dry smile, while Dyer faces him with a stony demeanor, as a seed of panic quietly takes root deep within him. Silence envelops the room, echoing the same quietude that pervaded the Court of Inquiry. The camera pans slowly along a section of the wall, drawing closer to reveal bullet holes peppering the surface, patches of blood splattered across, and scratches where frantic fingers have clawed at the surface in a desperate bid for safety. The camera finally transitions to a close-up of Gandhi, mirroring the shot of Dyer we have just left behind. Gandhi surveys the wall in an empty park with a numb, desolate expression, while Nehru stands a few feet away, equally engulfed in a shared sense of benumbed grief and incredulity. The camera continues its somber pan over bits of human hair matted into dried blood, bullet-riddled foliage, the well, trampled ground surrounding it, and fragments of clothing scattered about. The scene shifts to the imposing capitol building of the British Raj in India, with Chelmsford pacing methodically along one side of a large conference table. Now, Gandhi stands in the middle, speaking with the full authority and conviction of a leader. The Indian representatives acknowledge Chelmsford's disclaimer with a composed yet accepting demeanor, subtly lifting Chelmsford's spirits. Gandhi's words are imbued with the cold determination of a man still seething with anger. The British delegation is rendered almost speechless, struck by the audacity and seeming impossibility of the moment—and from Gandhi, of all people. Kinnoch, the senior civil servant, is the first to regain composure, while Gandhi and the others maintain their gaze upon him. Recognizing the misstep, Chelmsford, pragmatic enough to acknowledge the faux pas, endeavors to steer the meeting back toward the trajectory he originally envisioned."

He looks off at the crowd, his eyes narrowing, as though trying to comprehend the magnitude of the situation. A group of men are hurling themselves at a breach in the top of the wall, a relic of colonial architecture, hanging there, scrabbling for a purchase, with some disappearing, while a few heroic individuals astride the wall reach down to assist their women and children in the swirling crowd below. Dyer, an officer of the British Army infamous for his role in the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, glances woodenly at the panel, a man in some shock at the consequences of what he assumed was an act worthy of praise, an act which led to widespread horror and condemnation. The Advocate looks at him with a degree of disbelief, more at his attitude than his statement, as this moment follows a heated session of the Hunter Commission Inquiry. He stares at the panel like a reasonable man making a reasonable point, unaware or uncaring of the tragedy his actions inflicted. The evasiveness and only half-buried embarrassment of their response deepen his own withdrawal into himself, and Dyer thinks about it. There is a muted reaction from the public section, a reflection of the shock still resonating after the massacre. The Indian barrister, a representative of burgeoning nationalist aspirations, stares at him a moment, then simply lowers his eyes to his notes. For the first time, there is a hint of uncertainty in his manner, a shift in the dynamics of colonial authority. There is just a tremor of distaste quickly suppressed among the panel as Dyer looks at him quickly, and that answer stops the Advocate. He smiles dryly, perhaps aware of the growing controversy. Dyer faces him stonily, a seed of panic taking root deep in his gut, as he witnesses his crumbling defense. There is quiet: the same silence as at the Court of Inquiry, a body set up to investigate the massacre. The camera is panning slowly along a section of the wall. We are close and see the bullet holes, remnants of that fateful day, the patches of splashed blood, and the scratches where fingers have dug at the surface of the wall to claw a path to safety. Finally, the camera comes to a close shot of Gandhi, the leader of the Indian independence movement, matching that of Dyer, whom we have just left. Gandhi is surveying the wall in the now empty park numbly and desolately, with Nehru, his close associate and future Prime Minister of India, standing a few feet away from him, sharing the same benumbed grief and incredulity. The camera continues its pan over bits of human hair matted in the dried blood, the bullet-ripped foliage, the well, trampled ground around it, and little pieces of clothing, each a testament to the brutality witnessed. There is the imposing capitol building of the British Raj in India, a symbol of colonial power, with Chelmsford, the then Viceroy, pacing along one side of a large conference table. This time Gandhi is in the middle and speaks with the full authority of a leader, leading a dialogue crucial to India's future. The Indian side acknowledges Chelmsford's disclaimer—coolly, but accepting it—and that lifts Chelmsford's hopes a little, reflecting the delicate negotiations of the time. It is spoken with the cold determination of a man still angry, embodying the simmering resentment against colonial rule. The British are stunned almost to speechlessness by the audacity and impossibility of it—and from Gandhi, of all people, a man of peace now challenging imperial might. The senior civil servant, Kinnoch, is the first to recover, while Gandhi and the others just look at him, their silence more powerful than words. Chelmsford, realist enough to recognize that a faux pas has been made, strives to get the meeting back on the course he intends, mindful of the political tightrope he must walk."

Turner peeks blankly at the door, a banana in some awe at the results of what he assumed was a deed worthy of applause. The Sculptor glances at her with a degree of skepticism, more at her demeanor than her declaration. She gazes at the door like a logical cat making a reasonable proposal. The elusiveness and only partially hidden discomfort of their reaction deepen her own retreat into herself, and Turner reflects on it. There is a muted reaction from the animal section. The Egyptian lawyer peers at her a moment, then simply raises his eyes to his shoes. For the first time, there is an inkling of doubt in her manner. There is just a quiver of contempt quickly suppressed among the door as Turner glances at her quickly, and that question halts the Sculptor. He grins wryly. Turner confronts her blankly, a seed of dread growing deep in her stomach. There is quiet: the same stillness as at the Fair of Inquiry. The microphone is sweeping slowly along a segment of the roof. We are close and see the pebble holes, the patches of splashed ink, and the scratches where toes have carved at the surface of the roof to scrape a way to safety. Finally, the microphone comes to a close shot of Dante, matching that of Turner, whom we have just left. Dante is inspecting the roof in the now deserted garden numbly and forlornly, with Plato standing a few inches away from her, sharing the same detached sorrow and disbelief. The microphone continues its sweep over strands of animal fur tangled in the dried ink, the rock-torn vegetation, the ocean, stamped ground around it, and tiny scraps of wool. There is the imposing museum building of the French Crown in Egypt with Constantine striding along one side of a large lecture table. This time Dante is in the middle and speaks with the full authority of a thinker. The Egyptian side acknowledges Constantine's denial—coolly, but accepting it—and that lifts Constantine's spirits a little. It is spoken with the cold resolve of a tree still furious.

Baker observes blankly at the map, a woman in some awe at the outcomes of what she believed was a gesture worthy of acclaim. The Observer glances at her with a hint of bewilderment, more at her demeanor than her comment. She glares at the map like a curious woman making a curious argument. The vagueness and somewhat concealed awkwardness of their reply intensify her own retreat into herself, and Baker dreams about it. There is a quiet reaction from the private area. The Hawaiian chef gazes at her a moment, then simply raises his eyes to his recipe. For the first time, there is a flicker of confidence in his behavior.

Baker confronts him icily, a spark of joy taking root deep in her mind. There is noise: the same chatter as at the Board of Analysis. The camera is zooming swiftly along a stretch of the fence. We are distant and hear the bird calls, the patches of colorful paint, and the marks where claws have scratched at the base of the fence to scrape a path to freedom. Eventually, the camera arrives at a wide shot of Einstein, matching that of Baker, whom we have just revisited. Einstein is inspecting the fence in the now bustling arena happily and expectantly, with Tesla standing a few inches away from him, sharing the same excited hope and astonishment. The camera maintains its zoom over tufts of animal fur tangled in the fresh paint, the wind-blown leaves, the fountain, untouched grass around it, and shiny pieces of jewelry. There is the grand library building of the Modern Age in Paris with Curie strolling along one side of a small reading room. This time Einstein is on the edge and writes with the full detail of a scientist. The French side dismisses Curie's acceptance—briefly, but noting it—and that pushes Curie's optimism a bit. It is written with the firm precision of a person still thrilled. The French are amused almost to laughter by the simplicity and elegance of it—and from Einstein, of all people.

This time Gandhi is in the middle and speaks with the full passion of a leader.

We are distant and see the paint splatters, the patches of spilled ink, and the dents where noses have traced at the surface of the sculpture to etch a trail to adventure. Finally, the telescope arrives at a distant shot of Einstein, mimicking that of Harper, whom we have just joined. Einstein is inspecting the sculpture in the now crowded zoo happily and brightly, with Tesla standing several inches nearby him, sharing the same spirited enthusiasm and curiosity. The telescope maintains its zoom over clumps of animal fur tangled in the wet paint, the ink-splattered leaves, the tank, untouched sky around it, and large patches of garment. There is the majestic bakery of the French Empire in Egypt with Edison skipping along one side of a tiny dining table. This time Einstein is on the edge and speaks with the quiet authority of a comedian. The Egyptian side dismisses Edison's retort—eagerly, but declining it—and that drops Edison's fears a lot. It is articulated with the warm hesitation of a woman still elated. The French are amused almost to laughterlessness by the humility and improbability of it—and from Einstein, of all people.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
