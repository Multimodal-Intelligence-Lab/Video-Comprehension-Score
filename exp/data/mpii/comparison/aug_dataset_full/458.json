Inigo tries like hell to get out of the way, but no, and it sticks deep into his stomach, and he hurtles back helplessly against the wall of the room, his eyes glazed, blood coming from his wound. Count Rugen looks across the room at Inigo, and Inigo sinks. Meanwhile, Buttercup shuts the door of the Honeymoon Suite, crosses quietly to the far wall where she sits at a table, opens a jeweled box, and takes out a very deadly looking dagger. She seems very much at peace as she touches the knife to her bosom and Buttercup whirls as we see Westley lying on the bed. Yellin's sword is beside him. His voice sounds just fine, but he does not move. Buttercup leaps to the bed, covering him with kisses. Westley is helpless, and she lets go, thumping his head against the headboard. Count Rugen looks very much surprised as Inigo, struggling feebly, pulls the dagger from his stomach, holding the wound with his left hand. Rugen pushes off from the table, sword in hand, moving in to kill Inigo. Inigo watches the Count approach, and the Count flicks his sword at Inigo's heart, and there's not much Inigo can do, just kind of vaguely parry the thrust with the six-fingered sword and Count Rugen's blade sinks deeply into Inigo's left shoulder. The Count steps back, going for the heart again, and as this blow comes, Inigo tries to use the wall for support in forcing himself to his feet, and it's not a roaring success of an attempt, but he does at least make some progress, and again he manages to parry the thrust, as this time Rugen's sword runs through his right arm. Again, Inigo doesn't seem to mind, doesn't even feel it. Count Rugen steps back for just a moment, watching as Inigo continues to inch his way to his feet and then, just before the Count is about to strike again, Inigo manages a little flick of his own and Rugen hadn't expected it, and he jumps back, makes a little involuntary cry of surprise. Inigo slowly pushes away from the wall, and Count Rugen suddenly goes into a fierce attack, striking with great power and precision for he is a master swordsman, and he forces Inigo easily back, driving him easily into the wall. But he does not penetrate Inigo's defense. None of the Count's blows get home. As the Count steps back a moment.",

Inigo attempts like hell to get out of the path, but no, and it lodges deep into his abdomen, and he crashes back powerlessly against the partition of the chamber, his eyes dull, blood oozing from his injury. Count Rugen gazes across the chamber at Inigo, and Inigo descends. Meanwhile, Buttercup closes the door of the Honeymoon Suite, moves silently to the distant partition where she places herself at a table, opens a gem-studded container, and extracts a very lethal appearing stiletto. She appears very much at tranquility as she touches the stiletto to her chest and Buttercup spins as we observe Westley reclining on the bed. Yellin's saber is beside him. His voice resonates just fine, but he does not budge. Buttercup springs to the bed, smothering him with kisses. Westley is powerless, and she releases, thumping his cranium against the headboard. Count Rugen appears very much astonished as Inigo, struggling weakly, draws the stiletto from his abdomen, clutching the injury with his left hand. Rugen pushes off from the table, saber in hand, advancing in to slay Inigo. Inigo observes the Count approach, and the Count flicks his saber at Inigo's heart, and there's not much Inigo can do, just sort of hazily deflect the lunge with the six-fingered saber and Count Rugen's blade plunges deeply into Inigo's left shoulder. The Count steps back, aiming for the heart again, and as this strike arrives, Inigo attempts to utilize the partition for support in compelling himself to his feet, and it's not a thunderous success of an effort, but he does at least make some headway, and again he manages to deflect the lunge, as this time Rugen's saber pierces through his right limb. Again, Inigo doesn't seem to care, doesn't even sense it. Count Rugen steps back for just a moment, observing as Inigo continues to inch his way to his feet and then, just before the Count is about to strike again, Inigo executes a small flick of his own and Rugen hadn't anticipated it, and he leaps back, makes a small involuntary cry of astonishment. Inigo slowly pushes away from the partition, and Count Rugen suddenly launches into a ferocious assault, striking with great force and accuracy for he is a master swordsman, and he forces Inigo effortlessly back, propelling him effortlessly into the partition. But he does not breach Inigo's defense. None of the Count's strikes reach home. As the Count steps back a moment."

The gap is closed by him as he sprints on and toward Inigo, closer, closer, and the stairs are descended by him before he heads into a dining hall, and the dagger is thrown by Count Rugen. Inigo tries desperately to get out of the way, but the dagger sticks deep into his stomach, and he is hurtled helplessly back against the wall of the room, his eyes glazed, with blood coming from his wound. Across the room, Inigo is looked at by Count Rugen, and Inigo sinks. Meanwhile, the door of the Honeymoon Suite is shut by Buttercup, who quietly crosses to the far wall where she sits at a table, a jeweled box is opened by her, and a very deadly-looking dagger is taken out. At peace, she seems as she touches the knife to her bosom, and Buttercup whirls as Westley is seen lying on the bed. Beside him is Yellin's sword. His voice is fine, but movement is absent. Buttercup leaps to the bed, covering him with kisses. Helpless, Westley is as his head is thumped against the headboard by her. Very much surprised, Count Rugen looks as the dagger is pulled from Inigo's stomach by Inigo, who struggles feebly, holding the wound with his left hand. The table is pushed off by Rugen, sword in hand, as he moves in to kill Inigo. The Count is watched by Inigo as he approaches, and Inigo's heart is flicked at by the Count's sword. There's not much that can be done by Inigo, just kind of vaguely parrying the thrust with the six-fingered sword, and Rugen's blade sinks deeply into Inigo's left shoulder. The heart is targeted again by the Count as he steps back, and as this blow comes, the wall is used by Inigo for support in forcing himself to his feet. Though it's not a roaring success of an attempt, some progress is at least made by him, and again the thrust is parried, as this time, Rugen's sword runs through his right arm. Again, Inigo doesn't seem to mind, doesn't even feel it. Count Rugen steps back for just a moment, watching as Inigo continues to inch his way to his feet. Then, just before the Count is about to strike again, a little flick of his own is managed by Inigo, which Rugen hadn't expected, causing him to jump back and make a little involuntary cry of surprise. Away from the wall, Inigo slowly pushes, and a fierce attack is suddenly launched by Count Rugen, striking with great power and precision for he is a master swordsman. Inigo is easily forced back by him, driven easily into the wall. But Inigo’s defense is not penetrated. None of the Count's blows get home. A moment is taken by the Count to step back."

Meanwhile, Buttercup gently closes the window of the Library nook, tiptoes silently to the nearby chair where she sits at a desk, opens a wooden crate, and retrieves a very fierce-looking spatula. She appears completely tranquil as she presses the spatula to her chest and Buttercup spins as we see Westley lounging on the sofa. Yellin's spoon is beside him.

General Puff glances across the library at Lucy, and Lucy droops. Meanwhile, Petal bolts the window of the Garden Nook, crawls swiftly to the near shelf where she kneels at a bench, unveils a crystal chest, and extracts a beautifully polished feather. She appears very calm as she brushes the feather to her ankle, and Petal spins as we observe Willow reclining on the couch. Bruno's flute rests next to him. His tone seems just fair, but he does not twitch. Petal vaults to the couch, peppering him with nibbles. Willow is frozen, and she releases, bumping his chin against the cushion. General Puff appears quite startled as Lucy, floundering weakly, extracts the feather from her leg, clutching the bruise with her right hand. Puff shoves off from the bench, flute in paw, advancing in to tickle Lucy. Lucy observes the General advancing, and the General twirls his flute at Lucy's chest, and there's little Lucy can achieve, just sort of hazily block the gesture with the two-pronged flute, and General Puff's stem pierces deeply into Lucy's right shoulder.

Still, Lucy seems indifferent, doesn't even sense it.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
