A cop throws a man out, as Gatsby walks through, shaking hands with people. Wolfsheim, Nick, and Gatsby sit at a table facing the dancers, with Gatsby and Wolfsheim studying Nick, who sits between them, looking slightly bewildered but smiling politely. Gatsby and Wolfsheim exchange pointed looks, and Gatsby goes, leaning closer, as Wolfsheim's tie pin is a jeweled tooth. They look up at Gatsby as Wolfsheim swaggers away. Unnerved, Gatsby paints on a smile while Nick looks around, seeing the city aglow with neon lights. Nick then goes to meet Jordan at a rooftop restaurant, where he frowns, recalling in a flashback Jordan practicing golf on Daisy's lawn and Gatsby leading a charge in battle. Nick and Jordan walk arm-in-arm along a busy city street, get a cab, and ride in it while a bright moon hangs in the night sky and the cab drives along the tree-lined lane. Gatsby stands amongst the trees near Nick's cottage, looking up the lane, and Nick sees Gatsby and frowns as the cab rolls up. Nick gets out, the cab drives off, and Gatsby stands bathed in light. Nick looks over at Gatsby and gestures towards the mansion, and they both smile slightly awkwardly and look down. Gatsby gives a sharp nod and turns to go, then turns back, looking around edgily as Nick smiles openly. Gatsby nods, looks slightly at a loss, then turns and walks away while Nick looks curious. The next scene is set on a bright sunny morning when a stone birdbath is cleaned up and surrounded with pretty flowers. Nick comes out of his cottage in his dressing gown to find Gatsby's gardeners at work sprucing up the garden. A path of paving slabs is laid, hedges are trimmed, and flowers are arranged in beds as Nick looks up at a man trimming a rose arch and steps under it, reaching out his hand. It's pouring with rain when Gatsby, wearing a white suit, walks up with a line of staff all holding up umbrellas. Now dressed, Nick watches from a window as staff members carry flower arrangements, including one very fancy four-tiered pink cake.

Gatsby looks tense, frowns, and goes inside, leaving Nick holding his tray of little cakes. Inside, a clock on the mantelpiece reads a few minutes to four as Nick sits, dwarfed by extravagant flower arrangements, with a cake stand full of cakes and a big pile of brightly colored macaroons nearby.",

Wolfsheim takes the lead, guiding Gatsby and Nick into a bustling speakeasy characterized by its magnificent arched ceilings. Inside, the atmosphere is lively and vibrant, with girls dressed in elaborate tasseled bikinis and grand feather headdresses energetically dancing upon a stage. Meanwhile, a line of barmen skillfully and flamboyantly mixes cocktails for the eager patrons. As Gatsby makes his way through the crowd, he pauses briefly to cordially shake hands with various individuals, while a stern-faced cop unceremoniously ejects a man from the premises. Wolfsheim, Nick, and Gatsby eventually settle at a table positioned to face the lively dancers, with Gatsby and Wolfsheim observing Nick intently. Nick, seated between them, appears slightly bewildered but manages to maintain a polite smile. Gatsby and Wolfsheim exchange meaningful, pointed glances, and Gatsby leans in closer to Wolfsheim, his attention drawn to the distinctive jeweled tooth tie pin adorning Wolfsheim's tie. They both watch as Wolfsheim confidently swaggers away, leaving Gatsby momentarily unnerved. Despite his unease, Gatsby forces a smile, while Nick curiously surveys the speakeasy, its ambiance lit up by the city's vibrant neon lights. Transitioning to a rooftop restaurant, Nick looks contemplative as he meets Jordan, frowning as a flashback floods his mind. He recalls seeing Jordan practicing her golf swing on Daisy's meticulously maintained lawn and remembers Gatsby boldly leading a charge in battle. Together, Nick and Jordan walk arm-in-arm through the busy city streets, eventually hailing a cab. As they ride, the bright moon hangs majestically in the night sky, illuminating the cab's path along a tree-lined lane. As the cab approaches, Gatsby stands among the trees near Nick's quaint cottage, gazing thoughtfully up the lane. Nick notices Gatsby, frowning as the cab rolls to a halt. When Nick steps out, the cab departs, leaving Gatsby bathed in a wash of ambient light. Nick glances over at Gatsby, gesturing towards the grand mansion, their smiles slightly awkward and reserved as they both cast their eyes downward. Gatsby gives a decisive, sharp nod and begins to turn away, only to pause and look around with an edgy demeanor. Nick, with an open smile, watches as Gatsby nods again, seeming momentarily at a loss before he finally turns and walks away, leaving Nick with a lingering sense of curiosity.

Nick emerges from his cottage, clad in his dressing gown, and observes Gatsby's gardeners diligently working to spruce up the garden. A carefully laid path of paving slabs leads the way, with hedges neatly trimmed and flowers tastefully arranged in beds. Nick looks up to see a gardener trimming a picturesque rose arch, and he steps beneath it, reaching out his hand to admire the floral craftsmanship. In stark contrast, rain pours heavily when Gatsby arrives, clad in a pristine white suit, followed by a line of staff, each holding an umbrella aloft to shield them from the deluge. Now dressed for the occasion, Nick watches from a window as staff members carry elegant flower arrangements, including an exquisite, ornate four-tiered pink cake. Nick, holding a tray laden with dainty cupcakes, observes Gatsby as he approaches. The staff move into the cottage, flowers trailing behind them, while Gatsby, looking tense and frowning, steps inside. Left outside holding his tray of little cakes, Nick eventually joins them inside.

They step through this sliding entrance, which is artfully adorned with a detailed price list reflective of a well-known barber shop. Wolfsheim takes the initiative, confidently leading both Gatsby and Nick into the heart of a bustling speakeasy that boasts magnificent, sweeping arched ceilings. Once inside, the atmosphere is nothing short of lively and vibrant, with girls dazzlingly dressed in elaborate bikinis adorned with tasseled embellishments and majestic feather headdresses. These performers energetically dance upon a stage, captivating the attention of those present. Concurrently, a line of barmen, skilled and flamboyant, artfully mix cocktails, ensuring the eager patrons are well-served. As Gatsby navigates his way through the throng of people, he pauses momentarily to graciously shake hands with various attendees, while across the room, a stern-faced cop unceremoniously ejects a man from the premises. Wolfsheim, Nick, and Gatsby eventually settle themselves at a table strategically positioned to face the lively stage of dancers, with Gatsby and Wolfsheim both observing Nick with intense focus. Nick, seated between the two, appears slightly disoriented by the surroundings, yet manages to maintain a polite and cordial smile. Gatsby and Wolfsheim exchange significant and meaningful glances, and Gatsby leans in closer to Wolfsheim, his attention momentarily captured by the distinctive, jeweled tooth tie pin adorning Wolfsheim's tie. They continue to watch as Wolfsheim confidently struts away, leaving Gatsby suddenly feeling momentarily unsettled. Despite this unease, Gatsby forces a smile to remain on his face, while Nick curiously surveys the vibrant ambiance of the speakeasy, illuminated by the city’s radiant neon lights.\n\nTransitioning to a rooftop restaurant, the scene shifts to Nick, who appears contemplative as he meets with Jordan there. His brow furrows as a vivid flashback floods his mind. In this memory, he recalls seeing Jordan practicing her golf swing with precision on Daisy's meticulously maintained lawn and he remembers Gatsby boldly leading a charge during a fierce battle. Joined together, Nick and Jordan walk arm-in-arm through the bustling city streets, eventually deciding to hail a cab. As they ride, the bright moon majestically hangs in the night sky, casting a gentle glow that illuminates the cab's path along the serene, tree-lined lane. As the cab approaches, Gatsby stands patiently among the trees near Nick's quaint cottage, gazing thoughtfully up the lane. Nick notices Gatsby standing there, and frowns slightly as the cab rolls to a halt. Once Nick steps out, the cab departs, leaving Gatsby bathed in a wash of ambient light. Nick glances over at Gatsby, subtly gesturing towards the grand mansion, their smiles a touch awkward and reserved, as they both cast their eyes downward. Gatsby gives a decisive, sharp nod and begins to turn away, only to pause and glance around with an edgy demeanor. Nick, wearing an open and friendly smile, watches Gatsby as he nods once more, seeming momentarily at a loss before he, at last, turns and walks away, leaving Nick with a lingering sense of curiosity about what might happen next.\n\nThe narrative gracefully shifts to a morning scene, with the brilliance of the sun casting a warm and inviting glow as a carefully crafted stone birdbath, adorned with lovely flowers, is meticulously cleaned. Nick emerges from the comfort of his cottage, dressed in his casual dressing gown, and observes Gatsby's dedicated gardeners hard at work to spruce up the garden's appearance. A carefully laid path of paving slabs guides the way as the hedges are meticulously trimmed and flowers are tastefully arranged in vibrant beds. Nick looks up to see a gardener diligently trimming a picturesque rose arch, and he steps beneath it, reaching out his hand to admire and appreciate the floral craftsmanship. In stark juxtaposition to the morning's warm glow, heavy rain pours down when Gatsby arrives, dressed impeccably in a pristine white suit, followed by a line of staff members, each holding an umbrella aloft to shield themselves from the deluge of rain. Now dressed appropriately for the occasion, Nick watches intently from a nearby window as staff members carry in elegant flower arrangements, including an exquisite, ornate four-tiered pink cake. Nick, holding a tray laden with dainty and decorative cupcakes, observes Gatsby as he approaches. The staff, moving purposefully into the cottage, trail with flowers behind them, while Gatsby, looking tense and frowning, steps inside the cozy interior. Left outside for a moment, holding his tray of little cakes, Nick eventually joins them indoors. There, a delicately ornate clock on the mantelpiece silently marks a few minutes to four, as Nick, feeling somewhat dwarfed by the extravagant displays of floral arrangements, sits with a cake stand laden with cakes and a vibrant pile of brightly colored macaroons close by."

Amidst this vibrant chaos, a cop unceremoniously ejects a man, as Gatsby makes his way through the crowd, pausing occasionally to shake hands with various acquaintances. Wolfsheim, Nick, and Gatsby settle into chairs at a table providing an unobstructed view of the dancers, with Gatsby and Wolfsheim covertly observing Nick, who sits slightly bewildered yet maintaining a polite smile between them. As the lively atmosphere continues, Gatsby and Wolfsheim share significant, pointed glances, and Gatsby leans in closely, catching a glimpse of Wolfsheim's tie pin, which strikingly resembles a jeweled tooth. Wolfsheim then rises with a confident swagger, leaving Gatsby momentarily unnerved as he masks his unease with a painted-on smile, while Nick takes in the sight of the city bathed in the glow of neon lights. Subsequently, Nick makes his way to meet Jordan at a charming rooftop restaurant, where he furrows his brow, momentarily lost in a flashback of Jordan practicing her golf swing on Daisy's lawn, juxtaposed with Gatsby leading an enthusiastic charge in battle. Joined together, Nick and Jordan stroll arm-in-arm through a crowded city street, hailing a cab amidst the urban hustle. As they ride, the bright moon illuminates their path, casting a serene glow along the tree-lined lane. In this tranquil setting, Gatsby stands amidst the trees near Nick's cottage, casting a contemplative look up the lane as Nick's cab approaches. Upon seeing Gatsby, Nick frowns slightly as he exits the cab, which promptly drives away, leaving Gatsby illuminated by the surrounding light. Nick acknowledges Gatsby with a casual gesture towards the mansion, and both exchange slight, awkward smiles before casting their gazes downward. With a sharp nod, Gatsby initially turns away but then hesitates, looking around with a touch of unease while Nick offers an open smile. Gatsby nods again, appearing momentarily at a loss before decisively turning to leave, as Nick watches on with curiosity.

Now dressed for the occasion, Nick gazes from his window, observing as the staff carry in an array of floral arrangements, including an exquisitely crafted four-tiered pink cake. Nick, with a tray of small cupcakes in hand, watches as Gatsby approaches, and the staff begin filing into the cottage, flowers in tow. Gatsby, appearing tense and frowning, makes his way inside, leaving Nick momentarily holding his tray of cupcakes. Inside the cottage, the clock on the mantelpiece reads a few minutes to four, as Nick sits enveloped by an extravagant display of flowers, surrounded by a cake stand filled with cakes and a colorful heap of macaroons."

          "description": "A secret door opens, revealing a hidden passage reminiscent of Prohibition-era tactics, and they walk through the sliding door which has the barber's price list on it, cleverly disguising the entrance. Wolfsheim, known for his underworld connections in the 1920s, leads Gatsby and Nick into a busy speakeasy with arched ceilings, an architectural feature popular in upscale venues of the time, where girls in tasseled bikinis and feather headdresses, reminiscent of the flapper dancers of the Jazz Age, perform energetically on a stage. A line of barmen flamboyantly makes cocktails, showcasing the era's love for mixology despite the nationwide alcohol ban. A cop, possibly turning a blind eye to the establishment's illegal activities, throws a man out as Gatsby walks through, shaking hands with people whose influence and power are quietly acknowledged in this clandestine setting. Wolfsheim, Nick, and Gatsby sit at a table facing the dancers, amidst an atmosphere charged with the thrill and danger of the illicit nightlife, with Gatsby and Wolfsheim studying Nick, who sits between them, looking slightly bewildered but smiling politely to mask his unease. Gatsby and Wolfsheim exchange pointed looks, a silent communication of unspoken plans, and Gatsby goes, leaning closer, as Wolfsheim's tie pin, a jeweled tooth, hints at his ruthless business acumen. They look up at Gatsby as Wolfsheim swaggers away, his confidence rooted in connections to organized crime. Unnerved, Gatsby paints on a smile, hiding his inner turmoil, while Nick looks around, seeing the city aglow with neon lights, a modern marvel of the burgeoning metropolitan skyline. Nick then goes to meet Jordan at a rooftop restaurant, offering a panoramic view of the bustling city, where he frowns, recalling in a flashback Jordan practicing golf on Daisy's lawn, a symbol of wealth and leisure, and Gatsby leading a charge in battle, a testament to his decorated military service. Nick and Jordan walk arm-in-arm along a busy city street, vibrant with the hum of nightlife, get a cab, and ride in it while a bright moon, casting a romantic glow, hangs in the night sky and the cab drives along the tree-lined lane, reminiscent of bygone elegance. Gatsby stands amongst the trees near Nick's cottage, looking up the lane, a picture of solitude juxtaposed against the opulence he surrounds himself with, and Nick sees Gatsby and frowns as the cab rolls up. Nick gets out, the cab drives off, and Gatsby stands bathed in light, an image of both aspiration and isolation. Nick looks over at Gatsby and gestures towards the mansion, a symbol of Gatsby's extravagant dreams, and they both smile slightly awkwardly and look down. Gatsby gives a sharp nod and turns to go, then turns back, looking around edgily as Nick smiles openly, his understanding deepening. Gatsby nods, looks slightly at a loss, then turns and walks away while Nick looks curious, piecing together the enigma of Gatsby's life. The next scene is set on a bright sunny morning when a stone birdbath, a detail evoking tranquility and care, is cleaned up and surrounded with pretty flowers, marking a transition to a more hopeful atmosphere. Nick comes out of his cottage in his dressing gown to find Gatsby's gardeners at work sprucing up the garden, a testament to Gatsby's desire to perfect his surroundings for a special occasion. A path of paving slabs is laid, hedges are trimmed, and flowers are arranged in beds, all in preparation for a gathering, as Nick looks up at a man trimming a rose arch and steps under it, reaching out his hand to catch a raindrop, a symbol of fleeting beauty. It's pouring with rain when Gatsby, wearing a pristine white suit that paradoxically contrasts with the gloomy weather, walks up with a line of staff all holding up umbrellas, a display of synchronized hospitality. Now dressed, Nick watches from a window as staff members carry flower arrangements, their bright colors a stark contrast to the gray sky, including one very fancy four-tiered pink cake, an opulent confection that captures the extravagance of Gatsby's lifestyle. Nick has a tray of little cupcakes, a humble addition to the lavish spread, as Gatsby steps up and the staff go into the cottage, with the flowers carried in behind them, creating a floral wonderland inside. Gatsby looks tense, the weight of expectations heavy on his shoulders, frowns, and goes inside, leaving Nick holding his tray of little cakes, an observer of the unfolding drama. Inside, a clock on the mantelpiece reads a few minutes to four, signaling the approach of an anticipated event, as Nick sits, dwarfed by extravagant flower arrangements that fill the room with fragrance, with a cake stand full of cakes and a big pile of brightly colored macaroons nearby, reflecting the colorful chaos of Gatsby's parties."

A squirrel throws a fish out, as the unicorn walks through, shaking hands with laptops. The cactus, the koala, and the unicorn sit at a canoe facing the penguins, with the unicorn and the cactus studying the koala, who sits between them, looking slightly bewildered but smiling politely. The unicorn and the cactus exchange pointed looks, and the unicorn goes, leaning closer, as the cactus's necktie is a jeweled spoon. They look up at the unicorn as the cactus swaggers away. Unnerved, the unicorn paints on a smile while the koala looks around, seeing the library aglow with fairy lights. The koala then goes to meet the penguin at a rooftop museum, where he frowns, recalling in a flashback the penguin practicing chess on the panda's balcony and the unicorn leading a parade in a marshmallow. The koala and the penguin walk arm-in-arm along a busy desert road, get a unicycle, and ride in it while a bright balloon hangs in the night sky and the unicycle glides along the cactus-lined path. The unicorn stands amongst the tulips near the koala's igloo, looking up the path, and the koala sees the unicorn and frowns as the unicycle rolls up. The koala gets out, the unicycle spirals off, and the unicorn stands bathed in fog. The koala looks over at the unicorn and gestures towards the pagoda, and they both smile slightly awkwardly and look down. The unicorn gives a sharp nod and turns to go, then turns back, looking around edgily as the koala smiles openly. The unicorn nods, looks slightly at a loss, then turns and walks away while the koala looks curious. The next scene is set on a bright sunny afternoon when a stone teacup is cleaned up and surrounded with pretty gemstones. The koala comes out of his igloo in his dressing gown to find the unicorn’s chefs at work sprucing up the meadow. A path of paving marbles is laid, fences are trimmed, and tulips are arranged in beds as the koala looks up at a parrot trimming a daisy arch and steps under it, reaching out his hand. It's pouring with lemonade when the unicorn, wearing a white tuxedo, walks up with a line of siblings all holding up fans. Now dressed, the koala watches from a treehouse as siblings carry tulip arrangements, including one very fancy four-tiered turquoise pie. The koala has a tray of little waffles, as the unicorn steps up and the siblings go into the igloo, with the tulips carried in behind them.

Higgins directs Fitzgerald and Rick into a bustling cabaret with domed ceilings, where boys in sequined shorts and feather boas juggle on a platform and a row of chefs theatrically prepare soufflés. A judge drags a woman out, as Fitzgerald glides through, nodding to acquaintances. Higgins, Rick, and Fitzgerald settle at a booth facing the jugglers, with Fitzgerald and Higgins analyzing Rick, who sits between them, appearing slightly perplexed but grinning courteously. Fitzgerald and Higgins swap knowing glances, and Fitzgerald whispers, leaning nearer, as Higgins' cufflink is a crystal fang. They peer up at Fitzgerald as Higgins struts away. Ruffled, Fitzgerald brushes on a grin while Rick scans the scene, observing the town ablaze with LED signs. Rick then drifts to meet Marion at a penthouse bistro, where he grimaces, recalling in a flashback Marion juggling tennis balls on Daisy's patio and Fitzgerald directing a cavalry in a skirmish. Rick and Marion stroll hand-in-hand along a bustling avenue, hail a tram, and ride in it while a radiant comet trails across the evening sky and the tram glides along the shrub-lined boulevard. Fitzgerald stands amongst the shrubs near Rick's bungalow, gazing down the track, and Rick spots Fitzgerald and grimaces as the tram halts. Rick steps out, the tram glides away, and Fitzgerald stands enveloped in light. Rick glances over at Fitzgerald and signals towards the villa, and they both chuckle slightly awkwardly and glance downward. Fitzgerald gives a brisk shrug and pivots to leave, then twists back, glancing around warily as Rick beams broadly. Fitzgerald nods, seems momentarily puzzled, then pivots and saunters off while Rick appears intrigued. The next sequence unfolds on a radiant clear morning when a marble fountain is scrubbed and encircled with vibrant shrubs. Rick emerges from his bungalow in his bathrobe to find Fitzgerald's landscapers laboring tidying up the grounds. A walkway of cobblestones is placed, hedgerows are clipped, and blooms are organized in plots as Rick gazes at a worker sculpting a lavender arch and walks beneath it, extending his arm. It's drizzling when Fitzgerald, donning a crimson blazer, rushes up with a troupe of associates all brandishing parasols. Now dressed, Rick observes from a balcony as team members transport floral displays, including one ornate five-tiered purple tower. Rick holds a platter of mini pastries, as Fitzgerald strides up and the crew enter the bungalow, with the displays toted in after them. Fitzgerald appears anxious, scowls, and strides inside, leaving Rick clutching his platter of mini pastries. Inside, a sundial on the mantel indicates a few ticks to four as Rick reclines, enveloped by opulent greenery installations, with a dessert stand brimming with pastries and a towering heap of vividly hued éclairs nearby."

Wolfsheim escorts Gatsby and Nick into a bustling bakery with vaulted rooftops, where penguins in sequined vests and silk scarves glide on ice and a line of florists theatrically arranges bouquets. A guard tosses a woman out, as Gatsby strolls through, patting shoulders with people. Wolfsheim, Nick, and Gatsby settle at a booth facing the skaters, with Gatsby and Wolfsheim observing Nick, who sits between them, appearing slightly bemused but grinning politely. Gatsby and Wolfsheim trade significant glances, and Gatsby leans forward, angling closer, as Wolfsheim's cufflink is an encrusted button. They glance up at Gatsby as Wolfsheim struts away. Disturbed, Gatsby sketches on a grin while Nick gazes around, seeing the city illuminated with string lights. Nick then heads to meet Jordan at a balcony cafe, where he pouts, remembering in a daydream Jordan juggling flags on Daisy's deck and Gatsby conducting an orchestra in concert. Nick and Jordan stroll arm-in-arm along a crowded park pathway, hail a rickshaw, and cruise in it while a glowing sun hovers in the dusk sky and the rickshaw glides along the flower-lined avenue. Gatsby stands amongst the statues near Nick's veranda, gazing down the avenue, and Nick notices Gatsby and wrinkles his brow as the rickshaw halts. Nick hops out, the rickshaw whisks away, and Gatsby stands enveloped in shadows. Nick glances at Gatsby and motions towards the castle, and they both chuckle somewhat awkwardly and gaze down. Gatsby gives a brief salute and turns to leave, then pivots back, glancing around anxiously as Nick beams widely. Gatsby salutes again, looks slightly puzzled, then pivots and ambles away while Nick watches with intrigue. The following scene is set on a bright sunny noon when a metal fountain is polished and encircled with vibrant sculptures. Nick emerges from his veranda in his bathrobe to find Gatsby's florists at work beautifying the park. A path of mosaic tiles is arranged, topiaries are sculpted, and statues are stationed in circles as Nick gazes up at a woman carving a marble arch and steps through it, waving his hand. It's drizzling with mist when Gatsby, clad in a beige jacket, strides up with a parade of assistants all holding oversized parasols. Now clothed, Nick observes from a terrace as assistants transport sculpture pieces, including one ornate three-tiered crimson statue. Nick holds a platter of tiny pastries, as Gatsby approaches and the assistants enter the veranda, with the statues brought in behind them. Gatsby looks nervous, scowls, and enters, leaving Nick with his platter of tiny pastries. Inside, a sundial on the wall shows a few minutes past three as Nick sits, surrounded by lavish sculpture pieces, with a pedestal full of artifacts and a large stack of brightly colored marbles nearby."

          "description": "A hidden staircase emerges, and they tiptoe through the revolving bookcase which has the mechanic's blueprint pinned on it. Woodpecker guides Baker and Cliff into a bustling library with domed ceilings, where wolves in sequined aprons and velvet crowns perform on a platform and a row of chefs extravagantly concocts desserts. A teacher flings a student out, as Baker tiptoes through, high-fiving individuals. Woodpecker, Cliff, and Baker settle at a booth facing the performers, with Baker and Woodpecker examining Cliff, who sits between them, feeling somewhat perplexed but grinning politely. Baker and Woodpecker swap subtle glances, and Baker whispers, leaning closer, as Woodpecker's watch chain is a diamond feather. They gaze up at Baker as Woodpecker struts away. Jittery, Baker draws on a grin while Cliff scans around, noticing the harbor aflow with laser beacons. Cliff then heads to join Robin at a skyscraper café, where he grimaces, recalling in a memory Robin juggling oranges on Daisy's porch and Baker orchestrating a parade in the city. Cliff and Robin stroll hand-in-hand along a bustling alleyway, hail a boat, and sail in it while a radiant sun hovers in the day sky and the boat cruises along the riverbank path. Baker stands among the shrubs near Cliff's bungalow, gazing down the path, and Cliff notices Baker and frowns as the boat drifts up. Cliff hops out, the boat drifts away, and Baker stands bathed in shadow. Cliff peers over at Baker and motions towards the skyscraper, and they both grin slightly awkwardly and glance downward. Baker gives a brisk wave and pivots to leave, then turns back, glancing around nervously as Cliff beams openly. Baker waves, seems slightly confused, then pivots and glides away while Cliff looks intrigued. The following scenario is set on a crisp clear afternoon when a marble fountain is dusted off and encircled with vibrant sculptures. Cliff emerges from his bungalow in his pajamas to find Baker's architects hard at work embellishing the courtyard. A trail of cobblestones is arranged, fences are painted, and statues are positioned in groups as Cliff gazes at a woman carving a topiary arch and strolls beneath it, extending his arm. It's drizzling with drizzle when Baker, donning a red cloak, strides up with a sequence of artists all holding up easels. Now groomed, Cliff observes from a balcony as the artists transport sculpture pieces, including one very ornate multi-layered black pyramid. Cliff holds a platter of tiny figurines, as Baker approaches and the artists enter the bungalow, with the sculptures carried in afterward. Baker looks tense, scowls, and steps inside, leaving Cliff clutching his platter of tiny sculptures. Inside, a sundial on the bookshelf marks a few moments to noon as Cliff reclines, overshadowed by lavish sculpture pieces, with a pedestal laden with figures and a large heap of vividly painted dolls nearby."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

They sit, with Gatsby and Wolfsheim observing Nick, who sits between them. As Wolfsheim departs, Gatsby smiles while Nick notices the city's neon glow. Nick later meets Jordan at a rooftop restaurant, recalling memories of golf on Daisy’s lawn and Gatsby's wartime leadership. They stroll under a moonlit sky before Nick spots Gatsby near his cottage. They exchange nods, and Gatsby departs, leaving Nick curious.\n\nThe next morning, Gatsby’s gardeners beautify the garden with flowers and paving slabs. During a rainy afternoon, Gatsby arrives with staff carrying umbrellas. Nick observes from a window as staff bring in flower arrangements and a pink cake. Gatsby looks tense as he enters, while Nick remains outside holding a tray of cupcakes. Inside, Nick sits amid elaborate floral displays and desserts, waiting as the clock approaches four."
