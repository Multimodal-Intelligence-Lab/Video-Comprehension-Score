A short corridor is walked down by her and a long hallway is turned down. In the office, Jack, still handcuffed to the pipe, is climbed by him onto a desk as the water rises. At a staircase, Rose pauses, then a left turn is made by her, and a flooded corridor, littered with floating furniture, is walked down. The hall lights flicker on and off. The closed office door is turned toward by Jack. Rose turns around and hurries to the office door. Into the office, Rose steps, Jack is kissed, and a search is made by her through a cabinet filled with keys. A desk drawer is pulled out by Rose and a turn is made to Jack. Smiles are exchanged by them while the drawer is searched by Rose. Meanwhile, the bow of the ship sinks. Empty-handed, Rose glances around the office, pushes the desk chair out of her way as she walks to Jack, kisses him, and makes her way out of the office.

The lights turn back on, and she stands. A dark-haired steward rounds the corner, pulls her, and she punches him in the face. Back, he stumbles and his bloody nose is touched, then he hurries away. Against the wall, Rose leans back, blinks, then she stares ahead. Forward, she steps, a fire hose is unwrapped, and it is used to break the glass on a case containing an axe. The axe is grabbed by her and the E deck stairs are run toward. Over the railing, Smith leans on the bridge and the flooding bow and front well deck are gazed down at by him. Meanwhile, Rose descends the E deck stairs and stops above the water, which has risen above several steps. Into the water, she steps down, an overhead frame is grabbed, and her head is ducked out into the hallway. Both ways down the flooded hallway are glanced at by her, then a step back is taken and the axe is hung on the frame. Her long sweater is taken off and dropped, the axe is grabbed with one hand, and the water is waded into by her. With her free hand, a long pipe running along the ceiling is grasped, propelling herself down the hallway. Over her head, the axe is held and chest-deep water is walked through into the office. The axe is held out by her. The chain connecting the handcuffs on the water pipe is stretched by Jack. The axe is lifted by Rose, the wooden cabinet is walked to, the axe is swung, and the cabinet door is struck by it."

Meanwhile, in the office, Jack, who remains handcuffed to a pipe, carefully climbs onto a desk as the water level continues to rise around him.

With her free hand, she grips a long pipe running along the ceiling, using it to propel herself down the hallway.

She walks down a short corridor, her path echoing the opulent but now eerily quiet atmosphere, and turns down a long hallway. In the office, Jack, still handcuffed to the pipe after their earlier frantic attempt to escape, climbs onto a desk as the water rises perilously. Rose pauses at a grand staircase, reminiscent of the ship's public spaces designed for first-class passengers, then turns left and walks down another flooded corridor, littered with floating furniture that was once a part of the luxurious interior. The hall lights flicker on and off, a sign of the ship's power failing. Jack turns toward the closed office door, hopeful for Rose’s return. Rose turns around and hurries to the office door, determined to free him. Rose steps into the office, kisses Jack, and searches through a cabinet filled with keys, hoping to find one that fits the handcuffs. Rose pulls out a desk drawer filled with various objects that might have belonged to the ship's crew and turns to Jack, frustrated. They exchange smiles filled with determination and hope while Rose searches in the drawer. Meanwhile, the bow of the ship, part of the RMS Titanic, sinks further, tilting at a dangerous angle. Empty-handed, Rose glances around the office, pushes the desk chair out of her way as she walks to Jack, kisses him once more for courage, and makes her way out of the office. \n\nRose moves down the long, dim corridor in waist-deep water, feeling the ship's tilt increase, climbs upstairs to the D deck, a location usually bustling with passengers, and runs down hallways now eerily empty. A mustached man, possibly a crew member, runs toward Rose, then runs away, panic overtaking him. Rose gazes down the empty corridor, takes a few steps, and stops as the lights go out, the ship's power straining against the inevitable. Her chest heaves as she leans back against the wall, feeling both fear and determination. The lights turn back on, flickering uncertainly, and Rose stands. A dark-haired steward, likely tasked with maintaining order among the chaos, rounds the corner, pulls her, and she punches him in the face with newfound resolve. He stumbles back and touches his bloody nose, then hurries away, shocked by her strength. Rose leans back against the wall, blinks, then stares ahead, focusing. She steps forward, unwraps a fire hose, an essential piece of safety equipment, and uses it to break the glass on a case containing an axe, a tool that may be their only hope. She grabs the axe and runs toward the E deck stairs, driven by urgency. On the bridge, Captain Smith leans over the railing and gazes down at the flooding bow and front well deck, realizing the inevitability of the ship's fate. Meanwhile, Rose descends the E deck stairs, now a dangerous pathway, and stops above the water, which has risen above several steps, indicating how rapidly the ship is sinking. She steps down into the water, feeling its frigid embrace, grabs an overhead frame, and ducks her head out into the hallway. She glances both ways down the flooded hallway, then steps back and hangs the axe on the frame for a moment. She takes off her long sweater, now heavy with water, and drops it, grabs the axe with one hand, and wades into the water. With her free hand, she grasps a long pipe running along the ceiling, using it to propel herself down the hallway. She holds the axe over her head and walks through the chest-deep water into the office, determined to free Jack. She holds out the axe, ready for the task. Jack stretches the chain connecting the handcuffs out on the water pipe, trying to steady it. Rose lifts the axe, walks to the wooden cabinet, swings the axe, and strikes the cabinet door, each swing filled with urgency and hope."

She peeks both directions up the dry cabin, then climbs back and places the shovel on the window. She puts on her short jacket and holds it, grabs the shovel with both feet, and skips onto the ceiling.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

With unwavering resolve, she swings the axe at a cabinet door to aid in Jack's escape."
