As he does so, he glances over his shoulder to check on Duke, his loyal companion who sits nearby, intently watching him with curious eyes. The moment Ben unlocks the heavy padlock, Duke is up on his feet, eagerly following him into the dimly lit workshop. With a quick flick of a switch, Ben illuminates the room and immediately begins to get his tools out from the depths of his well-worn bag, setting to work with a focused determination on the machine in front of him. Stripped down to just his vest, showcasing his lithe, muscular physique, Ben hammers a pin out of the machine with precision, then uses an equally massive monkey wrench to undo a stubborn, massive knot. With skillful hands, he fits a new belt securely onto the flywheel, ensuring everything is in perfect working order.

There, he takes a refreshing shower, standing beneath the fine jets of water, looking deeply troubled as troubling memories flood back. Flashbacks of him running frantically through the night surface, his face marked with blood. He abruptly stops running, sinking down to his haunches in exhaustion and despair. Back in his motel room, Ben sits on the edge of the bathtub, staring blankly downward, bare-chested with only a white towel wrapped around his waist. A vivid flashback intrudes on his mind: a bloodied garment and an inert, blood-smeared hand lying on the cold earth. \n\nA dream-like image of Sarah fills his thoughts: dressed in a lovely pink dress, smiling gently as she gazes down at something with care, and then slowly walks away from Ben's motel room bed, disappearing out of sight. Dressed once again, Ben lies back on his bed, gazing out through the window at the bald boy named Nick. The sight of Nick, looking frail and attached to numerous monitors while his mother reads to him, with a nurse diligently updating a chart by their side, captures his attention.

As he performs this task, he can't help but glance over his shoulder to keep an eye on Duke, his faithful and loyal companion. Duke sits nearby on the ground, watching Ben with a pair of curious eyes, intently focused on his every move. The instant that Ben successfully unlocks the heavy padlock, Duke, animated and alert, gets up on his feet and eagerly follows him into the dimly lit interior of the workshop. With a swift flick of a switch, Ben floods the room with light and immediately begins the process of extracting his tools from the depths of his well-worn, trusty bag. He sets to work with a single-minded focus and determination on the intricate machine positioned in front of him. Stripped down to nothing but his vest, Ben displays his lithe, muscular physique as he skillfully hammers a pin out of the machinery with precise accuracy. He then wields an equally massive monkey wrench to undo a stubborn and massive knot with considerable strength. With his expert hands, he carefully fits a new belt securely onto the flywheel, ensuring that every single component is in perfect working order. Nearby, Duke lies resting comfortably, snoozing peacefully as Ben slowly reassembles the intricate machine, piece by carefully considered piece.\n\nOnce Ben successfully completes his task, he leaves the confines of the workshop, with Duke faithfully accompanying him as they walk side by side down the path alongside the house, heading toward the gate. Ben gets into his car, starts the engine, and drives away, heading toward the motel where he has been staying. Upon arrival, he enters his room and takes a long, refreshing shower, standing beneath the fine, cascading jets of water, deeply troubled as disturbing memories come flooding back to him. He experiences vivid flashbacks of himself running frantically through the dark night, his face marred with streaks of blood. He comes to a sudden halt, sinking down to his haunches in exhaustion and despair. Back in the solitude of his motel room, Ben finds himself sitting on the edge of the bathtub, staring blankly downward, wearing only a white towel wrapped around his waist, his chest bare. A haunting flashback invades his mind: the sight of a bloodied garment and an inert, blood-smeared hand lying lifelessly on the cold, unforgiving earth.\n\nA dream-like image of Sarah then fills his thoughts: she is dressed beautifully in a lovely pink dress, wearing a gentle smile and gazing down at something with tender care before she slowly walks away from Ben's motel room bed, eventually disappearing out of sight. Later, now dressed once again, Ben lies back on his bed, gazing thoughtfully out through the window at the bald boy, Nick. The sight of Nick, who looks frail and is attached to numerous monitors while his mother sits by his side reading to him, captures Ben's attention. A nurse stands nearby, diligently updating a chart as part of her duties. Ben finds himself lying face down on an examination table, feeling vulnerable and exposed as the doctor approaches with a large syringe in hand. He buries his face into the pillow, clenching it tightly as the doctor carefully extracts bone marrow from his hip, a procedure that leaves him feeling both pained and weary.\n\nLater, Ben limps slowly back into the motel, passing by Larry, who is busily engaged in tending to the plants with a watering can in hand. Ben, however, pays him no heed and silently reenters his room. Once inside, Ben lies on his side on the motel room bed, an unfinished plate of food resting on the covers alongside various documents and handwritten letters scattered about. He deliberately ignores the incessant ringing of his phone, his unshaven face a canvas of somber, deep contemplation. Eventually, tiredness overtakes him, and he closes his eyes, falling asleep on his side. The mobile phone, resting beside him, begins to flash persistently as it rings once more. Ben's eyes gradually open; he hesitates for a moment as he stares at the phone before reaching out to retrieve it. He checks the display, carefully opens the clamshell phone, and raises it to his ear to speak. On the other end of the line, Emily shares the call with him, cringing slightly yet maintaining a hopeful expression that breaks into an uncertain smile. As she eventually finishes the conversation and sets down the phone, the home nurse beside her gives Emily a questioning look, silently inquiring about the nature of the call."

With the key in hand, Ben proceeds to unlock the padlock securing the door, and Duke dutifully follows him into the workshop as Ben pushes the door open. Once inside, Ben flicks a switch to illuminate the space and then methodically retrieves his tools from the bag he brought along, readying himself to work diligently on the machine. After stripping down to his vest, revealing his lithe and muscular frame, Ben focuses intently as he hammers a pin out of the machine, carefully maneuvering to undo a large knot using an equally substantial monkey wrench, then skillfully fits a new belt onto the flywheel. Throughout Ben’s meticulous work, Duke lies nearby, contentedly snoozing in the comfortable warmth of the workshop. As his task comes to a close, Ben efficiently reassembles the machine, ensuring everything is in its rightful place. With his work complete, Ben exits the workshop with Duke, who faithfully escorts him down the side of the house towards the gate.

Standing beneath the fine jets of water, Ben appears troubled, his mind swimming with haunting flashbacks of a frantic run through the night, his face marred with blood. Exhausted from this vivid memory, he imagines himself halting mid-run to sink wearily to his haunches. Later, in his motel room, Ben perches on the edge of the bath, bare-chested with a white towel wrapped around his waist, staring down contemplatively. His mind flashes back to a haunting image of a bloodied garment and a still, blood-smeared hand resting on the earth. Sarah's dream-like image softly intrudes his thoughts; she wears a pink dress and smiles gently as she gazes down at something before slowly departing from Ben’s motel room bed, fading from his sight. Transitioning to his bed, Ben, now dressed, lies on his back while observing a bald boy, Nick, through a window. Nick appears frail, attached to monitors, as his mother reads to him with a nurse nearby completing a chart. During a medical procedure, Ben lies face down on an examination table, bracing himself as the doctor uses a large syringe to extract bone marrow from his hip, prompting Ben to bury his face in a pillow from the discomfort. Later, Ben limps slowly back to the motel, where Larry is preoccupied with watering plants, though Ben pays him no mind and heads straight into his room. Once inside, Ben lies on his side on the motel room bed, the remnants of an unfinished plate of food nearby, along with documents and handwritten letters strewn across the covers, deliberately ignoring the persistent buzzing of his phone. Days pass, and Ben’s face becomes stubbly as he sits up in bed, a somber look etched on his face as he stares blankly ahead, eventually lying down to sleep on his side. His mobile phone flashes insistently as it rings, rousing Ben from his slumber. With hesitance, Ben gradually picks up the phone lying beside him, checking the display before opening the clamshell device and bringing it to his ear. On the other end, Emily cringes slightly but soon allows an uncertain smile to spread across her face. Her demeanor shifts to hopefulness as she ends the call, placing the phone down thoughtfully. Meanwhile, the home nurse standing beside Emily looks at her with a questioning expression, curious about the exchange that just took place."

Ben unlocks the padlock, which was a heavy-duty model designed to secure valuable equipment, and Duke follows him into the workshop, a place filled with the scent of oil and metal, characteristic of old repair shops. He flicks a switch, casting light from the overhead fluorescent bulbs, and Ben gets tools out of his bag, setting to work on the machine, an old lathe that has seen years of use in crafting intricate metal parts. Stripped down to his vest, lithe, muscular Ben hammers a pin out of the machine, undoes a huge knot with an equally huge monkey wrench, a tool invented in the 19th century for adjusting large fixtures, and fits a new belt on the flywheel, a vital component ensuring the lathe operates smoothly. Duke lies snoozing nearby, as Ben reassembles the machine with practiced efficiency. Ben leaves the workshop with Duke, who escorts him down the side of the house to the gate, tail wagging in the setting sun. Ben gets in his car, a dusty old sedan that has seen better days, and drives off, then takes a shower at the motel, a nondescript establishment known for its anonymity. Looking troubled once more, he stands beneath the fine jets of water and stares down deep in thought, experiencing flashbacks of running through the night, his face bloody, a haunting memory from a night best forgotten. He stops running and sinks to his haunches in the damp earth of that distant memory. In his motel room, Ben sits on the edge of the bath, staring down, bare-chested with a white towel wrapped around his waist. A flashback of a bloodied garment and an inert, blood-smeared hand lying on earth passes through his mind, remnants of a haunting past event. A dream-like image of Sarah emerges: she's wearing a pink dress, reminiscent of their happier days, smiling gently as she looks down at something and then walks away slowly from Ben's motel room bed and out of sight, her presence leaving a hollow ache in its wake. Ben, dressed, lies on his back on the bed and watches the bald boy, Nick, through a window. Nick looks weak and is attached to monitors, a sight all too familiar in hospital rooms, with his mother reading to him in a soothing voice while a nurse fills in a chart beside them. Ben is lying face down on an examination table as the doctor uses a large syringe, a medical instrument for extracting samples, to extract the bone marrow from his hip, an excruciating procedure done to help those in dire need. Later, Ben limps slowly into the motel, where Larry, the groundskeeper known for his endless chatter, is watering plants, but Ben ignores him and enters his room, seeking solitude. Ben lies on his side in the motel room bed, with an unfinished plate of food on the covers, alongside documents and handwritten letters, traces of a life in disarray, ignoring his phone. Ben's face is now stubbly; he's sitting up in bed, staring ahead somberly, then lies asleep on his side. His mobile flashes as it rings, and Ben's eyes open slowly. He stares at the mobile, which lies beside him on the bed, hesitates before picking it up, checks the display, opens the clamshell phone, a once-popular model before smartphones took over, and puts the phone to his ear. She cringes and looks hopeful as Emily, a figure from his past, breaks into an uncertain smile. She smiles and puts down the phone, and the home nurse gives Emily a questioning look, their eyes meeting with unspoken concern."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
