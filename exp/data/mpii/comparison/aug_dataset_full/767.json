The steps are watched by Gordon as he grasps onto the handrails while mountains are flown over by them. The others are stood behind by Jackson and Yuri as the plane is approached for landing, while the controls are struggled with by Sasha to keep the aircraft level. As the ground is skimmed by the plane, the others are joined by Jackson and Yuri. In the cargo hold, a Bentley is run to by the two families, and it is unbuckled by Jackson, allowing inside climbing by them. A lever is heaved by Gordon, opening the cargo door, then the steps are headed for by him. The ground is thumped against by the plane, and the cargo hold is reached by Gordon, who sprints between rows of cars towards the open rear door. A key is inserted by Jackson into the Bentley's dashboard, it is turned, the car is put into gear, and acceleration towards the cargo exit is performed. Down the ramp, the car is shot and is bumped on the glacier. As landing is continued by the plane, the cargo door tosses the cars out. The plane is gotten on the ground by Sasha as the Bentley's airbags are deployed. Sasha crosses himself, his eyes are closed, and a stop is reached by it as his eyes are opened. Perilously close to the drop, the plane comes. A breath is taken in by Sasha, then a grin is given by him, but the face is void of a grin as the plane starts a descent down a steep incline, speed is rapidly gained, and the abyss is fallen into by it and exploded. Tamara sobs while watching from above. Skywards is looked by Jackson when a helicopter is heard by him, seeing a fleet of helicopters carrying wild animals in suspended harnesses. By the group on the ground, staring is done, and waving is started by Gordon. The group below is seen by the Chinese crewmen on the helicopter. A landing is made by the helicopter, and out to them rushes a man in uniform. A step forward is taken by Yuri and the twins, but Tamara stops. On board the helicopter are the boys, Yuri, and Popi, as boarding is completed by the crew. Mountains are sped over by the helicopter as the morning sun throws light on the summits. Together sit David and Laura. The complex built deep into the mountains is made their way to by the helicopters, and the bustling landing area is approached. Hearing the corgis, a turn is made by Professor West and sees the Queen, who struggles with her leads and holds onto her hat. Anheuser and his group are zoomed through the mountain on a bus on an elevated track, passing massive structures with ongoing work on various arks. At the R3 Boarding gate is Yuri, while Tamara walks with Gordon, and stopping is done by all when light is spotted by Lily. Down to a truck on the road, they run, and a stone is lobbed by Jackson at the vanishing truck, which is heard by a grandma in the back."

Meanwhile, Gordon is positioned on the steps, securely grasping the sturdy handrails as the aircraft soars gracefully over the majestic mountains. Behind the others, Jackson and Yuri take their positions as the airplane begins its approach for landing, while Sasha, with great effort, struggles at the controls to maintain the aircraft's level flight. As the plane skims over the ground with a gentle touch, Jackson and Yuri join the rest of the family group. In the spacious cargo hold, both families quickly rush towards a parked Bentley, and Jackson skillfully unbuckles the car, allowing everyone to climb inside securely. Gordon then pulls a lever with a firm heave, causing the cargo door to swing open, and he promptly turns to make his way back toward the steps. As the plane makes contact with the ground with a thump, Gordon races through the cargo hold, dashing between rows of vehicles to the inviting open rear door. Jackson, with precision, inserts a key into the Bentley's dashboard, smoothly turns it, engages the car into gear, and accelerates determinedly toward the open cargo exit. The car surges down the ramp and lands with a bump on the icy glacier below. Even as the plane continues its landing trajectory, cars are jostled out of the cargo door to the ground below. The Bentley’s airbags deploy with a sudden burst as Sasha successfully manages to land the aircraft on solid ground. Sasha, in a moment of relief, crosses himself and closes his eyes briefly, bringing the plane to a complete stop as he opens them again. They find themselves perilously close to a sheer drop. Sasha takes a deep breath, a grin forming on his face, but it quickly disappears as the plane begins to descend down a steep incline, gaining frightening speed, until it ultimately plummets into an abyss and explodes violently. Watching the scene from a safe vantage point above, Tamara sobs in distress. Jackson instinctively looks toward the sky when the sound of a helicopter draws his attention, revealing a fleet of helicopters carrying wild animals securely suspended in harnesses, flying above them.

Nearby, Gordon stands positioned on the steps, his hands firmly grasping onto the handrails, steadying himself as they watch the landscape of immense mountains pass swiftly beneath them. Jackson and Yuri maintain a position behind the rest of the group, watching intently as the plane begins its approach for landing. Inside the cockpit, Sasha fights with the controls, exerting effort and concentration to ensure the plane remains level. As the aircraft edges closer to the ground with its wheels skimming the surface, Jackson and Yuri swiftly join the others in readiness. In the cargo hold, both families spring into action, racing towards a parked Bentley. Jackson quickly moves to unbuckle the vehicle, allowing everyone to climb in with urgency. Gordon exerts energy to heave a lever, causing the cargo door to open, and without hesitation, he pivots and makes his way to the steps. The plane connects with the ground, and Gordon, upon reaching the cargo hold, accelerates his pace, sprinting between rows of cars towards the beckoning open rear door. Jackson promptly inserts a key into the Bentley's dashboard, giving it a turn before shifting the vehicle into gear, and then propels the car towards the open cargo exit. The Bentley launches down the ramp, making contact with the glacier in a jarring bump. Meanwhile, the plane's landing continues, dislodging cars from the cargo door as they tumble away. Inside the Bentley, the airbags deploy, cushioning impact as Sasha succeeds in securing the plane on the ground. In relief, Sasha crosses himself and momentarily closes his eyes, reopening them just in time to see the plane halted but perilously close to a precipice. He takes a deep breath and allows a grin to surface, only for it to be wiped away as the plane unexpectedly lurches forward, descending rapidly down a steep incline, gaining momentum before plummeting into an abyss and erupting in a fiery explosion. Observing from a vantage point above, Tamara is overcome with emotion, and tears spill as she watches. Jackson's attention is drawn skyward by the sound of an approaching helicopter, and he squints to see a fleet of helicopters carrying wild animals suspended in harnesses. Those gathered on the ground focus their gaze upwards as Gordon begins to wave with enthusiasm. The crewmen aboard the helicopter spot the group below and initiate their descent. Upon landing, a man dressed in uniform rushes out to meet them. Yuri and the twins step forward eagerly, but Tamara is momentarily restrained. Boarding the helicopter, the group, including the boys, Yuri, and Popi, gets settled inside while the crew finalizes their arrangements. As the helicopter swiftly advances over the towering mountains, the early morning sun casts its warm illumination across the summits, creating a breathtaking view. Within the helicopter, David and Laura sit closely together, sharing in the moment. The fleet of helicopters makes steady progress towards a complex intricately embedded within the mountainside, approaching an active landing area bustling with activity. Professor West, alerted by the sound of corgis, turns just in time to see the Queen wrestling with her leads and holding onto her hat as it threatens to escape. Elsewhere, a bus hurtles along an elevated track, transporting Anheuser and his group through the mountain, passing by enormous structures under construction meant for various arks. Yuri stands positioned at the R3 Boarding gate while Gordon accompanies Tamara, and they collectively halt when Lily excitedly points at a distant light. Without pause, they sprint down towards a truck on the road, and in a desperate attempt to capture attention, Jackson hurls a stone at the receding vehicle, catching the ear of a grandma seated in the back."

Gordon, who is acutely aware of the unpredictable nature of mountain weather, watches from the steps, grasping onto the handrails as the plane they are in flies over the towering, snow-capped mountains of the Himalayas. Jackson and Yuri, former flight engineers, stand behind the others as the plane approaches to land at the remote airstrip, while Sasha, an experienced but anxious pilot, struggles with the controls to keep the aircraft level amidst strong crosswinds. As the plane skims the ground, Jackson and Yuri join the others. In the cargo hold, the two families run to a Bentley, a luxurious symbol of their journey's beginning in Britain, and Jackson unbuckles it, allowing them to climb inside. Gordon heaves a lever designed for emergency evacuation, opening the cargo door, then turns and heads for the steps. The plane thumps against the ground, and reaching the cargo hold, Gordon sprints between the rows of cars towards the open rear door. Jackson inserts a key into the Bentley's dashboard, turns it, puts the car into gear, and accelerates towards the cargo exit. The car shoots down the ramp and bumps on the glacier, a vast, shimmering expanse of ice reflecting the early morning sun. As the plane continues landing, the cars, carefully secured but now released, are tossed out of the cargo door. The Bentley's airbags deploy in an explosion of safety foam as Sasha finally manages to get the plane on the ground. Sasha crosses himself, in a gesture learned from his Russian Orthodox background, closes his eyes, and it comes to a stop as he opens his eyes. The plane comes perilously close to the drop into a deep, icy crevasse. Sasha breathes in, relieved, then grins, but the grin vanishes from his face as the plane starts to go down a steep incline of the glacier, rapidly gaining speed, and it falls into an abyss and explodes in a fiery, echoing crash. Watching from above, Tamara sobs, her cries lost in the vast expanse of the icy wilderness. Jackson looks skywards when he hears a helicopter, seeing a fleet of helicopters carrying wild animals, displaced by climate change, in suspended harnesses as part of a massive international wildlife rescue operation. The group on the ground stares, and Gordon starts to wave to signal their presence. The Chinese crewmen on the helicopter see the group below, thanks to their infrared sensors. The helicopter lands, and a man in uniform, speaking hurriedly in Mandarin, rushes out to them. Yuri and the twins step forward, but Tamara is stopped by the urgency of the moment. The boys, Yuri, and Popi are on board the helicopter, as the crew gets aboard. The helicopter speeds over mountains as the morning sun throws light on the summits, a breathtaking view of sharp peaks and deep valleys. David and Laura sit together, sharing a moment of silent awe. The helicopters make their way to the complex, a top-secret sanctuary built deep into the mountains, approaching the bustling landing area where teams are coordinating global conservation efforts. Hearing the corgis, Professor West, a leader in genetic biodiversity, turns and sees the Queen, known for her love of these small dogs, struggling with their leads and holding onto her hat against the wind. A bus zooms Anheuser and his group through the mountain on an elevated track, passing massive structures with ongoing work on various arks designed to preserve life. Yuri is at the R3 Boarding gate, designated for the most critical bioresearchers, while Gordon walks with Tamara, heading towards their new life. They all stop when Lily spots light from the rising sun reflecting off a distant glass building. They run down to a truck on the road, and Jackson, filled with a mixture of relief and urgency, lobs a stone at the vanishing truck, which a grandma in the back hears, alerting her to stop."

Victor lifts a button, opening the cargo panel, then rotates and heads for the ladder. The blimp thuds against the soil, and reaching the luggage compartment, Victor dashes between the lines of bicycles towards the open front hatch.

As the blimp continues docking, the tricycles are hurled out of the cargo portal. The Corvette's seatbelts engage as Nina lands the blimp on the earth. Nina bows her head, shuts her eyes, and it comes to a halt as she opens her eyes. The blimp comes dangerously close to the chasm.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
