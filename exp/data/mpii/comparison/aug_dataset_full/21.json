She begins to give him a big looking glass from her handbag but reconsiders. Nevertheless, he extends his palm, and she hands him the looking glass. Simon grasps the looking glass ready for a moment of revelation, inhales as though about to plunge underwater, and begins to peer, offering himself a tiny, murmured pep talk. He swiftly raises his palm and gazes at the looking glass. A wide shot showcases Verdell secured in front as Carol appears utterly exhausted while setting down a mug of coffee. Melvin leans periodically to maintain a watch on his canine. When she reaches for the plate of untouched bacon, he goes berserk, and she is startled by the callousness of his disruption, but he doesn't perceive and becomes nearly talkative. Melvin nods, slightly exasperated about not being able to conclude his canine tale, and he stows the remaining bacon. As Melvin escorts Verdell back home, we observe, a pause before Melvin, something extraordinary: Verdell is sidestepping the fissures in the pavement. Melvin decelerates and witnesses the canine reflecting his actions by meticulously placing his feet to dodge fissures. Melvin chuckles aloud and hastily dons synthetic gloves to raise the canine to eye level. Later, Melvin is at his workstation, perusing to himself with immense gratification as Verdell sits captivated by the pace of his master's digits on the keyboard. He recites his composition aloud to the canine, and as he glances over, Verdell trots over, and unwittingly, Melvin grins at him, startling Frank. Verdell gazes up at him, then Melvin strolls to the entrance, turns the latch, and verifies that they are secured. He feels tormented until he momentarily breaks down while the canine observes. Melvin opens the entrance and shudders when he observes the scarred Simon in a wheelchair. A pause of silence ensues as Melvin ponders whether to conform with Simon, who taps his limb, attempting unsuccessfully to coax Verdell to come to him. Instead, the canine heads to the entrance and scratches at it. Jackie begins to lift the canine as Melvin barges in on the psychiatrist and utters one word. Melvin shakes his cranium and discerns every fresh detail meticulously before settling in. In the nearly-crowded waiting area, more clients are discernible as Melvin traverses through, visibly drained and distressed. He halts, gaze on them, and they appear shaken. He departs as Cheryl, a stocky waitress, unwillingly proceeds to his table while he, unseen, retrieves his cutlery and organizes them."

In this moment of vulnerability, a strange blend of helplessness and amusement takes over, leading them to share a laugh that seems more half-hearted than genuine. Then, quite unexpectedly, Frank makes an appearance in the doorway, startling them. Initially, Jackie contemplates the idea of handing Frank a large mirror that she has tucked away in her purse, but just before doing so, she hesitates, second-guessing her decision. Despite her moment of uncertainty, Frank extends his hand in an expectant manner, leaving Jackie little choice. Eventually, she makes up her mind to give him the mirror.

But when Frank extends his hand, her hesitation fades, and she relinquishes the mirror to him. Simon carefully holds the mirror, preparing himself for a moment of revelation. He pauses, inhaling deeply as though he were about to plunge into deep water, and begins to peer into the mirror while quietly giving himself a motivating pep talk.

When Carol reaches for the plate with uneaten bacon, Melvin reacts with frantic agitation, startling Carol with the insensitivity of his abrupt outburst. Oblivious to her shock, he continues speaking in a suddenly animated manner. Melvin, slightly frustrated by his inability to finish recounting his dog story, gives a resigned nod and discreetly slips the remaining bacon into his pocket. As Melvin walks Verdell back to their home, he gradually notices an intriguing behavior in Verdell that mirrors his own: the dog is precisely avoiding the cracks in the sidewalk. Curious, Melvin slows his pace, attentively observing Verdell's deliberate placement of his paws. Amused and delighted, Melvin laughs aloud, quickly donning plastic gloves to lift Verdell to eye level, sharing a moment of joy. The scene transitions to Melvin seated at his computer, indulging in the satisfaction of reading his work aloud to himself as Verdell gazes in fascination at the rapid movements of his master's fingers typing on the keyboard.

Verdell's gaze meets Melvin's, prompting Melvin to rise, walk to the door, and twist the lock, ensuring it is secure. A feeling of anguish grips him until he momentarily succumbs to it, briefly breaking down while Verdell watches sympathetically. Melvin opens the door and recoils slightly upon seeing Simon, who bears visible scars, seated in a wheelchair. A tense silence ensues as Melvin weighs his decision to fulfill Simonâ€™s silent plea, signaled by a pat on his own leg, coaxing Verdell to approach. However, Verdell instead trots to the door and scratches at it with determination. As Jackie moves to pick the dog up, Melvin intrudes abruptly on the psychiatrist, uttering just a single word.

As Duncan drives Elvis to the park, we discover, a pause before Duncan, something dull: Elvis is jumping over the puddles on the path. Duncan speeds up and ignores the cat imitating his actions by quickly placing his tail to jump puddles. Duncan cries silently and slowly takes off leather boots to push the cat to arm's length. Earlier, Duncan is in the garden, lying to the cat with little agitation as Elvis stands distracted by the slowness of his owner's feet on the grass. He whispers his lies softly to the cat, and as he turns away, Elvis skips away, and without understanding it, Duncan frowns at him, confusing George.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby cafÃ©, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
