Graham shuts his eyes, speaks to the void, and Merrill's eyes brim with moisture as Graham's eyes close, then open as he leans in near to Morgan's ear, after which Graham's eyes close again. He begins weeping and converses with no one, nods without glancing over as the beam directs up at the cellar ceiling above, and Graham gazes at the assurance in his junior sibling's expression. Graham observes Morgan lying inert on the floor, turns to Merrill, and the pair stand under the solitary dangling light bulb. Graham quietly turns and gazes at Morgan, moves across the chamber towards him, and Merrill watches as Graham kneels down and extends to Morgan's side. Graham detaches the baby monitor from his offspring's belt, walks back to Merrill, makes eye contact with Merrill, and holds it out between them, then activates it, resulting in electrical interference. The cellar door cracks open a few inches, Merrill opens it completely, ascends the stairs by himself, reaches the top and surveys the area, turns back down to the visages at the bottom, and gives them the thumbs up. He carries a limp Morgan in his arms, and Merrill nods as he begins to search the piles of objects that have tumbled from the cupboards, while Graham gently lays Morgan on the sofa. Bo emerges from the closet and looks into the family room, and Graham glances downward, then looks up swiftly, touches her cheek, and she starts crying. Colleen presses her cheek on top of Graham's hand, rests on it, with her eyes distant while Graham's eyes are not on Merrill. Merrill turns and looks to Graham, follows his gaze line to the baseball bat mounted above him, and reaches up to take the bat off its resting place as the entity starts to move. Merrill's hands tighten around the handle as he walks forward, halts, shifts his weight to his right leg while Morgan's face is obscured by vapor, and the entity begins to turn and becomes more discernible as its lines and colors don't match in position in the chamber. Merrill's left leg extends out, the entity gets struck across the back with the baseball bat, Morgan is dropped, falling to the carpet of the family room in an unnatural crumpled mass, with his arms and legs flopping lifelessly to the carpet. The entity turns to face Merrill and all the creature sees is the blur of wood as Merrill swings like a lumberjack, resulting in a slam and the entity collapsing to the ground. Graham lifts his offspring's limp form in his arms as the creature moves to its feet."

Meanwhile, Merrill stands in place, his gaze fixed intently on the desperate expression displayed by his brother. In a moment of quiet introspection, Graham closes his eyes and begins to speak softly into the enveloping darkness around him. At this same moment, Merrill finds his own eyes filling with tears, watching as Graham’s eyes first close, then slowly open again. Graham leans in close to Morgan's ear, only to shut his eyes once more. Overcome by a flood of emotion, Graham starts to cry and speaks aloud to no one in particular, nodding as if he is in agreement with something unseen, without directing his gaze. The beam of light from the flashlight points upward, illuminating the basement ceiling above them. Graham’s gaze is steadfastly focused on the unwavering conviction he sees in his younger brother's expression. He then glances down at Morgan, who lies limp on the ground, turning to face Merrill. Together, the two men stand under the single, dimly lit, dangling light bulb that casts a faint glow around them. Graham then quietly shifts his attention back to Morgan, slowly making his way across the room towards him. Merrill continues to watch intently as Graham kneels down by Morgan's side. With a gentle and deliberate motion, Graham unclips the baby monitor from where it is secured on his son's belt. He then walks back to where Merrill is standing, meets his eyes, and holds the monitor out between them, turning it on and causing a crackling sound of electrical static to fill the air. The basement door creaks open just a few inches, and Merrill proceeds to open it fully, ascending the stairs alone. Upon reaching the top, he looks around cautiously, then turns back to the others waiting below, offering them a reassuring thumbs-up gesture. He then carries the limp form of Morgan in his arms. Merrill nods in acknowledgment, beginning to rummage through the piles of items that have fallen from the cabinets. Meanwhile, Graham gently lays Morgan down on the sofa. Bo emerges from the closet, steps into the family room, and Graham, glancing down momentarily, quickly looks up to tenderly touch her cheek, prompting her to start crying.

Merrill extends his left leg forward, and the creature is struck across the back with the baseball bat. Morgan is dropped, tumbling to the carpet of the family room in an awkward, crumpled pile, his arms and legs flopping lifelessly onto the carpet.

Graham's eyes flutter open, and he leans in close to Morgan's ear, whispering something inaudible before closing his eyes once more. Overcome with emotion, he starts to cry, speaking to no one in particular, and nods absentmindedly as a beam of light points upward at the basement ceiling.

Graham quietly turns his attention back to Morgan, moving deliberately across the room towards him, while Merrill watches intently. Graham kneels down beside Morgan, reaching to his side to unclip the baby monitor from his son's belt. He then walks back to Merrill, making direct eye contact, and extends the monitor between them before switching it on, filling the air with the sound of electrical static.

Meanwhile, Morgan's face is obscured by gas, and the creature becomes more visible, its lines and colors misaligned with the room's position. Merrill extends his left leg, and with a powerful swing, he hammers the creature across the back with the baseball bat. Morgan is released, falling to the carpet of the family room in an unnatural, crumpled heap, his arms and legs flopping lifelessly. The creature turns to face Merrill, but all it perceives is the blur of wood as Merrill swings with the force of a lumberjack, delivering a resounding blow that sends the creature crashing to the ground.

Graham, their older brother often seen as the family leader, closes his eyes, talks to the darkness in an apparent attempt to summon courage, and Merrill's eyes fill up with water as Graham's eyes close, then open as he leans in close to Morgan's ear to offer reassurance, after which Graham's eyes close again. He starts crying and speaks to no one, nods without looking over as the beam of their only flashlight points up at the basement ceiling above, and Graham stares at the conviction in his younger brother's expression, recalling how Merrill used to play baseball in college. Graham looks at Morgan lying limp on the ground, turns to Merrill, and the two men stand under the single dangling light bulb, reminiscent of old basements designed as storm shelters. Graham quietly turns and looks at Morgan, moves across the room towards him, and Merrill watches as Graham kneels down and reaches to Morgan's side with determination. Graham unclips the baby monitor from his son's belt, a tool they have used to keep track of the children's safety during the crisis, walks back to Merrill, makes eye contact with Merrill, and holds it out between them, then turns it on, resulting in electrical static indicating interference with its ordinary functionality. The basement door cracks open a few inches, sensitive to drafts, Merrill opens it all the way, moves up the stairs by himself, reaches the top and looks around the farmhouse's familiar layout, turns back down to the faces at the bottom, and gives them the thumbs up, a gesture of cautious reassurance. He carries a limp Morgan in his arms, and Merrill nods as he begins to search the piles of things that have fallen from the cabinets, while Graham gently lays Morgan on the sofa, which is worn from years of family use. Bo, the youngest sibling known for her perceptive nature, steps out of the closet and looks into the family room, and Graham glances down, then looks up quickly, touches her cheek affectionately, and she starts crying. Colleen, their late mother who often brought calm to the household, presses her cheek on top of Graham's hand, rests on it, with her eyes distant while Graham's eyes are not on Merrill. Merrill turns and looks to Graham, follows his eye line to the baseball bat mounted above him, a relic from his high school sports triumphs, and reaches up to take the bat off its resting place as the creature, an intruder from a recent extraterrestrial event, starts to move. Merrill's hands tighten around the handle as he walks forward, stops, shifts his weight to his right leg while Morgan's face is obscured by gas, an indication of the noxious atmosphere introduced by the alien presence, and the creature begins to turn and becomes more visible as its lines and colors don't match in position in the room, a feature of its camouflage ability. Merrill's left leg goes out, the creature gets hammered across the back with the baseball bat, Morgan is dropped, falling to the carpet of the family room in an unnatural crumpled pile, with his arms and legs flopping lifelessly to the carpet. The creature turns to face Merrill and all the creature sees is the blur of wood as Merrill swings like a lumberjack, a skill inherited from his father's forestry work, resulting in a slam and the creature falling to the ground.

He starts laughing and listens to everyone, frowns without glancing over as the radio signals down at the attic floor below, and Phoenix gazes at the confusion in his older bicycle's vision. Phoenix glances at Zephyr standing still on the sky, turns to Orion, and the two cats sit above the double flying kite. Phoenix silently turns and glances at Zephyr, moves across the ocean towards him, and Orion watches as Phoenix stands up and reaches to Zephyr's cloud. Phoenix unfastens the radio transmitter from his dog's collar, walks back to Orion, makes eye contact with Orion, and holds it out among them, then turns it on, resulting in mechanical silence. The attic window creaks open a few feet, Orion closes it all the way, moves down the ladder by herself, reaches the bottom and glances around, turns back up to the wheels at the peak, and gives them the earphones down.

Carter glances at Richard sitting tall on the chair, turns to Vivian, and the three women sit beside the double broken candle.

Vivian wanders and glances to Carter, precedes his mouth line to the cricket racquet buried below her, and scratches down to remove the racquet from its hidden place as the animal stops to sit. Vivian's toes soften around the string as she runs backward, spins, shifts her height to her left arm while Richard's hand is faded by steam, and the animal starts to halt and becomes less faint as its shapes and shades do align in motion in the window.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
