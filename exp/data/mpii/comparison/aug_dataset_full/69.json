Meanwhile, VERONICA enumerates silently, utilizing digits as markers, then halts tallying. DANTE pursues VERONICA down and seizes her by the entryway, but she departs in a huff and forcefully releases him as she exits. VERONICA departed, and then DANTE swings the door ajar and shouts out. Two individuals strolling in the contrary direction outside pivot and proceed in that path, leaving DANTE standing in silence for a moment.

Simultaneously, VERONICA silently counts, using her fingers as markers to aid her in the task, and then she suddenly stops her counting. DANTE swiftly follows VERONICA, managing to catch hold of her by the door, but she departs in an agitated manner, forcefully releasing his grip in the process.

A brief and palpable moment of silence unfolds as DANTE'S chuckling gradually fades, transitioning into an understanding of the current situation. In the interval that follows, DANTE attends to a customer patiently waiting nearby. At the same time, VERONICA, with a calculating demeanor, silently counts by using her fingers as convenient markers to assist her in the task. Abruptly, she halts her counting. Swiftly, DANTE pursues VERONICA and manages to catch her by the door, but she leaves in a flustered manner, forcefully shaking off his grip in the process. After VERONICA's departure, DANTE swings the door open wide and yells out into the open air. Two men, who were initially heading in the opposite direction outside, quickly pivot and begin making their way back towards DANTE, leaving him to stand quietly for another brief moment. An impatient hand flips a videocassette back and forth within its typical black casing, as the time is now twenty minutes past, and someone is due to arrive soon. The IMPATIENT CUSTOMER throws an irritated glare at DANTE, who is deeply engrossed in studying a copy of Paradise Lost, trying his best to ignore the piercing stare directed his way. Frustrated, the IMPATIENT CUSTOMER storms out, which prompts DANTE to pick up a ring of keys from the counter, keys that are partially swallowed by the trash can.

Meanwhile, as she directs her gaze toward the counter, she notices a striking young man named WILLAM standing there, which prompts her to react with evident interest. A brief silence ensues during which DANTE'S earlier laughter gradually diminishes into a thoughtful understanding of the situation. After gaining clarity, DANTE shifts his attention to tending to a waiting customer. During this time, VERONICA begins a silent countdown, using the digits of her fingers as a means to mark each number, until she ceases her counting. Reacting swiftly, DANTE pursues VERONICA, reaching her just as she approaches the door, and he grabs her arm in a desperate attempt to halt her departure. However, VERONICA, with a hint of annoyance, breaks free from his grasp and exits with a huffy demeanor, showcasing her frustration. After her exit, DANTE immediately swings the door open with force and calls out into the distance, his voice echoing briefly. Observing from afar, two men who are initially walking in the opposite direction turn back upon hearing DANTE call, and head towards his direction, leaving DANTE momentarily standing in silence. Nearby, a videocassette enclosed in a standard black box flips repeatedly in the hands of someone whose impatient grip reveals a sense of urgency, as it's already twenty past, and there's an expectation of someone’s arrival soon. The IMPATIENT CUSTOMER casts a piercing glare at DANTE, who attempts to distract himself by focusing intently on a copy of Paradise Lost, deliberately avoiding any acknowledgment of the glare. Eventually, the IMPATIENT CUSTOMER storms out in frustration, prompting DANTE to retrieve a set of keys from the counter, which are partly concealed by a trash can. A hapless RANDAL meanders by, making a brief stop to glance at the door before peering inside and giving it a slight tug without success, after which he resumes his walk away. Meanwhile, another CUSTOMER eager for videos leans casually against the door of the video store, while the VERY ANXIOUS CUSTOMER stands rigidly, resembling a sentry at their post. The previously IMPATIENT CUSTOMER returns and intercepts RANDAL, leading to a pile of videocassettes being deposited onto the counter with a solitary key perched atop. RANDAL then leaves, carefully balancing the stack of tapes on his head as the IMPATIENT CUSTOMER watches him with a mix of irritation and intrigue. The VERY ANXIOUS CUSTOMER, in an act of resignation, now sits on the ground next to the video store's entrance. As RANDAL skilfully maintains the balance of his cargo, he fits the key into the lock with precision, inviting the VERY ANXIOUS CUSTOMER's unwavering stare. Once inside, RANDAL gently ensures the door is left open momentarily in a gentlemanly gesture, reinforcing a sense of familiarity with the routine. He conveys a confident smile, an acknowledgment of the repetition of this scene. Soon, a coffee filter is shoved into a metal pan, and someone piles ground coffee onto it. As this happens, DANTE makes his way back to his station, coinciding with RANDAL's entrance. RANDAL tosses the key into the air with playful abandon, catching it effortlessly, and proceeds to pick up the cat. He walks past a row of snacks, nonchalantly grabbing one without diverting his attention from a list in his other hand. DANTE settles into his seat behind the register, while RANDAL settles beside him, grabbing a newspaper to join the moment. The engagement announcement headline reads \"BREE TO,\" as RANDAL dials a phone number and a CUSTOMER approaches the counter to wait patiently. In a corner, the black cat captures attention by leaping into the litter box, commencing a ritual of pawing before it squats, leaning on its haunches to deposit a notably odorous load."

Meanwhile, VERONICA counts silently, using fingers as marks, then stops counting, recalling her mother's advice to stay calm under pressure. DANTE chases VERONICA down and grabs her by the door, but she exits in a huff and violently lets go of him as she leaves, just as the passing afternoon traffic begins to pick up. VERONICA went, and then DANTE swings the door open and yells out into the busy street. Two men walking in the opposite direction outside, perhaps regulars at the nearby diner, double back and head in that direction, leaving DANTE standing in silence for a moment. A videocassette, a hallmark of the '90s home entertainment boom, encased in the customary black box flips repeatedly, held by an impatient grasp, as it's twenty after and the delivery should be here soon. The IMPATIENT CUSTOMER glares at DANTE, who studies a copy of Paradise Lost, a classic epic poem by John Milton, trying not to notice the glare. The IMPATIENT CUSTOMER storms out, and DANTE lifts a ring of keys from the counter, which are half-swallowed by the trash can, the result of RANDAL's careless antics.

He picks the cat up, walks by a row of snacks and grabs one without looking at it, in a carefree manner, holding a list in his hand possibly detailing forgotten errands. DANTE sits in his seat behind the register, a vantage point overseeing the quirks of the store, while RANDAL grabs a paper and joins him behind the counter. The headline of the engagement announcement reads, BREE TO, suggesting an upcoming local society event, as RANDAL dials the phone and a CUSTOMER comes to the counter and waits. He looks at the litter box, where a black cat suddenly jumps in and starts pawing around, a scene familiar to all pet owners.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

          "description": "Veronica stands as Dante's head hits the floor, distracted by the attractive Willam at the counter. After a brief silence, Dante tends to a customer while Veronica silently counts with her fingers, then exits angrily, shrugging off Dante's grasp. Outside, Dante shouts as two men change direction. An impatient customer with a videocassette glares at Dante, who reads Paradise Lost. The customer storms out as hapless Randal arrives, tries the door, and walks away. Another customer waits at the video store door as the impatient one confronts Randal. Randal balances a pile of tapes, uses a key to enter the store, and the routine continues. Dante returns to his post as Randal joyfully tosses the key, grabs a snack, and holds a list. They sit together behind the counter as Randal dials the phone, and a customer watches a cat use the litter box."
