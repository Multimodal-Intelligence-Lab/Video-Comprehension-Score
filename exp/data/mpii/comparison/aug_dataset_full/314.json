Mr. Miller moves behind Kayleigh and encloses his hands firmly around her ears, so she can't perceive anything now. Evan bends over to murmur in Kayleigh's ear. Kayleigh gazes at the ground, then glances up at her father and trembles. Evan spins around to glimpse Kayleigh observing him, causing him to recoil from the surprise and collapse to the ground. She notices Evan's nose bleed, and her eyes enlarge. Evan, still astonished, can do little but gaze from the ground. He stands in the middle of her bedroom, encircled by sorority plaques and pink preppy decor, scarcely able to avert his eyes from her as she hands him a tissue. He reaches for his garments at the foot of the bed and comes up with a Greek-lettered fraternity sweatshirt and brown suede jacket, then grimaces with displeasure, grabs a towel, and departs.

Kayleigh's ears are tightly cupped by Mr. Miller's hands from behind, so nothing can be heard by her now. Kayleigh's ear is whispered into by Evan as he leans over. The floor is stared at by Kayleigh, then her father is looked up at by her, and she shivers.

Meanwhile, Mr. Miller is methodically and carefully setting up the camera, ensuring it is perfectly positioned on a sturdy tripod in the dimly lit, somewhat eerie basement. Kayleigh and Evan settle themselves onto uncomfortable folding chairs, which have been strategically positioned directly in front of the camera's lens. Tommy, standing at the top of the basement stairs, leans in ever so slightly, peering down with unmistakable curiosity about what is unfolding below. Mr. Miller lowers his voice to speak softly and directly to Evan and Kayleigh before moving silently behind the camera lens, preparing to capture the critical moment. Suddenly and without warning, the door at the top of the basement stairs opens silently, revealing someone who watches the entire scene unfold with a growing sense of horror. Mr. Miller walks quietly and swiftly behind Kayleigh, firmly placing his hands over her ears to ensure she can't hear anything that might happen next. Evan, seizing the opportunity, leans over to whisper something in Kayleigh's ear. Initially, Kayleigh is staring at the floor, but she looks up at her father and shivers slightly, perhaps from a chill in the air or something deeper. Evan, noticing her penetrating gaze, quickly whips around, only to lock eyes with Kayleigh, who is watching him intently. This intense moment causes him to lurch back in shock, losing balance and falling to the floor. Kayleigh observes Evan as his nose begins to bleed, her eyes widening in surprise at the unexpected sight. Evan, still in a state of shock and disbelief, can do little but stare upward from his position on the floor. \n\nLater on, Evan finds himself standing, almost disoriented, in the middle of her brightly decorated bedroom, surrounded by an array of sorority plaques and pink, preppy decor that feels almost overwhelming. He can hardly take his eyes off Kayleigh as she gracefully hands him a tissue. Reaching for his clothes at the foot of the bed, he comes up with a Greek-lettered fraternity sweatshirt and a somewhat out-of-place brown suede jacket. He frowns with distaste, clearly unimpressed, before grabbing a towel and making his way out. At the sink, Evan meticulously washes the blood off his face and takes a good, hard look at his reflection in the mirror. As he turns around, he unexpectedly sees Gwen—one of the sorority brats they encountered at the bar—exiting the shower completely naked; she casually pats his ass and then exits the bathroom without a second thought. Meanwhile, Kayleigh, dressed attractively in a long skirt paired with a tight red sweater, catches the eye of every guy on campus as she and Evan stroll together, arm in arm, through the bustling, lively quad. Many students wave to Evan and call out his name with familiarity. Kayleigh takes him by surprise with a big, unexpected kiss and then walks away, leaving Evan momentarily wowed. After taking a moment to gather his thoughts, Evan dashes off to his class. \n\nEvan reaches for his last quarter and inserts it into the lobby pay phone, dialing a telephone number with purpose. After the brief call, he hangs up the phone and checks the time on his watch. At that very moment, Thumper passes Evan in the lobby, walking away and leaving Evan standing there, utterly dumbfounded by the encounter. Determined, Evan rushes into the lecture hall, getting in line behind other students who are taking No. 2 pencils from a box on Professor Carter's desk, readying themselves for the exam. He then walks up the aisle and takes a seat, preparing for what comes next. As he sits down, he suddenly feels an arm being placed menacingly around his throat. Evan flinches, instantly alert, and turns around to see Hunter, the frat guy whom Thumper had assaulted the other night at Dirty Hank's bar. Hunter, moving stealthily, hands Evan a cheat-sheet for the exam. Evan nods in acknowledgment and smiles as the exams are passed down his row, ready to begin. Finally, Evan and Kayleigh have just finished having a moment of intimacy."

Kayleigh and Evan settle into their folding chairs positioned in front of the camera, their expressions a mix of anticipation and unease, as Tommy lingers at the top of the basement stairs, peering down with a curious gaze. Mr. Miller lowers his voice to a hushed tone, addressing Evan and Kayleigh with a seriousness that fills the room, before he moves behind the camera lens, ready to capture the moment. Unbeknownst to them, the door at the top of the basement stairs creaks open, and a silent observer peers in, their face contorted in horror at the unfolding scene. Mr. Miller steps behind Kayleigh, gently but firmly cupping his hands around her ears, ensuring she is enveloped in silence, unable to hear the words exchanged. Evan leans in close to Kayleigh, whispering softly into her ear, his breath warm against her skin. Kayleigh's gaze drops to the floor, her mind racing, before she lifts her eyes to meet her father's, a shiver running through her as she processes the gravity of the situation. In a sudden, startling motion, Evan spins around, his eyes locking with Kayleigh's, the intensity of her stare causing him to recoil in shock, losing his balance and crashing to the floor. As he lies there, dazed, Kayleigh's eyes widen in alarm at the sight of blood trickling from Evan's nose. Evan, still reeling from the fall, can only manage to stare up at her from his position on the floor. The scene shifts, and Evan finds himself standing in the middle of Kayleigh's bedroom, surrounded by the trappings of her sorority life—plaques adorning the walls and pink preppy decor filling the space. His attention is drawn to Kayleigh as she hands him a tissue, her presence commanding his focus. He reaches down to gather his clothes from the foot of the bed, his fingers closing around a Greek-lettered fraternity sweatshirt and a brown suede jacket. A frown of distaste crosses his face as he discards them in favor of a towel, which he clutches as he exits the room. At the bathroom sink, Evan methodically washes the blood from his face, his eyes meeting his own reflection in the mirror, a moment of introspection passing over him. As he turns away from the mirror, Gwen, one of the sorority girls he recognizes from the bar, emerges from the shower, unabashedly naked. She playfully pats his backside before sauntering out of the bathroom, leaving Evan momentarily taken aback. Later, Kayleigh, dressed in a long skirt and a tight red sweater that accentuates her figure, captures the attention of every guy on campus as she and Evan walk arm in arm through the bustling quad. Students greet Evan with waves and calls of his name, acknowledging his presence with friendly enthusiasm. In a spontaneous gesture, Kayleigh plants a big, unexpected kiss on Evan's lips before turning to walk away, leaving him momentarily stunned by the affectionate display. As the realization of the moment sinks in, Evan snaps out of his daze and dashes off to his class, eager to keep up with his schedule. In the lobby, Evan inserts his last quarter into the pay phone, carefully dialing a number before hanging up and checking his watch, a sense of urgency in his actions. Just then, Thumper passes by, his presence a fleeting distraction that leaves Evan momentarily dumbfounded. Gathering his wits, Evan hurries into the lecture hall, joining the line of students who are each taking a No. 2 pencil from a box on Professor Carter's desk. With pencil in hand, he makes his way up the aisle and finds a seat, settling in for the exam. As he sits, a menacing arm wraps around his throat, causing him to flinch and turn around in alarm. He finds himself face to face with Hunter, the frat guy who had been on the receiving end of Thumper's aggression at Dirty Hank's bar. In a covert exchange, Hunter slips Evan a cheat-sheet for the exam, a gesture that Evan acknowledges with a nod and a smile as the exams are distributed down the row. The scene shifts once more, and Evan and Kayleigh lie together, having just finished an intimate moment, the culmination of a series of events that have left them both changed."

Kayleigh and Evan sit on folding chairs in front of the camera as Tommy, the neighborhood troublemaker, stands at the top of the basement stairs, looking down with a mix of curiosity and suspicion. Mr. Miller lowers his voice and speaks to Evan and Kayleigh, then gets behind the lens to capture this moment steeped in mystery. Someone silently opens the door at the top of the basement stairs, a silhouette watching with horror due to the machine's unsettling reputation. Mr. Miller walks behind Kayleigh and cups his hands tightly around her ears, so she can't hear anything now, perhaps to shield her from the machine's rumored effects. Evan leans over to whisper in Kayleigh's ear, sharing what could be crucial information. Kayleigh stares at the floor, then looks up at her father and shivers, overwhelmed by the tension in the room. Evan whips around to see Kayleigh watching him, causing him to lurch back from the shock and fall to the floor due to the sudden motion. She sees Evan's nose bleed, a common side effect of the machine's interaction with its users, and her eyes go wide. Evan, still stunned, can do little but stare from the floor.\n\nHe stands in the middle of her bedroom, which is adorned with sorority plaques from her leadership roles in campus organizations, and pink preppy decor, indicating her taste and social life. Hardly able to take his eyes off her, as she hands him a tissue, Evan is momentarily distracted by the sight of his own reflection in the ornate vanity mirror. He reaches for his clothes at the foot of the bed and comes up with a Greek-lettered fraternity sweatshirt and a brown suede jacket, symbols of his own collegiate affiliations, then frowns with distaste, perhaps reconsidering his current lifestyle, grabs a towel, and heads out. At the sink, Evan washes the blood off his face and looks at his reflection in the mirror, contemplating the surreal events. Evan turns around and sees Gwen, one of the sorority brats from the bar known for her wild antics, exit the shower naked; she pats his ass and exits the bathroom nonchalantly.\n\nKayleigh, wearing a long skirt and tight red sweater that accentuates her natural confidence, catches the eye of every guy on campus as she and Evan stroll arm in arm through the quad, a central gathering spot on campus. Many students wave to Evan and call his name, a testament to his popularity. Kayleigh gives him a big unexpected kiss, a public display of affection that leaves Evan momentarily speechless, and walks away. After a moment of wow, Evan runs off to class himself. Evan inserts his last quarter into the lobby pay phone, a relic from a pre-cell phone era, and dials a telephone number with urgency. He hangs up the phone, then checks his watch, aware that punctuality could be crucial. At that moment, Thumper, known for his unpredictable antics, passes Evan in the lobby, walks away, leaving Evan dumbfounded by his sudden appearance and cryptic demeanor.\n\nEvan runs into the lecture hall, a vast space filled with eager students, and gets in line behind others who are taking No. 2 pencils from a box on Professor Carter’s desk, known for her strict examination rules; then he walks up the aisle and takes a seat among his fellow classmates. As he sits down, someone puts their arm menacingly around Evan’s throat, an unexpected act of aggression. Evan flinches, turns around, and sees Hunter, the frat guy Thumper assaulted the other night at Dirty Hank’s bar, a notorious local dive. Hunter surreptitiously hands Evan a cheat-sheet to the exam, a risky act given Professor Carter's reputation for integrity. Evan nods and smiles as exams are passed down his row, trying to maintain a façade of calm.

Linda glances at the ceiling, then gazes down at her brother and laughs. Jordan spins around to find Linda glaring at him, causing him to jump forward in surprise and leap to the ceiling. She watches Jordan’s toe twitch, and her mouth goes wide. Jordan, still awake, can do nothing but giggle from the ceiling. He perches in the corner of her hallway, surrounded by fraternity emblems and orange gothic decor, barely managing to close his eyes from her as she throws him a handkerchief. He tosses his shoes at the head of the table and ends up with a Roman-numeraled sorority sweater and black leather cap, then grins with amusement, drops a blanket, and strolls in.

Jordan drops his first penny into the hallway jukebox and tunes a radio station. He picks up the receiver, then taps his shoe. At that instant, Sawyer passes Jordan in the hallway, skips toward him, leaving Jordan ecstatic. Jordan dances into the dance studio and gets in line beside other dancers who are taking No. 3 violins from a basket on Coach Taylor’s stage, then he sits behind the door and takes a stand.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

          "description": "Evan is shocked as Mr. Miller sets up a camera in the basement, where Evan and Kayleigh sit. As Tommy watches from the stairs, Mr. Miller whispers to Evan and Kayleigh and then covers Kayleigh's ears. Evan whispers to her, causing her to shiver, and when she sees his nose bleed, she's startled. Later, Evan finds himself in Kayleigh's pink-decorated room, grabs his clothes disdainfully, and leaves to wash his face at a sink. Gwen, a sorority girl, exits the shower, patting Evan as she leaves. Kayleigh, in a striking outfit, draws attention on campus while walking with Evan. They share a kiss before she leaves, and Evan, astonished, heads to class. At a pay phone, Evan checks his watch before entering a lecture hall. In line for pencils, he's threatened by Hunter, a frat guy, who slips him a cheat-sheet for the exam. Evan nods, smiling as exams begin. Finally, Evan and Kayleigh are seen after having sex."
