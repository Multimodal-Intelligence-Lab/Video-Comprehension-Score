Meanwhile, Cal experiences a sudden jolt that awakens him, and as he gets to his feet, he inadvertently causes a ball to fall from a tree that stands in Emily's garden. This occurs as Cal himself tumbles out from the branches of that very same tree. Upon reaching the ground, he pauses for a moment, freezing in place while he intensely focuses his gaze on the house. He then moves on to water the flower beds, casting a swift glance back at the house, and takes a moment to delicately prune one of the lush rose bushes. Cal carefully navigates his way across the lawn, his shoes equipped with lengthy metal spikes on the bottom. With precise attention to detail, he trims the hedge, retracing his path over the lawn, and conspicuously sidles his way across it. Suddenly, a security light blinks on, causing him to halt abruptly in his tracks, but he quickly decides to make a run for it. Later, Cal finds joy in playing a game of catch with Robbie; both participants are equipped with their baseball gloves. Robbie nods in understanding as Cal raises his eyebrows and squints at Robbie before lobbing the ball with an easy throw toward him. Robbie skillfully catches it without effort in his glove, beaming with joy before he throws it back with equal precision. Jessica's parents, along with Bernie, an ex-friend, and Claire, are present as Cal finds himself sitting alone on a chair in a long, empty corridor. His brow is deeply furrowed in thought as he stares intently straight ahead, occasionally glancing to his right just as Emily approaches from the opposite direction. Cal stands up with an inviting posture as Emily greets him with a shy smile, to which he responds with a bright, friendly smile of his own. They both settle into seating positions on either side of a door located in front of the lockers, engaging in an awkward shuffle in their seats, intertwining and then untangling their fingers with uncertainty. Cal looks down at the floor, nods, glances downward again, and then shakes his head in contemplation, while Emily takes a deep breath, steadying herself. Cal bestows a gentle smile before his expression shifts to a more serious demeanor. Emily's eyes start to fill with tears as Kate attempts to force a smile, angrily yanks at the door, closes her eyes, takes a deep, calming breath, stands up, and gently touches her temple in a reflexive gesture. Emily's smile fades to a cold expression as she faces Cal, gawking at him, and he raises his brow but then looks down at the floor. She prepares to speak, opening and closing her mouth, nodding her head slightly, and Cal shakes his head again, staring down at his feet. He lets out a sigh while a gentle smile begins to creep across his face, and Emily, tearfully, manages to smile as well. A crowd starts to gather, and Cal turns toward Emily with a sheepish expression. She glares at him while he hangs his head low, shakes it, looks up, and his eyes dart nervously around the surroundings. Emily then turns away and walks off, while Cal turns to watch her departure as she climbs into her car and drives away. As the rain begins to fall, Bernie and Claire also walk away, leaving the scene. Elsewhere, Jacob is seated alone in his smart, minimalist apartment, which stands in stark contrast to the unfolding drama, casually eating a bowl of cereal and scrutinizing the packet in his hands.

A grin spreads across his face as his gaze meets Emily's, who is nearby and provocatively licking her lips. Meanwhile, Cal, who has been napping, suddenly starts awake with a jolt, sitting up abruptly and glancing around. As he rises to his feet, a ball tumbles from the branches of a tree in Emily's garden, closely followed by Cal, who loses his balance and falls out of the tree. Recovering from his fall, Cal remains motionless for a moment, his eyes fixed intently on the house as he gathers his composure. He then picks up a nearby watering can and begins to water the flower beds meticulously, casting occasional glances back at the house. With precision, he prunes one of the rose bushes, trimming away any dead or unruly leaves. Carefully, he treads over the lawn, each step marked by the distinct impression of long metal spikes on the soles of his shoes. After trimming the hedge with steady hands, he retraces his steps across the lawn, sidling across its surface. Suddenly, a security light flicks on, casting a bright glare, and Cal freezes in place, his heartbeat quickening. In a flash, he decides to make a run for it, his feet pounding against the ground. Later, Cal and Robbie engage in a game of catch, each wearing baseball gloves that gleam under the sun. Robbie nods in agreement as Cal raises his brows, squinting slightly to gauge his aim. Cal then lobs the ball towards Robbie, who catches it expertly in his glove, a beaming smile spreading across his face before he throws it back with gusto. As time passes, Jessica's parents, her ex-friend Bernie, and Claire are present in the vicinity as Cal finds himself sitting alone on a chair in a corridor. His brow is furrowed in concentration, staring ahead with an occasional glance to his right. It is then that Emily approaches from the opposite direction, prompting Cal to stand as she offers a shy smile. His face lights up with a bright, genuine smile, and they both take a seat on either side of a door in front of the lockers. Awkwardness settles between them, and they both shuffle in their seats, their fingers knotting and unknotting in nervousness. Cal directs his gaze to the floor, nodding slightly before shaking his head. Emily, meanwhile, takes a deep, steadying breath as Cal's face transitions from serene to serious. Emily's eyes begin to fill with tears, yet Kate forces a smile, harshly yanking the door, only to close her eyes, take a deep, calming breath, stand, and gently touch her temple. Emily's smile turns cold as she turns to face Cal, gawking at him, her movements slow and deliberate. Cal raises his brow momentarily but then averts his eyes, looking down. Emily opens her mouth as if to speak but closes it again, nodding with silent resolution. In response, Cal shakes his head, his gaze fixed on his feet. He lets out a sigh, and as Emily tearfully smiles at him, a gentle smile also creeps across his face. A crowd has gathered around them, and Cal turns towards Emily with a sheepish expression while she glares at him, prompting him to hang his head and shake it before looking up and letting his eyes dart around. Emily, turning abruptly, walks away, her steps firm and resolute. Cal watches her retreating figure until she gets into her car and drives off, leaving him behind. Bernie and Claire, noticing the rain beginning to fall, walk away from the scene. Meanwhile, Jacob sits in solitude within his smart, minimalist apartment, focused intently on a bowl of cereal in front of him, studying the packet as if searching for answers. Behind him, a large black and white abstract painting looms, its presence adding an artistic touch to the room. As Emily drives through the night, she shakes her head in disbelief at the wheel, her eyes blinking away the emotion as she lets out a heavy sigh. Back outside the school, Cal leans against his car, the rain coming down in earnest as he allows the droplets to soak him through, unmoving as he processes the whirlwind of events."

Cal wakes with a jolt, gets up with a start that echoes the chaos of a busy city morning, and a ball, possibly from a neighborhood game, falls from a tree in Emily's garden as Cal falls out of the branches of the tree, a common spot for adventurous children. He remains stock still, much like a cat observing its surroundings, and regards the house, a mid-century family home, intently, then waters the flower beds, which are filled with tulips, glances back at the house, and prunes one of the rose bushes, adding to the garden’s aesthetic. He treads over the lawn with shoes with long metal spikes on the bottom, typically used for lawn aeration, trims the hedge that borders the property, treads over the lawn the other way, and sidles across it. A security light, likely installed for safety in this quiet neighborhood, comes on, he freezes, and then he makes a run for it. Cal plays catch with Robbie; they both wear baseball gloves, traditional in American culture, Robbie nods, and Cal raises his brows, squints at Robbie, and lobs the ball at him, who catches it in his glove and beams before throwing it back, a gesture of friendship. Jessica's parents, known for their involvement in local charity events, ex-friend Bernie, and Claire are there as Cal sits on a chair alone in a corridor, possibly at a school waiting for a meeting, his brow furrowed, staring ahead, and glancing to his right as Emily approaches from the other direction. Cal stands as she smiles shyly, and he beams brightly at her. They both take a seat on either side of a door in front of the lockers, reminiscent of scenes in coming-of-age films, shuffle awkwardly in their seats, and both knot and unknit their fingers. Cal looks down at the floor, nods, looks down, shakes his head, and Emily takes a deep breath as Cal smiles serenely before his expression becomes serious, suggesting an unspoken conflict. Emily's eyes well with tears, her emotions evident, as Kate forces a grin, yanks the door angrily, closes her eyes, takes a deep, calming breath like a technique taught in meditation, stands, and touches her temple gently, a sign of stress. Emily smiles coldly, turns to face Cal, gawks at him, and he raises his brow but looks down. She opens and closes her mouth, nods her head, and Cal shakes his head and stares at his feet, sighs, and a gentle smile creeps across his face as tearfully, Emily smiles, indicating a bittersweet moment. A crowd has gathered, perhaps for a school event, Cal turns to Emily sheepishly, and she glares at him as he hangs his head, shakes it, looks up, and his eyes dart around, a sign of discomfort. Emily walks away, and Cal turns to watch her go as Emily gets into her car, a compact sedan, and drives off. Bernie and Claire walk away as it starts to rain, adding a dramatic effect to the scene. Jacob sits alone in his smart, minimalist apartment, inspired by modern Scandinavian interior design, eating a bowl of cereal and studying the packet, with a large black and white abstract painting, a piece by a renowned local artist, hanging behind him. Emily drives through the night, shaking her head in disbelief at the wheel and blinks and sighs heavily as Cal leans against his car outside the school in a moment of reflection and lets the rain soak him, symbolizing a cleansing or fresh start."

A fire alarm blares on, he leaps, and then he crawls away quietly. Marcus builds a puzzle with Terry; they both wear gardening hats, Terry grins, and Marcus curls his ears, squints at Terry, and flings the kite at him, who catches it in his hat and dances before tossing it back.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
