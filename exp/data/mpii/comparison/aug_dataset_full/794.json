Willie then approaches his old, worn-out car and, following a moment of intimacy, leans casually against it, enjoying another cigarette while she steps out to face him. The exchange is brief as she returns his half-smile with one of her own before turning away and walking off. Not long after her departure, a somber Indian man from the bar urgently approaches Willie and delivers a forceful shove, prompting Curly Head Fat Ass to intervene by pulling the man, referred to as Mr. Not Gay, off Willie. With a sense of indignation, Mr. Not Gay then strides away into the night, leaving Willie to catch his breath as he exchanges glances with Fat Ass, who reciprocates the look. Later on, Willie offers Fat Ass a ride home in his dilapidated vehicle, and as they sit inside, Fat Ass gazes at Willie with a warm smile, which Willie does not return, instead diverting his gaze. Unperturbed, the kid continues to watch Willie, who subsequently switches off the car's engine along with its single functional headlight before they both exit the vehicle.

Grandma walks by Willie without acknowledging the bizarre sight of him wearing a Santa outfit topped with a black balaclava. With a silent nod from the kid, Willie removes the balaclava, methodically opens a safe, and extracts bundles of cash along with a passport, securing them before heading over to an armchair and settling into it. The naive kid grins at him with admiration. Willie subsequently leaves the scene, driving off in a luxurious BMW. The following day in the mall, Bob, the manager, is conducting his routine inspections and moves through a women's clothing store catering to larger sizes when an unfamiliar noise from the fitting room captures his attention. Curiosity piqued, Bob bends down to peer under a cubicle door, revealing a pair of women’s feet accompanied by a man’s feet clad in red Santa pants pooled around his ankles. Marcus catches Bob’s eye, casting a look of reproach his way, before helping himself to a candy from a jar on Bob’s desk as he makes his exit. Later, Marcus meanders through a mall restaurant, sipping on a Coke, when he catches sight of Willie flirting with an attractive blonde at a pinball machine, brazenly thrusting his hips toward her.

She nods and looks at his glass, pours him another shot of whiskey, a favored spirit originating from Scotland and Ireland, and then one for herself. They down them in one, a common custom in drinking culture to signal camaraderie, and she gives him a coy look. Willie gets into his beaten-up old car, a relic of a bygone era with its chipped paint and rusted bumper. After the festive fornication, a slang term for casual and celebratory intimacy, Willie leans against the car having a smoke, while she gets out and faces him. He half-smiles and nods, and she gives him a smile and heads off. Once she's gone, the moody-looking Indian guy from the bar, whose intensity had been noticed earlier, runs over and shoves Willie, and Curly Head Fat Ass, known for his peculiar nickname and distinct hairstyle, pulls Mr. Not Gay off Willie. Mr. Not Gay, whose name suggests a play on stereotypes, marches off into the night, and Willie catches his breath and turns to Fat Ass. Fat Ass turns to him. Sometime later, Willie gives Fat Ass a lift home in his knackered old car, an embarrassing but functional vehicle. Sitting in the passenger seat, the kid stares at Willie and smiles warmly, revealing a genuine affection, but Willie looks away. Apparently unmoved, the kid keeps staring at Willie. Willie turns off his engine and one working headlight, a testament to the car's decrepitude, then gets out of the car with the kid. Willie admires the affluent suburban house they're in front of, a marked contrast to his economic situation, and frowns. As the kid unlocks the door, Willie pulls out a cotch, a concealed weapon often used in stealth, and puts on a black balaclava, reminiscent of bank heists in movies. Inside, Grandma is watching a TV program featuring dancing fruit, an absurdist comedy series popular for its quirky humor. Grandma walks past Willie, apparently unmoved by the fact that Santa is wearing a black balaclava, adding a surreal touch to the scene. Willie turns to the kid, who nods. Willie pulls up his balaclava, opens a safe with a skill honed by years of practice, and removes wads of cash and a passport, then shuts the safe and goes and sits down in an armchair. The credulous kid beams at him, clearly impressed by the night's adventure. Willie drives away in a very nice BMW, a luxury car that starkly contrasts with his usual ride. The next day at the mall, a bustling hub of consumer activity, Bob, the manager, is doing his rounds and strolls through a woman's wear shop for larger ladies, a niche retail segment that has grown in recent years. Some noise emanating from the changing room catches his attention, and Bob decides to investigate. He looks under a cubicle door and sees a woman's feet and a man's feet behind them, with red Santa pants at his ankles, suggesting a clandestine encounter. Marcus gives Bob a reproachful look and takes a candy from a jar on Bob's desk as he leaves, showcasing his mischievous character. Later, Marcus wanders through a restaurant in the mall, sipping a classic American Coke, and spots Willie putting the moves on a hot-bodied blonde at a pinball machine, a retro game experiencing a resurgence in popularity. Willie thrusts his crotch into the blonde, an overt display of machismo. As he opens the car door, a pile of empties, evidence of his excessive drinking, spills out, and he drives off, crashing them under his wheels. Bob is with Gin, the security chief known for her sharp instincts, who eats an orange while Bob winces at the phrase, highlighting his aversion to certain expressions."

He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
