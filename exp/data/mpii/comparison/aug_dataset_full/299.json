The screen becomes completely dominated by the eyes, nose, and mouth of a woman who is moving closer and closer to the CAMERA, intending to give Jeff a kiss.

She kisses Jeff firmly, with an assertive touch, but it lacks the intensity of deep passion. Then, her head retreats just an inch or two, and she begins to speak.

As Jeff begins to stir from his sleep, his eyes slowly, almost languidly, open, and he directs his gaze upward. The screen then becomes overwhelmingly dominated by the eyes, nose, and mouth of a woman who is, in her approach, moving closer and more intimately toward the CAMERA, clearly intending to give Jeff a kiss.

He remains in peaceful slumber until a shadow, cast by another person, subtly creeps across his face. As the shadow plays upon his features, his eyelids slowly flutter open, awareness dawning in his gaze. He turns his eyes upwards, just in time to see the screen dominated by the approaching eyes, nose, and mouth of a woman who steadily moves closer to the CAMERA, intending to kiss Jeff. The woman’s face, mostly enveloped in shadow except for a faint glow from the window tracing her profile, descends as she places a firm yet unpassionate kiss upon Jeff's lips. Her head then retreats slightly, just an inch or two, and she begins to speak. The CAMERA captures this moment, with their profiles enlarging to fill the frame before it lowers, leading the audience to focus exclusively on the expression in their eyes, while their lips exit the bottom of the screen. Without missing a beat, the CAMERA trails her as she swiftly advances towards another lamp, distancing herself slightly so her form is visible down to the waist. Upon reaching the lamp, she turns it on, the illumination deftly revealing that her allure extends beyond her facial beauty. The CAMERA follows her graceful motion to yet another lamp, which she also lights, now displaying her full figure. She stands impeccably dressed in high-style, dramatic evening wear, her entire appearance beautifully groomed and flawless. Jeff's gaze crosses from his current position to take in her elegant form. In response, she executes a professional model's turn, elegantly showcasing the dress's features. Jeff responds to this display, prompting her to laugh softly. Her eyes wander down to a long mahogany table beside her, cluttered with his personal belongings, including her own handbag. As she speaks, her eyes flit across the tabletop, as if searching for something specific. Her search ends as she picks up an old and cracked cigarette box, examining it thoughtfully while continuing her conversation. She turns to face him again, moving towards him with a purposeful stride, bearing the cigarette box. Facing Jeff, she makes a quick decision, pivoting towards the door with urgency, and as she rushes past, she deftly drops the cigarette box back onto the table, THE CAMERA closely following her movements. Ascending the two steps leading to the door, she halts and turns back towards Jeff, extending her arm to grasp the doorknob, which she turns with a swift motion. The door swings open revealing a middle-aged waiter, framed perfectly in the doorway. He wears a pristine white linen pea jacket, accented by a red collar, exuding an aura of tender amusement. A smile plays across his lips as he acknowledges them with a nod and steps inside. In one hand, he balances a substantial portable warming oven, while the other grips an ice bucket, its contents—a bottle of wine discreetly shrouded with a napkin. Descending the stairs, she trails behind him, seamlessly taking the wine bucket he extends to her, which she then places with care upon the table. THE CAMERA seamlessly accompanies them, capturing their synchronized choreography as he advances towards the kitchen, while she diverts towards a small bar set within the wall cabinet."

A shadow of some other person, briefly obscuring the early morning sunlight filtering through the window, creeps over his face. His eyes start to open. He looks up. The screen is filled with the eyes, nose, and mouth of a woman coming nearer and nearer to the CAMERA to kiss Jeff. The face is more or less in shadow, with a faint light coming onto the profile from the window, hinting at the dawn of a new day. The girl kisses Jeff firmly, but not passionately, suggesting a relationship marked by comfort rather than fiery romance. Then her head moves back an inch or two. She speaks softly, her voice blending into the quiet hum of city life beneath them. The two big profiles fill the screen.

The CAMERA PANS HER over to a third lamp which she turns on. She is now full figure, beautifully groomed and flawless, reminiscent of the iconic models seen on the covers of high-fashion magazines. Her dress is high-style fashion and dramatic evening wear, likely from a high-end designer known for luxurious fabrics and elegant cuts. Jeff looks across the room at her. She does a professional model's turn in the dress, showing off its features with practiced poise. Jeff replies. She laughs pleasantly, her laughter echoing like the gentle clinking of glasses at an exclusive gala. She looks down at the long mahogany table beside her, which is littered with a number of his personal effects, including a vintage camera from Jeff's days as a renowned photojournalist. Her own handbag, a limited edition piece from a famous Parisian designer, is also on the table. As she talks, her eyes scan the table as if she's looking for something specific. Lisa finds what she has been looking for, picks up an old and cracked cigarette box, a memento from a distant trip to Havana, and examines it as she talks. She turns to look at him and moves toward him, carrying the cigarette box. Lisa faces Jeff in the chair. She turns around quickly and dashes to the door, dropping the cigarette box on the table as she passes, THE CAMERA PANNING with her. She goes up the two steps, stops, and turns back to Jeff.

The ear is more or less in silhouette, with a dim lantern dropping onto the silhouette from the door. The kitten tickles Earl softly, but not intensely. Then its neck retracts upward a centimeter or four. It quacks. The two tiny silhouettes fill the fabric. It drifts down until the toes drift out of the top of the fabric, leaving only the ears filling it. The PIPELINE PURSUES IT immediately to another curtain. It journeys a bit higher away from us so that we now glimpse it up to its fingers. It flips on the third curtain, and the lantern reveals to us that its complexity is not absent on its ears. The PIPELINE SWINGS IT over to a second curtain which it flips on. It is now half object, attractively groomed and impeccable. Its hat is high-style attire and theatrical evening gear. Earl glances across the chamber at it. It completes a professional mannequin's rotation on the hat, showcasing its dimensions. Earl retorts. It chuckles softly. It glances upward at the short willow carpet behind it, which is cluttered with several of his foreign accessories. Its separate backpack is also on the carpet. As it squawks, its ears assess the carpet as if it's glancing for anything random. Carla reveals what it has been glancing for, grips an young and shattered ornament box, and scrutinizes it as it squawks. It flips to scrutinize him and leaps toward him, gripping the ornament box. Carla faces Earl on the divan. It spins around calmly and strolls to the gate, placing the ornament box on the carpet as it passes, THE PIPELINE ROTATING with it. It drifts across the nine walls, halts, and spins backward to Earl. It grips the gatepost and rotates it. It glides open the gate and stumbles to one edge.

It's balancing in one talon a tiny elastic painting brush, and in the other talon a bread basket containing a goblet of tea wrapped with a parchment. It drifts up the walls as it stumbles. It grips it the tea basket, and it positions it on the carpet. THE PIPELINE GLIDES with any of them as it flips toward the hallway and it drifts to a broad closet nestled in the floor chest."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
