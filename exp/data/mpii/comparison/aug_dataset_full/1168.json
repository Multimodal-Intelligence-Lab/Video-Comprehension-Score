Harry pulls Nigel away just before the wall implodes, sending chunks of stones flying into the room in a cloud of dust, while Umbridge beams with satisfaction. Harry notices Draco holding a tearful and distressed Cho. Dumbledore winks at Harry as Fawkes the phoenix swoops down, and man and bird disappear in a burst of flame. Meanwhile, Filch climbs a high, tottering ladder to read the latest decree, removing a painting of six men in Elizabethan dress inspecting a skeleton to make more space on the wall. The men in the painting look up in alarm as Filch tips it to one side, and they all slide out of sight. The intricate locking mechanism on the school's main doors slides into place. In the great hall, the members of Dumbledore's army take their punishment, writing without ink using Umbridge's curled brown quills as she sits on the stage facing them, perched on Dumbledore's chair, dressed in a long pink robe, and drinking a cup of tea.

Hermione takes the handlebars, and Gwarp looks at her expectantly, with Hagrid nodding encouragement. Hermione rings the rusty bell, and Gwarp sits playing with it, smiling innocently. Meanwhile, Harry sees his parents in a mirror, with a reflection of his younger self between them as Snape points his wand, causing a confusion of happy and terrifying memories to flash through Harry's mind.",

          "description": "Luna's argent Patronus vanishes as the chamber becomes dim, prompting the pupils to glance around apprehensively. A vast looking-glass fragments and breaks, and Nigel gazes through an aperture in the rock barrier behind it, viewing Umbridge and her squad, as she directs her wand. Harry draws Nigel away just before the wall collapses, sending pieces of rocks soaring into the chamber in a mist of grit, while Umbridge grins with gratification. Harry observes Draco holding a weeping and troubled Cho. Dumbledore blinks at Harry as Fawkes the phoenix dives downward, and man and bird vanish in a flare of fire. Meanwhile, Filch ascends a tall, unsteady ladder to read the newest edict, removing an artwork of six men in Elizabethan attire examining a skeleton to create additional space on the barrier. The men in the artwork glance up in fright as Filch tips it to one side, and they all slip out of view. The complex fastening mechanism on the academy's principal portals glides into position. In the grand hall, the constituents of Dumbledore's legion take their chastisement, inscribing without ink using Umbridge's coiled sepia quills as she sits on the platform facing them, perched on Dumbledore's chair, clad in a lengthy pink robe, and sipping a cup of tea. As the pupils grimace with agony, she grins to herself with evident delight, while Fred and George, clenching their teeth, stare at her. Outside the hall, Cho is standing as the pupils exit, clutching their aching and painful hands. Tentatively, Cho approaches the last person to depart, but he dismisses her and walks by, leaving her weeping and desolate as she watches after him. Elsewhere, Hagrid gazes through an archway into the Forbidden Forest, where a herd of beings, half-man, half-horse, races past, and a young giant looms out of the shadows, tenfold larger than Hagrid. The giant crushes a bird between his enormous hands as Gwarp lumbers towards them, knocking Hagrid aside. Though they retreat, Gwarp is restrained by a cord tethered to a tree, towering over them. Gwarp seizes Hermione, while Ron thwacks Gwarp and is knocked over. Hermione, looking like a minuscule doll in the giant's grasp, wags her finger sternly in his visage, and Gwarp places her tenderly on the ground. Ron gazes at her worriedly as Gwarp searches through a mound of scrap metal, selecting a present for Hermione—a pair of bicycle handlebars in his gigantic grasp—which he extends to her. Hermione takes the handlebars, and Gwarp gazes at her expectantly, with Hagrid nodding support. Hermione rings the corroded bell, and Gwarp sits playing with it, grinning guilelessly. Meanwhile, Harry sees his progenitors in a mirror, with a reflection of his juvenile self between them as Snape directs his wand, causing a confusion of joyous and frightening recollections to flash through Harry's mind."

The substantial, imposing mirror cracks loudly before shattering completely, and Nigel, curious, peers through the newly formed hole in the stone wall that has been revealed behind it. On the other side, he spots Umbridge and her cohort, her wand raised with determination. In a swift and protective motion, Harry pulls Nigel away just moments before the wall suddenly implodes, hurling a torrent of stone fragments into the room in a massive, swirling cloud of dust, while Umbridge looks on, beaming with satisfaction at the chaos she has caused. Harry's attention is then drawn to Draco, who is holding a tearful and visibly distressed Cho. Dumbledore, with a gentle, reassuring wink directed at Harry, signals Fawkes the phoenix to swoop down. In an instant, both man and majestic bird vanish in a dazzling burst of flame. Meanwhile, Filch, the caretaker, climbs a precariously high, wobbly ladder to read the latest decree. During this task, he removes a painting depicting six men in Elizabethan attire who are inspecting a skeleton, making space for the decree on the wall. Alarmed, the painted men glance upwards as Filch tips their painting to one side, causing them to slide out of view. The school's main doors lock securely with an intricate mechanism sliding into place. Within the grand expanse of the great hall, the members of Dumbledore's army undergo their punishment, forced to write without ink using Umbridge's tightly curled brown quills. Seated on the stage and facing them, she perches comfortably on Dumbledore's chair, clad in a long pink robe, sipping tea with a smug satisfaction. As the students wince in pain from their tasks, she smiles to herself in clear delight, while Fred and George grit their teeth in defiance, glaring intently at her. Outside the hall, as students emerge, Cho stands waiting, clutching her sore, painful hands. Hesitantly, she approaches the last person to exit, but he dismissively ignores her, walking past without a word, leaving her feeling tearful and forlorn as she watches him leave. Elsewhere, Hagrid peers through an archway leading into the ominous Forbidden Forest, where a majestic herd of centaur-like creatures, half-man, half-horse, gallops by with striking grace. Emerging from the shadows, a young giant appears, towering at a size ten times greater than Hagrid himself. The giant flattens an unfortunate bird between his enormous hands as Gwarp, another giant, lumbers towards them, inadvertently knocking Hagrid aside. Although they back away cautiously, Gwarp is kept from advancing further by a rope tethered to a tree, towering over them nonetheless. In a surprising move, Gwarp grabs Hermione, but Ron responds by thwacking Gwarp, only to be knocked over himself. Hermione, appearing like a tiny, delicate doll within the giant's fist, sternly wags her finger in his face, prompting Gwarp to gently place her back on the ground. With a mixture of anxiety and assurance, Ron looks on as Gwarp sifts through a pile of scrap metal, ultimately selecting a gift for Hermione—a pair of bicycle handlebars held in his massive grip—which he proudly offers to her. Hermione accepts the handlebars, and Gwarp gazes at her expectantly, while Hagrid nods with encouragement. When Hermione rings the rusty bell attached to the handlebars, Gwarp sits contentedly, playing with it and smiling innocently, as if delighted by the simple sound. Meanwhile, Harry experiences a vision in which he sees his beloved parents reflected in a mirror, with the image of his younger self situated between them. As Snape points his wand, a rapid succession of joyous and terrifying memories flash chaotically through Harry's mind."

          "description": "As Luna's ethereal, silvery Patronus flickers and fades away, the room is enveloped in darkness, leading the students to exchange nervous glances, their eyes darting around for reassurance. Suddenly, a large mirror begins to crack, its intricate surface splintering until it shatters completely. Through the new opening in the stone wall behind it, Nigel cautiously peers, his eyes widening in alarm as he spots Umbridge and her squad; her wand is poised and ready. Sensing imminent danger, Harry swiftly grabs Nigel and urgently pulls him away just in time to avoid the implosion of the wall, which bursts inward, unleashing a barrage of stone chunks that hurtle into the room amid a swirling cloud of dust. Meanwhile, Umbridge stands by, her face alight with satisfaction at the chaos she has orchestrated. Amidst the tumult, Harry's attention is drawn to Draco, who is holding Cho close, her face tear-streaked and distressed. At that moment, Dumbledore, with a subtle yet reassuring wink directed at Harry, signals to Fawkes the phoenix. With synchronized grace, man and bird vanish together in a brilliant explosion of fiery light. Meanwhile, in another corner of the castle, Filch ascends a precariously high, swaying ladder to post the latest decree. As he does so, he removes a painting depicting six men in Elizabethan attire who are examining a skeleton, making room on the wall. The men in the painting, startled by this disturbance, cast their gaze upwards in alarm as Filch tilts the frame, causing them to slide out of view, disappearing from sight. Elsewhere, the school's formidable main doors are secured with the precision of an intricate locking mechanism. Inside the great hall, members of Dumbledore's Army endure their punishment, each student diligently writing without ink, using the distinctive, curled brown quills provided by Umbridge. She sits with authority on the stage, occupying Dumbledore's chair, her long pink robe flowing elegantly around her as she sips leisurely from a cup of tea. The students, their faces contorted with pain, are witnessed by Umbridge, who regards their discomfort with a self-satisfied smile. Among the group, Fred and George silently seethe with anger, their eyes locked on her. As the students file out of the hall, Cho stands by, her demeanor marked by sorrow as she gingerly holds her aching hands. She takes a tentative step forward, intending to approach the last student to leave, but he brusquely ignores her and strides past, leaving her standing there, eyes filled with tears and heart heavy with disappointment as she watches him walk away. Meanwhile, in a different part of the magical world, Hagrid is seen peering through the leafy archway of the Forbidden Forest. He watches as a herd of centaurs, their forms an extraordinary fusion of man and horse, thunders past. Emerging from the shadowy woodland, a young giant, a colossal figure towering ten times Hagrid's height, looms into view. As the giant nonchalantly flattens a bird between his massive hands, Gwarp, another giant, advances clumsily towards them, inadvertently knocking Hagrid aside. Despite their retreat, Gwarp's movements are constrained by a rope tethered to a nearby tree, causing him to stand towering yet somewhat contained. But Gwarp reaches out and seizes Hermione, lifting her as though she were a fragile doll clutched in his immense palm. Displaying surprising courage, Hermione sternly wags her finger at him in admonishment, prompting Gwarp to gently lower her to the ground. Observing with palpable concern, Ron watches Hermione intently as Gwarp rummages through a nearby heap of scrap metal, thoughtfully selecting a pair of bicycle handlebars clutched in his enormous hand, which he presents to Hermione as a gift. Accepting the handlebars, Hermione meets Gwarp's expectant gaze as Hagrid nods in silent encouragement. Gaining a sense of comfort, Hermione rings the rusty bell attached to the handlebars, eliciting a delighted response from Gwarp as he sits down, his attention fully absorbed in the simple pleasure of playing with the bell, a genuine smile of innocent delight spread across his face. Simultaneously, Harry finds himself gazing into a mirror, where the reflections of his parents appear alongside a younger version of himself. At this poignant moment, Snape raises his wand, conjuring a swirling conflux of cherished memories and terrifying experiences that flash through Harry's mind, creating a jumbled tapestry of emotions."

A huge mirror, reminiscent of the magical Mirror of Erised that shows one's deepest desires, cracks and shatters, and Nigel peers through a hole in the stone wall behind it, seeing Umbridge and her Inquisitorial Squad, a group of students she enlisted to enforce her strict rules, as she aims her wand. Harry pulls Nigel away just before the wall implodes, sending chunks of stones flying into the room in a cloud of dust, while Umbridge beams with satisfaction, reveling in her authority as Hogwarts High Inquisitor. Harry notices Draco holding a tearful and distressed Cho, who recently faced accusations of betrayal. Dumbledore, known for his wisdom and calm in crises, winks at Harry as Fawkes the phoenix swoops down, and man and bird disappear in a burst of flame, a method of transport unique to phoenixes. Meanwhile, Filch, the school's cantankerous caretaker, climbs a high, tottering ladder to read the latest Educational Decree issued by Umbridge, removing a painting of six men in Elizabethan dress inspecting a skeleton to make more space on the wall. The men in the painting look up in alarm as Filch tips it to one side, and they all slide out of sight. The intricate locking mechanism, part of the school’s enhanced security measures, on the main doors slides into place. In the great hall, the members of Dumbledore's Army, a secret student group formed to oppose Umbridge's tyranny, take their punishment, writing without ink using Umbridge's sinister enchanted quills that carve words into their skin, as she sits on the stage facing them, perched on Dumbledore's chair, dressed in a long pink robe, and drinking a cup of tea. As the students wince with pain, she smiles to herself with obvious pleasure, while Fred and George, known for their rebellious spirit and penchant for pranks, grit their teeth and glare at her. Outside the hall, Cho is standing as the students come out, clutching their sore and painful hands. Hesitantly, Cho approaches the last person to leave, but he cuts her dead and walks past, leaving her tearful and forlorn as she gazes after him. Elsewhere, Hagrid peers through an archway into the Forbidden Forest, a dangerous and mysterious part of the Hogwarts grounds, where a herd of centaurs, creatures half-man, half-horse, gallops past, and a young giant looms out of the shadows, ten times bigger than Hagrid. The giant flattens a bird between his huge hands as Gwarp, Hagrid's half-brother, lumbers towards them, knocking Hagrid aside. Though they back away, Gwarp is restrained by a rope tethered to a tree, towering over them. Gwarp grabs Hermione, while Ron thwacks Gwarp and is knocked over. Hermione, looking like a tiny doll in the giant's fist, wags her finger sternly in his face, and Gwarp places her gently on the ground. Ron looks at her anxiously as Gwarp searches through a pile of scrap metal, choosing a gift for Hermione—a pair of bicycle handlebars in his colossal fist—which he offers to her. Hermione takes the handlebars, and Gwarp looks at her expectantly, with Hagrid, deeply fond of magical creatures despite their danger, nodding encouragement. Hermione rings the rusty bell, and Gwarp sits playing with it, smiling innocently, a rare moment of peace for the often intimidating creature. Meanwhile, Harry sees his parents in a mirror, with a reflection of his younger self between them as Snape, a complex figure often at odds with Harry, points his wand, causing a confusion of happy and terrifying memories to flash through Harry's mind."

Harry observes Draco cradling a cheerful and relieved Cho. Dumbledore salutes Harry as Fawkes the phoenix glides up, and man and bird materialize in a flash of light. Meanwhile, Filch descends a low, steady staircase to recite the latest decree, adding a painting of six men in Elizabethan attire examining a skeleton to create additional space on the wall. The men in the painting gaze down in surprise as Filch slides it into position, and they all drift out of view. The intricate locking mechanism on the school's main doors retracts from place. In the great hall, the members of Dumbledore's army enjoy their task, painting with ink using Umbridge's curled brown quills as she stands on the stage beside them, leaning on Dumbledore's chair, dressed in a short pink jacket, and sipping a mug of cocoa.

Outside the hall, Cho is sitting as the students enter, patting their smooth and soothed hands. Eagerly, Cho approaches the first person to arrive, but he hugs her warmly and stops, leaving her joyful and elated as she gazes at him. Elsewhere, Hagrid steps back from an archway into the Forbidden Forest, where a herd of creatures, half-man, half-horse, strolls past, and a young giant appears from the mist, twice smaller than Hagrid. The giant catches a leaf between his huge hands as Gwarp strolls towards them, nudging Hagrid gently. Though they approach, Gwarp is secured by a ribbon tied to a branch, looming under them. Gwarp releases Hermione, while Ron pats Gwarp and is lifted gently. Hermione, looking like a tiny doll on the giant's shoulder, nods approvingly in his face, and Gwarp sets her softly on the earth. Ron peers at her warmly as Gwarp digs through a pile of feathers, selecting a gift for Hermione—a pair of toy car wheels in his colossal fist—which he extends to her. Hermione accepts the wheels, and Gwarp gazes at her eagerly, with Hagrid clapping encouragement. Hermione revs the shiny wheel, and Gwarp stands playing with it, smiling eagerly.

A tiny umbrella cracks and shatters, and a notebook peers through a hole in the metal door behind it, seeing a violin and its orchestra, as it aims its brush. A painting pulls a notebook away just before the door implodes, sending ribbons of paint flying into the kitchen in a cloud of glitter, while a violin beams with satisfaction. A painting notices a guitar holding a delighted and thrilled bicycle. A clock winks at a painting as a pillow the canary swoops down, and curtain and fly disappear in a burst of song. Meanwhile, a hammer climbs a low, sturdy bookshelf to read the oldest cookbook, removing a calendar of two cats in Egyptian hats observing a seashell to make more space on the door. The cats in the calendar look up in curiosity as a hammer tips it to one side, and they all slide out of sight. The intricate opening lock on the ocean's main windows slides into place. In the small kitchen, the visitors of a clock's city take their journey, dancing without music using a violin's long blue batons as it sits on the floor facing them, perched on a clock's table, dressed in a short green scarf, and drinking a cup of chocolate. As the lamps smile with joy, it murmurs to itself with obvious distaste, while a tree and a drum, opening their mouths, glare at it. Outside the kitchen, a bicycle is standing as the lamps come out, clutching their colorful and smooth books. Joyfully, a bicycle approaches the first creature to arrive, but it cuts it alive and runs past, leaving it delighted and ecstatic as it dances after it. Nearby, a guitar peers through a window into the Enchanted Cave, where a flock of inventions, half-cat, half-elephant, float past, and a tiny mouse looms out of the clouds, ninety times smaller than a guitar. The mouse inflates a curtain between its tiny ribbons as Lamp sways towards them, pushing a guitar aside. Though they tiptoe away, Lamp is released by a thread tangled to a mountain, towering under them. Lamp catches a monkey, while a bus thwacks Lamp and is shaken up. A monkey, looking like a giant truck in the mouse's eye, wags its wheel happily in its field, and Lamp places it softly on the sky. A bus looks at it nervously as Lamp searches through a pile of clouds, designing a stage for a monkey—a pair of ocean sunglasses in its miniscule wheel—which it suggests to it. A monkey captures the sunglasses, and Lamp looks at it quietly, with a guitar humming encouragement. A monkey plays the golden drum, and Lamp stands swimming with it, singing loudly. Meanwhile, a painting sees its friends in a photograph, with an illusion of its elder kin around them as a horse whispers its brush, causing a collection of sad and thrilling books to fly through a painting's heart."

An enormous portrait crumbles and disintegrates, and Gary peers through a crack in the wooden cabinet behind it, spotting Snape and his team, as he launches his staff. Hermione pushes Gary aside just before the cabinet explodes, sending splinters of wood flying into the hallway in a swirl of smoke, while Snape grins with delight. Hermione notices Neville holding a laughing and jubilant Luna. McGonagall nods at Hermione as Hedwig the owl glides upward, and woman and owl vanish in a flicker of lightning. Meanwhile, Sprout scales a wide, rickety staircase to display the new poster, shifting a painting of seven women in Victorian attire studying an owl to clear more floor space. The women in the painting glance down in shock as Sprout tilts it forward, and they all disappear from view. The elaborate closing mechanism on the school's side windows locks into position. In the small auditorium, the followers of McGonagall's league receive their commendation, sketching without paper using Snape's twisted black pens as he lounges on the platform observing them, settled on McGonagall's bench, dressed in a short green cloak, and sipping a glass of juice. As the teachers chuckle with relief, he frowns to himself with evident displeasure, while Ron and Ginny, smiling broadly, wave at him. Inside the corridor, Luna is sitting as the teachers enter, massaging their smooth and delicate feet. Confidently, Luna addresses the first person to arrive, but she turns her back and strides by, leaving her smiling and upbeat as she watches her depart. Somewhere else, Sprout gazes through a window into the Magical Garden, where a flock of creatures, half-bird, half-lion, strolls past, and an old giant emerges from the mist, twenty times smaller than Sprout. The giant squashes an insect between his tiny fingers as Nerf trudges towards them, stepping over Sprout. Though they approach closer, Nerf is trapped by a chain tied to a boulder, looming beside them. Nerf grabs Ron, while Neville pats Nerf and is brushed aside. Ron, looking like a miniature doll in the giant's grasp, shakes his head gently in his sight, and Nerf sets him softly on the ground. Neville glances at him confidently as Nerf rummages through a heap of old newspapers, selecting a trinket for Ron—a set of car wheels in his enormous grasp—which he extends to him. Ron accepts the wheels, and Nerf observes him hopefully, with Sprout shaking encouragement. Ron honks the bronze horn, and Nerf sits engaging with it, grinning bashfully. Meanwhile, Hermione observes her mentors in a photograph, with a depiction of her older self beside them as Draco waves his staff, creating a deluge of joyous and haunting visions to flash through Hermione's thoughts."

Harry nudges Nigel aside just before the panel collapses, sending wisps of paper fluttering into the room in a swirl of feathers, while Umbridge grins with delight. Harry notices Draco cradling a cheerful and relaxed Cho. Dumbledore nods at Harry as Fawkes the phoenix glides upwards, and man and bird appear in a flash of water. Meanwhile, Filch descends a short, sturdy staircase to doodle on the latest notice, attaching a portrait of three women in Victorian attire examining a tapestry to make less space on the wall. The women in the portrait glance down in amusement as Filch balances it to the other side, and they all dance into view. The simple locking mechanism on the school's rear windows spins into position.

Outside the hall, Cho is sitting as the students go out, caressing their smooth and gentle arms. Boldly, Cho confronts the last person to leave, but he greets her warmly and walks alongside, leaving her smiling and content as she follows him. Elsewhere, Hagrid spies through a doorway into the Forbidden Ocean, where a pod of animals, half-bird, half-lion, soars past, and a young dragon emerges from the mist, ten times smaller than Hagrid. The dragon crushes a cloud between its tiny wings as Gwarp skips toward them, nudging Hagrid gently. Though they step closer, Gwarp is anchored by a chain tied to a rock, towering beneath them. Gwarp snatches Hermione, while Ron tickles Gwarp and is brushed aside. Hermione, looking like a tiny leaf in the dragon's wing, nods approvingly in his face, and Gwarp places her softly on the grass. Ron gazes at her proudly as Gwarp rummages through a pile of seashells, selecting a gift for Hermione—a pair of seashell earrings in his delicate grasp—which he presents to her. Hermione takes the earrings, and Gwarp gazes at her hopefully, with Hagrid applauding gently. Hermione jingles the bright shell, and Gwarp sits examining it, beaming innocently. Meanwhile, Harry sees his friends in a pond, with a reflection of his older self among them as Snape waves his book, causing a cascade of joyful and frightening images to ripple through Harry's mind."

Oliver observes Max clutching a playful and joyful Daisy. Professor Chuckles nods at Oliver as Gertrude the griffin glides upward, and elephant and griffin vanish in a whoosh of smoke. Meanwhile, Marvin descends a low, sturdy staircase to hear the oldest rumor, erasing a sketch of four women in Roman attire studying a lizard to make room on the floor. The women in the sketch glance down in surprise as Marvin drops it to the ceiling, and they all disappear from view. The simple unlocking device on the garden's small windows locks out of reach. In the vast meadow, the guests of Professor Chuckles' team celebrate their achievement, drawing with paint using Samantha’s pointed black brushes as she stands by the fence observing them, leaning against Professor Chuckles' bench, dressed in a short green garment, and munching a piece of pie. As the chefs grin with joy, she frowns to herself with evident displeasure, while Tim and Jack, laughing quietly, ignore her. Inside the meadow, Daisy is sitting as the guests stroll in, stretching their strong and healthy feet. Confidently, Daisy retreats from the first person to enter, but she cheers him up and skips away, deserting him cheerful and content as he watches after her. Somewhere else, Leonard leaps through a passageway into the Secret Garden, where a pack of creatures, half-wolf, half-owl, soars past, and an old dragon sneaks out of the sunlight, four times smaller than Leonard. The dragon flattens a leaf between his tiny claws as Lark tiptoes towards them, pushing Leonard aside. Though they approach closer, Lark is supported by a vine fastened to a bush, overshadowing them. Lark lifts Cindy, while Tom nudges Lark and is praised swiftly. Cindy, looking like a large statue in the dragon's claw, shakes her head gently in his direction, and Lark places her firmly on the rock. Tom stares at her joyfully as Lark rummages through a pile of real treasure, selecting a treasure for Cindy—a set of toy soldiers in his minuscule claw—which he shows to her. Cindy accepts the soldiers, and Lark watches her patiently, with Leonard shaking disapproval. Cindy swings the tiny ribbon, and Lark stands admiring it, clapping loudly. Meanwhile, Oliver notices his siblings in a pond, with an image of his elder brother behind them as Daniel waves his torch, creating a series of sad and exhilarating dreams to flicker through Oliver's soul."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Umbridge is satisfied as Draco comforts a tearful Cho. Dumbledore vanishes with Fawkes in flames. Filch removes a painting to post a new decree as the men's alarmed figures disappear. The school's doors lock, and in the great hall, Dumbledore's army silently endures punishment with Umbridge's quills. Umbridge, pleased, watches from Dumbledore's chair. Fred and George glare at her. Outside, Cho tries to approach the last student, who ignores her, leaving her sad. Hagrid observes the Forbidden Forest, where centaur-like creatures and a giant appear. The giant, Gwarp, captures Hermione but gently sets her down after she scolds him. Ron is knocked over but recovers. Gwarp offers Hermione bicycle handlebars as a gift, and she rings its bell, delighting him. Harry sees his parents in a mirror as Snape's wand prompts a mix of memories in Harry's mind."
