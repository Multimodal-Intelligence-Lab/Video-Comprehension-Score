She steps towards the door, pushes it wide open, and enters the office, where shafts of bright sunlight stream through the small window above the desk, bathing her face in golden light. Sandra moves a chair to the wall, stands on it, and looks out the window to see Howard bound to an inverted cross, with enormous blisters bubbling on his skin. As the blisters on Howard's exposed arms and chest throb, Sandra climbs down off the chair, and Kyle runs in and grabs her around the waist, but she elbows him aside. Audrey wakes up and runs to the office where Sandra is heaving the desk away from the door, then pushes Audrey away and runs outside. Percy grabs Sandra around the waist to turn her away as Howard's stomach explodes in a shower of steaming liquid. Percy heaves Sandra back into the office, where she flops on the floor. Charlie stares at Percy, leaning in the doorway, as he stares blankly into space, then falls flat on his face. His back is burnt off, steam wafts around his exposed organs, and later, in the storeroom, Percy lies under a white sheet while Bob leans on the covered corpse with a wretched expression, and Jeep stands in the doorway as Bob's face twitches. In the diner, Sandra, now bound to a chair with wrists tied behind her back, sits as bright shafts of light stream through gaps between planks nailed against the window. Kneeling in front of Sandra, Audrey takes a pill from a pot as Sandra, with tears on her face, nods. Audrey pops the pill in her mouth, offers Sandra a drink through a straw, and smiles, but Sandra narrows her eyes and fixes Audrey with a cold, bitter stare. Kyle walks in, prompting a shaken Audrey to get up and follow Kyle. Meanwhile, Charlie sits looking pensive as Audrey tries to tune the radio, turning the dial and moving the aerial around. Michael shakes his head, and Charlie looks down at her belly. Standing in the bathroom, Charlie lights a cigarette, has a puff, regards her pretty face in the mirror by the light of a lantern and a couple of candles, with an expression fraught. She gently runs her thumb over her pregnant belly, then throws down the cigarette sharply, stamps on it, grabs her jacket, walks out, and sits alone in the kitchen with her feet up.

She strides towards the portal, thrusts it wide open, and enters the workspace, where beams of brilliant sunlight pour through the small window above the workstation, bathing her visage in golden glow. Sandra relocates a seat to the partition, stands on it, and gazes out the window to see Howard tied to an upside-down cross, with enormous welts rising on his skin. As the welts on Howard's exposed limbs and torso pulsate, Sandra descends off the seat, and Kyle dashes in and seizes her around the waist, but she jabs him aside. Audrey awakens and rushes to the workspace where Sandra is dragging the workstation away from the portal, then shoves Audrey aside and dashes outdoors. Percy seizes Sandra around the waist to turn her away as Howard's abdomen bursts in a spray of scalding fluid. Percy drags Sandra back into the workspace, where she collapses on the ground. Charlie gawks at Percy, leaning in the entrance, as he gazes vacantly into the void, then falls flat on his visage. His back is charred off, vapor wafts around his exposed organs, and later, in the storeroom, Percy reclines under a white cover while Bob leans on the shrouded cadaver with a miserable expression, and Jeep stands in the entrance as Bob's visage twitches. In the eatery, Sandra, now bound to a seat with wrists tied behind her back, sits as bright beams of light pour through gaps between planks nailed against the window. Kneeling in front of Sandra, Audrey takes a tablet from a container as Sandra, with tears on her visage, nods. Audrey pops the tablet in her mouth, offers Sandra a beverage through a straw, and grins, but Sandra narrows her eyes and fixes Audrey with a cold, bitter glare. Kyle strolls in, prompting a shaken Audrey to rise and follow Kyle. Meanwhile, Charlie sits looking thoughtful as Audrey attempts to tune the radio, turning the knob and moving the antenna around. Michael shakes his head, and Charlie looks down at her abdomen. Standing in the lavatory, Charlie lights a cigarette, takes a puff, regards her pretty visage in the mirror by the glow of a lantern and a couple of candles, with an expression fraught. She gently runs her thumb over her gravid abdomen, then tosses down the cigarette sharply, stamps on it, grabs her jacket, walks out, and sits alone in the galley with her feet up. She looks up and grins at Jeep before taking her feet off the seat."

A chair is moved to the wall by Sandra, stood on, and the window is looked out by her to see Howard bound to an inverted cross, with enormous blisters bubbling on his skin.

As she pauses, her attention is drawn to a door that is slightly ajar, with a streak of light peeping invitingly through the gap. With a determined step, she approaches the door, pushes it wide open, and enters the office. Inside, shafts of bright, unfiltered sunlight stream through the small window positioned above the desk, casting a golden glow that bathes her face in warmth. \n\nWith a sense of purpose, Sandra places a sturdy chair against the wall, climbs up onto it, and peers out the window. Her gaze falls upon Howard, who is bound to an inverted cross, his skin marred by enormous blisters that bubble ominously. Witnessing the painful throbbing of the blisters on Howard's exposed arms and chest, Sandra climbs back down off the chair. Just then, Kyle bursts into the room and grabs her firmly around the waist, but Sandra, not easily deterred, elbows him aside forcefully. \n\nAudrey, suddenly awakened by the commotion, rushes to the office to find Sandra laboring to heave the desk away from the door. In a rush of adrenaline, Sandra pushes Audrey aside and runs outside.

As she pauses momentarily, her attention is inevitably drawn to a door that is left slightly ajar, allowing a streak of light to peep invitingly through the narrow gap, calling out to her curiosity. Gathering her resolve, she takes a determined step forward, approaching the door with a sense of purpose. With a firm push, she swings it wide open and steps into the office. Inside, shafts of bright, unfiltered sunlight stream powerfully through the small window positioned strategically above the desk, casting a golden glow that envelops her face in a comforting warmth. \n\nFilled with a sense of urgency and purpose, Sandra places a sturdy, reliable chair against the wall, climbs onto it with care, and peers out the window to get a better view. Her gaze falls upon Howard, who is unfortunately bound to an inverted cross, his skin cruelly marred by enormous blisters that bubble menacingly. Witnessing the painful throbbing of the blisters on Howard's exposed arms and chest, Sandra climbs back down from the chair with determination. Just at that moment, Kyle bursts into the room with sudden energy and grabs her firmly around the waist, but Sandra, displaying her resilience, elbows him aside forcefully, refusing to be easily deterred.\n\nAudrey, suddenly awakened by the commotion echoing through the space, rushes to the office to find Sandra laboring with determination to heave the desk away from the door. Fueled by a rush of adrenaline, Sandra pushes Audrey aside with urgency and makes her way outside in a hurry. Percy quickly intercepts her, grabbing her securely around the waist to forcibly turn her away just as Howard’s stomach violently explodes in a horrific shower of steaming liquid.

Abruptly, without any warning, he loses all sense of balance and falls flat on his face, the skin on his back painfully burnt away, with steam wafting ominously around his tragically exposed organs. Later on, in the storeroom, Percy lies still under a somber, white sheet, while Bob sorrowfully leans against the shrouded body, his face etched with a wretched, sorrow-filled expression. Jeep stands solemnly in the doorway, observing as Bob's face twitches with barely contained emotion.\n\nIn the diner, Sandra finds herself securely bound to a chair, her wrists tied tightly behind her back, restraining her movements. Bright shafts of light pour insistently through the narrow gaps between planks that are crudely nailed across the window.

However, Sandra responds not with any visible gratitude but with narrowed eyes, fixing Audrey with a cold, bitterly intense stare. Kyle enters the room, causing a visibly shaken Audrey to rise and follow him out without delay.\n\nMeanwhile, Charlie sits quietly, lost in contemplation, as Audrey persistently fiddles with the radio, turning the dial this way and that, adjusting the aerial as part of her efforts to tune in. Michael, watching attentively, shakes his head gently, prompting Charlie to glance down at her own growing, pregnant belly. Standing alone in the bathroom, Charlie lights a cigarette, takes a contemplative puff, and gazes at her pretty face reflected in the mirror, illuminated softly by the warm glow of a lantern and a couple of flickering candles, her expression fraught with worry. She gently runs her thumb over the gentle curve of her pregnant belly, then, with a sudden, sharp movement, throws down the cigarette, stamps it out decisively, grabs her jacket with determination, and exits. She finds a quiet corner in the kitchen, sitting alone with her feet propped up on a chair for comfort. Looking up, she smiles warmly at Jeep before deliberately lowering her feet to the floor."

She approaches this door cautiously, places her hand on it, and pushes it open to reveal an office where shafts of bright sunlight pour through a small window above the desk, casting her face in a warm, golden glow. Sandra positions a chair against the wall, climbs onto it, and peers out the window, catching sight of Howard, who is bound to an inverted cross with his skin erupting in enormous, pulsing blisters. As she observes the painful throbbing of the blisters on Howard's arms and chest, Sandra climbs down from the chair. Suddenly, Kyle bursts into the room and wraps his arms around her waist, but Sandra quickly reacts, jabbing her elbow into him to break free. Meanwhile, Audrey, awakened by the commotion, rushes to the office and finds Sandra laboriously moving the desk away from the door before shoving Audrey aside and bolting outside. Once outside, Percy seizes Sandra by the waist in an attempt to divert her attention just as Howard's stomach bursts in a violent eruption of steaming liquid. Percy drags Sandra back into the office, where she collapses onto the floor. Charlie fixes her gaze on Percy, who leans motionless in the doorway with a distant stare, only to eventually topple forward onto his face. His back is severely burnt, with steam rising from his exposed organs. Later, in the storeroom, Percy lies under a white sheet, his lifeless form leaning against Bob, who rests with a sorrowful expression while Jeep stands silently in the doorway, watching Bob’s face twitch with emotion. In the diner, Sandra is seated, restrained on a chair with her wrists securely tied behind her back, as beams of light filter through the slats of planks nailed across the window. Audrey kneels in front of Sandra, retrieves a pill from a container, and Sandra, her eyes filled with tears, gives a slight nod. Audrey places the pill in Sandra's mouth, offers her a sip from a straw, and attempts a reassuring smile, but Sandra meets her with a cold, bitter glare. Kyle enters the room, causing Audrey, visibly shaken, to rise and follow his lead. Meanwhile, Charlie sits, deep in thought, as Audrey works to tune the radio, fiddling with the dial and adjusting the aerial in search of a signal. Michael observes and shakes his head in disapproval, prompting Charlie to lower her gaze to her pregnant belly. In the bathroom, Charlie lights a cigarette, takes a drag, and gazes at her reflection in the mirror lit by a lantern and a couple of candles, her expression troubled. She gently caresses her pregnant belly with her thumb, then abruptly discards the cigarette, extinguishes it with a firm stomp, retrieves her jacket, exits the room, and heads to the kitchen, where she sits alone with her feet propped up. She eventually looks up, a smile forming as she notices Jeep entering, prompting her to remove her feet from the chair."

This corridor, often used for staff breaks, is seldom traversed by patrons. She steps towards the door, pushes it wide open, and enters the office, where shafts of bright sunlight stream through the small window above the desk, bathing her face in golden light from the late afternoon sun. Sandra moves a chair to the wall, stands on it, and looks out the window to see Howard bound to an inverted cross, a disturbing sight often associated with certain horror rituals, with enormous blisters bubbling on his skin from what seems to be intense exposure to heat or chemicals. As the blisters on Howard's exposed arms and chest throb, suggesting immense pain, Sandra climbs down off the chair, and Kyle, known for his quick reactions and protective nature, runs in and grabs her around the waist, but she elbows him aside. Audrey wakes up from a fitful sleep, haunted by nightmares, and runs to the office where Sandra is heaving the desk away from the door that creaks under the strain, then pushes Audrey away and runs outside. Percy, a strong and steady figure in the group, grabs Sandra around the waist to turn her away as Howard's stomach explodes in a shower of steaming liquid, a terrifying and surreal occurrence. Percy heaves Sandra back into the office, where she flops helplessly on the floor. Charlie stares at Percy, leaning in the doorway of the old building, as he stares blankly into space, then falls flat on his face. His back is burnt off, steam wafts around his exposed organs, indicating severe trauma, and later, in the storeroom often used for extra supplies, Percy lies under a white sheet while Bob, characterized by his taciturn demeanor, leans on the covered corpse with a wretched expression, and Jeep, a regular in the diner with an inquisitive nature, stands in the doorway as Bob's face twitches with emotion. In the diner, Sandra, now bound to a chair with wrists tied behind her back, sits as bright shafts of light stream through gaps between planks nailed against the window, remnants of a hasty attempt to fortify the building. Kneeling in front of Sandra, Audrey takes a pill from a pot, a makeshift remedy for stress or pain, as Sandra, with tears on her face, nods in reluctant acceptance. Audrey pops the pill in her mouth, offers Sandra a drink through a straw, and smiles, but Sandra narrows her eyes and fixes Audrey with a cold, bitter stare, a look of betrayal. Kyle walks in, prompting a shaken Audrey to get up and follow Kyle, whose leadership and calming presence are needed. Meanwhile, Charlie sits looking pensive as Audrey tries to tune the radio, an old device that crackles with static, turning the dial and moving the aerial around to catch any signal. Michael shakes his head, a gesture of disagreement or disbelief, and Charlie looks down at her belly, contemplating the future. Standing in the bathroom, Charlie lights a cigarette, an act of rebellion against her better judgment, has a puff, regards her pretty face in the mirror by the light of a lantern and a couple of candles, with an expression fraught with worry. She gently runs her thumb over her pregnant belly, then throws down the cigarette sharply, stamps on it, grabs her jacket, walks out with a determined air, and sits alone in the kitchen with her feet up on the chair, a habit from her youth. She looks up and smiles at Jeep, a moment of shared warmth, before taking her feet off the chair."

He strides towards the window, swings it wide open, and enters the library, where beams of dim moonlight filter through the large mirror above the bookshelf, bathing his hands in silver glow. Roland moves a ladder to the wardrobe, climbs on it, and peers out the chandelier to see Albert tied to a towering statue, with tiny feathers fluttering on his cloak. As the feathers on Albert's uncovered legs and torso shiver, Roland climbs down off the ladder, and Ethan strolls in and hugs him around the shoulders, but he nudges him away. Clara dozes off and saunters to the library where Roland is dragging the bookshelf away from the window, then nudges Clara away and strolls indoors. Sophie clutches Roland around the shoulders to turn him aside as Albert's cloak bursts in a flurry of drifting petals. Sophie drags Roland back into the library, where he collapses on the carpet. Nicholas gazes at Sophie, crouching in the wardrobe, as she stares curiously into space, then collapses flat on her nose. Her forearms are sliced off, smoke swirls around her exposed bones, and later, in the courtyard, Sophie lies underneath a navy quilt while Jason leans on the hidden coffin with a joyous expression, and Truck rolls in the elevator as Jason's hands flicker. In the cabin, Roland, now tied to a sofa with ankles bound behind his legs, reclines as dull beams of moonlight filter through holes between curtains draped against the ceiling. Bowing in front of Roland, Clara takes a book from a shelf as Roland, with smiles on his hands, nods. Clara slides the book in her bag, hands Roland a snack through a napkin, and grins, but Roland widens his mouth and fixes Clara with a warm, joyful gaze. Ethan strolls in, prompting a confident Clara to rise and trail Ethan. Meanwhile, Nicholas reclines appearing thoughtful as Clara tries to shake the clock, rotating the knob and shifting the switch around. David shrugs, and Nicholas glances down at her wrist. Sitting in the office, Nicholas ignites a candle, inhales once, regards her lovely hands in the painting by the glow of a flashlight and a couple of torches, with an expression serene. She softly runs her finger over her silver wristwatch, then tosses down the candle quickly, crushes it, grabs her coat, strolls outside, and perches alone in the corridor with her elbows up. She gazes down and grins at Truck before lowering her elbows from the table."

She meanders towards the curtain, swings it fully open, and strolls into the library, where beams of soft moonlight filter through the narrow window above the bookcase, illuminating her face in silver light. Geraldine slides a ladder to the bookshelf, climbs it, and peers out the window to see Edward tethered to a tilted pole, with large scales surfacing on his skin. As the scales on Edward's uncovered arms and torso pulsate, Geraldine descends from the ladder, and Marcus dashes in and taps her on the shoulder, but she sidesteps him. Leonie dozes off and dashes to the library where Geraldine is shoving the bookshelf away from the window, then nudges Leonie aside and rushes out. Winston taps Geraldine on the shoulder to spin her around as Edward's back bursts in a shower of sparkling fragments. Winston pushes Geraldine back into the library, where she sprawls on the rug. Olivia observes Winston, leaning on the windowsill, as he gazes vacantly into space, then collapses flat on his belly. His front is torn off, mist swirls around his visible bones, and later, in the supply room, Winston rests under a green blanket while James leans on the draped figure with a gloomy look, and Ranger stands in the doorway as James's mouth quivers. In the bistro, Geraldine, now tethered to a stool with ankles tied together, sits as faint beams of light filter through crevices between boards nailed over the window. Sitting in front of Geraldine, Leonie takes a capsule from a jar as Geraldine, with tears on her face, nods. Leonie places the capsule in her mouth, offers Geraldine a sip through a straw, and grins, but Geraldine narrows her eyes and fixes Leonie with a cold, harsh gaze. Marcus steps in, prompting a startled Leonie to leave and trail Marcus. Meanwhile, Olivia lounges looking contemplative as Leonie attempts to adjust the television, twisting the knob and repositioning the antenna. Thomas shakes his head, and Olivia gazes down at her notebook. Standing in the hallway, Olivia flicks a match, takes a drag, studies her reflection in the mirror by the glow of a flashlight and a pair of candles, with an expression tense. She gently strokes her thumb over her open notebook, then flings the match angrily, stomps on it, grabs her scarf, exits, and sits alone in the office with her feet up. She glances up and beams at Ranger before placing her feet on the floor."

She strides towards the curtain, pulls it closed, and enters the library, where beams of soft moonlight filter through the tiny vent above the bookshelf, illuminating her face in silvery hues. Sandra drags a stool to the shelf, climbs on it, and peers out the vent to see Howard strapped to an upright tree, with massive bubbles shimmering on his skin. As the bubbles on Howard's concealed arms and torso pulsate, Sandra hops off the stool, and Kyle bursts in and taps her on the shoulder, but she nudges him away. Audrey dozes off and scurries to the library where Sandra is hoisting the bookshelf against the curtain, then shoves Audrey aside and dashes indoors. Percy clasps Sandra by the shoulder to steer her forward as Howard's chest erupts in a spray of fragrant mist. Percy tugs Sandra forward into the library, where she collapses on the rug. Charlie gawks at Percy, perched in the porch, as he gazes blankly at the ceiling, then topples backward onto his back. His shirt is torn apart, mist drifts over his revealed bones, and later, in the pantry, Percy slumps under a blue blanket while Bob rests on the covered figure with an elated expression, and Jeep lounges in the porch as Bob's hand twitches. In the gazebo, Sandra, now tied to a bench with ankles bound together, rests as gentle beams of light filter through slits between curtains hung against the wall. Crouching before Sandra, Audrey picks a stone from a jar as Sandra, with a smile on her face, nods. Audrey places the stone in her palm, offers Sandra a snack with a fork, and grins, but Sandra narrows her eyes and fixes Audrey with a warm, grateful look. Kyle strolls in, prompting a startled Audrey to stand up and trail Kyle. Meanwhile, Charlie lounges looking contemplative as Audrey attempts to fix the television, pressing the buttons and adjusting the antenna. Michael shakes his head, and Charlie looks down at her shoes. Standing in the parlor, Charlie turns on a lamp, takes a sip, admires her plain face in the window by the glow of a chandelier and a cluster of lamps, with a look of peace. She gently runs her thumb over her flat stomach, then tosses aside the lamp abruptly, steps on it, grabs her scarf, strides out, and sits together in the den with her book open. She looks down and laughs at Jeep before placing her book on the table."

He tiptoes towards the curtain, yanks it wide open, and enters the library, where echoes of distant laughter bounce through the narrow archway above the shelf, enveloping his ears in silver whispers. Marlon drags a ladder to the hedge, climbs on it, and peers over the hedge to see Felix tethered to a whirling carousel, with tiny feathers sprouting on his skin. As the feathers on Felix's bare legs and torso flutter, Marlon descends from the ladder, and Lucy dashes in and clutches him around the ankle, but he nudges her aside. Melanie dozes off and dashes to the library where Marlon is dragging the sofa away from the curtain, then nudges Melanie aside and sprints inside. Jasper clutches Marlon around the ankle to redirect him as Felix's shoulder bursts in a cascade of icy sparkles. Jasper drags Marlon back into the library, where he collapses on the rug. Edgar gawks at Jasper, lounging in the archway, as he gazes blankly at the ceiling, then collapses flat on his side. His chest is peeled away, mist swirls around his visible bones, and later, in the basement, Jasper rests under a patterned quilt while Luna leans on the veiled figure with a somber look, and Scooter hovers in the archway as Luna's gaze twitches. In the parlor, Marlon, now perched on a stool with feet tied behind his back, lingers as dim beams of light filter through slats dangling from the ceiling. Kneeling before Marlon, Melanie extracts a coin from a jar as Marlon, with raindrops on his forehead, nods. Melanie slips the coin on her tongue, offers Marlon a biscuit from a plate, and chuckles, but Marlon frowns and anchors Melanie with a hot, sour gaze. Lucy strolls in, causing a startled Melanie to arise and trail Lucy. Meanwhile, Edgar reclines appearing thoughtful as Melanie attempts to set the clock, twisting the knob and waving the pendulum around. Henry shakes his elbow, and Edgar glances at her knee. Standing in the pantry, Edgar ignites a match, takes a whiff, studies her muddy boots in the reflection by the glow of an oil lamp and a pair of lanterns, with an expression anxious. She softly strokes her cheek over her swollen knee, then flicks the match abruptly, squashes it, grabs her backpack, ambles out, and sits solo in the attic with her arms crossed. She glances up and grins at Scooter before slipping her arms off the perch."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
