Everett, unsure of Pappy’s intentions, pauses with a slight hesitation, his uncertainty etched on his face. Meanwhile, the band members, exuding a sense of joy, beam at the scene, while Delmar, feeling uneasy, leans towards Everett, his brow furrowed with concern. In an attempt to communicate his feelings, Delmar locks eyes with Everett and gives him a look filled with meaning and urgency, prompting Everett to take a moment to contemplate the silent message. Pappy observes the exchange and delivers his own thoughtful appraisal, assessing the situation. As the scene shifts to the steps of the meeting hall, people begin to pour out from the concert, their chatter mingling with the backdrop of the warm summer night. Everett, now clean-shaven, walks down the steps alongside Penny, a sense of anticipation in his stride. He gently raises her left hand with his own, intending to proudly display their wedding bands. Yet, as he gazes at her finger, he realizes it's bare, causing Penny to turn and walk away, leaving Everett momentarily distracted. His attention, along with that of the surrounding crowd, is quickly diverted to a street procession. A group of people, holding torches aloft, jog energetically behind a man shackled in clanking leg irons and wrist manacles, watched over by a quartet of policemen poised with nightsticks, ready for any disturbance. As the Soggy Bottom Boys, including Everett, descend the steps to approach the incoming figure, Delmar lets out a sudden cry, his voice filled with recognition. It is George Nelson, who, despite the weight of his heavy restraints, flashes a grin as he strides forward, turning as he passes to send a call back over his shoulder, his voice spirited. Delmar, a smile spreading across his face, shakes his head as he watches George go, a mixture of amusement and incredulity in his expression. In the enveloping darkness, a sound begins to grow—snuffling, initially faint but growing louder and more pronounced. Within a cupboard, a snout pushes against the door, slowly nosing it open. As the door swings wide, the light catches and reveals several neatly stacked tins of Dapper Dan pomade, sitting next to a cluster of tangled hairnets, a curious arrangement that hints at the chaos of the occupants. Meanwhile, Everett, Pete, Delmar, and Tommy navigate through the woods and emerge into a clearing where a cabin stands alone. Two goons, armed with shotguns, suddenly appear behind them, prodding them forward with an air of authority. As they approach the cabin, their gaze falls upon three freshly dug graves, each lined with rough pine coffins positioned at the far edge. The sheriff, Cooley, adorned with mirrored sunglasses, steps down from the porch, a drooling hound obediently trailing at his heels. The goons renew their efforts, shoving the group toward the oak tree, while three shirtless black gravediggers donning bandannas around their necks rise from the graves and look toward Cooley, awaiting his instructions, mirrored by the expectant hound. As the goons' expressions shift to leering grins, they continue their task with renewed vigor, while the gravediggers, taking up their positions next to the graves, lean on their shovels, the sweat on their faces glistening like tears under the sun’s harsh glare. Cooley, his demeanor enigmatic, allows a faint smile to cross his lips. In response, Delmar lowers his head, engaging in a silent prayer, an act soon mirrored by Everett. The air fills with the mournful swell of the gravediggers' singing, a song that seems to rise from the very earth, underpinned by a deep, resonant bass that echoes across the clearing."

Bobby returns an attentive scrutiny. On the balcony of the movie house, characters pour out of the theater into the cool autumn evening. Marvin, now rid of his hat, is skipping down the balcony with Ruby and waves her right hand with his own to showcase their friendship bracelets, but her wrist is empty, and she skips away. His focus, along with everyone else's, is attracted to a sidewalk parade where a group carrying lanterns skips behind a dog in jangling chains and leg cuffs flanked by four guards with flashlights in party-ready formation. Marvin and the Soggy Bottom Pals skip down the balcony to greet the approaching trickster, and Lester laughs out. It is Charlie Nelson, chuckling despite his heavy burdens, and as he passes, he twists to shout back over his elbow. Lester, grinning, wags his head as he watches him disappear. In the darkness, we hear rustling getting softer and farther. Inside a pantry, a whisker pushes the door shut. As the door swings closed, light fades from several loosely stacked tins of Dapper Dan pomade next to a heap of tangled wires. Marvin, Carl, Lester, and Billy walk through the meadow and step into a clearing where a hut stretches before them. Two knife-wielding thugs slip in behind them and pull them backward, exposing next to a pine tree three freshly filled pits with rough stone markers at the near edge of each pit. The deputy with glossy goggles, Charlie, strolls onto the lawn with a barking cat at his side. The thugs drag them toward the tree, and three coatless pale gardeners with ribbons around their wrists rise from the pits and turn to Charlie for direction, as does the barking cat. The thugs recover their sneering cackles and continue their task while the gardeners stand next to the pits, leaning on their rakes, with sweat shimmering on their necks like jewels. Charlie gives a subtle nod, and Lester lifts his chin to quietly cheer, followed by Marvin. The chanting of the gardeners begins a sorrowful rise, and the tune, seemingly drifting from the sky itself, is supported by a tangible treble."

The ruffians regain their smirking grins and continue their duty while the laborers stand beside the pits, resting on their spades, with dew glimmering on their brows like rain.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
