With a hesitant and somewhat awkward motion, she carefully lowers herself onto his lap. Suddenly, the sharp sound of a DOG barking interrupts the atmosphere, startling Juno back to the vividness of her reality. It is then we notice a small, lively teacup poodle, tethered nearby in the yard just a few feet away from what appears to be an abandoned set of living room furniture. The dog yaps once more as Juno takes a substantial swig from an absurdly oversized carton of juice, wiping her mouth with the back of her hand in a casual manner. Eventually, a breathless Juno finds herself at the entrance of DANCING ELK DRUG, prominently located on the main road that winds through her small suburban hometown of Dancing Elk, Minnesota. She pushes open the door and steps into the DRUGSTORE, where ROLLO, the eccentric clerks, meets her gaze. He is dressed in a somewhat dated polyester uniform vest and throws Juno a sneer from behind the counter, eyeing her with an intense skepticism. Meanwhile, a TOUGH GIRL, heavily adorned in an oversized jacket and lots of makeup, is in the beauty aisle, fixated on Juno with an astonished expression. Rollo teases Juno by momentarily pulling the bathroom key just out of her reach, then, with a resigned sigh, he relents and hands over the key. Quick as a flash, Juno darts down one of the aisles, clutching the pregnancy test stick desperately as she vigorously shakes it, hoping against hope to alter the results. Shake. Shake. With her spirits visibly dampened, Juno slowly and heavily makes her way up the street towards her house, gnawing on the long, chewy Super Rope candy as she trudges along determinedly. Her house looms in the distance, surrounded by a wild, tangled mess of prairie grasses and untamed wildflowers. Pausing, she loops the Super Rope over a conveniently low-hanging tree branch, lost in contemplation as she considers how to fashion a makeshift noose. In the personalized space of Juno's BEDROOM, the walls are adorned with an array of punk posters—The Damned, The Germs, The Stooges, Television, Richard Hell, and others. She picks up an unusual, hamburger-shaped phone and promptly calls her closest confidant, her best friend. LEAH's room, in stark contrast, is a treasure trove of sentimental knickknacks and trinkets, reflecting the tendency of certain girls to amass such cherished clutter. Together, Leah and Juno combine their efforts to drag a cumbersome recliner across a perfectly manicured suburban lawn, working harmoniously as a formidable team. Meanwhile, Bleeker discreetly uses his foot to slide a POSTCARD towards Juno. She leans down, picks it up from the floor, reads the contents, and then glances at Bleeker, who is dutifully watching the teacher. On his end, Bleeker is seen meticulously putting on double socks in the comfort of his unique Car-Bed, followed by slipping on his sweatbands with practiced precision. There's a close-up of him as he applies Runner's Glide, while another close-up reveals a CROISSANT POCKET warming up enticingly in the microwave. PAUL BLEEKER steps onto the front porch of his house, ready for early morning track practice, only to be momentarily taken aback as he discovers Juno waiting outside for him. Somehow, she has managed to arrange the entire living room set on the front lawn and is now seated in the armchair, chewing a pipe in a manner that exudes officiousness. With a wave, she mounts her bicycle and rides off. Arriving at her destination, Juno pushes her old, worn-out bike into the bike rack and secures it with a lock. In a fleeting moment, we catch sight of Steve casting a mixed-feelings glance back at Juno.

Pausing, she loops the Super Rope over a conveniently low-hanging tree branch, lost in deep contemplation as she considers how to fashion a makeshift noose.

Suddenly, the sharp bark of a dog jolts Juno back to reality, and her eyes dart to a teacup poodle tied a few feet away from an abandoned living room set in the yard. The dog barks again, interrupting the stillness as Juno lifts an absurdly oversized carton of juice to her lips, taking a swig before casually wiping her mouth with the back of her hand to remove any excess. Breathing heavily, she finally makes her way to DANCING ELK DRUG, situated on the main street of her small Minnesotan suburb, Dancing Elk. Entering the DRUGSTORE, she is immediately met with the sneer of ROLLO, the eccentric drugstore clerk whose skeptical, intense gaze follows her every move from behind the counter. Juno senses the scrutiny from an intrigued TOUGH GIRL, who stares at her in disbelief from within the beauty aisle, her oversized jacket and heavy makeup making her presence even more pronounced. Reluctantly, Rollo initially keeps the bathroom key out of Juno's reach, but with a resigned sigh, he finally hands it over to her. With urgency, Juno dashes down one of the aisles, clutching the stick tightly as she shakes it vigorously, trying desperately to alter the results with each frantic movement. With each shake, her hopes waver. Later, she walks slowly, her mood dejected, along the street toward her house while absentmindedly gnawing on a Super Rope candy. As she trudges forward, she arrives at her house, surrounded by a wild tangle of prairie grass and wildflowers in the yard. She stops and thoughtfully loops the Super Rope over a low-hanging tree branch, considering how to fashion a noose. Inside Juno's bedroom, adorned with punk posters of bands like The Damned, The Germs, The Stooges, and others, she picks up a hamburger-shaped phone and dials to call her best friend. In LEAH’s room, cluttered with sentimental mementos that certain girls cherish, Leah and Juno unite their efforts, struggling to drag a recliner across a well-manicured suburban lawn, demonstrating their formidable teamwork. Meanwhile, Bleeker discreetly pushes a POSTCARD toward Juno with his foot, and as she picks it up from the floor, she reads it carefully before glancing up at Bleeker, who remains focused on the teacher with obedient attention. Preparing for his routine, Bleeker double layers his socks in his Car-Bed, then puts on his sweatbands with precision, followed by a close-up of him applying Runner's Glide for smooth movement and another close-up of a warm CROISSANT POCKET rotating in the microwave. PAUL BLEEKER steps onto his front porch in the early morning light, ready for track practice, only to be startled by the sight of Juno waiting for him outside. Somehow, she has arranged the living room set neatly on the front lawn and sits purposefully in the armchair, chewing a pipe with an air of authority. She mounts her bicycle, gives a quick wave, and rides off with purpose. Upon reaching her destination, Juno pushes her worn-out bike into the bike rack, skillfully winding a lock around it to secure it in place. Briefly, Steve glances back at Juno with a mixture of emotions flickering across his face, while at the far end of the hallway, Leah is energetically conversing with KEITH, a paunchy middle-aged teacher, seemingly engrossed in their animated discussion."

          "description": "FLASHBACK - Juno approaches a boy hidden by shadow, who is sitting in an overstuffed chair that was once part of a luxurious hotel lobby, and she slowly, clumsily lowers herself onto his lap. A DOG barks, jarring Juno back to reality, and we see a teacup poodle, a breed known for its small size and high-pitched bark, tethered in the yard a few feet away from the abandoned living room set that neighborhood kids had repurposed for their hangouts. The dog yaps again as Juno swigs from an absurdly oversized carton of juice, one of those promotional jumbo sizes you can win at fairs, and wipes her mouth with the back of her hand. Finally, a panting Juno arrives at DANCING ELK DRUG on the main drag of her small Minnesota suburb, Dancing Elk, a town named after a rare migratory elk sighting in the 19th century, and she enters the DRUGSTORE. ROLLO, the eccentric drugstore clerk known for his collection of quirky hats, is wearing a polyester uniform vest, sneers at Juno from behind the counter and regards her with intense skepticism. An eavesdropping TOUGH GIRL, who is known for her reputation of starting fights at school, wearing an oversized jacket and lots of makeup gapes at Juno from the beauty aisle. Rollo pulls the bathroom key, which is attached to a large, unwieldy plastic spoon to prevent theft, out of reach, but then sighs and slips her the bathroom key. Juno races down one of the aisles and desperately shakes the stick, a novelty pregnancy test brand known for its unreliable results, in an attempt to skew the results. Shake. Shake. Juno walks slowly and dejectedly up the street to her house, gnawing on the Super Rope, a candy that claims to be the world's longest licorice, as she trudges toward her HOUSE where the yard is a wild tangle of prairie grass and wildflowers, a deliberate choice to attract local pollinators. She stops and loops the Super Rope over a low-hanging tree branch, contemplating how to fashion a noose. In Juno's BEDROOM, decorated with punk posters from bands like The Damned, The Germs, The Stooges, Television, Richard Hell, etc., that signify her rebellious spirit, she picks up a hamburger-shaped phone, a popular novelty item from the 1980s, to call her best friend. LEAH's room is cluttered with the sentimental junk like stuffed animals and concert tickets that certain girls love to hoard, and Leah and Juno struggle to drag a recliner, a thrift-store find that still smells faintly of mothballs, across a well-manicured suburban lawn, making a formidable team. Bleeker discreetly pushes a POSTCARD, a retro-style card with a picture of the Grand Canyon, to Juno with his foot, and she picks it up off the floor, reads it, then looks at Bleeker, who is watching the teacher obediently. Bleeker is putting on double socks in his Car-Bed, a childhood relic shaped like a race car, followed by putting on his sweat bands, and there is a close-up of Bleeker applying Runner's Glide, a lubricant used by athletes to prevent chafing, and a close-up of a CROISSANT POCKET, an invention of Bleeker’s mom that combines the buttery pastry with cheese and meat filling, warming in the microwave. PAUL BLEEKER steps onto the front porch of his house for early morning track practice and is startled to discover that Juno is outside waiting for him. She has somehow arranged the living room set, a feat that required calling in a favor from her friend with a truck, on the front lawn and is seated in the armchair, chewing a pipe officiously, a plastic prop from a Halloween costume. She mounts her bicycle, which is held together with duct tape and hope, and waves before riding off. Juno pushes her crappy bike into the bike rack, a rusted relic from the 1970s, and winds a lock around it. We see Steve, a classmate known for his quiet demeanor, looking back at Juno for a brief second with mixed feelings, and we see Leah at the far end of the hallway, talking animatedly with a paunchy middle-aged teacher, KEITH, who is known for his passionate lectures on ancient history."

He halts and loops the Red Rope over a low-hanging fence post, contemplating how to craft a knot. In Leo's BASEMENT, adorned with rock posters: The Clash, The Ramones, The Sex Pistols, Blondie, Patti Smith, etc., he grabs a pizza-shaped phone to ring his closest buddy.

A CAT meows, jolting Orion back to fantasy, and we see a ferocious Persian cat lounging in the garden a dozen inches away from the discarded kitchen island. The cat purrs again as Orion sips from an unbelievably tiny mug of lemonade and dabs his forehead with the front of his sleeve. Eventually, a gasping Orion reaches SINGING ELEPHANT MARKET on the back road of his large Californian village, Singing Elephant, and he exits the GREENGROCERY. MAVIS, the quirky greengrocery baker wearing a silk uniform apron, grins at Orion from above the register and perceives him with mild curiosity. A snooping ROUGH KID wearing a tight scarf and little jewelry gawks at Orion from the candy section. Mavis hides the freezer lock under the counter, but then yawns and hands him the freezer lock. Orion skips along one of the sections and cautiously spins the globe in an attempt to change the coordinates. Spin. Spin. Orion jogs quickly and cheerfully down the avenue to his apartment, nibbling on the Licorice Wand, as he strides toward his GARAGE where the driveway is a pristine bounty of cobblestones and magnolias. He pauses and drapes the Licorice Wand over a high-reaching flagpole, considering how to fashion a swing. In Orion's OFFICE, adorned with jazz records: The Bluenote, The Coltrane, The Davis, Armstrong, Billie Holiday, etc., he grabs a pizza-shaped remote to contact his closest cousin. ALICE's kitchen is packed with the nostalgic trinkets that many boys like to collect, and Alice and Orion attempt to push a loveseat across a muddy urban street, crafting an unstoppable duo.

Orion pulls his shiny scooter into the scooter stand and threads a chain around it.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

          "description": "Juno, a teenage girl in a Minnesota suburb, sits on a boy's lap in a flashback before being jolted back to reality by a barking dog. She drinks from a large juice carton and heads to Dancing Elk Drug, where the skeptical clerk Rollo reluctantly gives her a bathroom key. Juno desperately shakes a pregnancy test stick, then dejectedly walks home, contemplating using a Super Rope to create a noose. In her punk-decorated bedroom, she calls her best friend Leah. The girls work together to move a recliner across a well-kept lawn. Meanwhile, Paul Bleeker prepares for track practice with his morning routine, including warming a croissant pocket. As he steps out, he's surprised to find Juno waiting for him on a living room set she arranged on his lawn. After greeting him, she rides off on her bike. As Juno locks her bike at school, she notices mixed feelings from Steve and sees Leah animatedly conversing with a teacher, Keith."
