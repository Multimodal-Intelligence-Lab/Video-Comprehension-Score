He extracts a fragment of gray fabric from which a firearm grip protrudes. He places the fabric on his periodical, unwraps the stubby, black handgun, gazes at it, re-wraps it, and returns it. Feeling beneath the denims once more, he extracts a battered dossier. He opens it and flips through aged periodical cuttings about American football. A snapshot of a young David in football attire peers out from another narrative. He turns over additional cuttings, duplicates of the initial narratives, sheets of sport outcomes, and more snapshots of football contests. The figures involved are obscured by their helmets and visage guards until he arrives at a photograph of an overturned automobile. He stares at it frowning.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

After inspecting it, he replaces the gun and removes a folder containing old American football clippings, including pictures of a young David in gear and an overturned car in a ditch. He frowns, then quickly hides the folder as Audrey appears outside. Her face crumbles, and she departs. At a large football stadium, David, on duty with a walkie-talkie, and Elijah, with a stick, monitor the crowd. A tall man in a camouflage jacket catches David's attention. Elijah, in a black coat and gloves, also looks back. David instructs security to frisk fans as the man leaves the queue. David exchanges glances and smiles with Elijah. Later, Elijah's glass walking stick is in his car as the man walks by. Elijah follows through shadows around the stadium but loses sight of him."
