Wick moves and sits next to Don, grasping the tumbler from his hand, and then leans over Don to loosen his necktie. Disregarding the echo of footfalls coming from the stairway, Wick stands, places the tumbler of bourbon on the table, and is about to move towards the telephone when the doorbell chimes in a sequence of brief, brief, extended, brief. Wick halts, and Don rises on the sofa, lifting himself up by gripping Wick's arm. Wick pushes Don through the doorway into the shadowy bedroom and shuts the door after him. Wick then switches on the living room lights, rolls the vacant bottle under the sofa, and conceals the tumbler of bourbon behind a stack of albums. As Wick proceeds towards the door, the bottle rolls out from under the sofa, so he halts to roll it back before going into the corridor to unlock the door. Helen enters, and as she talks, Wick attempts to approach the bottle without her observing. Suddenly, she observes Wick attempting to nudge the bottle back under the sofa. Wick then strolls over to the albums, picks up the tumbler, and listens with his head against the doorpost, troubled. Helen comes into the living room, and Wick takes a sip. Wick stands, stunned with the tumbler of bourbon in hand, as Don enters shakily. Almost at the door to the entryway, Helen turns back into the room, gazing at Don and beginning to comprehend that he's intoxicated. Don gazes at the tumbler in Wick's hand, takes it from him, opens a drawer, extracts two cartridges, and holds them in his palm. Helen looks at him for a moment, then removes and tosses her hat into a chair. Wick goes into the kitchenette, and Helen raises herself to her tiptoes to kiss him affectionately. Meanwhile, Nat and Don are alone, with Nat behind the bar inserting toothpicks into olives and arranging them on a dish. Don leaps up, rushes to the bookcase, and starts pulling out volumes row by row. He goes to the closet, opens it wide, and throws all its contents on the floor before returning to the large chair to collapse, fatigued. His eyes again fall on the vacant bottle and the vacant tumbler, noticing something inscribed on it distorted by the tumbler."

Paying no heed to the footsteps echoing from the staircase, Wick stands up once more, carefully places the glass of whiskey on the table, and is on the verge of heading towards the telephone when the distinct pattern of the doorbell rings out—a series of short, short, long, short chimes.

He leans in closer to Don, his hands deftly maneuvering to loosen Don's tie for him. All the while, the faint sound of footsteps descending the staircase is ignored by Wick as he stands up, carefully placing the glass filled with whiskey onto the table. Just as he begins to move towards the telephone, a ringing pattern composed of short, short, long, short from the doorbell halts him in his tracks. As Wick freezes momentarily, Don, stirred by the sound, sits upright on the couch and reaches out, anchoring himself by holding onto Wick's arm. Wick quickly reacts by guiding Don towards a nearby doorway, gently but firmly pushing him into the darkened bedroom and closing the door behind him. With Don safely hidden, Wick swiftly flicks on the living room lights, nudging an empty bottle to roll discreetly under the couch and stowing away the glass of whiskey behind a stack of records. As he makes his way towards the door, the bottle, which had not remained hidden, rolls back out into the open, prompting Wick to stop and roll it back under the couch once more. He then proceeds into the hall, opening the door to reveal Helen standing there. Simultaneously, while Helen begins to speak, Wick furtively tries to approach the bottle, hoping to keep it out of her line of sight. However, she notices his attempt to hide it as he subtly tries to kick the bottle back under the couch. Realizing he's been caught, Wick strides over to the records, retrieves the glass, and, feeling a wave of tension, presses his head against the doorpost to eavesdrop on the sounds beyond. Helen enters the living room, and Wick takes a swig from the glass. Suddenly, Wick stands, visibly startled with the glass still in hand, when Don reenters the room with an unsteady gait. Almost reaching the doorway of the entrance hall, Helen pauses, turns around, and her gaze falls on Don. Her eyes fixate on him as she gradually comprehends that he's inebriated. Don's attention shifts to the glass Wick is holding; he takes it, opens a nearby drawer, retrieves two bullets, and lets them rest in his palm. Helen stares at him for a brief moment before removing her hat and carelessly tossing it onto a chair. Meanwhile, Wick retreats into the kitchenette, where Helen rises onto her tiptoes to plant a warm kiss on him. In another part of the room, Nat and Don find themselves alone, with Nat behind the bar diligently skewering toothpicks into olives and arranging them neatly on a plate. Almost suddenly, Don springs to his feet, makes a beeline to the bookcase, and begins yanking out books row after row in a frenzy. He rushes to the closet, flinging its doors open wide and dumping all its contents onto the floor, before stumbling back to the large chair to collapse in utter exhaustion. As his eyes wander once more, they land on the empty bottle and glass, catching sight of something scribbled on it, a message obscured and distorted by the curvature of the glass."

Wick goes and sits beside Don, an old college friend known for his carefree spirit, taking the glass from his hand, and then bends over Don to loosen his tie, a habit Don developed working late hours at the law firm downtown. Ignoring the sound of steps coming from the staircase, likely the creaky old wooden stairs known to everyone in the building, Wick rises, places the glass of whiskey on the table, a rare single malt from Scotland, and is about to head towards the antique rotary telephone when the doorbell rings in a pattern of short, short, long, short, a Morse code used among friends. Wick freezes, and Don sits up on the couch, pulling himself up by clinging to Wick's arm, a gesture reminiscent of their college days. Wick pushes Don through the doorway into the dark bedroom and closes the door after him, wary of revealing Don's condition.\n\nWick then snaps on the living room lights, installed just last spring, rolls the empty bottle under the couch, a hand-me-down from his grandmother, and hides the glass of whiskey behind a pile of vintage jazz records. As Wick starts towards the door, the bottle rolls out from under the couch, so he stops to roll it back before going into the hall to open the door. Helen enters, Wick's sister who is visiting from out of town, and as she speaks, Wick tries to approach the bottle without her noticing. Suddenly, she sees Wick trying to kick the bottle back under the couch, a move that sparks her curiosity. Wick then walks over to the records, picks up the glass, and listens with his head against the doorpost, harassed by a sudden loud noise from outside. Helen comes into the living room, and Wick takes a drink, his nerves slightly calmed. Wick stands, startled with the glass of whiskey in hand, as Don enters unsteadily, his lawyer's briefcase left forgotten by the couch. Almost at the door to the entrance hall, Helen turns back into the room, staring at Don and beginning to realize that he's drunk, her expression shifting from surprise to concern.\n\nDon looks at the glass in Wick's hand, takes it from him, opens a drawer in the antique oak desk, removes two bullets, a stark reminder of his days in the military, and holds them in his palm. Helen looks at him for a second, then removes and tosses her hat, a stylish cloche, into a chair. Wick goes into the kitchenette, a modest space with chipped tiles, and Helen raises herself to her tiptoes to kiss him warmly, a gesture filled with familial love. Meanwhile, Nat and Don are alone, with Nat behind the bar putting toothpicks into olives and arranging them on a plate, a routine from his bartending days during college. Don jumps up, runs to the bookcase, a wall-to-wall structure filled with classic novels, and starts pulling out books row by row, driven by a sudden inexplicable urge. He goes to the closet, opens it wide, and throws all its contents, mostly winter coats and old tennis rackets, on the floor before returning to the big chair to collapse, exhausted. His eyes again fall on the empty bottle and the empty glass, noticing something written on it distorted by the glass, perhaps a clue to his earlier frantic search."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
