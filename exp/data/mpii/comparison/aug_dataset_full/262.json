Hi is departing the frame again, continuing to speak as we hear him rifling offscreen, then he reenters the frame with two pistols wedged in his belt and wielding his pump-action shotgun, priming it with a WHOOSH-CLACK. From the front bumper of a car, lovely wilderness extends to the horizon as the road sweeps beneath the camera. Gale operates, peering out at the road while Evelle cradles Nathan Jr., occasionally jouncing him contemplatively. Evelle is peering down at the infant, adjusting him in his lap as Gale glances over and Evelle, grinning, gazes up from the infant to Gale. A box of diapers is placed down on the check-out counter, where Evelle and the Cashier, a late-middle-aged gentleman, perhaps the owner of the small mom-and-pop shop, confront each other. Evelle has various baby items, including diapers and infant food, stacked on the counter that the Cashier is ringing up. Through the open door beyond them, a strip of the parking lot is visible. Up over his head, Evelle takes a plastic-wrapped water gun off a display rack and drops it on the counter while looking around at other impulse items displayed by the register; he unhooks a bag of balloons and is extracting a gun out of his belt as the Cashier is already down on the floor, out of frame. With his hands free now, Gale reaches for the back door while Evelle sorts through his items. Gale is looking around, baffled, and the two men gaze at each other before their heads whip around to look in the rear seat, then they look at each other in terror as their eyes widen, recalling simultaneously, and both gaze up at the roof of the car. Lifting off the accelerator and yelling as he observes the foot, Gale, overcome, speaks in a low unsteady voice. Ed is driving, and both are staring silently ahead at the road as Hi glances over at Ed, melancholy but attempting to be amiable, nodding to himself, which quiets Hi down. After a moment, Hi clears his throat.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
