The cable falls free, and he crosses, still on his knees, to the girl, and repeats the operation, glancing over his shoulder to the open door behind him. He silences the pair, hand out, palm down.

He stands in the portal of a washroom, where a lad and lass, not quite adolescents, are seated on the ground facing one another, their wrists bound above their heads. He bends beside the lad, tugging the synthetic cord binding his wrists to a towel rail, light shimmering on his nuptial band. The cord falls loose, and he traverses, still on his knees, to the lass, and repeats the procedure, peering over his shoulder to the open entrance behind him. He quiets the duo, hand out, palm downward. In another larger sleeping area, plain white linen drapes flutter at the open casement, offering glimpses of a duo of bare limbs outstretched on the carpet. The drapes flutter further apart, unveiling a woman in a robe, seated on the ground, and reclining against an antiquated black heater. Her knees are drawn upward. The robe has slipped partway up her legs. Her wrists are bound above her head and tethered to the heater. Her head lulls to one side. From the opposite side of the chamber, David gazes downward at her and places a finger to his lips. He traverses to the full-length casement and parts the drapes. After a moment, he steps through the drapes onto a terrace and strides to the border, raindrops shimmering on his rain cloak. He reclines on the rail and peers over. The custodian in orange propels himself at David from within the sleeping area. David is propelled over the terrace. He lands on his visage in liquid. He elevates his head. The black glossy surface upon which he's reclining begins to crinkle and sag. Liquid forms an ever-larger pool around him. He observes the rain splashing in the liquid before him as he gradually begins to submerge. To his left, he notices a crumpled ridge of synthetic sheeting begin to fold in on itself. More ridges ahead and to his right do likewise. Behind him, as the sheeting slips inward, he notices a glimmering white surface below it. From above, the black synthetic swimming pool cover encircles him, ensnares him, and descends into the shadowy liquid. Beneath the surface, darkness yields to illumination from above, seen through a mist of bubbles, before the darkness encloses him anew. His hands flail in the bubbles reaching for the illumination. High above the liquid, a blurred figure in orange turns away from the terrace. Darkness and light alternate beneath the liquid as David struggles to liberate himself from the clasp of the black cover. Through the bubbles, a rod appears, protruding downward from a blurred silhouette at the poolside."

He is currently positioned at the threshold of a bathroom, where a young boy and girl, who have not yet reached their teenage years, are seated on the floor facing one another. Their wrists are securely bound above their heads. With a determined air, he kneels beside the boy, attentively working to release the plastic cable fastening his wrists to a towel rail, the light briefly catching on the gleam of his wedding ring. Once the cable is loosened and falls away, he moves, maintaining his position on his knees, across to the girl. He methodically repeats the same procedure for her, occasionally casting a cautious glance over his shoulder toward the open door that lies behind him. He gestures for silence, extending his hand outward with his palm facing downward in a calming gesture. \n\nIn another part of the house, within a larger bedroom draped with plain white linen curtains that flutter gently at the open window, glimpses of two bare legs can be seen, stretched out languidly on the carpet. As the curtains sway further apart with each movement, they reveal a woman clad in a dressing gown, seated on the floor and leaning wearily against an antiquated black radiator. Her knees are drawn up, and the gown has slipped partially up her legs, exposing them. Her wrists are bound above her head, securely tied to the radiator, while her head lolls to one side in a semi-conscious manner. Observing her from another side of the room, David looks down at her, placing a finger to his lips in a silent gesture of caution. He then crosses the room to approach the full-length window, drawing the curtains apart. After a brief pause, he steps through the parted curtains onto the balcony outside and proceeds to the edge, where raindrops glisten on his rain cape, adding a sparkling sheen. Leaning on the rail, he peers over the edge.\n\nSuddenly, the maintenance man donned in bright orange launches a surprise attack, propelling himself towards David from within the bedroom. This unexpected force sends David hurtling over the edge of the balcony. He lands harshly, face first, into the water below. Raising his head with effort, he notices that the black, shiny surface beneath him is beginning to crumple and sag. An ever-expanding pool of water forms around him as he lies there. He watches with apprehension as the rain continues to splash into the water in front of him, a prelude to his slow descent. Off to his left, he observes a crumpled ridge of plastic sheeting begin to fold inwards upon itself. The ridges ahead and to his right start to follow suit, creating an uncertain terrain. Behind him, as the sheeting slips progressively inward, a starkly contrasting glistening white surface becomes visible beneath it. From a vantage point above, the black plastic covering of the swimming pool begins to envelop him, wrapping him tightly, and pulling him further into the dark, foreboding water below. \n\nBeneath the surface, the overwhelming blackness is periodically interrupted by light filtering from above, seen through a haze of rising bubbles, before the darkness reclaims its dominance. Desperately, his hands thrash about in the midst of the bubbles, reaching out fervently toward the distant light. Far above the surface of the water, a blurred shape clad in orange turns away from the edge of the balcony, retreating from the scene. Under the water, David experiences alternating flashes of darkness and light as he fervently struggles to liberate himself from the constricting embrace of the black pool cover.

          "description": "He gazes across the room, his eyes tracing the line of sight past the bed to a second doorway. He takes a step into the bathroom's doorway, where his attention fixes on a boy and girl seated on the floor facing each other, their youthful forms restrained by their wrists bound and suspended above them. He moves with intention, lowering himself beside the boy, reaching out to grasp the plastic cable securing the boy’s wrists to the towel rail. In the gentle illumination, light catches and reflects off his wedding ring. As he tugs with precision, the cable releases, falling away with a soft snap, freeing the boy. Staying low to the ground, he maneuvers on his knees across the floor to where the girl sits, repeating the procedure with a focused glance cast over his shoulder towards the open door behind him, ensuring their safety. With both children's wrists liberated, he signals for silence, extending his hand with his palm facing downward to communicate stillness and quiet. In a different, larger bedroom, the plain white linen curtains dance in the breeze at the open window, parting just enough to offer glimpses of a pair of bare legs stretched out on the carpet. As the curtains become more agitated, they reveal a woman clad in a dressing gown, seated on the floor with her back resting against an antiquated black radiator. Her position is one of vulnerability, with knees drawn up and the gown having slipped partway up her legs. Her wrists are similarly restrained above her head, tied securely to the radiator, and her head slumps lethargically to one side. Observing her from the room's opposite side, David regards her with a silent gesture, placing a finger to his lips to convey the need for quiet. He strides over to the full-length window, carefully parting the curtains, and after a moment of consideration, steps through them onto the balcony. There, he walks purposefully to the edge, where raindrops gleam upon his rain cape like tiny jewels. Leaning slightly on the balcony rail, he gazes downward. Unexpectedly, the maintenance man in orange charges at David from the safety of the bedroom's interior. The collision is forceful, sending David tumbling over the balcony's edge. He crashes face-first into a pool of water, lifting his head in a daze as the black, glossy surface beneath him begins to buckle and sag ominously. The water encircles him, forming an ever-expanding pool, as he watches the rain impact the water directly before him, creating ripples that mirror his growing predicament. To his left, he observes a crumpled ridge of plastic sheeting beginning to collapse inward, a cascade effect as more ridges around him do the same. Behind him, as the sheeting succumbs to the pressure, it reveals beneath it a glistening white surface. From a higher vantage point, the black plastic cover of the swimming pool envelops him, drawing him into its depths as it submerges into the dark water. Submerged, the enveloping darkness intermittently yields to light filtering from above, seen through a blur of bubbles, before the shadows close in once more. Desperately, his hands thrash within the bubbles, reaching with increasing urgency for the elusive light. Far above, a vaguely discernible shape clad in orange turns its back to the balcony, indifferent to his plight. Beneath the surface, the dance of darkness and light continues as David struggles valiantly to extricate himself from the constricting embrace of the black cover. Amidst the swirling bubbles, a pole materializes, reaching downwards from a blurred figure standing at the edge of the pool."

He stands in the doorway of a bathroom, where a boy and girl, not quite teenagers, are sitting on the floor facing each other, their wrists tied above their heads in a manner reminiscent of an old hostage scene. He kneels beside the boy, pulling the plastic cable tying his wrists to a towel rail, light glinting on his wedding ring, which has been on his finger since the day of his quiet summer wedding. The cable falls free, and he crosses, still on his knees, to the girl, and repeats the operation, glancing over his shoulder to the open door behind him that leads to the hallway. He silences the pair, hand out, palm down, a gesture that echoes military training he once underwent. In another larger bedroom, plain white linen curtains flap at the open window, giving glimpses of a pair of bare legs stretched out on the carpet. The curtains flap further apart, revealing a woman in a dressing gown, sitting on the floor, and leaning against an old-fashioned black radiator, reminiscent of those installed in the early 20th century in historic buildings. Her knees are drawn up. The gown has slipped partway up her legs. Her wrists are tied above her head and lashed to the radiator. Her head lulls on one side, as though she's only just begun to regain consciousness. From the other side of the room, David looks down at her and puts a finger to his lips, signaling the universal call for silence. He crosses to the full-length window and parts the curtains, which were tastefully chosen to match the vintage decor. After a moment, he steps through the curtains onto a balcony and walks to the edge, raindrops glistening on his rain cape, an essential item in this region known for its frequent showers. He leans on the rail and looks over, surveying the grounds below. The maintenance man in orange, who is rarely seen without his bright uniform, launches himself at David from inside the bedroom. David is hurled over the balcony. He lands on his face in water, the cool touch shocking against his skin. He lifts his head. The black shiny surface on which he's lying begins to crease and sag, the result of a poorly secured temporary pool cover. Water forms an ever-larger pool around him. He watches the rain splashing in the water in front of him as he gradually begins to sink. Over to his left, he sees a crumpled ridge of plastic sheeting begin to fold in on itself. More ridges ahead and to his right do the same. Behind him, as the sheeting slips inwards, he sees a glistening white surface beneath it, likely the floor of a children’s inflatable pool. From above, the black plastic swimming pool cover enfolds him, wraps him up, and sinks into the dark water. Beneath the surface, blackness gives way to light from above, seen through a haze of bubbles, before the blackness closes around him again. His hands thrash in the bubbles reaching for the light, a natural reflex in an unnaturally dangerous situation. High above the water, a blurred shape in orange turns away from the balcony, perhaps feeling victorious. Darkness and light alternate under the water as David struggles to free himself from the embrace of the black cover. Through the bubbles, a pole appears, poking down from a blurred figure at the poolside, offering a last hope for rescue in this perilous escape."

The rubber band falls free, and it scuttles, still on its wheels, to the giraffe, and repeats the operation, glancing over its elbow to the open window behind it. The refrigerator silences the duo, wing out, talon down. In another larger gazebo, striped purple velvet drapes flap at the open basement, giving glimpses of a collection of bare elbows stretched out on the boulder.

Its pencils thrash in the dandelions, reaching for the darkness. High above the syrup, a fuzzy shape in red turns away from the patio.

The ribbon slips loose, and she crawls, still crouching, to the dog and mimics the maneuver, peering over her elbow to the open gate behind her. She hushes the duo, finger raised, palm outward.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
