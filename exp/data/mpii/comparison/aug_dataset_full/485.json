The camera smoothly pans to capture her movement, maintaining focus on her as she approaches the window. Upon reaching it, she notices the upstairs bedroom remains illuminated, and it becomes evident that the voice originates from that particular room. Standing near the window, Mary listens intently, her expression revealing an escalating blend of distress, concern, and sympathy. With a heavy heart, she slowly turns her face away from the window to gaze wistfully at the small, empty room, then shifts her focus back to the view outside. There, she observes Norman making his way down the path, a tray cloaked in a napkin balanced carefully in his hands. Mary regards him for a brief moment before swiftly pivoting on her heels, quickly moving to the door, opening it, and stepping out onto the porch. Pausing momentarily just outside the door, she seems ready to proceed when Norman appears from around the building, walking along the porch. Passing by the office, he halts only when he reaches her vicinity. He locks eyes with her, feeling a sharp sting of embarrassment as he perceives the knowing look in her eyes. Beginning to retreat into her room, Mary senses Norman’s intent to follow but notices his hesitation as he takes in the full scene—a young, attractive woman in a motel room. He realizes that bringing down the food tray, defying his mother's wishes, has already stretched his limits for the day. Opting not to wait for any form of approval or disapproval from her, he promptly turns and hustles back to the office. Mary watches him depart, her amusement tinged with sympathy, and subsequently decides to follow. Inside, Norman scans the room, tray still in hand, noting the lack of a suitable surface for laying out supper. Turning, he notices Mary standing there at the doorway. As he busies himself with the task of arranging the bread, ham, and milk, we observe Mary as she traverses the room, her attention drawn to the paintings adorning the walls. Predominantly nudes, the artwork carries a subtle religious undertone. Eventually, Mary reaches the sofa, settles herself down, and casts her eyes over the meal laid before her. Starting to eat, her demeanor remains somewhat tense; she gingerly picks up a small slice of ham, bites off a minuscule portion, and nibbles at it with the air of someone deeply preoccupied and disturbed. Meanwhile, Norman watches her intently, taking note of the tiny bite she has taken, prompting him to smile and then chuckle softly. Mary meets his gaze, her lips compressing into a slight smile. However, Norman’s demeanor shifts as he turns towards her, his expression turning startlingly cold. The fury he felt dissipates as swiftly and completely as it had arisen, leaving him to slump back into his chair, visibly deflated. Mary observes the turmoil within him, almost physically sharing in the pain of his inner struggle. She then quietly exits the parlor, and from Norman's perspective, we see her traversing the small office space, finally disappearing into the night outside. Norman, left in solitude, enters the office and fixates his attention on the book. He returns to the parlor, still wearing a puzzled expression, inwardly grappling with his impulses, torn between resisting and succumbing to the urge to listen more intently to the sounds that surround him."

The camera follows her to the window, and once there, we see the light is still on in the upstairs bedroom, known for its intricate woodwork, and the voice is coming from that room. Mary stands by the window, listening with mounting distress, concern, and sympathy.

He stares with painful embarrassment at the knowing look in her eye. She begins to back into her room, and Norman starts to follow but hesitates as he sees the total picture of an attractive young woman and a motel room, a setting that makes him uncomfortable due to his sheltered upbringing. Bringing down the tray of food, in defiance of his mother's orders who is famously strict, is about the limit of his defiance for one day. Without waiting for approval or disapproval, he turns and hurries to the office adorned with old travel posters. Mary looks after him, her face showing amused sympathy, then follows. Norman looks about, tray in hand, sees there is no reasonable place to spread out a supper in the cramped space. He turns and sees Mary standing in the doorway watching with curiosity. As Norman goes about spreading out the bread and ham sourced from a local farm and pouring the milk into vintage glassware, we follow Mary across the room. She notices the paintings on the wall; nudes, primarily, and many with a vaguely religious overtone that hint at Norman's complex psyche. Finally, Mary reaches the sofa, sits down, and looks at the spread. Mary begins to eat, her attitude a bit tense.

Norman gazes at her, at the tiny bite she has taken, smiles, and then laughs, a rare break from his usual somber demeanor. Mary looks at him, with some compression, and smiles. Norman turns slowly, looking at her with a striking coldness, reminiscent of his usual demeanor when stressed. The fury suddenly dies, abruptly and completely, and he sinks back into his chair. Mary watches the troubled man, almost physically pained by his anguish associated with deep personal conflicts. She goes out of the parlor. We see her from Norman's viewpoint as she crosses the small office lined with dusty old ledgers and goes out into the night.

Norman turns his ear from the direction of the sounds, seems to be fighting an impulse to listen, or more than listen, as if torn between duty and his own desires."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
