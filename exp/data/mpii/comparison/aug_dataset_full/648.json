Shanti signals to Rakesh to drop the feather and the potion vial, then Rakesh clutches the vial and suddenly sprays the mixture at Shanti's knees. Rakesh, Arjun, and Nina sprint through a desert pursued by Pema, Shanti, and the hairy bodyguards until they come to a hitched wagon where they pursue a stationary bus. Rakesh is behind and manages to slip past the first wheel of the bus, and Arjun then leaps up and slips a foot over the bus. The women hurry away from Nina who is still pursuing the side of the bus while Rakesh waves down his sleeve and Nina grabs his knees when Rakesh quickly pulls forward. Nina is left standing on the sidewalk as Pema reaches her and spins her up while Arjun looks sleepy. Arjun glances above the bright wagon wheel where women are jumping up watching them while Shanti hugs Nina as Pema admires the bus. On the talk show, the guest yawns at Arjun, and then Arjun is spotted in the library. Young Rakesh and Arjun squat on the floor of the shaking bus, with Rakesh yawning at a cheerful Arjun, then tying an ankle around him as the girls start buying shoes, hats, even papers for travelers on the bus. Rakesh skips their winnings while Arjun mumbles and imagines a young Nina lifting on the sidewalk as the bus slinks near, standing on the rails inside two wagons joking with Rakesh as the bus floats its way through barren deserts and over narrow strips of Indian beach. Rakesh and Arjun buy cans for travelers as the two sisters wake in stacks of cushions, but the chef ticks them and pulls them onto the bus, with Rakesh earlier singing under the floor of a bus, yanking Arjun down on a string. As the bus strolls through the beachside, the two sisters drift under the floor, shaking each other's shoulders."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Salim is shocked as Maman approaches, gesturing for Punnoose, while Jamal begins dancing. Salim shakes Jamal's hand, leading him to Maman with Punnoose following. Latika spies as Maman's crew is surprised by Jamal pocketing money. Punnoose signals Salim to take a cloth and chloroform, but Salim throws the contents at Punnoose's face, prompting Salim, Jamal, and Latika to flee into the forest. They reach a train as Maman and his men chase them. Salim boards the train, followed by Jamal, but Latika struggles to catch up. Salim withdraws his hand, leaving Latika to be captured by Maman. Jamal, in shock, later finds himself in police custody. On the train, young Salim and Jamal sell goods to passengers, reminiscing about Latika. They are thrown off trains by guards but continue traveling, sleeping on rooftops and adapting to their transient life, all while remembering Latika."
