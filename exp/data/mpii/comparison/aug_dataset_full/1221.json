          "description": "As the volunteer peers down at Rambo's boat, Lewis stands firmly in the stern with his back to Rambo, and in a decisive manner, he raises his hand to point at himself as if seeking acknowledgment before casting a look toward Rambo, who, choosing to ignore him, maintains a stoic presence. With deliberate slowness, Rambo fixes a cold glare on him, his expression blank and unwavering, before he deliberately turns his head away, leans slightly over the boat's edge, and spits into the river, the water rippling quietly. Afterward, he refocuses his gaze on the distant horizon, and Lewis, feeling a wave of disgust, shakes his head in disappointment and turns on his heel to walk away. As he does so, Handsome and rugged School Boy takes a brief moment to look up along the boat in Rambo's direction, his glance lingering momentarily. Transitioning to the military camp at night, a truck is stationed at the far end of two neatly arranged rows of huts. Meanwhile, in the confines of a pigsty cell, Sarah lifts her eyes to peer through floorboards into the hut above, where the commander, sporting a short, well-groomed mustache, inhales deeply from one of his ever-present cigarettes, puffs out a stream of smoke with a self-satisfied smirk, and then, with a casual air, strolls away as Sarah silently lowers her head against the wall of her prison in resignation. On the river, the boat navigates around a promontory, strategically keeping its headlamps off to remain unseen. Lewis, leaning pensively on the boat's prow, takes a moment to turn his head and glance back toward the stern where Rambo meets his gaze with a stare that holds for a second, before Lewis, feeling a sense of unresolved tension, turns away again. The boat eventually maneuvers alongside the harbor where Michael's party had previously been dropped off, and the mercenaries, each appearing focused and determined, disembark with an array of weapons slung over their shoulders and bandoleers strapped across their chests, showcasing automatic rifles equipped with telescopic sights. As they descend, two rebels emerge along the path that leads to the gangplank, while Rambo, moving with purpose, strides up the gangplank. The group of mercenaries, accompanied by BN the rebel and the boy tracker, proceed to set off into the forest, their figures gradually swallowed by the dense undergrowth, while Rambo stands at the edge of the clearing, watching them with a solemn expression before he eventually turns back toward the boat. BN and the boy adeptly guide the mercenaries through the tangled forest undergrowth, navigating carefully as School Boy's rifle stands out due to its particularly bulky size, and they encounter a small stream, which they cross with deliberate care. En-Joo, distinguishable by his khaki hat, and Diaz, who has a shirt draped over his hair for protection, continue onward. Resting against a tree, partially concealed by the encroaching vines, is a dull gray object, bullet-shaped with fins at one end, which catches Lewis's attention and he regards it with wariness, while the rest of the mercenaries, undeterred, proceed past the object, paying it little heed. As they advance, they pass by the ominous mouth of a cave set against a craggy mountainside; inside, a small group of anxious locals comprising women, children, and elderly men casts uneasy glances outward, and though the mercenaries continue moving, En-Joo, Reese, and Diaz each take a moment, looking back at the locals with expressions of cautious acknowledgment. Upon reaching the village paddy field, the water, despite being clear, reveals pale brown mud beneath its surface with plant stalks jutting into the air and trees mirrored in the water. Within its depths lies the decomposing corpse of a human, partially submerged, with a dead buffalo further beyond, while BN and the mercenaries stand on the periphery of the field, surveying the macabre scene. More grim discoveries await at the field's edge, where Reese, overcome by the stench, presses his shirt against his nose, and a woman's severed head dangles grotesquely from a post. As Lewis turns to observe, his gaze is arrested by the sight of two bodies hanging from the bare rafters of a ruined hut. The boy, in a decision that suggests understanding, nods and then departs, leaving the mercenaries to make a cautious note of the devastated village, their mood one of wary vigilance as they take in the aftermath of the destruction."

Lewis, trying to assert his role as leader of the operation, points to himself and looks at Rambo, who ignores him with the stoicism for which he is well-known. Rambo fixes him a glare but remains expressionless, a tactic he often uses to maintain an air of authority, then turns away and spits into the river, a broad, winding waterway known for its perilous currents, before staring ahead again as Lewis walks away in disgust. Handsome and rugged School Boy, a marksman known for his sharp shooting, glances up the boat at Rambo. The military camp at night has a truck sitting at the end of two rows of huts, which are hastily constructed shelters used by the soldiers stationed there. In the pigsty cell, Sarah, who was captured while delivering medical supplies to local villages, looks up through the floorboards into the hut where the commander appears. The commander, with a short, neat mustache that seems out of place given the harsh conditions, takes a pull on one of his ever-present cigarettes, which are a rare commodity in these remote areas, blows smoke, smirks, and walks away as Sarah rests her head against the rough wooden wall of her prison. On the river, the boat rounds a promontory, a high point of land that juts into the water, with its headlamps off to avoid detection. Lewis leans pensively on the boat's prow, turns to look at the stern, and Rambo stares back at him, a master at reading the intentions of others, before Lewis turns away. The boat pulls alongside the harbor where Michael's party were dropped, a location known for its strategic importance in smuggling activities, and the mercenaries disembark laden with various weapons and bandoleers, including automatic rifles with telescopic sights favored for their long-range accuracy. Two rebels, members of a local resistance group fighting against the oppressive military regime, approach along the path leading to the gangplank as Rambo walks up the gangplank. The party of mercenaries, BN the rebel, and the boy tracker set off into the dense forest, navigating through terrain fraught with dangers, while Rambo solemnly watches them go, his experience as a seasoned operator evident in his composed demeanor, turns away, and walks back to the boat. BN and the boy lead the mercenaries through forest undergrowth as School Boy's rifle, a specially modified sniper rifle, is particularly bulky, and they cross a small stream, its waters surprisingly clear despite the surrounding chaos. En-Joo wears a khaki hat to shield himself from the sun, and Diaz has a shirt covering his hair, a makeshift effort to blend into the surroundings. Resting against a tree and partially covered in vines is a dull gray object, an unexploded ordnance from a past conflict, bullet-shaped but with fins at one end, which Lewis regards warily, while the rest of the mercenaries, perhaps desensitized by experience, pay the bomb little attention and move on. They pass a cave mouth on a craggy mountainside where inside there's a small collection of nervous-looking locals, comprising women, children, and old men, likely displaced refugees hiding from ongoing violent confrontations, and the mercenaries move on as En-Joo, Reese, and Diaz each give the locals a backward glance. At the village paddy field, where rice is cultivated, the water is clear but there is pale brown mud beneath it, with sticks of plant poking into the air and trees reflected in the water's surface. A decomposing human corpse lies partially submerged in the water with a dead buffalo beyond it, suggestive of a recent attack, as BN and the mercenaries overlook the field. More corpses lie at the edge of the field, and Reese holds his shirt against his nose to ward off the stench of decay, as a woman's severed head hangs from a post, a grim warning to others. Lewis turns to look, and there are two bodies hanging from bare rafters in the remains of a hut, remnants of the latest atrocity. The boy nods and leaves, moving with the practiced agility of someone familiar with the terrain, and the mercenaries make a wary record of the ruined village, each considering the perilous road ahead."

On the ocean, the canoe rounds a peninsula with its lanterns ablaze. Stanley reclines thoughtfully on the canoe's bridge, turns to smile at the bow, and Geraldine grins back at him before Stanley gazes away.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
