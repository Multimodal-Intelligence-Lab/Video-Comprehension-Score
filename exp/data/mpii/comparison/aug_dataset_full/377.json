Inside, Edward Bloom, 61, lies asleep on the bed. Although not as vibrant as before, his condition is not worse than expected; the illness has been quick but left him largely intact, with no I.V.s or monitors in sight. Will approaches the bed as Edward cracks open an eye, struggling to focus. Edward tries to speak, but no words come out, so he glances at a pitcher on the nightstand. Will pours him a glass of water and helps him drink. There is a long, tense pause, and as Will almost speaks to break the silence, he remembers the can of Ensure, which he holds up. Edward recoils at the sight of it but then rolls his eyes. Will opens the can, finds a straw, and Edward drinks as much Ensure as he can stand before pushing the can away, swallowing with difficulty. Will does not commit to Edward's unspoken assessment, prompting Edward to laugh a little, which turns into a cough. The coughing escalates until another drink of water calms it. Will takes the half-empty Ensure and stands to leave. Before exiting, he smiles at his joke, shuts the door behind himself, and drinks the remainder of the Ensure, finding it tastes horrible. As he heads for the stairs, Will walks past an open door, leaving the frame as we stay behind to see an eight-year-old Will, face covered with chicken pox and calamine lotion, sitting in bed. The young Will sings, his voice high and thin, until it cracks and drops, leaving him embarrassed as he continues singing, struggling to follow the baritone part. As he sings, Edward, undoes his collar, which pops off, followed by two more buttons, one hitting a chubby woman in the neck. We watch as Edward’s pant cuffs rise quickly, indicative of his rapid growth. Young Edward lies in bed, limbs and weight supported by pulleys and levers, surrounded by dozens of encyclopedias. He considers an encyclopedia article, already adorned with drawings, when the crack of a bat signals a game-winning home run. The crowd cheers as the batter, presumably Edward, rounds the bases. This scene marks our first real encounter with grown-up Edward, whom we will follow from the ages of 18 to 30.",

Inside, Edward Bloom, 61, reclines asleep on the mattress. Although not as lively as before, his state is not worse than anticipated; the sickness has been swift but left him largely whole, with no I.V.s or monitors visible. Will approaches the mattress as Edward cracks open an eye, struggling to concentrate. Edward attempts to speak, but no words emerge, so he glances at a jug on the bedside table. Will pours him a tumbler of liquid and aids him in drinking. There is a lengthy, tense hesitation, and as Will almost speaks to break the quiet, he recalls the can of Ensure, which he holds up. Edward flinches at the sight of it but then rolls his eyes. Will opens the can, finds a straw, and Edward drinks as much Ensure as he can tolerate before pushing the can away, swallowing with effort. Will does not commit to Edward's unspoken evaluation, prompting Edward to chuckle slightly, which turns into a cough. The coughing intensifies until another drink of liquid calms it. Will takes the half-empty Ensure and stands to depart. Before exiting, he grins at his jest, shuts the portal behind himself, and drinks the remainder of the Ensure, finding it tastes dreadful. As he heads for the steps, Will strolls past an open portal, leaving the frame as we remain behind to see an eight-year-old Will, face covered with chicken pox and calamine lotion, seated in bed. The young Will sings, his voice high and thin, until it cracks and drops, leaving him embarrassed as he continues singing, struggling to follow the baritone part.

We observe as Edward’s trouser cuffs rise swiftly, indicative of his rapid growth. Young Edward reclines in bed, limbs and weight supported by pulleys and levers, surrounded by dozens of encyclopedias. He contemplates an encyclopedia entry, already adorned with sketches, when the crack of a bat signals a game-winning home run. The spectators cheer as the batter, presumably Edward, rounds the bases. This scene marks our first genuine encounter with mature Edward, whom we will follow from the ages of 18 to 30."

Inside, Edward Bloom, 61, is lying asleep on the bed. Although not as vibrant as before, no worse condition than expected is shown; the illness has been quick but has largely left him intact, with no I.V.s or monitors seen. The bed is approached by Will as an eye is cracked open by Edward, struggling to focus. An attempt to speak is made by Edward, but no words come out, so a glance is given by him at a pitcher on the nightstand. A glass of water is poured for him by Will, who helps him drink. A long, tense pause occurs, and as the silence is almost broken by Will, a remembrance of the can of Ensure occurs to him, which he holds up. The sight of it causes Edward to recoil, but then his eyes are rolled. The can is opened by Will, a straw is found, and as much Ensure as he can stand is drunk by Edward before the can is pushed away, swallowing with difficulty. Will does not commit to Edward's unspoken assessment, prompting a little laugh from Edward, which turns into a cough. The coughing escalates until another drink of water calms it. The half-empty Ensure is taken by Will, and he stands to leave. Before exiting, a smile is given by him at his joke, the door is shut behind himself, and the remainder of the Ensure is drunk, finding it tastes horrible.

Although Edward is not as vibrant and full of life as he once was in his younger days, his condition is not worse than anticipated; the illness he suffers from has progressed swiftly but has left him largely intact, with no visible intravenous lines or monitoring equipment in sight. Will moves closer to the bed, and Edward slowly opens one eye, struggling to focus and take in his surroundings. Edward makes an effort to speak, but no words come out, so he directs his gaze toward a pitcher of water on the nearby nightstand.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
