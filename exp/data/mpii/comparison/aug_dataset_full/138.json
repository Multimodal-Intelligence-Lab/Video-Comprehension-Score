Meha attempts to speak dispassionately, but under Gandhi's compassionate gaze, his hopelessness surfaces. Near collapse, Meha gestures around the vacant house, unable to proceed, and he nods. Gandhi gazes around the primitive abode where nearly nothing remains. Two young males, perhaps seventeen and older, a girl about sixteen, and Meha's spouse, sitting near Ba, are present. The two women hear together, but Meha's spouse appears defeated, with disheveled hair and a grimy sari. Gandhi nods, articulating bleak expressions that present no false promise, and glances at Meha's spouse, who lowers her head as tears come to her eyes. Ba consoles her, and the woman breaks down into sobs. Later, Gandhi rides in an open howdah on an elephant, lost in grave contemplation, with Shukla by his side, too intimidated to interrupt Gandhi's somber mood, which holds more fury than observed before except towards Ba. A ball is struck, revealing a lush, verdant field where white-clad players and English spectators watch under parasols, with Indian attendants discreetly serving beverages. After a four is struck, a batsman notices a vehicle hurrying near the clubhouse with an officer and streaming people, an Indian corporal driving, as a major stands on the back seat. The captain, wearing a clerical collar, resolute, looks down at Gandhi and shakes his head. Gandhi is seen in full, in a white loincloth, shawl, and sandals, his attire for existence. Charlie examines Gandhi, comprehends, and grins, prompting a small grin from Gandhi, who chuckles, and chuckles again. Charlie turns to the guard, who hesitantly unlocks the cell.

Behind him, a large gathering of villagers waits patiently and stoically outside the modest dwelling, each person hoping for their turn to have their case heard. Meha, standing in front, attempts to speak in a controlled and emotionless tone; however, under the empathetic and understanding gaze of Gandhi, his suppressed despair begins to surface and become evident. In a state nearing emotional collapse, Meha gestures helplessly around the sparsely furnished and empty house, unable to continue speaking, and Gandhi acknowledges his struggle with a nod. Gazing around the crude and simple dwelling where almost no possessions remain, Gandhi takes in the scene. Present are two young men, perhaps around seventeen years or older, a girl likely about sixteen, and Meha's wife, all sitting near Ba. The two women listen intently together, yet there is an air of defeat about Meha's wife, her hair disheveled and her sari noticeably dirty. Gandhi nods, uttering words that are somber and bleak, offering no illusions or false hope. He then glances towards Meha's wife, who, overwhelmed by emotion, lowers her head as tears begin to pool in her eyes. Ba reaches out to comfort her gently, causing the woman to break down completely into deep, uncontrollable sobs.\n\nLater, Gandhi is seen riding thoughtfully in an open howdah on an elephant. He is deep in sober reflection, with Shukla sitting by his side, too intimidated to disrupt Gandhi's dark and intense mood, which seems to contain more anger than anyone has observed before, except perhaps in moments directed towards Ba. Meanwhile, on a lush, verdant cricket pitch nearby, a ball is struck with precision, capturing the attention of white-clad players and English spectators who watch under the shade of parasols, while Indian servants unobtrusively serve drinks. After a skillful four is hit, a batsman notices a car making its way hurriedly towards the clubhouse, an officer visible with an entourage of people streaming behind, driven by an Indian corporal as a major stands in the back seat. The captain, notably marked by his clerical collar and a look of determination, observes Gandhi and shakes his head slightly. Gandhi stands in stark contrast, seen fully in his simple yet significant attire of a white loincloth, a shawl draped over his shoulders, and sandals on his feet, his chosen attire that symbolizes his way of life. Charlie, observing Gandhi intently, comes to an understanding and breaks into a grin, which prompts a small grin in return from Gandhi, leading to shared laughter that breaks the tension. Charlie then turns to the guard, who, after a moment of hesitation, unlocks the cell door.

Behind him, there is a large assembly of villagers gathered together, waiting with patient and stoic demeanor outside the modest dwelling. Each individual there harbors the hope of having their opportunity to present their case and be heard. Positioned at the forefront is Meha, who endeavors to speak in a voice that is controlled and devoid of emotion; however, under the empathetic and understanding gaze of Gandhi, Meha’s suppressed despair begins to surface and become evident. In a state nearing emotional collapse, Meha gestures helplessly around the sparsely furnished and empty house, finding himself unable to continue speaking. Gandhi acknowledges his struggle with a simple but knowing nod. As his eyes casually sweep across the crude and simple dwelling where hardly any possessions remain, Gandhi takes in the scene. Present within this space are two young men, probably around seventeen years of age or possibly older, a girl who appears to be likely about sixteen, and Meha's wife, all of whom are seated near Ba. The two women listen together with earnest attention, yet there is an air of defeat that surrounds Meha's wife; her hair is disheveled, and her sari is noticeably dirty. Gandhi nods and speaks words that are somber and bleak, offering neither illusions nor false hope. He then turns his gaze towards Meha's wife, who, overwhelmed by the rising tide of her emotions, lowers her head as tears begin to pool and brim in her eyes. In response, Ba reaches out to comfort her gently, causing the woman to break down completely, succumbing to deep and uncontrollable sobs.\n\nLater on, Gandhi is observed riding thoughtfully in an open howdah atop an elephant. He is immersed in deep, sober reflection, with Shukla seated by his side, feeling too intimidated to disrupt Gandhi's dark and intense mood, a mood that seems to simmer with more anger than anyone has noticed before, except perhaps in rare moments directed towards Ba. Meanwhile, on a nearby lush and verdant cricket pitch, a ball is struck with precision, catching the attention of white-clad players and English spectators who watch from the comfort of shade provided by their parasols, while Indian servants unobtrusively serve refreshing drinks. After a skillful four is hit, a batsman observes a car making its way hurriedly towards the clubhouse, with an officer visible amongst an entourage of people streaming behind. It is being driven by an Indian corporal as a major stands in the back seat. The captain, distinguished by his clerical collar and an expression of determination, observes Gandhi and shakes his head ever so slightly. Gandhi stands out in stark contrast, seen fully in his simple yet significant attire of a white loincloth, a shawl draped over his shoulders, and sandals on his feet, an attire that symbolizes his chosen way of life.

In the background, a large group of villagers stands patiently, waiting outside the dwelling, showing their readiness to have their concerns addressed. As Meha attempts to convey his situation without becoming emotional, the empathetic gaze of Gandhi seems to penetrate Meha's defenses, causing his feelings of despair to surface. Meha, on the verge of breaking down, gestures broadly around the nearly empty house, his voice faltering, indicating his inability to continue speaking. Gandhi, taking in the scene, casts his eyes around the primitive dwelling, noting the absence of belongings or comforts. Within the room, there are two young men, one appearing to be around seventeen and the other slightly older, a teenage girl of about sixteen, and Meha's wife, all of whom are sitting near Ba. The two women, Meha's wife and Ba, listen intently together, but the wife appears particularly defeated, her hair disheveled and her sari dirty. Acknowledging the depth of the situation, Gandhi nods somberly and delivers words that are honest but devoid of any false promises, casting a glance at Meha's wife, who reacts by lowering her head and tears welling up in her eyes. In response, Ba reaches out to comfort her, causing Meha's wife to release her pent-up emotion and break down into sobs. Later, Gandhi finds himself riding in an open howdah atop an elephant, deep in sober reflection, with Shukla beside him, who is too intimidated by Gandhi's unusually dark mood to speak. This mood, infused with anger, is more intense than any other that has surfaced except when directed towards Ba. In a change of scene, a ball is struck on a lush, green cricket pitch where players clad in white and English spectators, shaded under parasols, watch the game as Indian servants move discreetly among them, serving drinks. After the ball is hit to the boundary for four runs, a batsman takes notice of a car speeding towards the clubhouse. The car, driven by an Indian corporal, carries an officer and a group of people streaming behind it, with a major standing prominently in the back seat. Observing these events, the team captain, distinguished by his clerical collar, looks down at Gandhi with determination and shakes his head. Gandhi stands there fully visible in his simple attire of a white loincloth, shawl, and sandals, which represents his lifelong commitment. Charlie, observing Gandhi thoughtfully, comprehends the gravity of his presence and breaks into a grin, which elicits a small grin from Gandhi as well, followed by laughter and then another round of laughter. Charlie then turns his attention to the guard, who, after a moment's hesitation, unlocks the cell door. Entering the cell, Charlie takes a seat on a stool opposite Gandhi, his long legs awkwardly positioned in the confined space between them."

Meha tries to speak unemotionally, but under Gandhi's sympathetic gaze, his despair breaks through, much like many who felt comforted by Gandhi's presence during India's struggle for independence. Near breakdown, Meha gestures around the empty house, unable to continue, and he nods, acknowledging the hardship faced by his family. Gandhi looks around the crude dwelling where almost nothing remains, a reflection of the poverty that plagued rural India. Two young men, perhaps seventeen and older, a girl about sixteen, and Meha's wife, sitting near Ba, who is affectionately known as Kasturba Gandhi, are present. The two women listen together, but Meha's wife looks defeated, with unkempt hair and a dirty sari, emblematic of the struggles endured by women in a patriarchal society. Gandhi nods, speaking bleak words that offer no false hope, mindful of the realistic approach he always advocated, and glances at Meha's wife, who lowers her head as water comes to her eyes. Ba comforts her, demonstrating her nurturing nature, and the woman breaks down into sobs. Later, Gandhi rides in an open howdah on an elephant, a traditional mode of Indian royal transport, lost in sober reflection, with Shukla by his side, too intimidated to interrupt Gandhi's dark mood, which contains more anger than seen before except towards Ba, illustrating occasional tensions in their partnership. A ball is hit, revealing a lush, verdant pitch where white-garbed players engage in a cricket match, a legacy of British colonial influence, and English onlookers watch under parasols, with Indian servants discreetly serving drinks in a scene of colonial leisure. After a four is hit, a batsman notices a car hurrying near the clubhouse with an officer and streaming people, an Indian corporal driving, as a major stands on the back seat, highlighting the military presence often interwoven with civilian life during British rule.

Near breakdown, the astronaut gestures around the empty house, unable to continue, and the penguin nods. The penguin looks around the crude dwelling where almost nothing remains. Two young men, perhaps seventeen and older, a girl about sixteen, and the astronaut's wife, sitting near Ba, are present. The two women listen together, but the astronaut's wife looks defeated, with unkempt hair and a dirty sari. The penguin nods, speaking bleak words that offer no false hope, and glances at the astronaut's wife, who lowers her head as water comes to her eyes. Ba comforts her, and the woman breaks down into sobs. Later, the penguin rides in an open howdah on an elephant, lost in sober reflection, with a magician by the penguin's side, too intimidated to interrupt the penguin's dark mood, which contains more anger than seen before except towards Ba. A robot hits a ball, revealing a lush, verdant pitch where white-garbed players and English onlookers watch under parasols, with Indian servants discreetly serving drinks. After a four is hit, a batsman notices a car hurrying near the clubhouse with an officer and streaming people, an Indian corporal driving, as a major stands on the back seat. A detective, wearing a clerical collar, determined, looks down at the penguin and shakes the detective's head. The penguin is seen in full, in a white loincloth, shawl, and sandals, the penguin's attire for life. A knight studies the penguin, understands, and grins, prompting a small grin from the penguin, who laughs, and laughs again. The knight turns to the guard, who hesitantly unlocks the cell. The knight enters, sits on a stool opposite the penguin, the knight's long legs awkwardly filling the space between them."

Gandhi looks around the crude shed where almost nothing remains. Two young men, perhaps seventeen and older, a girl about sixteen, and Meha's wife, sitting near Ba, are present. The two women listen together, but Meha's wife looks defeated, with unkempt hair and a tattered hat.

Meha attempts to convey indifferently, but under Gandhi's understanding gaze, his frustration surfaces. Near exhaustion, Meha gestures around the vacant house, hesitant to persist, and he nods. Gandhi surveys the rustic dwelling where almost nothing is left. Two young men, perhaps seventeen and older, a girl about sixteen, and Meha's wife, sitting near Ba, are present. The two women converse quietly, but Meha's wife appears weary, with tangled hair and a dusty sari. Gandhi nods, delivering somber words that extend no false optimism, and glances at Meha's wife, who bows her head as tears form in her eyes. Ba reassures her, and the woman erupts into sobs. Later, Gandhi travels in an open carriage on an elephant, immersed in deep contemplation, with Shukla at his side, too hesitant to disturb Gandhi's somber mood, which contains more irritation than seen before except towards Ba. A ball is caught, revealing a lush, verdant pitch where white-garbed players and English spectators observe under parasols, with Indian servants discreetly distributing refreshments. After a four is caught, a batsman notices a car speeding near the clubhouse with an officer and streaming people, an Indian corporal steering, as a major stands on the back seat.

Einstein looks around the crude barn where almost nothing remains. Two young mice, perhaps seventeen and older, a rabbit about sixteen, and Laila's uncle, sitting near Ken, are present. The two ants listen together, but Laila's uncle looks defeated, with unkempt fur and a dirty apron. Einstein nods, speaking bleak words that offer no false hope, and glances at Laila's uncle, who lowers her hat as water comes to her knees. Ken comforts her, and the uncle breaks down into sobs. Later, Einstein rides in an open gondola on a whale, lost in sober reflection, with Hughes by her side, too intimidated to interrupt Einstein's dark mood, which contains more humor than seen before except towards Ken. A feather is hit, revealing a lush, verdant rug where black-garbed dancers and Danish onlookers watch under umbrellas, with Japanese chefs discreetly serving ice cream.

Zara attempts to communicate cheerfully, but under Thor's watchful gaze, her excitement overflows. On the brink of glee, Zara gestures around the bustling control room, struggling to continue, and she hums. Thor glances around the sleek vessel where almost everything gleams. Two elderly women, perhaps eighty and older, a boy about fifteen, and Zara's brother, lounging near Loki, are present. The two men chat together, but Zara's brother appears exhausted, with disheveled hair and a dusty jacket. Thor hums, uttering uplifting phrases that bring no false promises, and glances at Zara's brother, who raises his head as a grin spreads across his face. Loki cheers him, and the man bursts into laughter. Later, Thor flies in a closed pod on a spaceship, lost in joyous contemplation, with Banner by his side, too enthralled to disrupt Thor's bright demeanor, which contains more joy than seen before except towards Loki. A balloon floats, revealing a dry, barren field where casually-dressed competitors and Martian spectators gather under space helmets, with alien staff discreetly distributing snacks. After a hit is made, a runner notices a drone hovering near the base with a robot and a crowd, a Martian pilot operating, as a drone commander stands on the roof. The umpire, wearing a pilot's cap, resolute, gazes up at Thor and nods his head. Thor is seen in full, in a golden armor suit, cape, and boots, his attire for battle. Bruce examines Thor, comprehends, and chuckles, prompting a slight chuckle from Thor, who roars, and roars again. Bruce turns to the technician, who eagerly unleashes the hatch.

Meha attempts to convey excitement, but under Gandhi's curious glance, his hope bursts forth. Approaching enthusiasm, Meha waves toward the decorated tent, unable to stop, and he grins. Gandhi scans the lavish pavilion where almost everything gleams. Two youths, perhaps nineteen and older, a boy about fourteen, and Meha's sister, lounging near Ba, are present. The two relatives converse together, but Meha's sister looks contented, with styled hair and a clean gown. Gandhi nods, speaking cheerful words that offer strong encouragement, and peers at Meha's sister, who raises her head as laughter comes to her lips. Ba praises her, and the woman bursts into giggles. Later, Gandhi sails in a closed carriage on a camel, caught in lighthearted musing, with Shukla by his side, too relaxed to break Gandhi's upbeat mood, which contains more joy than seen before except towards Ba. A dice is tossed, revealing a barren, sandy field where brightly-dressed dancers and Indian attendees observe without hats, with English butlers discreetly serving meals. After a dance is performed, a dancer notices a bicycle pedaling near the tent with a cook and trailing spectators, a Chinese navigator steering, as a colonel sits on the front basket. The director, wearing a construction hat, intrigued, glances up at Gandhi and nods his head. Gandhi is observed completely, in a colorful robe, scarf, and slippers, his costume for celebrations. Charlie watches Gandhi, appreciates, and chuckles, prompting a wide grin from Gandhi, who giggles, and giggles again. Charlie approaches the gardener, who confidently secures the gate. Charlie enters, reclines on a beanbag opposite Gandhi, his short arms awkwardly clasping the space behind them."

Zoe struggles to sing musically, but under the dragon's curious glance, her happiness bursts forth. Nearly laughing, Zoe waves toward the crowded barn, eager to continue, and she grins. The dragon peeks around the ornate palace where almost everything shines. Two old women, perhaps seventy and younger, a boy about six, and Zoe's brother, standing far from Ray, are absent. The two men chuckle separately, but Zoe's brother appears victorious, with styled hair and a pristine suit. The dragon grins, uttering cheerful phrases that convey no false applause, and winks at Zoe's brother, who lifts his head as fireworks light up the sky. Ray praises him, and the man bursts into cheers. Earlier, the dragon races on a swift chariot on a highway, engulfed in light-hearted contemplation, with Terry by its side, too fearful to disturb the dragon's sunny disposition, which contains more joy than shown before except towards Ray. A feather is blown, revealing a barren, desert field where black-clad dancers and French tourists relax under umbrellas, with Japanese chefs openly serving meals. After a kite is flown, a pilot watches a bicycle dawdling around the garden with a musician and singing cats, a French sergeant conducting, as a gardener sits on the front basket. The referee, wearing a jester's hat, elated, looks up at the dragon and bounces his toes. The dragon is spotted in halves, in a black tuxedo, cape, and boots, its outfit for parties. Alex ignores the dragon, misunderstands, and frowns, causing a wide frown from the dragon, who cries, and cries again. Alex approaches the poet, who confidently locks the door. Alex exits, stands on a ladder beside the dragon, her short arms gracefully stretching beneath them."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Later, riding an elephant, Gandhi is deep in thought, with Shukla beside him, reflecting more anger than usual. Meanwhile, a cricket game unfolds with English spectators and discreet Indian servants.
