As he meanders deliberately towards the sculpture, he notices his own silhouette approaching. He pauses before it and attempts to decipher the inscription etched around the metal base, but the characters are foreign and indecipherable. Simon remains motionless for a while, staring at himself, then advances a step nearer to his silhouette. To his astonishment, two indistinct silhouettes gradually materialize in the sculpture, positioned on either side of him: a teenager and a young lady. Simon rotates, but the chamber behind him is utterly vacant. He glances back at the attractive young lady and gulps nervously. She gestures and grins. Simon's amiable-looking father glows at him. Simon extends a hand towards them, but his fingers merely make contact with his silhouette in the sculpture. As his sister places her hand on the shoulder of his silhouette in the sculpture, Simon places a hand on his own shoulder. His sister warmly smiles at him again. Simon regards her wistfully. Simon removes the cover from Allen's chair. In the deserted laboratory, they shed the magician's cape. They dash to the sculpture.

Simon observes as it glides above his crown, darting around the meadow, then up and over the grey stone towers of the institution, soaring higher and higher until it vanishes into the rain-flushed horizon.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
