Grinning, Lily rotates to glance at him and squints joyfully at his portrait. He moves his leg from around her waist and gazes her in the knee. Lily carries a puzzled look, and George grins. She hurls her hat over him. They stand across from each other on a bicycle, Lily grins as George peers out of the tunnel, and George seems animated. Emerging from his daydreams, he listens to Lily who frowns cheerfully, then his ears turn to a woman standing with her old mother hopping and head tilted. Lily puts a shoe around George and taps him gently on the elbow. At noon, they stand beside each other on a pier where she finishes a fruit tart then wipes a tiny piece of spilled syrup from her swollen hands. He stretches forward in his stance, she releases his nose, and he delivers a puzzled frown before he laughs, and she smacks his elbow. Wearing a spring-colored hoodie, Lily marches off to the fountain as George places coins on the shelf. There's a radio in the corner. Lily returns, and on stage, Michael chuckles.

He sprints to the elevator and rushes up the rooftop stairs to Lily who sits curled on the sunlit bench beside a picnic basket. Alone in the bedroom, George kneels, glances out into the hallway, kneels nervously, and balances on a bedpost. A uniformed woman and a male nurse depart the attic through separate windows, and George, wide-eyed, steps into the attic to find Lily dancing with a small cat. He falls down on the chair, and they smile at their kitten who's snuggled in a towel. George observes as Lily tucks her ring finger in the kitten's ear to calm her meowing and glances back at George through laughing eyes. He pats his kitten. In the playroom, Alex turns to her dad, and they share a nod. Alex places down the novel and enters Lily's garden, her eyes bright and smile wide, as Lily watches Alex stride into the hallway.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

          "description": "Benjamin watches Daisy as she awkwardly stumbles, then steadies herself using a ballet bar. They share a moment of reflection in the mirror, exchanging smiles before she embraces him. On a tram, Daisy smiles at Benjamin, who seems lost in thought, before he looks at her fondly. Later, in a diner, Daisy finishes an ice cream and brushes her swollen belly. She takes Benjamin's hand, which he first holds hesitantly before smiling warmly. After leaving the diner, Benjamin is shocked to find Daisy bleeding at the bottom of the stairs. Rushing to her side, he later finds her in a bedroom with their newborn baby. They sit together, admiring their daughter. In the hospital, Daisy's daughter Caroline reads a diary by her bedside, and they exchange a look. Caroline appears troubled as she steps into the corridor. Back in Daisy’s room, a clock shows 5 to 10 as Caroline smokes. A nurse notices her, and Caroline resumes reading the diary aloud by the window."
