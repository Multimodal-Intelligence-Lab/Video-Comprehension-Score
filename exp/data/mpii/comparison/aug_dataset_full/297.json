She rises, strolls to the barrier, and gazes over, observing him crouching down, examining his blossoms, and caressing them fondly and with some satisfaction. His wrath seems to have departed him, substituted by the kind of tranquility that blossoms bring numerous individuals. He observes her but doesn't utter, and she begins signaling to him how to tend to his blossoms. He attends for a moment, then gazes directly at her, demonstrating with the emphatic motions of his lips that he opposes energetically to the irritation of her remarks. Startled and a bit surprised, she withdraws from the barrier. Jeff is seated in the foreground in a waist shot when the entryway to his flat opens behind him. Stella McGaffery enters, pauses on the landing to observe Jeff. She is a robust, unhandsome, dark-haired female attired like a community nurse, with a dark coat, dark felt hat, and a white uniform visible beneath the coat. As she descends the landing stairs, gripping the wrought iron balustrade with one hand, she transports a small black bag, which she places down on a desk, then removes her hat and coat and hangs them on a chair. Her wardrobe is worn and appears as if it belongs more to a pugilist than a nurse. Content, she strides to Jeff, whose visage exhibits he doesn't regard much of it, and twirls the wheelchair around suddenly to face her. She extracts the thermometer from its container, shakes it down, observes it, and converses as she operates. As she departs him gripping the thermometer, the camera withdraws as she crosses to a couch, extracts a sheet from underneath, and covers the couch with it, speaking continually. He extracts the thermometer, having no retort, and, conquered, places it back into his mouth as Stella proceeds with her task. The camera pans her over to him as she extracts the thermometer, observes it, and then puts down the thermometer. She aids him in standing on one foot, then assists him off with his pajama top. He hops one step, then she lowers him, face down, on the couch. She fetches a container of rubbing oil, and the camera is very low at one extremity of the couch where Jeff's head, half-submerged in the sheet, is large in the foreground, while beyond him Stella looms large and powerful-looking."

After a moment of adjustment in her chair, she rises and takes deliberate steps towards the fence. Peering over, she observes him kneeling down among his garden flowers, carefully examining each bloom, and tenderly touching them with a sense of pride and affection that seems to have replaced any previous traces of anger with the tranquility often brought by nature. Though he notices her presence, he maintains his silence, prompting her to begin a series of gestures aimed at instructing him on the nuances of flower care. He initially listens, his focus momentarily captured, but soon meets her gaze directly, responding with exaggerated lip movements that convey his strong objections to her unsolicited advice. Surprised and somewhat taken aback by his forceful reaction, she steps away from the fence, slightly startled. As the scene shifts, Jeff is shown seated in the foreground, captured in a waist shot, his attention momentarily redirected when the entrance door to his apartment swings open behind him.

She hangs them over a chair, the garments’ worn and battle-ready look, more befitting a fighter than a nurse, contrasting with her professional uniform. With everything in place, she approaches Jeff, who appears unimpressed, and swiftly swings his wheelchair to face her directly. Proceeding with her routine, she retrieves a thermometer from its case, swiftly shakes it down, and gives it a cursory glance while engaging in conversation. Leaving him with the thermometer in his mouth, she moves to a divan across the room, pulling a sheet from beneath it, and spreads it out with non-stop chatter. As he extracts the thermometer, lacking any retort, he returns it to his mouth, surrendering to the situation while Stella continues with her tasks. The camera follows her closely as she returns, removes the thermometer once again, examines it, and puts it away before assisting him to stand on one foot. Her assistance extends to helping him remove his pajama top as he hops a step, allowing her to gently lower him face down onto the divan. She then retrieves a bottle of rubbing oil, with the camera angle positioned low at the divan's edge, creating a vivid contrast between Jeff’s head, half-buried in the sheet and looming large in the foreground, and Stella's robust figure dominating the background, poised to begin her remedial work."

She is a slight, unattractive, fair-haired woman clothed like a park ranger, with a light jacket, light straw hat, and a green scarf peeking under the jacket. As she descends to the ceiling ladder, clutching the wooden beam with one foot, she swings a large red suitcase, which she places beside a counter, then pulls off her hat and jacket and drapes them on a rail.

Content, she dances to Kevin, whose face signals he doesn't admire it much, and spins the rocking chair abruptly to face her. She pulls the stethoscope out of its box, twists it upward, peers at it, and sings as she dances.

He observes her but doesn't converse, and she begins signaling to him how to arrange his stones. He ponders briefly, then gazes directly at her, demonstrating with exaggerated facial expressions that he objects fervently to the irritation of her gestures. Surprised and a bit taken aback, she retreats from the hedge. Jeff is lounging in the foreground in a medium shot when the exit door to his flat swings open behind him. Stella McGaffery enters, hesitates on the platform to observe Jeff. She is a sturdy, unconventional, light-haired woman dressed like a postal worker, with a beige jacket, green beret, and a checkered blouse visible beneath the jacket. As she descends the platform steps, gripping the wooden banister with one hand, she balances a large yellow backpack, which she places on a bench, then removes her beret and jacket and drapes them over a sofa.

He fiddles with the stethoscope, having no retort, and, resigned, places it back around his neck as Stella continues her task. The camera tracks her over to him as she removes the stethoscope, observes it, and then hangs the stethoscope. She assists him in balancing on one leg, then helps him shed his robe.

His fury seems to have abandoned him, replaced by the sort of tranquility that pebbles grant many creatures.

Delia McGaffery strolls in, hesitates on the veranda to observe Gus. She is a lean, charming, light-haired man dressed like a ballroom dancer, with a pale scarf, bright cap, and a colorful outfit peeking beneath the scarf. As she strolls down the veranda steps, gripping the wooden banister with one paw, she bears a large blue basket, which she places down on a shelf, then removes her cap and scarf and hangs them on a hook. Her garb is aged and appears as if it belongs more to a gymnast than a dancer. Content, she strolls to Gus, whose grin indicates he isn't impressed by it, and twirls the rocking chair sharply to face her. She extracts the compass from its pouch, flips it open, examines it, and converses as she proceeds. As she leaves him clutching the compass, the spotlight zooms out as she strides to a hammock, extracts a pillow from below, and drapes the hammock with it, chattering continuously. He retracts the compass, devoid of retort, and, resigned, places it back between his teeth as Delia continues with her tasks. The lens trails her over to him as she extracts the compass, inspects it, and then stows away the compass. She aids him in balancing on one paw, then assists him in removing his nightshirt.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
