Joe's focus shifts back to Parrish and Susan; the dance number comes to a dramatic conclusion with a resonant BOOM. On the dance floor, Parrish lifts his gaze and spots Joe, who is watching from the terrace, patiently waiting. In a spontaneous gesture, he pulls Susan into a close embrace, holding her tightly.

Susan, noticeably in discomfort, finds herself unable to muster a response to whatever is weighing on her mind. They lock eyes, and as seconds stretch into a prolonged, charged pause, a silent but profound understanding settles between them. Gently, he enfolds her in his embrace, and together, they begin to sway, moving gracefully across the space as if in a private dance away from everyone else. Meanwhile, perched on a grass terrace at the outer edge of the party, yet still maintaining a vantage point over the dance floor, stands Joe, whose gaze is fixed on Parrish and Susan, watching them with a mixture of admiration and a hint of wistfulness. A waiter ambles by, momentarily catching sight of Joe and coming to an abrupt stop. Joe meets the waiter’s eyes briefly before the waiter hesitates and then continues on his way. Joe’s attention shifts back to Parrish and Susan just as the music climaxes with a resounding BOOM. On the dance floor, Parrish’s eyes lift and connect with Joe’s, who remains up on the terrace, seemingly in anticipation. In a sudden movement, Parrish hugs Susan tightly, drawing her close until their proximity is almost palpable. Susan looks up at him; he responds with a reassuring smile and a nod, maintaining the embrace until a smile finally plays on her lips. Once she smiles back, she allows herself to be swept along by the throng heading to witness the fireworks. As Parrish perceives that she is making her way out, he turns purposefully, ascending towards Joe. Joe rises as Parrish approaches, and together, they watch the partygoers congregate, eager for the fireworks show. Joe holds back, observing Parrish patiently until he discerns that Parrish has comprehended and accepted his previous counsel. Only then does Joe proceed with the conversation. Parrish, gathering himself, allows a faint smile, inhales deeply, and strides purposefully forward once more, Joe accompanying him steadfastly. In unison, they move forward and soon disappear beyond the hill’s crest. Meanwhile, a series of vibrant fireworks explodes across the night sky. Below, Susan, responding to an involuntary pang, glances back towards the hill’s peak. She hesitates briefly before decisively breaking away from the party, her pace accelerating as she begins to ascend the hill. Halting midway, she notices a silhouette emerging against the backdrop where Joe and Parrish had vanished. The figure approaches directly towards her; she squints, trying to discern his identity, and a moment of recognition seems to stir her, prompting her to step forward, almost as if drawn by an irresistible force. Suddenly, she halts again. A man continues his approach, and as he nears, his features become clearer to Susan, and recognition solidifies. An inexplicable aura around him causes her to feel slightly apprehensive. Joe, from a distance, gives a slight shrug, endearingly scratches his head, as though bewildered by the unfolding events in both time and space. A burgeoning realization dawns on Susan, leaving her slightly unsteady. She fixes her gaze intently on Joe, seeking answers, holding herself completely still as she tries to read his expression. In the presence of the Young Man, with his eyes wide open, vulnerable, and imploring her response, she remains silent for what seems like an eternity. The tension finally breaks as words spill out of her, hesitantly yet deliberately. Susan exhales deeply, prompting a tender smile from the Young Man; they remain wholly absorbed in each other’s presence. As Susan allows herself to smile, the grand finale of the fireworks bursts overhead, music wafts up from the gathering below, and the evening sky is illuminated with a dazzling display of lights."

They watch the festivities as Joe gauges Parrish's readiness; once assured, they walk side by side and vanish over the hill. Fireworks illuminate the sky, drawing Susan's gaze upward. She briskly moves towards the hill, stopping when she sees a figure approaching. As he nears, she recognizes him and starts moving towards him, then hesitates. The man continues forward, and upon recognizing Joe, Susan feels a mix of familiarity and uncertainty. Joe's endearing shrug and Susan's realization leave her lightheaded.

Susan, encumbered by a sharp pain from an old injury sustained during her years as a dancer, can't summon an answer. They regard each other in the muted glow of the party lights, and after a long, contemplative pause, they have reached an unspoken understanding. He takes her in his arms with the grace of someone who has studied ballroom dancing, and they dance away, moving seamlessly across the floor. On a distant fringe of the party, on a grass terrace designed during the estate's landscaping transformation in the 1920s, is Joe. His eyes are on Parrish and Susan; he watches them admiringly yet ruefully, reflecting on the paths that have brought them all here. A Waiter, dressed in the classic black and white uniform of the elite catering company renowned in the region, passes, catches sight of Joe, and stops. Joe regards the Waiter for a moment, pondering whether to request another drink or not. The Waiter hesitates, then moves off with the practiced ease of someone used to serving at opulent gatherings. Joe's attention returns to Parrish and Susan; the dance number ends with a BOOM from the percussion section of the live jazz band. On the dance floor, Parrish looks up and sees Joe up on the terrace, waiting. Suddenly, feeling an urge to express the bond they share, he hugs her, holding her very close. She looks at him; he smiles, nods, but doesn't release her until she smiles back, a genuine reflection of their shared history. Now she heads out with the crowd for the fireworks that are set to be a spectacular display over the lake. When Parrish senses she is on her way, he turns and heads up towards Joe. Joe rises to meet Parrish as he approaches, the moonlight casting a gentle glow over their reunion. They watch the guests gathering to view the fireworks, their brightly colored bursts beginning to paint the sky. Joe waits and regards Parrish with the patience of an old friend, waiting until he has a sense that Parrish has accepted what Joe has said, then Joe continues, confident in their understanding. Parrish waits, smiles faintly, takes a deep breath that fills him with resolve, and strides out again, Joe right with him, like two comrades setting out on a path anew. In tandem, they continue on and disappear over the crest of the hill, where whispers of their conversation fade into the night. A barrage of fireworks lights up the sky with a brilliance that reflects in the eyes of onlookers. Down below, Susan, in a pained reflex, again turns and looks up towards the hill, the place where memories and futures intertwine. She hesitates, then glides away from the party, her step quickening as she walks up towards the hill where so much has already played out. Susan halts, and in the distance, a figure is approaching from over the crest of the hill where Joe and Parrish disappeared into the shadows. He is heading straight for her; she tries to make him out, squinting against the backdrop of exploding colors, seems to recognize him, and starts to walk towards him as if pulled by a magnet powered by hope and curiosity. Now she stops again, her heart fluttering with uncertainty. It is a man who keeps coming, and now that he is close, she recognizes him as an old friend from her college days, someone she hadn't expected to see. Something about him, perhaps the way the years have changed him, makes Susan slightly tentative. Joe, who has always had a knack for diffusing tension with humor, shrugs, scratches his head endearingly, uncertain of time and place in this moment of unexpected reunion. Some realization is dawning on Susan, rendering her lightheaded, as the memories from their shared past flood back. Susan regards Joe intently, searching his face for an answer, a glimmer of the connection they once shared. Susan holds herself very still, as if bracing for whatever revelation might come next. She searches the Young Man's eyes; his face is open, completely vulnerable, waiting for her response, the moment heavy with potential. After a long silence, the words come out haltingly, as though each one must be carefully chosen. Susan sighs, a release of the tension held within, the Young Man smiles gently, and they are completely intent on each other, the world around them fading into the background. Susan smiles as the fireworks finale goes off, the MUSIC, a swelling symphony piece performed live by the orchestra, comes up from below, and the night fills with light and sound, a perfect backdrop to this moment of reconnection."

It is a bird which keeps leaping, and now that it is distant, she recognizes it. Something about it makes Harriet slightly hesitant. Sarah frowns, rubs her beak awkwardly, puzzled by sound and shadow. Some memory is emerging in Harriet, making her lightfooted. Harriet observes Sarah carefully, seeking her ears for a question. Harriet stands herself very tense. She seeks the Old Bird's tail; her ears are open, completely guarded, listening for her greeting. After a quick noise, the sounds come out smoothly. Harriet yawns, the Old Bird laughs quietly, and they are completely focused on each other. Harriet chuckles as the parade finale ends, the DRUMS rise from above, and the morning fills with sound."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

          "description": "He approaches Susan, and amidst the crowd, they find a secluded connection. Susan is in pain and silent, but they reach an understanding. He embraces her, and they dance. Joe watches them from a distance, admiringly but ruefully. A waiter briefly catches Joe's attention, but he refocuses on the couple as the dance ends with a boom. Parrish embraces Susan tightly before she joins the crowd heading to watch fireworks. Parrish then approaches Joe, and they watch guests gather for the show. Joe waits, senses Parrish's acceptance, and they proceed together over the hill. Fireworks illuminate the sky as Susan looks toward the hill. She heads there, quickening her pace. Susan sees a figure approaching and recognizes him, feeling drawn to him. As he nears, she becomes tentative but recognizes Joe, who appears uncertain. Susan searches his face for answers. After a long pause, she responds haltingly. The Young Man smiles; they focus intently on each other as the fireworks finale lights the night."
