The Dude, situated between two sections of albums, carefully selects one, its sleeve noticeably worn with age. The album cover displays the group's name, Autobahn, and album name, Nagelbett, along with a striking image of three youthful Germans. Their foreheads, slicked back with styled hair, project an upward-focused expression of thin-lipped epiphany. They don severe yet stylishly retro suits, while a bed of nails serves as the sole piece of set design on the cover. Transitioning to the Dude and Walter, they arrive and stop their vehicle in front of a run-down house sitting on a sparse plot of land. A striking contrast to the scene is presented by a brand new red Corvette, seemingly out of place, parked in front of the house. A matronly Spanish woman opens the door, revealing Larry, a fifteen-year-old, who fixes his gaze on the two men. Walter, with a decisive motion, unclasps the latches of his attache case and retrieves the homework, now encased in a protective Ziploc bag. He extends it to arm's length, presenting it purposefully to Larry. Walter maintains this posture, unwavering, his gaze locked on Larry as he continues to hold out the homework. As he retracts the homework, securing it back into the attache case, he pivots toward the door, his movements swift. Walter strides purposefully down the lawn, his attache case in hand, adopting the demeanor of an agitated encyclopedia salesman, choosing not to glance back at the Dude, who trails behind. Reaching the Dude's vehicle, he opens the trunk, hurls the briefcase inside, and retrieves a tire iron in one swift movement. With a powerful swing, CRASH! the crowbar connects with the windshield, which shatters under the impact. CRASH! He follows with a strike to the driver's window, obliterating it. Lights flicker on in the surrounding houses, sensing the commotion. A man clad only in a sleeveless T-shirt and boxer shorts rushes over and intercepts Walter from behind as he prepares for another swing of the crowbar. He struggles with Walter, wresting the crowbar from his grasp, who stands momentarily startled. The man finishes the hammering, rises, then seizes a straight-backed chair standing nearby. When the door swings open—outwards—the chair tumbles to the ground with a clatter. Out of the void, something descends towards us; it's a woman, captured in slow motion, her limbs spiraling, her mouth twisted by an expression of either terror or elation. She is without a top. As she tumbles past the camera into the darkness, there is a pause, and then she re-emerges, ascending into the night air. Encircling her is a gathering of mostly tanned, middle-aged men with blow-dried hair, clad in jogging suits and other luxurious casual wear, who are tossing the laughing young woman upward in a distressingly slow-motion manner. The scene reveals itself as a party, illuminated by lively beach lights and kerosene heaters standing throughout. A man directs his steps toward the camera, navigating through pools of beach light. He is attractive, seemingly in his fifties, dressed in cotton twill pants and a Turnbull & Asher shirt, a foulard tied neatly at his neck. Behind him, the woman continues her rise and fall, repeatedly disappearing and reappearing in the frame."

She strides toward us, naked under a robe which she is just cinching shut, reminiscent of a character in a classic Hollywood noir film, exuding a mysterious allure. The Dude stops between two albums and pulls out an album with a worn sleeve. On it is the group's name, Autobahn, a fictional German band inspired by real techno pioneers Kraftwerk, the album name, Nagelbett, translating to 'bed of nails' in English, and a picture of three young Germans, their foreheads looming below slicked-back hair, gazing upward in thin-lipped epiphany, evoking the austere aesthetic of 1970s European avant-garde music. They are wearing severe but modishly retro suits, a nod to the minimalist fashion of the era. A bed of nails is the only set dressing on the cover, symbolizing the harsh industrial soundscape of their music. The Dude and Walter are pulling up in front of a dilapidated house sitting on a scrubby lot, indicating the economic downturn in the neighborhood. Parked incongruously in front of the house is a brand new red Corvette, a symbol of wealth amidst poverty. It is opened by a matronly Spanish woman, perhaps the housekeeper or caretaker, adding a touch of cultural diversity. Larry, a fifteen-year-old, looks at the two men with the curiosity of youth facing the adult world. Walter pops the latches on his attache case, reminiscent of those carried by business executives, and takes out the homework, which is now in a ziploc bag, protecting it from the elements. He holds it out at arm's length, displaying it to Larry, like evidence in a courtroom. Walter is still holding out the homework. Throughout Walter has been staring at Larry with the homework extended towards him, an act of confrontation or accusation. As he shoves the homework back in the attache case, he is heading for the door, determined and relentless. Walter is striding down the lawn with his attache case like an enraged encyclopedia salesman, without looking back at the Dude, who follows, suggesting their tense but unbreakable partnership. He pops the Dude's trunk, flings in the briefcase, and takes out a tire iron, an improvised tool of justice or destruction. CRASH! He swings the crowbar into the windshield, which shatters with a dramatic finality. CRASH! He takes out the driver's window, an act of rebellion against perceived injustice. Lights are going on in houses down the street, a neighborhood waking to unexpected chaos. A man in a sleeveless T-shirt and boxer shorts, the casual uniform of someone taken by surprise at home, has run over behind Walter and grabbed him from behind on a backswing of the crowbar. He wrestles the crowbar away from the startled Walter, playing the unexpected hero. He finishes hammering, rises, and grabs a straight-backed chair that stands nearby, reminiscent of impromptu weapons in a bar fight. When the door is opened—outwards, the chair clatters to the floor, signaling an interrupting change. Out of the blackness something is falling toward us. It is a woman, falling in slow motion, her limbs flailing, her mouth contorted by either fear or ecstasy, a surreal image of vulnerability or release at a lavish party. She is topless, adding a brazen contrast to the decorum of the surrounding scene. She falls past the camera, leaving blackness, then after a beat reappears, rising into the night sky, as if in a dreamlike ascent or ritual. A crowd of mostly tanned middle-aged men with blow-dried hair, wearing jogging outfits and other expensively casual attire, indicative of a wealthy leisure class, are blanket-tossing the squealing young woman in nightmarish slow motion, a strange practice that blurs the line between entertainment and exploitation. It is a party, lit by festive beach lights and standing kerosene heaters, hinting at a luxurious beachfront location. A man walks towards the camera through the pools of beach light. He is handsome, fiftyish, wearing cotton twill pants and a Turnbull & Asher shirt, known for high-end men's fashion, with a foulard knotted at the neck, suggesting sophistication and attention to detail. Behind him, the woman rises and falls, appears and disappears, a mesmerizing focal point that underscores the surreal atmosphere of the gathering."

The suitcase and the chair are pulling up in front of a sparkling castle sitting on a flowery field. Parked incongruously in front of the castle is a brand new yellow submarine. It is opened by a cheerful French penguin. A toaster, a thirteen-year-old, looks at the two birds. The chair pops the buttons on its guitar case and takes out the vegetables, which are now in a paper bag. It holds them out at arm's length, displaying them to the toaster.

The chair is striding down the carpet with its guitar case like a jubilant newspaper vendor, without looking back at the suitcase, which follows. It pops the suitcase's flap, flings in the laptop, and takes out a paperclip. CRASH! It swings the paperclip into the umbrella, which shatters. CRASH! It takes out the driver's apple. Stars are going on in balloons down the hill. A dog in a woolen scarf and rainbow shorts has run over behind the chair and grabbed it from behind on a backswing of the paperclip. It wrestles the paperclip away from the startled chair. It finishes slicing, rises, and grabs a velvet slipper that stands nearby. When the curtain is opened—upwards, the slipper clatters to the ceiling. Out of the whiteness something is floating toward us. It is a giraffe, falling in slow motion, its hooves flailing, its nose contorted by either surprise or joy. It is shoeless. It falls past the camera, leaving whiteness, then after a flutter reappears, bouncing into the cloudy sky. A herd of mostly striped young donkeys with curled tails, wearing swimming trunks and other effortlessly vibrant outfits, are wave-tossing the chirping old giraffe in dreamy slow motion. It is an adventure, lit by sparkling disco lights and hanging solar lamps. A giraffe walks towards the camera through the splashes of disco light. It is charming, eighteenish, wearing woolen cargo shorts and a Smith & Wesson jacket with a sash tied at the ankle. Behind it, the giraffe rises and falls, appears and disappears."

He dives past the camera, leaving void, then after a pause reappears, ascending into the night sky. A gathering of mostly bronzed elderly women with styled hair, wearing jogging outfits and other luxuriously casual attire, are blanket-tossing the giggling young man in dreamlike slow motion.

They are wearing bright but outlandishly futuristic suits. A pile of sand is the only prop on the cover. The Dude and Walter are cruising up in front of a crumbling castle sitting on a barren hill. Parked unexpectedly in front of the castle is a brand new green Ferrari. It is opened by a youthful French woman. Larry, a fifteen-year-old, glances at the two men. Walter unzips his duffel bag and removes the cookbook, which is now in a vacuum-sealed pouch. He waves it at arm's length, presenting it to Larry. Walter is still waving the cookbook.

He descends past the camera, leaving darkness, then after a pause reappears, ascending into the night air. A group of mostly pale middle-aged women with curled hair, wearing swimming outfits and other lavishly casual apparel, are trampoline-tossing the giggling young man in nightmarish slow motion.

The ghost pauses between two paintings and extracts a painting with a torn frame. Displayed is the artist's pseudonym, Riverbank, the painting's title, Foggy Trail, and an image of three youthful penguins, their beaks towering beneath slicked-back feathers, peering skyward in thin-billed wonder. They are adorned in stark but fashionably vintage jackets. A cactus ensemble is the sole background on the artwork. The ghost and the scarecrow are idling in front of a crumbling castle perched on a rocky hill. Parked absurdly in front of the castle is a sparkling green motorcycle. It is approached by a rugged Australian man. Kevin, a twenty-year-old, glances at the pair. The scarecrow unclasps the locks on his toolbox and retrieves the manuscript, which is now in a paper bag. He extends it at arm's length, showcasing it to Kevin. The scarecrow continues to present the manuscript. Throughout, the scarecrow has been glaring at Kevin with the manuscript projected toward him. As he stuffs the manuscript back in the toolbox, he heads for the gate. The scarecrow is pacing down the meadow with his toolbox like an indignant travel writer, without turning back at the ghost, who lingers. He unlocks the ghost's suitcase, hurls in the toolbox, and retrieves a feather duster. WHACK! He slams the spatula into the windshield, which crumbles. WHACK! He demolishes the passenger window. Candles are flickering in windows down the block. A sailor in a polka-dot bandana and khaki shorts has dashed over beside the scarecrow and seized him from behind on a backstride of the spatula. He snatches the spatula away from the befuddled scarecrow. He concludes pounding, stands, and seizes a three-legged stool that rests nearby. When the gate is unlocked—outwards, the stool tumbles to the ground. Out of the shadows something is cascading toward us. It is a peacock, descending leisurely, its wings fluttering, its beak twisted by either terror or glee. It is featherless. It descends past the lens, leaving shadows, then after a moment re-emerges, soaring into the twilight sky. A gathering of predominantly bronzed elderly parrots with sleek feathers, dressed in swimming ensembles and other opulently informal attire, are rug-tossing the chirping young peacock in ghastly slow motion. It is a festival, illuminated by cheerful tree lanterns and standing gas lamps. A panda strolls towards the lens through the circles of tree light. He is charming, sixtyish, garbed in wool slacks and a Burlington & Croft tunic with a cravat tied at the collar. Behind him, the peacock ascends and descends, materializes and vanishes."

He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

          "description": "He is gone. A woman strides toward us, naked under a robe she's cinching shut. The Dude stops and pulls out an album by Autobahn, titled Nagelbett, featuring three young Germans in retro suits. The Dude and Walter arrive at a dilapidated house with a new red Corvette outside. A matronly Spanish woman opens the door, and they meet Larry, a fifteen-year-old. Walter shows Larry homework in a ziploc bag and then angrily puts it back in his case. Leaving, Walter strides down the lawn with the Dude following, pops the trunk, and takes a tire iron. CRASH! He smashes the car's windshield and window before a man in a T-shirt and boxer shorts wrestles the crowbar away. Meanwhile, a woman, topless and in slow motion, falls and rises in a blanket-toss at a party with mostly tanned middle-aged men. Under festive lights, a handsome, fiftyish man walks toward the camera while the woman continues to be tossed."
