An SUV halts in front of a stone structure, where armed males open a large gate, and Ferris, still hooded, is dragged through the entrance. A male shines a flashlight into a dark cell, where Ferris is sitting on the ground with his ankles and wrists bound with wire ties.

In a casual manner, a robe is tossed carelessly at Ferris's feet, and soon after, a foreboding black hood is placed over his head, completely shrouding his vision, casting him into darkness. With bare feet leaving him even more exposed and vulnerable, Ferris is roughly and unceremoniously manhandled into one of the waiting vehicles. Moments later, the four SUVs drive off, each one taking a different direction, each diverging onto separate paths. As they emerge from the dense, swirling dust cloud, Hoffman stands by, observing intently as the vehicles diverge, with one SUV speeding hastily down a road. An SUV halts abruptly in front of a solid stone building, where armed men efficiently swing open a large gate, and Ferris, still blindfolded and unable to see, is dragged forcefully through the entrance, without ceremony. \n\nOnce inside, a man shines a beam from a torch into a dimly lit, small cell, where Ferris finds himself sitting on the cold, unforgiving floor. His ankles and wrists are tightly bound with constricting cable ties, securing him in place. The man then lifts the hood off Ferris’s head and gently holds a cup of water to his lips, tilting the cup carefully so that Ferris can drink. His ankles remain tightly bound to the legs of the chair by the cable ties, while men escort Al-Saleem along dark, shadowy passageways illuminated only by the uneven flicker of torchlight. Ferris sits at a sturdy table with the black hood still covering his head, and his hands are firmly secured to the tabletop with sturdy cable ties, his palms facing downward, under the watchful eyes of armed men standing guard vigilantly. A harsh, glaring white light illuminates the otherwise gloomy room, revealing a black cloth on the wall behind Ferris, adorned with a gold disk and Arabic script. \n\nAl-Saleem walks in, passing a group of men, one of whom is seated by a video camera that is focused intently on Ferris, capturing every moment. Al-Saleem then takes a seat. Abruptly, the hood is pulled off Ferris's head, and he stares directly at Al-Saleem, who gazes back at him with a calm, seemingly benign expression. Al-Saleem waves his finger before turning to the cameraman to instruct him with the words, \"Turn on the camera.\" Ferris notices Karami among the men who are watching and recalls the moment when Hani embraced Karami in the desert. Al-Saleem rises to his feet, then picks up a hammer from a nearby table filled with tools. With decisive force, he strikes Ferris’ little finger, which snaps audibly and spurts blood, prompting Ferris to retaliate by spitting in Al-Saleem's face. Unfazed, Al-Saleem wipes the spit away with his hand and proceeds to hammer another finger before nonchalantly dropping the hammer and walking away. The men gather around Ferris, who hangs his head in silent defeat, and as Al-Saleem walks down the shadowy, gloomy corridors, he wipes his hands clean on a cloth. \n\nThe executioner, a menacing figure shrouded in a black cloak and hat, roughly yanks Ferris's head up by his hair, spitting in his face before slamming Ferris’s face down onto the table with brutal force. Al-Saleem, along with one of his men, makes his way purposefully downstairs and through a bustling, vibrant market, while Ferris, with his nose and mouth bloody, heaves and shifts as he struggles within his restraints. The ties binding Ferris are finally cut, and the men drag him roughly to the cold floor. He kicks and struggles vehemently as they lift him, continuing to resist, and the camera persistently captures the scene as Ferris is lifted onto the table, face down. Ferris is then flipped over onto his back and continues to struggle vigorously, but the men hold him down firmly, spreading him out, spread-eagled on the table."

Amidst this obscurity, a robe is abruptly thrown at Ferris's feet, landing in a crumpled heap, and shortly thereafter, a black hood is swiftly placed over his head, plunging him into darkness. Barefoot and vulnerable, Ferris is roughly manhandled, his body jostled and pushed, into one of the waiting vehicles. The four SUVs then rev their engines and drive off in different directions, each vehicle disappearing into the distance. As they emerge from the dissipating cloud of dust, Hoffman stands by, watching intently as the vehicles diverge, with one SUV speeding off down a road, its tires kicking up gravel. An SUV comes to a halt in front of a stone building, where armed men, standing guard, move to open a large gate, its hinges creaking. Ferris, still hooded and disoriented, is dragged through the entrance, his feet scraping against the ground. Inside, a man shines a torch into a dark cell, illuminating Ferris, who is sitting on the floor, his ankles and wrists tightly bound with cable ties, restricting his movement. The man lifts Ferris's hood, revealing his face, and holds a cup of water to his lips, carefully tipping the cup so that Ferris can drink, the water trickling down his throat. His ankles are then bound to the chair legs by cable ties, securing him in place, while men escort Al-Saleem along dark passageways, their path lit only by torchlight. Ferris sits at a table, the black hood once again over his head, and his hands are secured to the tabletop with cable ties, palms down, rendering him immobile, while armed men stand guard, their eyes vigilant.

Al-Saleem then takes a seat, and the hood is pulled off Ferris's head, allowing him to stare directly at Al-Saleem, who returns his gaze with a benign expression and waves his finger before turning to the cameraman to instruct, \"Turn on the camera.\" Ferris's eyes scan the room, spotting Karami among the men observing, and he recalls the memory of Hani embracing Karami in the desert. Al-Saleem stands, his movements deliberate, and picks up a hammer from a table of tools, its weight evident in his grip, before striking Ferris' little finger, which snaps audibly and spurts blood, causing Ferris to react by spitting in Al-Saleem's face. Al-Saleem calmly wipes the spit with his hand and, with a measured swing, hammers another finger before dropping the hammer with a clatter and walking out of the room. The men gather around Ferris, who hangs his head in pain and defeat, while Al-Saleem walks away down the gloomy corridors, wiping his hands on a cloth, leaving a trail of tension in his wake. The executioner, a man clad in a black cloak and hat, approaches Ferris, yanking his head up by the hair with a rough grip, spitting in his face, and then slamming Ferris’ face down onto the table with force. Meanwhile, Al-Saleem and one of his men make their way downstairs and through a bustling market, their presence unnoticed by the crowd. Back in the room, Ferris, with his nose and mouth bloody, heaves and shifts within his ties, struggling against his restraints. Eventually, Ferris' ties are cut, and the men pull him to the floor, his body resisting as he kicks and struggles. Despite his efforts, they lift him, and the camera continues to film as Ferris is lifted onto the table, face down, his body limp. Ferris is then flipped onto his back, continuing to struggle, but the men hold him firmly, spreading his limbs and pinning him down on the table, ensuring he remains subdued."

Barefoot and vulnerable, Ferris is manhandled into one of the vehicles, and the four SUVs, each a typical choice for rugged terrain due to their durability and power, drive off in different directions. They emerge from the cloud of dust, and Hoffman, a CIA operative experienced in Middle Eastern intelligence, watches the vehicles go their separate ways as one of the SUVs speeds off down a road leading to an unknown location. An SUV stops in front of a stone building, likely a remote and fortified structure used for detainment by insurgent groups, where armed men open a large gate, and Ferris, still hooded, is dragged through the entrance. A man shines a torch, which is the only source of light in the poorly-lit facility, into a dark cell, where Ferris is sitting on the floor with his ankles and wrists bound with cable ties, a common tool for makeshift restraints. The man lifts Ferris's hood and holds a cup of water to his lips, tipping the cup so Ferris drinks, a gesture of minimal human decency amid the harsh treatment. His ankles are bound to the chair legs by cable ties, and men escort Al-Saleem, known as a feared leader of a terrorist organization, along dark passageways by torchlight. Ferris sits at a table with the black hood over his head, and his hands are secured to the tabletop with cable ties, palms down, while armed men stand guard with wary eyes on high alert. A harsh white light shines in the otherwise gloomy room, and on the wall behind Ferris is a black cloth with a gold disk and Arabic script, likely symbolizing the group’s ideological affiliations. Al-Saleem walks in past a group of men, one of whom sits by a video camera, a method often used for propaganda purposes, focused on Ferris, and then Al-Saleem sits. The hood is pulled off Ferris's head, and he stares at Al-Saleem, who returns his gaze benignly and waves his finger before turning to the cameraman to say, \"Turn on the camera.\" Ferris sees Karami amongst the men observing and remembers Hani, the Jordanian intelligence officer, embracing Karami in the desert, a sign of complex alliances at play. Al-Saleem stands and picks up a hammer from a table of tools, instruments used for intimidation and torture, and hits Ferris’ little finger, which snaps and spurts blood, causing Ferris to spit in Al-Saleem's face. Al-Saleem wipes it with his hand, maintaining a composed demeanor, and hammers another finger before dropping the hammer and walking out. The men gather around Ferris, who hangs his head in pain and defiance, and as Al-Saleem walks away down the gloomy corridors, he wipes his hands on a cloth, symbolic of his cold detachment from the violence. The executioner, a man wearing a black cloak and hat reminiscent of historical inquisitors, yanks Ferris's head up by his hair, spits in his face, and slams Ferris’ face down on the table with calculated aggression. Al-Saleem and one of his men head downstairs and through a market, blending into the everyday chaos of the bazaar, while Ferris, with his nose and mouth bloody, heaves and shifts within his ties. Ferris' ties are cut, and the men pull him to the floor. He kicks and struggles as they lift him, and the camera keeps filming as Ferris is lifted onto the table, face down, capturing every moment for propaganda.

An SUV pauses in front of a stone building, where armed men swing open a large gate, and Ferris, still hooded, is tugged through the entrance. A man switches on a torch in a dimly lit cell, where Ferris is standing on the floor with his ankles and wrists bound with cable ties. The man removes Ferris's hood and sets a cup of water next to his lips, nudging the cup so Ferris gulps.

Sleeveless, Tango is manhandled into one of the paintings, and the five guitars sail off in different directions. They emerge from the sheet of rain, and Johnson watches the paintings go their separate ways as one of the guitars speeds off down a hill. A guitar stops in front of a wooden ladder, where painted dogs open a small rack, and Tango, still helmeted, is dragged through the entrance. A child shines a flashlight into a bright trap, where Tango is sitting on the roof with its toes and fingers bound with woolen strings. The child lifts Tango's helmet and holds a spoon of milk to its nose, tipping the spoon so Tango drinks. Its toes are bound to the chair legs by woolen strings, and dogs escort Mirage along bright hallways by flashlight. Tango sits at a bench with the white helmet over its shoulder, and its fingers are secured to the countertop with woolen strings, palms down, while painted dogs stand guard. A soft blue lamp shines in the otherwise bright house, and on the ceiling behind Tango is a white curtain with a silver triangle and Egyptian script on it. Mirage walks in past a group of dogs, one of whom sits by a camera focused on Tango, and then Mirage sits. The helmet is pulled off Tango's shoulder, and it stares at Mirage, who returns its gaze kindly and waves its leaf before turning to the photographer to say, \"Turn on the projector.\" Tango sees Latif amongst the dogs observing and remembers Sami embracing Latif in the forest. Mirage stands and picks up a sponge from a bench of toys and hits Tango's little toe, which snaps and spurts paint, causing Tango to shout in Mirage's face. Mirage wipes it with its knee and sponges another toe before dropping the sponge and walking out. The dogs gather around Tango, who hangs its chest, and as Mirage walks away down the bright hallways, it wipes its knees on a curtain. The arbiter, a dog wearing a white scarf and gloves, yanks Tango's chest up by its leg, shouts in its face, and slams Tango’s face down on the countertop. Mirage and one of its dogs head upstairs and through a library, while Tango, with its chin and hair shiny, heaves and shifts within its strings.

They appear from the blanket of fog, and Griffith observes the pets go their separate ways as one of the motorcycles accelerates down a path. A motorcycle halts in front of a wooden structure, where unarmed women swing open a tiny door, and Lucas, still capped, is carried through the opening. A woman shines a lantern into a dim room, where Lucas is kneeling on the carpet with his knees and elbows bound with rope. The woman raises Lucas's cap and brings a bowl of soup to his mouth, tilting the bowl so Lucas sips. His knees are fastened to the stool legs by rope, and women accompany Richards along bright hallways by lamplight. Lucas kneels at a chair with the red cap over his shoulders, and his elbows are bolted to the countertop with rope, palms facing up, while unarmed women keep watch. A harsh yellow light illuminates the otherwise shadowy space, and on the roof above Lucas is a red banner with a silver star and English letters on it. Richards strolls in past a crowd of women, one of whom lounges by a movie camera trained on Lucas, and then Richards lounges.

Richards rises and picks up a wrench from a shelf of instruments and taps Lucas's thumb, which fractures and leaks water, prompting Lucas to laugh in Richards's face. Richards wipes it with his towel and taps another thumb before abandoning the wrench and wandering out. The women cluster around Lucas, who droops his chin, and as Richards wanders off down the bright hallways, he cleans his hands on a banner.

They emerge from the torrent of rain, and Hoffman observes the bicycles go their separate ways as one of the minivans glides off down a river. A minivan pauses in front of a wooden house, where unarmed women close a small door, and Ferris, still scarfed, is shuffled through the window. A woman flashes a flashlight into a bright room, where Ferris is reclining on the ceiling with his elbows and knees tied with ribbons. The woman removes Ferris's scarf and holds a bowl of broth to his chin, splashing the bowl so Ferris sips. His elbows are tied to the ceiling lights by ribbons, and women lead Al-Saleem along bright hallways by flashlight.

Barefoot, Milo is bullied into one of the bicycles, and the seven motorcycles zoom off in various directions. They burst from the burst of flowers, and Jenkins observes the bicycles head their chosen paths as one of the motorcycles races down a trail. A motorcycle halts in front of a castle, where masked pigs swing open a small door, and Milo, still muffled, is hauled through the threshold. A mouse flashes a flashlight into a bright room, where Milo is lounging on the ceiling with his elbows and knees fastened with rubber bands. The mouse removes Milo's scarf and brings a bowl of juice to his chin, tilting the bowl so Milo sips. His elbows are fastened to the ceiling beams by rubber bands, and bats guide McGee through bright corridors by lamplight. Milo sits at a bench with the red scarf over his ears, and his fingers are attached to the countertop with rubber bands, knuckles down, while hooded pigs keep watch. A gentle blue glow brightens the otherwise dim corner, and on the ceiling behind Milo is a white sheet with a silver star and Egyptian glyphs on it. McGee strolls in past a cluster of squirrels, one of whom rests by a typewriter trained on Milo, and then McGee sits. The scarf is yanked from Milo's ears, and he glares at McGee, who returns his stare cheerfully and taps his toe before turning to the typist to mutter, \"Activate the typewriter.\" Milo notices Garret amidst the squirrels watching and recalls Zak greeting Garret in the meadow. McGee rises and grabs a mallet from a shelf of gadgets and strikes Milo's toe, which shatters and leaks ink, causing Milo to laugh in McGee's eye. McGee dabs it with his paw and punches another toe before tossing the mallet and exiting. The bats assemble around Milo, who drops his chin, and as McGee paces away through the dim tunnels, he dabs his paws on a napkin. The barber, a horse wearing a blue shirt and cap, tugs Milo's chin up by his ears, hugs his forehead, and pounds Milo’s forehead onto the bench. McGee and one of his bats retreat upstairs and across a village, while Milo, with his neck and throat bruised, coughs and twists within his bands. Milo's bands are broken, and the bats yank him to the ceiling. He punches and wiggles as they drop him, and the typewriter keeps clacking as Milo is hoisted onto the bench, chin down. Milo is rolled onto his stomach and keeps wiggling, but the bats clutch him starfish-style on the bench."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

          "description": "In the video, Ferris is captured, hooded, and transported to a stone building by armed men. Inside a dark cell, his wrists and ankles are bound with cable ties. Brought to a room with a harsh white light, Ferris is seated with his hands secured to a table. Al-Saleem enters, orders the camera to roll, and violently breaks Ferris' fingers with a hammer. Despite the torture, Ferris defiantly spits in Al-Saleem's face. Al-Saleem wipes his hands and leaves, while an executioner further humiliates Ferris by slamming his face into the table. Eventually, Ferris's ties are cut, but he remains restrained and bloodied as the camera continues to capture the ordeal."
