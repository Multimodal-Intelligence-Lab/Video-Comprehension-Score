  "ground_truth": "Pippin looks on in frightened awe as Sam and Gollum lead Frodo to the stairs. Above Minas Morgul, the sky is bright with light as the city erupts. Faces of soldiers and civilians of Minas Tirith watch from the parapets of the city as Frodo and Sam sink to the ground, holding their hands against their ears, as out of the city comes a rending screech, shivering and rising swiftly to a piercing pitch beyond the range of hearing. The terrible cry ends, falling back through a long sickening wail to silence. Frodo squeezes his eyes shut, clutching at his shirt as if it's on fire. The cavernous gate of Minas Morgul swings open, and a huge army marches out—rank upon rank of armor-clad orcs moving swiftly and silently, passing close to Frodo and Sam in an endless stream of ragged columns. Seventy-five thousand orcs march to war, just below Frodo, while Frodo, Sam, and Gollum climb the stony stairs high above the marching army. Gandalf is thinking and calculating as he strides through the back streets of the city so determined and purposeful that Pippin has to run to keep up. Gandalf suddenly stops and looks down at Pippin, kneels down, and looks at Pippin earnestly, his hand on Pippin's shoulder, before watching as Pippin hurries away. An ancient stone bridge spans the ruins of east and west Osgiliath—a once mighty Gondorian city. Ithilien Rangers patrol the bridge, and the west Osgiliath has fallen into disrepair, but the desolation of east Osgiliath is more pronounced—it is held by the forces of Mordor. The camera tracks down beneath the bridge to the dark waters, catching a stealthy movement. Many boats carrying murderous-looking orcs are quietly tracking down the river, with several hunched figures on board steering with long oars. Faramir, Captain of Gondor, issues orders to his soldiers. The Ithilien Rangers take position; they are all weathered, hardened, professional soldiers, watchful, ready, and waiting. On the river, the boats quietly advance, and Faramir and his soldiers lie in wait. As the boats arrive, hundreds of orcs race ashore, and Faramir steps out, his sword drawn. A fierce battle ensues, but Faramir is unable to stop the advance as hundreds of orcs cross the wide bridge into west Osgiliath. A dizzying view looks down on Minas Tirith, 1000 feet below, as Pippin desperately scrambles up the rocky mountainside, clambers over a rocky ledge, and ducks behind a stone wall, panting heavily. An ancient stone ledge holds a great pile of firewood, secured in stacked bundles. Gandalf waits tensely below as Pippin stealthily manages to pour oil on the wood and set a flame to it. Within seconds, the great pyre is alight, and the guards look on in total surprise as the flames erupt into the twilight sky.",

          "description": "Pippin observes on in frightened amazement as Sam and Gollum guide Frodo to the stairway. Above Minas Morgul, the sky is luminous with radiance as the metropolis explodes. Visages of warriors and civilians of Minas Tirith gaze from the parapets of the metropolis as Frodo and Sam descend to the earth, holding their hands against their ears, as out of the metropolis comes a rending shriek, trembling and rising swiftly to a piercing pitch beyond the spectrum of perception. The dreadful wail concludes, dropping back through a prolonged nauseating moan to stillness. Frodo squeezes his eyes shut, grasping at his garment as if it's on fire. The cavernous portal of Minas Morgul swings open, and a massive legion marches out—rank upon rank of armor-clad orcs advancing swiftly and silently, passing near to Frodo and Sam in an endless stream of tattered columns. Seventy-five thousand orcs march to conflict, just below Frodo, while Frodo, Sam, and Gollum ascend the stony stairway high above the advancing legion. Gandalf is reflecting and calculating as he strides through the rear avenues of the metropolis so determined and purposeful that Pippin has to sprint to keep up. Gandalf suddenly pauses and gazes down at Pippin, kneels down, and gazes at Pippin earnestly, his hand on Pippin's shoulder, before observing as Pippin hastens away. An ancient stone span bridges the ruins of east and west Osgiliath—a once mighty Gondorian metropolis. Ithilien Rangers patrol the span, and the west Osgiliath has declined into neglect, but the desolation of east Osgiliath is more pronounced—it is held by the forces of Mordor. The lens follows down beneath the span to the dark waters, catching a stealthy motion. Many vessels carrying murderous-looking orcs are quietly tracking down the river, with several hunched figures on board steering with long oars. Faramir, Captain of Gondor, issues orders to his warriors. The Ithilien Rangers take position; they are all weathered, hardened, professional warriors, vigilant, ready, and waiting. On the river, the vessels quietly progress, and Faramir and his warriors lie in ambush. As the vessels arrive, hundreds of orcs charge ashore, and Faramir steps out, his sword drawn. A fierce skirmish ensues, but Faramir is unable to halt the progress as hundreds of orcs traverse the broad span into west Osgiliath. A dizzying view gazes down on Minas Tirith, 1000 feet below, as Pippin frantically scrambles up the rocky mountainside, climbs over a rocky ledge, and ducks behind a stone wall, panting heavily. An ancient stone ledge holds a great heap of firewood, secured in stacked bundles. Gandalf waits tensely below as Pippin stealthily manages to pour oil on the timber and set a flame to it. Within seconds, the great pyre is ablaze, and the sentries gaze on in total surprise as the flames explode into the twilight sky."

Soldiers and civilians of Minas Tirith watch faces from the parapets of the city as Frodo and Sam are sunk to the ground, their hands held against their ears, as a rending screech comes out of the city, shivering and rising swiftly to a piercing pitch beyond the range of hearing. The terrible cry is ended, falling back through a long sickening wail to silence. Frodo's eyes are squeezed shut by him, his shirt clutched at as if it's on fire. The cavernous gate of Minas Morgul is swung open, and an army is marched out by a huge number of armor-clad orcs moving swiftly and silently, passing close to Frodo and Sam in an endless stream of ragged columns. Seventy-five thousand orcs are marched to war, just below Frodo, while the stony stairs are climbed high above the marching army by Frodo, Sam, and Gollum. Gandalf thinks and calculates as the back streets of the city are strided through by him so determined and purposeful that Pippin has to run to keep up. Pippin is looked down at by Gandalf who suddenly stops, kneels down, and looks at Pippin earnestly, his hand placed on Pippin's shoulder, before Pippin is watched as he hurries away. An ancient stone bridge is spanned by the ruins of east and west Osgiliath—a once mighty Gondorian city. The bridge is patrolled by Ithilien Rangers, and the west Osgiliath has been fallen into disrepair, but the desolation of east Osgiliath is pronounced more by the forces of Mordor who hold it.

Above the dark and foreboding city of Minas Morgul, the sky is illuminated with a bright, almost blinding light as the city itself erupts with activity. The faces of both soldiers and civilians from the city of Minas Tirith are visible, watching intently from the parapets of their city. They observe as Frodo and Sam sink to the ground, pressing their hands tightly against their ears in a desperate attempt to block out the sound. From the city comes a rending screech, a sound so shivering and rising so swiftly that it reaches a piercing pitch beyond the range of normal hearing.

Frodo squeezes his eyes shut tightly, clutching at his shirt as if it were on fire, trying to steady himself.

His eyes are wide open, filled with a complex blend of fear and wonder, as he watches the determined figures of Sam and Gollum lead Frodo toward the ominous and foreboding stairs. Above the shadowy and threatening city of Minas Morgul, the sky is suddenly illuminated with a bright, almost blinding light as the city itself bursts into a flurry of activity and noise. The anxious faces of both soldiers and civilians, people from the noble city of Minas Tirith, are visible, watching intently and with great concern from the parapets of their fortified city. They closely observe as Frodo and Sam sink down to the ground, pressing their hands tightly against their ears in a desperate attempt to block out the intense and overwhelming sound. From the heart of the city comes a rending screech, a sound so bone-chilling and shivering that it rises swiftly to a piercing high pitch, beyond the range of normal human hearing. This terrible and blood-curdling cry eventually comes to an end, falling back through a prolonged, sickening wail until it fades into an uneasy silence. Frodo squeezes his eyes shut tightly, clutching at his shirt as if it were engulfed in flames, trying to steady himself amidst the chaos. The massive, cavernous gate of Minas Morgul swings open with a slow, foreboding creak, and a tremendous army of orcs begins to march out in seemingly endless ranks. Rank upon rank of armor-clad orcs move with swift, silent steps, passing dangerously close to Frodo and Sam in an unending stream of ragged and formidable columns. Seventy-five thousand orcs are on the move, marching to war just below where Frodo, Sam, and Gollum are cautiously climbing the steep, stony stairs high above the marching army below. Meanwhile, Gandalf is consumed in deep thought, calculating every possibility and strategizing carefully as he strides purposefully through the winding back streets of the city. He moves with such unwavering determination and focused purpose that Pippin has to run quickly to keep up with him. Suddenly, Gandalf stops abruptly, looks down at Pippin with a piercing gaze, kneels down, and gazes at him earnestly, placing a reassuring hand on Pippin's shoulder before watching as Pippin hurries away on his important mission. An ancient stone bridge stretches across the expanse of the ruins of east and west Osgiliath—once a mighty and thriving city of Gondor that now lies in partial ruin. Ithilien Rangers vigilantly patrol the bridge, and while the west Osgiliath has tragically fallen into disrepair, the desolation of east Osgiliath is even more pronounced, as it is under the oppressive control of the dark forces of Mordor. The camera tracks down beneath the bridge to the dark and swirling waters below, capturing a stealthy movement emerging from the shadows. Many boats, filled with orcs bearing murderous expressions, are quietly making their way down the river with deadly intent, with several hunched, sinister-looking figures on board skillfully steering with long, menacing oars. Faramir, the brave Captain of Gondor, issues his commands to his soldiers with authoritative precision. The Ithilien Rangers, experienced and battle-hardened professional soldiers, take their positions with seasoned vigilance; they are watchful, ready, and waiting for the inevitable impending battle. On the river, the boats continue to advance quietly, and Faramir and his soldiers lie in wait, fully prepared for the confrontation. As the boats finally arrive, hundreds of orcs race ashore, and Faramir steps out with resolve, his sword drawn, ready for the intense combat ahead. A fierce and brutal battle ensues, but despite their valiant efforts, Faramir and his men are unable to stop the relentless advance as hundreds of orcs rapidly cross the wide bridge into the vulnerable west Osgiliath. A dizzying view looks down from a great height on Minas Tirith, 1000 feet below, as Pippin desperately scrambles up the steep and rocky mountainside, clambering over a rocky ledge and ducking behind a protective stone wall, panting heavily from the exertion of his climb. An ancient stone ledge holds a great pile of firewood, secured in carefully stacked bundles. Gandalf waits tensely below, his eyes fixed on the crucial task at hand. Pippin stealthily manages to pour oil on the wood and set a flame to it. Within mere seconds, the great pyre is ablaze, and the guards look on in total shock and surprise as the flames erupt into the twilight sky, casting a fiery and dramatic glow over the scene."

Above the ominous city of Minas Morgul, the sky is illuminated with an eerie brightness as the city itself seems to explode with activity. Meanwhile, the faces of soldiers and civilians in Minas Tirith are fixed in a tense gaze from the parapets, observing the distant figures of Frodo and Sam as they collapse to the ground. They press their hands tightly against their ears, trying to block out the horrific sound that emanates from the city—a screech that begins with a shivering intensity and swiftly escalates to a piercing pitch that surpasses the limits of human hearing. This dreadful cry eventually subsides, descending into a long, sickening wail before fading into silence. Frodo, overwhelmed by the experience, squeezes his eyes shut and clutches at his shirt as if it were ablaze. At that moment, the massive gate of Minas Morgul creaks open, revealing a formidable army. Rank upon rank of orcs, clad in armor, march out with swift, silent precision, their ragged columns passing perilously close to Frodo and Sam. As seventy-five thousand orcs advance towards war, Frodo, Sam, and Gollum begin their ascent up the stony stairs, climbing high above the relentless march of the army below. In another part of the city, Gandalf strides purposefully through the back streets, his mind racing with thoughts and calculations. His pace is so determined that Pippin struggles to keep up, breaking into a run. Suddenly, Gandalf halts, turns to Pippin, and kneels down to meet his gaze. With a hand placed reassuringly on Pippin's shoulder, Gandalf looks at him earnestly before watching Pippin hurry away. Meanwhile, an ancient stone bridge stretches across the ruins of east and west Osgiliath, a once-mighty city of Gondor. Ithilien Rangers patrol the bridge, their presence a stark contrast to the dilapidated state of west Osgiliath, while the desolation of east Osgiliath is even more pronounced, held captive by the forces of Mordor. The camera pans down beneath the bridge to the dark, foreboding waters, capturing the stealthy movement of boats. These vessels, filled with orcs bearing murderous expressions, glide silently down the river, steered by several hunched figures wielding long oars. Faramir, the Captain of Gondor, issues commands to his soldiers, the Ithilien Rangers, who take their positions with the seasoned vigilance of weathered, professional soldiers, ready and waiting. As the boats draw nearer, Faramir and his men lie in ambush. When the boats finally reach the shore, hundreds of orcs race onto the land, prompting Faramir to step forward, his sword drawn, ready for battle. A fierce confrontation ensues, but despite their efforts, Faramir and his soldiers are unable to halt the orcs' advance as they swarm across the wide bridge into west Osgiliath. Meanwhile, a dizzying view reveals Minas Tirith, a thousand feet below, as Pippin desperately scrambles up the rocky mountainside. He clambers over a rocky ledge and ducks behind a stone wall, panting heavily from the exertion. Nearby, an ancient stone ledge supports a great pile of firewood, meticulously secured in stacked bundles. Below, Gandalf waits with tense anticipation as Pippin stealthily pours oil over the wood and strikes a flame. Within moments, the great pyre ignites, and the guards look on in utter surprise as the flames leap into the twilight sky, casting a fiery glow over the scene."

Above the sinister fortress of Minas Morgul, which serves as a bastion for Sauron's forces, the sky is bright with light as the city erupts with dark energy. Faces of soldiers and civilians of Minas Tirith, the last stronghold of men and capital city of Gondor, watch from the parapets of the city as Frodo and Sam sink to the ground, holding their hands against their ears, as out of the city comes a rending screech, the war cry of the Nazgûl, shivering and rising swiftly to a piercing pitch beyond the range of hearing. The terrible cry ends, falling back through a long sickening wail to silence. Frodo squeezes his eyes shut, clutching at his shirt as if it's on fire, struggling with the unbearable weight of the Ring. The cavernous gate of Minas Morgul swings open, and a huge army marches out—rank upon rank of armor-clad orcs, creatures bred by Sauron for war, moving swiftly and silently, passing close to Frodo and Sam in an endless stream of ragged columns. Seventy-five thousand orcs, a number unprecedented in the War of the Ring, march to war, just below Frodo, while Frodo, Sam, and Gollum climb the stony stairs known as the Stairs of Cirith Ungol high above the marching army. Gandalf, the wise and powerful wizard known as Mithrandir to the Elves, is thinking and calculating as he strides through the back streets of the city so determined and purposeful that Pippin has to run to keep up. Gandalf suddenly stops and looks down at Pippin, kneels down, and looks at Pippin earnestly, his hand on Pippin's shoulder, before watching as Pippin hurries away.

The camera tracks down beneath the bridge to the dark waters, catching a stealthy movement. Many boats carrying murderous-looking orcs, twisted creatures of hate, are quietly tracking down the river, with several hunched figures on board steering with long oars.

Faces of soldiers and civilians of Minas Tirith observe from the walls of the city as Frodo and Sam collapse to the ground, shielding their eyes as out of the city comes a rumbling chant, descending and dropping slowly to a gentle hum beyond the range of hearing. The terrible cry concludes, receding back through a brief gentle murmur to stillness. Frodo opens his eyes wide, grasping at his shirt as if it's freezing. The cavernous gate of Minas Morgul slams shut, and a gigantic army retreats—row upon row of armor-clad orcs moving leisurely and hushed, passing far from Frodo and Sam in an unbroken line of neat columns. Seventy-five thousand orcs retreat from conflict, just above Frodo, while Frodo, Sam, and Gollum descend the stony stairs low below the retreating army. Gandalf is pondering and hesitating as he strolls through the main streets of the city so relaxed and aimless that Pippin strolls leisurely to catch up. Gandalf quickly moves and glances up at Pippin, stands tall, and gazes at Pippin dismissively, his hand away from Pippin's shoulder, before observing as Pippin strolls away. A modern stone bridge traverses the structures of north and south Osgiliath—a once thriving Gondorian city. Ithilien Rangers abandon the bridge, and the east Osgiliath has blossomed into prosperity, but the affluence of west Osgiliath is more subtle—it is held by allies of Gondor. The camera moves up above the bridge to the bright waters, capturing a noisy disturbance. Many boats carrying friendly-looking orcs are loudly floating up the river, with several upright figures on board rowing with short paddles. Faramir, Captain of Gondor, listens to orders from his soldiers. The Ithilien Rangers abandon position; they are all youthful, inexperienced, amateur soldiers, careless, relaxed, and unwary. On the river, the boats noisily recede, and Faramir and his soldiers rise to depart. As the boats leave, hundreds of orcs flee the shore, and Faramir steps back, his sword sheathed. A peaceful negotiation ensues, but Faramir is able to halt the retreat as hundreds of orcs block the narrow bridge into east Osgiliath. A calming view looks up to Minas Tirith, 1000 feet above, as Pippin calmly descends the smooth mountainside, slides over a grassy ledge, and lounges beside a stone pillar, breathing steadily. An ancient stone shelf holds a small heap of firewood, scattered in loose piles. Gandalf watches patiently above as Pippin boldly manages to pour water on the wood and extinguish it.

Faces of bakers and travelers of Willa's Town watch from the ramparts of the village as Marvin and Tony slump to the soil, pressing their knees against their elbows, as out of the village comes a tearing whistle, trembling and rising swiftly to a shrill note beyond the scope of perception. The dreadful wail concludes, descending back through a long nauseating howl to quiet. Marvin shuts his lips tight, grasping at his scarf as if it's ablaze. The vast tower of Willa's Fortress swings open, and a massive squad marches forth—line upon line of armor-clad goblins moving swiftly and quietly, passing near Marvin and Tony in an unending stream of tattered lines. Seventy-five thousand goblins march to fight, just below Marvin, while Marvin, Tony, and Zippy ascend the rocky ladders high above the marching squad. Merlin is pondering and counting as he strides through the back paths of the village so resolute and determined that Rinco has to dash to keep pace. Merlin abruptly halts and gazes down at Rinco, crouches down, and gazes at Rinco intently, his hand on Rinco's elbow, before observing as Rinco rushes away. An ancient timber bridge arches over the ruins of north and south Balintown—a once powerful Glendrian village. Skara Archers patrol the bridge, and the south Balintown has crumbled into neglect, but the devastation of north Balintown is more distinct—it is occupied by the troops of Zandor. The lens tracks down beneath the bridge to the dark waves, spotting a furtive shift. Many rafts carrying villainous-looking goblins are quietly floating down the creek, with several crouched figures on board steering with lengthy poles. Devlin, Leader of Glenwood, issues commands to his archers. The Skara Archers take stance; they are all seasoned, rugged, expert archers, vigilant, poised, and prepared. On the creek, the rafts quietly proceed, and Devlin and his archers lie in ambush. As the rafts land, hundreds of goblins charge the shore, and Devlin steps forth, his dagger unsheathed. A furious clash breaks out, but Devlin is unable to halt the progress as hundreds of goblins traverse the broad bridge into south Balintown. A dizzying perspective looks down on Willa's Town, 1000 meters below, as Rinco frantically climbs up the craggy hillside, scrambles over a craggy ridge, and crouches behind a stone barricade, gasping deeply. An ancient timber ridge holds a great heap of lumber, secured in stacked bundles. Merlin waits tensely below as Rinco furtively manages to pour sap on the lumber and ignite it. Within moments, the great pyre is blazing, and the sentinels look on in utter astonishment as the inferno erupts into the dusk sky."

Faces of merchants and farmers of Bree observe from the rooftops of the town as Aragorn and Legolas tumble to the ground, clasping their hands over their mouths, as out of the village comes a booming roar, echoing and climbing steadily to a deafening tone beyond the brink of sound. The dreadful shout fades, dropping back through a prolonged mournful howl to stillness. Aragorn opens his eyes wide, gripping his cloak as if it's turning to ice. The iron gates of Helm's Deep creak open, and a vast host marches in—line upon line of cloak-draped goblins moving lazily and noisily, passing near to Aragorn and Legolas in a constant wave of battered platoons. Eighty thousand goblins march to feast, close to Aragorn, while Aragorn, Legolas, and the troll descend the muddy hill far below the stagnant crowd. Boromir is dreaming and planning as he strides along the main roads of the village so anxiously and erratically that Merry has to skip to catch up. Boromir suddenly halts and glances up at Merry, crouches down, and gazes at Merry sincerely, his hand on Merry's wrist, before nodding as Merry hurries on. An ancient wooden bridge crosses the ruins of north and south Beleriand—a once grand Dwarven city. Woodland Elves guard the bridge, and the south Beleriand has become pristine, but the beauty of north Beleriand is more striking—it is protected by the forces of Rivendell. The camera pans up above the bridge to the bright skies, following a steady movement. Several ships carrying friendly-looking elves are openly gliding up the river, with numerous standing figures on deck rowing with large paddles. Éomer, Marshall of the Rohirrim, gives advice to his warriors. The Woodland Elves hold position; they are all fresh, eager, untested warriors, patient, prepared, and observing. Along the river, the ships openly progress, and Éomer and his warriors sit in anticipation. As the ships anchor, dozens of elves march inland, and Éomer leaps forward, his axe raised. A wild skirmish unfolds, but Éomer is able to halt the retreat as dozens of elves rush back across the narrow bridge out of south Beleriand. A sweeping perspective gazes up at Edoras, 500 feet above, as Merry calmly ambles down the grassy hillside, tiptoes over a wooden railing, and peeks from behind a tree, breathing quietly. An ancient wooden platform supports a great heap of hay, bundled in tied bales. Boromir waits expectantly above as Merry boldly manages to scatter water on the hay and extinguish it. Within moments, the great pyre is smoldering, and the villagers stand in quiet astonishment as the smoke dissipates into the morning air."

Faces of merchants and travelers of Minas Tirith gaze from the towers of the city as Frodo and Sam rise to the air, covering their mouths with their hands, as out of the city comes a booming whisper, twisting and falling slowly to a low hum beyond the realm of perception. The haunting sound begins, soaring up through a short joyful song to noise. Frodo blinks his eyes open, tugging at his cloak as if it's drenched. The hidden door of Minas Morgul slams shut, and a tiny group saunters in—row upon row of robe-clad elves moving slowly and loudly, strolling far from Frodo and Sam in a scattered stream of neat formations. Seventy-five hundred elves march to peace, just above Frodo, while Frodo, Sam, and Gollum descend the sandy ladders low below the resting group. Gandalf is pondering and counting as he floats through the front streets of the city so hurried and aimless that Pippin has to stroll to keep up. Gandalf suddenly rushes and glances up at Pippin, stands up, and glances at Pippin distractedly, his hand on Pippin’s ankle, before listening as Pippin ambles away. A modern metal tower stretches across the buildings of east and west Osgiliath—a once vibrant Gondorian village. Ithilien Rangers guard the tower, and the west Osgiliath has been restored with repairs, but the bustling of east Osgiliath is less obvious—it is protected by the allies of Mordor. The camera moves up above the tower to the clear skies, catching a loud disturbance. Many planes carrying joyful-looking elves are noisily rising through the air, with several standing figures on board waving with short wands. Faramir, Captain of Gondor, whispers orders to his crew. The Ithilien Rangers hold position; they are all inexperienced, gentle, curious farmers, distracted, unprepared, and listening. In the sky, the planes noisily retreat, and Faramir and his crew march away. As the planes leave, hundreds of elves fly away, and Faramir steps back, his shield carried. A gentle drizzle prevails, but Faramir is able to halt the retreat as hundreds of elves leave the narrow tower out of west Osgiliath. A calming view looks up at Minas Tirith, 1000 feet above, as Pippin calmly descends the flat valley, slides under a grassy slope, and rests beside a wooden fence, singing softly. An ancient wooden fence holds a small pile of hay, scattered in random heaps. Gandalf rests calmly above as Pippin boldly manages to spill water on the hay and blow a breeze at it. Within minutes, the small heap is soaking, and the animals glance around in mild curiosity as the water pools into the morning ground."

Eyes of sailors and villagers of Zara's Reach peek from the towers of the valley as Finn and Ted float to the ceiling, pressing their feet against their knees, as out of the valley comes a whispering hum, trembling and soaring gently to a muted tune beyond the scope of feeling. The gentle tune halts, sliding forward through a brief delightful melody to chatter. Finn blinks his eyes open, tugging at his pants as if they're freezing. The narrow arch of Zara's Burrow slams shut, and a tiny crew skips in—line by line of robe-wrapped goblins floating quietly and loudly, stopping far from Finn and Ted in a rare stream of tidy clusters. Fifty-three goblins hop to rest, just above Finn, while Finn, Ted, and Blix slide the sandy ladders low below the hopping crew. Harriet is glancing and guessing as she skips around the front paths of the valley so aimlessly and listlessly that Milo has to crawl to catch up. Harriet suddenly leaps and listens up at Milo, twirls up, and listens at Milo distractedly, her arm at Milo's elbow, after listening as Milo dances near. A shiny brick arch crosses the walls of north and south Tinseltown—a never puny Draconian metropolis. Avalon Knights march the arch, and the north Tinseltown has repaired into maintenance, yet the construction of south Tinseltown is less subtle—it is abandoned by the rebels of Avalon. The satellite zooms up above the arch to the bright skies, missing a noisy stillness. Several balloons dropping cheerful-sounding pixies are loudly gliding up the canyon, with many crouching giants on shore kicking with short toes. Marcellus, King of Draco, whispers requests to his rebels. The Avalon Knights flee direction; they are all youthful, inexperienced, clumsy rebels, careless, unsteady, and leaving. In the air, the balloons loudly fall, and Marcellus and his rebels rise from sleep. Before the balloons vanish, dozens of pixies dive underwater, and Marcellus rests in, his shield hidden. A gentle peace resumes, yet Marcellus is able to commence the retreat as dozens of pixies jump the narrow arch out of south Tinseltown. A steadying gaze glances up at Zara's Reach, 600 inches above, as Milo calmly slides down the dusty meadow, slithers under a dusty crack, and pops below a wooden gate, whispering softly. A shiny brick crack holds a tiny stack of hay, squandered in tangled heaps. Harriet hides sleepily above as Milo loudly fails to pour honey under the hay and suffocate a whisper to them. Beyond hours, the tiny whispers are cold, and the knights ignore in complete curiosity as the whispers fizzle into the morning air."

He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

The sky above Minas Morgul lights up as Frodo and Sam, covering their ears, hear a piercing screech from the city. Frodo clutches his shirt in fear as the city's gate opens, and a massive army of orcs marches out silently below him. Meanwhile, Gandalf, deep in thought, strides purposefully through the city streets with Pippin struggling to keep up. After a brief exchange, Pippin hurries off. In Osgiliath, Faramir leads his soldiers as Ithilien Rangers patrol the bridge. Boats carrying orcs approach, and a battle ensues as the orcs advance into west Osgiliath. Faramir's efforts can't halt their progress. Pippin climbs a mountainside in Minas Tirith, lights a pyre, and ignites a beacon as guards look on in surprise."
