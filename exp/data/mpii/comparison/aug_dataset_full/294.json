Jeff's dialogue continues over the activity of the two women. Evidently no sign of Thorwald. He glances quickly toward the junction and then right back to Lisa. The spade is lying on the earth beside Lisa. Stella has relinquished the spade and left the blossoms and soil scattered over the path. Jeff, tense and wide-eyed, observes Lisa ascend the fire escape. While Lisa begins up the fire escape, we see Stella sprinting toward the barrier in the foreground to climb over it. Lisa ascends the fire escape to the second story and the exterior of Thorwald's apartment. She attempts, unsuccessfully, to get through the window which opens into the kitchen from the fire escape. And then, with some effort, stretches and succeeds in getting in through the living room window, which is open. She proceeds directly to the bedroom and we see her bending over one of the suitcases. Jeff quickly grabs the telephoto lens and directs it on the salesman's apartment. Lisa turns from the suitcase with the alligator purse in her hand. There is an expression of triumph on her visage. She opens it and her expression shifts to dismay. She glances toward Jeff's apartment and, to convey her dismay, she turns the purse upside down. Empty.

The conversation over the action of the two women continues by Jeff. Apparently, Thorwald is not seen. The intersection is quickly looked toward by him and then right back to Lisa. Beside Lisa, the shovel is lying on the ground. The shovel has been abandoned by Stella and the flowers and dirt have been left strewn over the walk. Tense and wide-eyed, Lisa is watched by Jeff as she climbs the fire escape. While the fire escape is being started up by Lisa, Stella is seen running toward the wall in the foreground to climb over it.

Meanwhile, Jeff swiftly reaches for the phone, his fingers deftly dialing the number. The familiar buzzing sound of the filter fills the air, and soon the phone on the other end is lifted, revealing a woman's voice that catches Jeff off guard, leaving him momentarily puzzled. Squinting out the window, he attempts to make sense of the unexpected voice while continuing his conversation, his focus shifting between the phone call and the two women below. Despite the unfolding activities, there's no sign of Thorwald, prompting Jeff to glance quickly toward the intersection before refocusing on Lisa with urgency in his gaze. On the ground next to Lisa lies an abandoned shovel, left by Stella, with flowers and dirt scattered across the walkway. With wide eyes and tension palpable, Jeff's attention is riveted on Lisa as she begins her ascent up the fire escape. While Lisa makes her way up the metal structure to the second floor, Stella appears in the foreground, running toward the wall with determination to climb over it. As Lisa reaches the outside of Thorwald's apartment on the second floor, she attempts to open the kitchen window unsuccessfully. Undeterred, she stretches with effort until she manages to slip through the open living room window, landing inside. Her focus sharpens as she moves directly to the bedroom, where she bends over one of the suitcases with intent. Observing from afar, Jeff picks up the long-focus lens and trains it meticulously on the salesman's apartment. Lisa turns away from the suitcase, clutching an alligator handbag, her face lighting up with a momentary expression of triumph. However, upon opening the bag, her expression quickly shifts to one of dismay as she realizes its contents are missing. With urgency, she looks toward Jeff's apartment, seeking to convey her disappointment by turning the handbag upside down, showing it to be empty. Jeff, feeling the weight of anxiety, lowers the long-focus lens, his brow glistening with sweat as he mutters under his breath. His eyes dart to the alleyway and then back to Lisa with growing concern. Lisa swiftly moves to the dresser, pulling open the drawers in a frantic search for the elusive jewelry. She drops the handbag on the bed and scans the room, hoping to find a promising starting point for her search, but finds nothing of value. As Jeff watches with mounting tension, the door behind him bursts open, and Stella rushes into the apartment, causing Jeff to swivel toward her with urgency. He instinctively reaches for the phone, but Stella firmly presses his hand down, urging him to pause. With shock etched on her face, Stella gazes out the window, prompting Jeff to turn his attention quickly back to the scene outside, momentarily abandoning the phone. Together, Jeff and Stella steal a glance at the songwriter's apartment, just as a fresh burst of melody pours out from the previously quiet space. The camera briefly captures the songwriter's apartment, where his musical group is gathered around the piano, lost in the creation of beautiful music. In a poignant moment, Miss Lonely Hearts lifts her head to listen, deeply moved by the melody, and slowly lowers the pills and glass of water onto her lap, her intentions halted by the transcendent beauty of the music she hears."

Jeff, an ex-photographer now confined to a wheelchair after a recent accident, picks up the phone and quickly dials to reach someone who might help. The buzzer sounds on filter, commonly known as a telephone exchange used in the 1950s to connect calls, then the phone is lifted. A woman's voice is heard and Jeff seems a little puzzled at the sound of it, as though he's expecting someone else. He squints out the window, a habit from his years spent framing the world through a camera lens. Jeff's conversation continues over the action of the two women, who are risking much by being in Thorwald's yard. Apparently no sight of Thorwald, a traveling salesman whose strange behavior has raised suspicions. He looks quickly toward the intersection, where the streetlight occasionally flickers, and then right back to Lisa. The shovel, an indispensable yet incriminating gardening tool, is lying on the ground beside Lisa. Stella has abandoned the shovel and left the flowers and dirt strewn over the walk, perhaps in a bid to cover up their intrusion. Jeff, tense and wide-eyed, watches Lisa climb the fire escape, which rattles slightly with age and disuse. While Lisa starts up the fire escape, we see Stella running toward the wall in the foreground to climb over it, her movements hurried and nervous. Lisa climbs the fire escape to the second floor and the outside of Thorwald's apartment, hoping to find crucial evidence. She tries, unsuccessfully, to get through the window which opens into the kitchen from the fire escape. And then, with some difficulty, stretches and succeeds in getting in through the living room window, which is open, an oversight by the elusive Thorwald. She goes directly to the bedroom, the place most likely to hide secrets, and we see her bending over one of the suitcases, searching for clues. Jeff quickly picks up the long-focus lens, a tool of his trade that allows him to see the details, and trains it on the salesman's apartment. Lisa turns from the suitcase with the alligator handbag in her hand, a luxury item that seems out of place, perhaps suggesting its importance. There is an expression of triumph on her face. She opens it and her expression changes to dismay. She looks toward Jeff’s apartment across the courtyard and, to communicate her dismay, she turns the handbag upside down. Empty. He lowers the long-focus lens, his heart pounding as he is sweating with anxiety. He mutters, almost to himself. His eyes turn quickly to the alleyway, a dark and narrow passage often used for discreet movements, and back again to Lisa. She moves quickly to the dresser and begins opening the drawers to check them, driven by urgency. Lisa has dropped the bag on the bed and is now looking around the bedroom, looking for some place to start searching for the jewelry, the elusive evidence she needs. She finds nothing. As Jeff watches tensely, the door bursts open behind him and Stella hurries into the apartment, her face flushed with urgency. Jeff swings toward Stella, who has likely gathered some crucial information. He reaches for the phone. As he picks up the receiver, Stella pushes his hand down again, indicating silence. Stella looks out the window, and her face registers shock at the scene unfolding across the courtyard. Jeff turns quickly to the window again, forgetting the phone for the moment. Jeff and Stella turn for a quick glimpse of the songwriter's apartment, their neighbor known for late-night melodies. At this moment, from the songwriter's apartment which has been quiet for a while, comes a new burst of melody, a haunting tune of hope and longing. A quick flash of the songwriter's apartment, and his musical group gathered around the piano, playing with fervor. Miss Lonely Hearts, a neighbor who often watches life pass by alone, lifts her head to listen, and slowly lowers the pills and glass of water into her lap, her whole purpose arrested by the beauty of what she hears, a reminder of life's unexpected moments of grace."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Stella rushes into Jeff's apartment and stops him from calling. Both are shocked by what they see from the window. Meanwhile, a new melody from the songwriter's apartment captivates Miss Lonely Hearts, halting her previous intentions."
