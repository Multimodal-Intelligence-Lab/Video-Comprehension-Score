He tears the yellow document into fragments and tosses the fragments out over the gorge. We trace the bits of yellow document as they twirl in the breeze, then descend into the abyss underneath. The bits flutter in the breeze. Beneath lies the abrupt descent down the mountainside to the shadowy gorge. We trace this and speed upwards, leaving Valjean and the town of Digne far underneath, towards the sun bursting through the skies with the alps beyond. One bit of document twirls upwards in the daylight. The camera then begins to plunge back down through fog and mist underneath, through era and expanse, down to uncover vessels resting in low tide on the muck of the bay along the wharf of the town and red brick mill structures. The camera races towards three steeds galloping down a long muddy path on a flat expanse towards the fortified town of Montreuil-sur-Mer. Montreuil rests on a bay leading out to the ocean. As the riders enter the fortified town, we observe the impoverished gathered around the portals, destitute and sick individuals clamoring to get in. Javert observes the destitution of the individuals, impassive as always. The officers enter the port, and the vagrants are shoved back as the portals open and close for the officers. The long workspace is filled with tables at which conservatively attired women are laboring, creating adornments out of shellac, a dark resin which resembles jet. The Supervisor has paused beside Fantine, a beautiful young woman. As he reclines over to murmur in her ear, Fantine, astonished, pricks her digit with her needle. The women begin to remove their coveralls and organize their implements for the day. Fantine has extracted a note. The main factory woman seizes the note away from Fantine. Fantine attempts to retrieve the note. The note is handed surreptitiously down the sequence of women workers. The main factory woman begins to carry Fantine's note over to the Supervisor. The women quarrel. The proprietor enters the factory floor. Clean-shaven, well-nourished, transformed: it's Valjean. Suddenly, Valjean perceives Javert emerge on the first-level balcony of his office. His world collapses. On the factory floor, Fantine persists to defend herself to the Supervisor, as the women chant. The Supervisor drags Fantine away. Below, Fantine turns and calls to Valjean in his office above with a plaintive wail. Valjean strides back to the stairs up to his office and displays some demonstration samples of their work, casting a pointed gaze."

We follow the scraps of yellow paper as they dance in the wind, then fall away into the void below. The scraps flutter in the wind.

We follow this and accelerate upwards, leaving Valjean and the town of Digne, a quiet enclave in the Provence region of France, far below, towards the sun breaking through the heavens with the alps, majestic and eternal, beyond. One scrap of paper dances upwards in the sunlight. The camera then starts to tumble back down through mist and cloud below, through time and space, down to discover ships sitting in low tide on the mud of the estuary along the dockside of the town and red brick factory buildings, relics of the industrial revolution. The camera hurtles towards three horses riding down a long muddy road on a flat plain towards the walled town of Montreuil-sur-Mer, a coastal town once famed for its military fortifications. Montreuil sits on an estuary leading out to the sea, where trade ships frequently docked. As the riders enter the walled town, we see the poor clustered around the gates, destitute and sick people clammering to get in, seeking refuge and opportunity. Javert, a stern and unyielding officer known throughout the region, sees the destitution of the people, expressionless as ever. The police enter the harbour, and the beggars are pushed back as the gates open and close for the police.

The Foreman has stopped beside Fantine, a pretty young woman with a tragic story. As he leans over to whisper in her ear, Fantine, surprised, pricks her finger with her needle. The women start to take off their overalls and pack up their tools for the day. Fantine has taken out a letter, a precious link to her cherished daughter, Cosette.

Below, Fantine turns and calls to Valjean in his office above with a pitiful cry, a heartbreakingly desperate plea for help.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby cafÃ©, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
