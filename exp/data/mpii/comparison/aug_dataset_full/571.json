Jay and Kay get out, appearing as very undercover cops working for a secretive government agency that deals with extraterrestrial matters, and Jay starts up the driveway while Kay pulls a black card, marked with the insignia of the Men in Black organization, from his wallet and extends it to Beatrice as she draws close. Beatrice looks much better than before, more nicely dressed, with a touch of makeup and a smile on her face, suggesting perhaps new hope or a bribe. In the living room, Jay sips some of her lemonade, a classic homemade drink in these rural areas, and winces as a little giggle escapes her at the thought. Kay is in the hole where the ship, now a part of local folklore, landed, investigating with a pocket spectral analyzer, a device designed to detect energy signatures, over a section of scorched earth, and above him, Jay leans over, staring down as Kay looks up at him and the analyzer shifts colors from red to yellow, then purple, and green, indicating the presence of multiple alien elements. It's Dr. Laurel Weaver, the former forensic pathologist who tried to speak to Jay before. Laurel signs his clipboard, which is standard procedure for documenting autopsies, gives him a dirty look, but he laughs and leaves. She goes to the stretcher, bends down, and gently pets Rosenberg's cat, which has been unusually calm despite the chaos, indicative of its extraterrestrial origin. She looks up to see Jay and Kay standing there, then goes to the Arquillian's body on a table under the lights, throws back a sheet revealing the fully dissected Arquillian, a species known for its delicate political ties to Earth, and begins to examine it. Jay and Laurel cross the room to where Rosenberg's corpse, known as a respected jeweler in New York City who secretly brokered peace between alien factions, lies on another gurney, and she snaps her rubber gloves and reaches down, sinking her hands into the body as she moves things aside, which by Jay's expression, is very disgusting. From the other side of the room, Kay clears his throat, and Jay walks across the morgue to Kay, who is still examining the Arquillian.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

          "description": "Jay and Laurel cross the room to where Rosenberg's corpse lies on another gurney and she snaps her rubber gloves and reaches down sinking her hands into the body as she moves things aside which by Jay's expression is very disgusting  From the other side of the room Kay clears his throat and Jay walks across the morgue to Kay who is still examining the Arquillian  Jay turns and races across the room to rejoin her leans down and notices strange stitching around the base of Rosenberg's ear  He reaches out touches the ear turns it and with a soft pull the ear comes away from the head like a latch  Jay pulls again and Rosenberg's entire face pushes out with a mechanical hum and hinges open the whole face rotating away from the rest of the artificial skull  A tiny little green man gravely wounded but not quite dead staggers up out of a small control room inside Rosenberg's head with gearshifts and viewing screens all around the inside of the skull  The Baltian nods vigorously nods again falls and dies  Kay and Jay are not paying attention to Laurel when FLASH  Without even looking at her Kay whips out his neuralyzer and blanks her out The LTD pulls to a stop at the end of the driveway leading to Beatrice's farmhouse where the alien ship landed and the wrecked pickup truck is still there  Jay and Kay get out appearing as very undercover cops and Jay starts up the driveway while Kay pulls a black card from his wallet and extends it to Beatrice as she draws close  Beatrice looks much better than before more nicely dressed with a touch of makeup and a smile on her face  In the living room Jay sips some of her lemonade and winces as a little giggle escapes her at the thought  Kay is in the hole where the ship landed investigating with a pocket spectral analyzer over a section of scorched earth and above him  Jay leans over staring down as Kay looks up at him and the analyzer shifts colors from red to yellow then purple and green  It's Dr Laurel Weaver the woman who tried to speak to Jay before Laurel signs his clipboard gives him a dirty look but he laughs and leaves  She goes to the stretcher bends down and gently pets Rosenberg's cat  She looks up to see Jay and Kay standing there then goes to the Arquillian's body on a table under the lights throws back a sheet revealing the fully dissected Arquillian and begins to examine it "
