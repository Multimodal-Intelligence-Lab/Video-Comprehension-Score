Phyllis takes her hand off the doorknob and holds on to Neff's arm. They look at each other, and the look is like a long kiss. Then, Neff goes out with a briefcase under his arm and comes down the steps to the street, where his Dodge coupe is parked at the curb. He opens the door and stops, looking in.

Phyllis and Neff progress near to the door, and Phyllis cracks the door ajar. Both glance at the staircase, where Dietrichson is ascending. Phyllis removes her hand from the doorknob and grips Neff's limb. They gaze at each other, and the gaze is akin to a prolonged embrace. Then, Neff exits with a case under his limb and descends the stairs to the roadway, where his Dodge coupe is stationed at the edge. He unlocks the door and pauses, peering inside. Sitting there in the dim corner of the vehicle, away from the steering wheel, is Lola, who sports a coat but no cap. Lola grants him a cunning grin, and Neff is somewhat vexed. Neff enters the vehicle, places the case on the shelf behind the driver's seat, shuts the door, and ignites the vehicle. They glide down the slope, and Neff regards Lola inquisitively, while Lola returns his gaze. Neff halts the vehicle by the curb, rotates, and peers towards the vehicle. Zachetti strides towards the vehicle, and Lola has opened the door. Zachetti arrives, and Lola steps out of the vehicle, catching up with Zachetti, and they stroll away jointly. Gradually, Neff shifts the vehicle in gear and proceeds, his expression tense. Behind his head, light reflects on the metal of the zipper on the case. There is a fair portion of activity, but the spot is not congested. Neff proceeds along the sidewalk into the shot, passing in front of the produce and vegetable exhibition and going between the booths into the marketplace. He pauses by the cashier's counter and purchases a pack of cigarettes. As he is unsealing the pack, he glances back nonchalantly beyond the turnstile into the back section of the market, where the shelves are stocked with tinned goods and other wares, and patrons move about selecting items and placing them in their baskets. Phyllis is observed among them, standing by the soap segment, with her basket partially filled. She wears a plain house dress, no cap, and has a sizable envelope handbag under her arm. Phyllis is placing a tin of cleaning powder into her basket. Neff enters the shot and progresses along the shelves towards her, very slowly, feigning to inspect the goods.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
