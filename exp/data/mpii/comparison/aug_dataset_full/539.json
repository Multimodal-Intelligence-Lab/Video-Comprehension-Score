As it becomes dim, the climate decreases various levels, and the glow of oil lamps flickers on the cavern surfaces ahead. The lads advance prudently, cautious to remain concealed, and glimpse four individuals excavating with spades and mattocks, with the fourth individual clad in a hide waistcoat and a brown felt trilby hat. Roscoe dashes onward and provides Trilby the container, who strides toward a lamp resting on a stone and places the container adjacent to the lamp. Halfbreed shoves Roscoe, who leaps with enthusiasm, while Rough Rider advances to gaze at the container as Trilby opens it and retrieves a gem-encrusted crucifix from the container, holding it aloft. Trilby's allies practically drool at the spectacle of it. Indy removes his hat, glances down at the unseen activity, and continues to admire the crucifix before setting it on the stone next to its container and the lamp. Indy turns back to scrutinize the individuals with a look of determination, then turns back toward Herman, but observes in wide-eyed terror as a serpent slides across his lap. Indy plainly picks up the serpent and tosses it aside, causing Herman to gasp. Indy seizes Herman's scout neckerchief, pulls him closer, releases the neckerchief, gives Herman a pat, and Herman rushes off. Indy perceives the crucifix on the stone next to the lamp, and as the bandits continue to search for further treasures, he maneuvers his way unseen within arm's reach of the crucifix. With Trilby glancing over at the individuals excavating, Indy picks up the crucifix, places it in his trousers, and begins to haul himself up a rope hanging nearby. As he climbs, Indy's feet fracture a timber beam, attracting the individuals' attention, and the three bandits are so eager to get their hands on Indy that they almost topple one another over. Only Trilby is unperturbed; he casts a disdainful glance in the direction of his fleeing cohorts and sets off after Indy. Indy emerges from the obscurity of the Pueblo into the brilliance of day, hears running footfalls behind him, and dashes off. Rough Rider, Halfbreed, and Roscoe swiftly appear and run after him. Indy leaps from one stone to another, where the scout troop steeds are below, places two fingers in his mouth, and whistles for his steed, who trots over. Indy places the crucifix in his belt, prepares to leap, and then leaps into the saddle."

The boys move forward with caution, meticulously ensuring they remain hidden from view, and soon spot four men energetically digging with shovels and pick-axes. One of these men, who appears to be of some significance, is distinguished by a leather waist jacket and a brown felt fedora hat perched on his head. Suddenly, Roscoe dashes forward eagerly, handing over a box to Fedora, who strides toward a lantern resting precariously on a rock and places the box carefully next to it. Meanwhile, Halfbreed gives Roscoe a shove, causing him to leap with excitement, while Rough Rider moves in closer to gaze at the box as Fedora opens it and triumphantly lifts a bejeweled cross out from within.

Upon reaching the top, they proceed down the narrow passageway, their movements synchronized to ensure they stay close together. As darkness gradually envelops the passage, the temperature around them drops noticeably, a chill settling into the air with each passing moment. The soft, flickering light of kerosene lanterns becomes visible, casting dancing shadows and illuminating the tunnel walls ahead in an eerie display. The boys advance with heightened caution, their eyes and ears attuned to their surroundings as they remain vigilant and hidden from view. Peering around a corner, they spot four men engrossed in their labor, methodically digging into the earth with shovels and pick-axes. One of these men stands out, donned in a leather waist jacket and a distinctive brown felt fedora hat. Roscoe, one of the men, impulsively rushes forward, holding a box that he eagerly hands over to Fedora, who steps confidently toward the lantern resting on a nearby rock. Placing the box next to the lantern, Fedora becomes the center of attention. Halfbreed, another man, gives Roscoe a shove, spurring a jump of excitement from Roscoe, while Rough Rider takes a step forward to peer at the box with keen interest. With deliberate movements, Fedora opens the box, revealing a bejeweled cross that he lifts and holds high, capturing the attention of his companions, whose eyes widen with anticipation and desire. Meanwhile, Indy, one of the Scouts, removes his hat and lowers his gaze, momentarily captivated by the off-screen action before him, but unable to resist admiring the cross. He sets it gently on the rock beside its box and the lantern, his mind whirring with determination. He turns back to scrutinize the men, a look of resolve etched on his face, but as he pivots toward his fellow Scout, Herman, he becomes frozen in wide-eyed horror as he sees a snake slithering across his lap. Without hesitation, Indy picks up the snake with matter-of-fact precision and tosses it aside, eliciting a gasp from Herman. Indy then seizes Herman's scout scarf, pulling him closer with a reassuring grip, and upon releasing the scarf, he pats Herman on the back, prompting him to dash off. With the cross lying tantalizingly close on the rock next to the lantern, Indy seizes the moment. As the robbers remain engrossed in their search for more treasures, Indy stealthily moves within arm's reach of the cross. With Fedora momentarily distracted, supervising the men digging, Indy swiftly snatches the cross and discreetly tucks it into his pants. He then turns his attention to a rope hanging nearby, initiating his ascent. As he climbs, the structure beneath his feet gives way, and the snap of a wooden beam breaking echoes through the passage, drawing the men's attention. In their eagerness to capture Indy, the three robbers nearly collide in their pursuit, driven by their singular focus on reclaiming the cross. Only Fedora remains unfazed, casting a look of disdain at the chaos around him before setting off after Indy with determined strides. Bursting forth from the dimness of the Pueblo into the stark brightness of day, Indy catches the sound of hurried footsteps behind him and instinctively breaks into a run. Hot on his trail, Rough Rider, Halfbreed, and Roscoe quickly emerge and give chase. Demonstrating agility and precision, Indy leaps from one rock to another, where the scout troop's horses are assembled below. He places two fingers in his mouth and issues a sharp whistle, summoning his horse, which promptly trots over to him. Indy carefully slides the cross into his belt, mentally preparing himself for the upcoming leap. With a swift and practiced motion, he propels himself into the saddle, ready to make his escape."

As it gets dark, the temperature in the desert environment drops several degrees, and the light of kerosene lanterns, once a common source of portable lighting before electricity, dances on the tunnel walls ahead. The boys approach cautiously, careful to stay hidden, and see four men digging with shovels and pick-axes, tools traditionally used in mining and excavation. The fourth man, known as Fedora for his distinctive brown felt fedora hat—a style popularized in the early 20th century—wears a leather waist jacket reminiscent of those favored by adventurers and workers alike. Roscoe rushes forward and gives Fedora the box, who steps toward a lantern resting on a rock, using it to illuminate his actions, and puts the box next to the lantern. Halfbreed, a nickname likely denoting a mixed heritage, pushes Roscoe, who jumps with excitement, while Rough Rider, a moniker perhaps inspired by Theodore Roosevelt's cavalry regiment, steps forward to look at the box as Fedora opens it and takes a bejeweled cross, a relic that may date back to a period of historical significance, from the box, holding it aloft. Fedora's comrades practically salivate at the sight of it. Indy, a nickname for Indiana Jones, a character renowned for his adventurous exploits, takes off his hat, looks down at the off-screen action, and continues to admire the cross before placing it on the rock next to its box and the lantern. Indy turns back to observe the men with a look of resolve, then turns back toward Herman, but watches in wide-eyed horror as a snake, a creature often associated with danger in folklore, slithers across his lap. Indy matter-of-factly picks up the snake, showing his usual fearless demeanor, and tosses it aside, causing Herman to gasp. Indy grabs Herman's scout scarf, pulls him closer, releases the scarf, gives Herman a reassuring pat, and Herman dashes off. Indy sees the cross on the rock next to the lantern, and as the robbers, likely treasure hunters, continue to search for additional valuables, he works his way unseen within arm's reach of the cross. With Fedora looking over at the men digging, Indy picks up the cross, puts it in his pants, and begins to pull himself up a rope hanging nearby, an escape method often employed in daring adventures. As he climbs, Indy's feet break a wooden beam, a structural element of the old passageway, attracting the men's attention, and the three robbers are so eager to get their hands on Indy that they almost knock each other over. Only Fedora remains unperturbed; he casts a disgusted glance in the direction of his fleeing companions and sets off after Indy. Indy emerges from the darkness of the Pueblo, an architectural style used by Native American tribes, into the brightness of day, hears running footsteps behind him, and dashes off. Rough Rider, Halfbreed, and Roscoe quickly appear and run after him. Indy jumps from one rock to another, where the scout troop horses are below, well-trained mounts for the young scouts, puts two fingers in his mouth, and whistles for his horse, who trots over obediently. Indy puts the cross in his belt, secures it as a cowboy might, prepares to jump, and then jumps into the saddle, demonstrating his adeptness as a rider."

Baxter leaps forward and hands Beret the bag, who moves toward a lantern perched on a boulder and places the bag next to the lantern. Patch nudges Baxter, who spins with curiosity, while Daredevil strides forward to glance at the bag as Beret opens it and extracts a bejeweled crown from the bag, raising it high. Beret's allies practically drool at the sight of it.

Only Beret remains calm; she tosses a disdainful look in the direction of her departing associates and starts after Logan. Logan emerges from the shadows of the cave into the glow of day, hears hurried footsteps behind him, and races away. Daredevil, Patch, and Baxter soon appear and chase after him. Logan leaps from one boulder to another, where the guide troop ponies are below, puts two fingers in his mouth, and whistles for his pony, who trots over.

Roscoe stumbles backward and hands Beret the bag, who saunters toward a torch perched on a plank and places the bag next to the torch. Halfbreed nudges Roscoe, who bounces with curiosity, while Rough Rider shuffles forward to peer at the bag as Beret unzips it and extracts a glittering tiara from the bag, raising it triumphantly.

As the sky brightens, the humidity rises several units, and the glow of neon signs flickers on the cavern ceiling above. The penguins advance stealthily, careful to remain revealed, and see a quartet of rabbits painting with brushes and rollers, with the fourth rabbit wearing a silk evening gown and a green silk top hat. Rutherford dashes backward and hands Top Hat the envelope, who tumbles toward a candle balanced on a twig and drops the envelope next to the candle. Harefoot shoves Rutherford, who twirls with delight, while Starjumper steps backward to peer at the envelope as Top Hat opens it and extracts a ruby ring from the envelope, holding it sideways. Top Hat's friends practically faint at the aroma of it. Waldo removes his cap, gazes up at the televised image, and continues to ponder the ring before tossing it on the twig next to its envelope and the candle. Waldo pivots backwards to inspect the rabbits with an expression of curiosity, then pivots forward toward Gerald, but gawks in astonishment as a lizard scampers across his shoulder. Waldo casually snatches the lizard and hurls it away, causing Gerald to chuckle. Waldo grabs Gerald's necktie, pulls him away, releases the necktie, gives Gerald a nudge, and Gerald crawls away. Waldo notices the ring on the twig next to the candle, and as the painters continue to explore for further trinkets, he slinks around exposed within arm's length of the ring. With Top Hat glancing over at the rabbits painting, Waldo lifts the ring, tucks it in his vest, and begins to hoist himself down a vine hanging overhead. As he descends, Waldo’s wings snap a metal pipe, attracting the rabbits' focus, and the trio of painters are so determined to catch Waldo that they nearly topple each other over. Only Top Hat is indifferent; he casts a dismissive look in the direction of his pursuing friends and ambles toward Waldo. Waldo appears from the brightness of the Coliseum into the dimness of twilight, hears prancing hooves behind him, and crawls away. Starjumper, Harefoot, and Rutherford sluggishly emerge and crawl behind him. Waldo stretches from one twig to another, where the farmer's flock is above, puts two toes on his beak, and bleats for his goat, who trots away. Waldo places the ring in his scarf, plans to hop, and then hops into the cart."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
