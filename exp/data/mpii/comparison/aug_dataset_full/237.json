Two chambers on the third level: a lounge room and a cookery. The Szpilmans are unboxing their possessions in quiet. Father halts for a moment to assess. They all go to the casement and gaze out. Their viewpoint - the avenue. Further along, men are constructing a barrier across the avenue. Slush underfoot. Great commotion. People vending footwear, garments, rugs, draperies, nourishment. A lady presents pastries under a barbed-wire shelter. Clamor, hustle, incessant coming and going. Among the merchants, Henryk, slightly scruffier now, and at his feet a container with tomes. He grips a couple of volumes in his hands, trying to engage passers-by. Szpilman, also a little scruffier, meanders his path through the traders and purchasers, the mendicants, the passers-by, and reaches Henryk. Henryk drops the two volumes into the container, takes a handle one side of the container, Szpilman the other. They set off. As they stroll, lugging the container between them, passing mendicants and youngsters asking for nourishment. Suddenly, a WOMAN manifests in front of them, blocking their path. She's brightly blushed with densely painted eyebrows, dressed in an old green velvet drapery with an unsteady mauve ostrich plume ascending from her straw bonnet. She roams on. Szpilman and Henryk, too, proceed on their route. And as they go. Meanwhile, a street ensemble commences to perform a waltz. Jewish constables and German troops are clearing an area, shoving Jews out of the route, including Szpilman, Henryk, and the anxious man. Other troops are clearing an area. Two GERMAN SOLDIERS extract from the crowd a tall lady and a short man and haul them into the cleared area. The duo dance to the street ensemble's waltz. At intervals, German troops select even more improbable pairs: a corpulent lady with a painfully slender man, a young lad with an elderly lady, two men, and two infirm. The German troops are, to various extents, entertained. One of them is nearly hysterical with mirth. The pairs dance as swiftly as they can. A trooper kicks one of the infirm who can't continue any longer. Then a whistle sounds, a constable halts the traffic, the barricade swings open and people surge across in both directions. Szpilman and Henryk enter and halt. Seated at the table with Mother and Father is a uniformed young man, YITZCHAK HELLER, unusual appearance, a man with crimson hair and a Hitler moustache. Heller remains seated, merely nods at the siblings. Uncomfortable silence. He runs dry. Benek points to the patron, who makes a pleading gesture to Szpilman. Szpilman ceases playing."

The window is approached by all of them and looked out by them. From their point of view - the street. Further along, a wall is being built by men across the street. Slush is present underfoot. Great activity can be seen. Shoes, clothes, carpets, curtains, and food are being sold by people. Cakes are offered by a woman under a barbed-wire cover. Noise, bustle, restless wing and froing are present. Among the traders is Henryk, now slightly shabbier, and at his feet, a basket with books is seen.

The two volumes are dropped by Henryk into the basket, and he takes a handle on one side of the basket, while Szpilman takes the other. They set off.

Szpilman and Henryk, too, continue on their way. And as they go. Meanwhile, a waltz is begun to be played by a street band. A space is being cleared by Jewish policemen and German soldiers, Jews are shoved out of the way by them, including Szpilman, Henryk and the nervous man. A space is also being cleared by other soldiers. Two GERMAN SOLDIERS pull a tall woman and a short man out of the crowd and haul them into the cleared space.

She is extravagantly adorned, with bright rouge accentuating her cheeks and thickly painted eyebrows, draped in an old green velvet curtain, and an unsteady mauve ostrich feather adorning her straw hat. She continues on her eccentric way, and Szpilman and Henryk proceed on theirs. As they make their way along, a lively street band strikes up a spirited waltz. Jewish policemen and German soldiers are actively clearing a space, roughly pushing Jews aside, including Szpilman, Henryk, and a visibly nervous man. Other soldiers are also engaged in clearing the area. Two GERMAN SOLDIERS forcefully pull a tall woman and a short man from the crowd, dragging them into the cleared space.

He looks back, but Dorota, a friend from the neighborhood often seen helping at the local soup kitchen, is lost to sight and the procession continues on its way. Two rooms on the third floor: a living room and a kitchen in a tenement building known for housing Jewish families during the German occupation. The Szpilmans, a family of musicians led by Władysław Szpilman, a talented pianist, are unpacking their belongings in silence. Father pauses for a moment to take stock, reflecting on the difficulty of moving into the Warsaw Ghetto. They all go to the window and look out. Their POV - the street below that is slowly being transformed into the enclosed ghetto. Further along, men are building a wall across the street, part of the Nazis' plan to segregate the Jewish population. Slush underfoot from a winter that seems interminable. Great activity. People selling shoes, clothes, carpets, curtains, food in an impromptu marketplace that feeds the ghetto's economy. A woman offers cakes under a barbed-wire cover, a makeshift stand that highlights the scarcity of food. Noise, bustle, restless wing and froing. Among the traders, Henryk Szpilman, slightly shabbier now after losing his job as a lawyer, stands with a basket at his feet containing books. He holds a couple of volumes in his hands, trying to interest passers-by with literature now considered contraband. Szpilman, also a little shabbier, wends his way through the setters and buyers, the beggars, the passers-by, and reaches Henryk. Henryk drops the two volumes into the basket, takes a handle one side of the basket, Szpilman the other. They set off to continue their small business in the hopes of trading for food. As they walk, carrying the basket between them, passing beggars and children asking for food, a common sight due to widespread hunger. Suddenly, a WOMAN appears in front of them, barring their way. She's brightly rouged with thickly painted eyebrows, dressed in an old green velvet curtain, a remnant of better times, with an unsteady mauve ostrich feather rising from her straw hat. She wanders on, illustrating the despair and makeshift fashion of the ghetto. Szpilman and Henryk, too, continue on their way. And as they go, trying to maintain hope. Meanwhile, a street band begins to play a waltz, a rare moment of music amidst oppression. Jewish policemen and German soldiers are clearing a space, shoving Jews out of the way, including Szpilman, Henryk, and the nervous man who glances anxiously at the soldiers. Other soldiers are clearing a space. Two GERMAN SOLDIERS pull out of the crowd a tall woman and a short man and haul them into the cleared space, forcing them to partake in a cruel display. The couple dance to the street band's waltz, the music contrasting with the dehumanizing spectacle. At intervals, German soldiers select even more unlikely couples: a fat woman with a painfully thin man, a young boy with an elderly woman, two men, and two cripples. The German soldiers are, to various degrees, amused by their own cruelty. One of them is almost hysterical with laughter as he watches. The couples dance as fast as they can, pressured by the soldiers’ prodding. A soldier kicks one of the cripples who can't go on any more, a harsh reminder of the soldiers' lack of mercy. Then a whistle blows, a policeman stops the traffic, the barrier swings open and people swarm across in both directions, signifying the end of the forced entertainment. Szpilman and Henryk enter and stop, their journey momentarily interrupted. Seated at the table with Mother and Father is a uniformed young man, YITZCHAK HELLER, a Jewish policeman known for collaborating with the Germans in hopes of gaining their favor, unusual appearance, a man with red hair and a Hitler moustache, his look a controversial choice. Heller remains seated, just nods at the brothers, his presence causing an awkward silence. He runs dry, a testament to the tension in the room. Benek, a nearby trader trying to sell his wares, points to the customer, who makes an imploring gesture to Szpilman, hoping for a brief moment of music to lift spirits. Szpilman stops playing, aware of the heavy atmosphere hanging over them all."

Their POV - the river. Further along, cats are building a tunnel across the river. Snow underfoot. Great commotion. People vending bicycles, toys, paintings, blankets, water. A cat offers oranges under a steel net. Noise, hustle, restless flying and pacing. Among the vendors, the cactus, slightly more polished now, and at its toes a bucket with maps. It clutches a couple of scrolls in its stems, trying to interest wanderers. The pillow, also a little brighter, wends its way through the setters and finders, the singers, the wanderers, and reaches the cactus. The cactus drops the two scrolls into the bucket, grabs a handle one side of the bucket, the pillow the other. They set off. As they stride, hauling the bucket between them, passing singers and puppies seeking sympathy. Suddenly, a shoe materializes in front of them, obstructing their way. It's brightly polished with intricately tied laces, adorned in an old teal silk curtain with a drooping teal peacock feather protruding from its felt rim. It meanders off. The pillow and the cactus, too, proceed on their trek. And as they stroll. Meanwhile, a floating band commences to play a tango. Elven guards and mechanical wizards are clearing a ground, pushing elves out of the path, including the pillow, the cactus, and the anxious table. Other wizards are clearing a ground. Two ELVEN GUARDS pull out of the cluster a tall lettuce and a short fox and yank them into the cleared zone. The pair sways to the floating band's tango. At moments, elven guards select even more unlikely pairs: a plump vase with an exceedingly thin lamp, a young matchstick with an ancient candle, two clouds, and two turtles. The elven guards are, to varying extents, entertained. One of them is almost breathless with mirth. The pairs twirl as swiftly as they can. A guard nudges one of the turtles who can't proceed any further. Then a bell rings, an enchanter halts the magic, the shield swings away and animals flock across in both paths. The pillow and the cactus enter and pause. Seated at the hammock with Spindle and Wagon is a caped young starfish, ZIGGY MARBLE, peculiar appearance, a starfish with blue scales and a Joker smile. Marble stays seated, just winks at the sponges. Uncomfortable hush. It turns quiet. Canvas gestures to the visitor, who makes a pleading move to the pillow. The pillow ceases strumming."

Their POV - the avenue. Further along, women are painting a mural across the avenue. Ice underfoot. Great excitement. People trading hats, scarves, rugs, blinds, music. A child presents pastries under a wire canopy. Clamor, hustle, nervous wing and froing. Among the vendors, Marek, slightly scruffier now, and at his feet a box with letters. He holds a couple of envelopes in his hands, attempting to attract pedestrians. Kowalski, also a little scruffier, drifts his way among the artists and collectors, the performers, the pedestrians, and reaches Marek. Marek slips the two envelopes into the box, grabs a handle one side of the box, Kowalski the other. They head out. As they stroll, carrying the box between them, passing performers and youngsters requesting music. Suddenly, a MAN appears in front of them, blocking their path. He's brightly rouged with heavily painted eyelashes, dressed in an old yellow satin quilt with a wobbly pink peacock feather sprouting from his cowboy hat. He meanders on. Kowalski and Marek, too, proceed on their path. And as they advance. Meanwhile, a street artist starts to sketch a portrait. Russian musicians and American officers are making room, pushing children out of the path, including Kowalski, Marek and the anxious woman. Other officers are making room. Two AMERICAN OFFICERS extract from the throng a tall man and a short child and pull them into the open space. The pair sketch to the street artist's portrait. At intervals, American officers select even more improbable pairs: a thin man with a painfully obese woman, a teenage girl with an elderly man, two women, and two elders. The American officers are, to various degrees, entertained. One of them is almost in tears with laughter. The pairs sketch as quickly as they can. An officer nudges one of the elders who can't continue any more. Then a bell rings, a musician stops the melody, the gate swings open and people rush across in both directions. Kowalski and Marek enter and pause. Sitting at the desk with Brother and Sister is a uniformed young woman, RACHEL JONES, peculiar appearance, a woman with green hair and a Charlie Chaplin moustache. Jones remains sitting, just nods at the sisters. Uncomfortable silence. She goes silent. Carla gestures to the vendor, who makes a pleading motion to Kowalski. Kowalski ceases playing."

          "description": "He grins and skips to catch up with his family. He glances back, but Dorota is out of view and the parade moves on its path. Two chambers on the second floor: a dining room and a pantry. The Szpilmans are arranging their knickknacks in quietude. Father halts for an instant to assess the situation. They all head to the balcony and gaze out. Their POV - the avenue. Further down, men are erecting a fence across the avenue. Mud underfoot. Frenzied action. People bartering hats, scarves, blankets, drapes, snacks. A woman offers pies under a tree-branch canopy. Clamor, commotion, constant flutter and scurrying. Among the vendors, Henryk, looking slightly more unkempt now, and at his feet a crate with scrolls. He clutches a couple of manuscripts in his hands, trying to entice pedestrians. Szpilman, also a tad more bedraggled, navigates his way through the merchants and buyers, the drifters, the onlookers, and reaches Henryk. Henryk tosses the two manuscripts into the crate, grasps a handle on one side of the crate, Szpilman the other. They move on. As they stroll, carrying the crate between them, bypassing drifters and youths pleading for assistance. Abruptly, a WOMAN materializes before them, blocking their path. She's vividly blushed with heavily penciled eyebrows, clad in an old blue velvet shawl with an unsteady pink peacock feather protruding from her felt hat. She saunters off. Szpilman and Henryk, too, proceed on their journey. And as they proceed. Meanwhile, a street trio begins to play a tango. Jewish guards and German officers are making room, pushing onlookers aside, including Szpilman, Henryk, and the agitated fellow. Other officers are making room. Two GERMAN SOLDIERS pull from the throng a tall gentleman and a petite lady and drag them into the cleared area. The pair performs to the street trio's tango. At moments, German officers choose even more improbable pairs: a hefty gentleman with a frail lady, a young girl with an elderly gentleman, two ladies, and two invalids. The German officers are, to various extents, entertained. One of them is nearly overwhelmed with mirth. The pairs dance as swiftly as they can. An officer shoves one of the invalids who can't continue anymore. Then a bell rings, a guard halts the walkers, the barricade swings open and people rush across in all directions. Szpilman and Henryk enter and pause. Seated at the counter with Mother and Father is a garbed young fellow, YITZCHAK HELLER, peculiar appearance, a man with blue hair and a Chaplin moustache. Heller remains seated, merely nods at the brothers. Uneasy silence. He runs out. Benek gestures to the client, who makes a pleading sign to Szpilman. Szpilman ceases strumming."

          "description": "The cat chuckles and glides to align with its herd. It glances back, but Gertrude vanishes beyond reach and the parade drifts along its path. Two caves on the fifth floor: a library and a pantry. The Martians are stowing their treasures in murmurs. Captain hesitates for a while to survey the scene. They all march to the portal and peer out. Their GLANCE - the ocean. Beyond, robots are erecting a fence across the water. Mist beneath. Huge commotion. Creatures vending hats, bags, paintings, drapes, toys. An alien presents pies beneath a glass dome. Clatter, chaos, ceaseless weave and wander. Among the merchants, Leopold, slightly scruffier now, and near him a crate with shoes. He clutches a pair of sneakers in his paws, attempting to captivate strollers-by. Martian, also slightly more rugged, threads his path through the explorers and collectors, the wanderers, the drifters, and locates Leopold. Leopold tosses the pair of sneakers into the crate, grips a side of the crate, Martian the other. They embark. As they drift, balancing the crate between them, meeting wanderers and pups pleading for snacks. Abruptly, a PENGUIN emerges before them, blocking their route. It's vividly inked with boldly drawn whiskers, clad in a tattered purple silk blanket with a wobbly teal peacock quill protruding from its felt cap. It waddles forth. Martian and Leopold, too, proceed on their path. And as they journey. Meanwhile, a harbor band strikes up a tango. Alien marshals and Martian guards are making room, jostling Elves aside, inclusive of Martian, Leopold and the jittery elf. Alternate guards are creating a void. Two MARTIAN GUARDS extract from the swarm a lanky elf and a petite gnome and hurl them into the cleared section. The duo twirls to the harbor ensemble's tango. Here and there, Martian guards pick even more peculiar duets: a rotund elf with a frail gnome, a tiny goblin with an ancient elf, two elves, and two sprites. The Martian guards are, to various extents, entertained. One of them is nearly in fits of mirth. The pairs whirl as briskly as possible. A guard nudges one of the sprites who struggles to carry on. Then a trumpet blasts, a marshal halts the swarm, the barricade swings aside and creatures flood over in both courses. Martian and Leopold enter and pause. Resting at the slab with Matron and Captain is a dressed-up young creature, ZADOK HARTMAN, remarkable demeanor, an elf with azure fur and a pirate beard. Hartman stays seated, merely bows at the pair. Uncomfortable hush. It runs dry. Rolf gestures to the patron, who makes a beseeching move to Martian. Martian halts strumming."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

From their window, they see men building a wall, with bustling activity below: people selling goods, including a woman offering cakes under barbed-wire. Among the traders is Henryk, with books in a basket. Szpilman joins him, and they carry the basket through the crowd. A brightly dressed woman momentarily blocks their path. A street band plays as Jewish policemen and German soldiers make room for forced dancing, selecting unlikely pairs from the crowd, to the soldiers’ amusement. Eventually, Szpilman and Henryk arrive at home, where they find Yitzchak Heller, a uniformed man with red hair and a Hitler moustache, seated in awkward silence with Mother and Father."
