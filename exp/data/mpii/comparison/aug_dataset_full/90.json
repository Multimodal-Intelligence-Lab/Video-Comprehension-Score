Carl's uneasy grin diminishes as there is a whimpering noise. The officer pauses and leans forward into the automobile, listening. Grimsrud extends across Carl, seizes the trooper by the hair, and smashes his head down onto the automobile door. With his free hand, Grimsrud pops the glove compartment, produces a firearm out, and extends across Carl, firing at the back of the trooper's head. Jean shrieks as he releases the officer, whose head slides out the window and whose body flops back onto the roadway. Carl gazes out at the cop in the street, exits, and leans down to lift up the body. Headlights emerge: an approaching automobile that Grimsrud perceives as the automobile nears, decelerating. Carl, with the trooper's body lifted halfway up, is immobilized in the headlights. The automobile carries the outlines of two riders in front as Grimsrud slides into the operator's seat. The automobile speeds, roars past, and away. Grimsrud screeches into a U-turn, the operator's door banging shut with his spin. He takes the cigarette from his mouth and stubs it in his ashtray. Small crimson rear lights fishtail up ahead as Jean begins shrieking in the rear seat. The crimson rear lights ahead start to turn, and with a remote crunching sound, they vanish. The headlights now exhibit only vacant roadway, starting to turn the automobile. Grimsrud is not catching on the rear lights, so he scowls and decelerates. The destroyed automobile's headlights shine off into a snowy field adjoining the highway as Grimsrud applies brakes. Jean slides off the rear seat and thumps into the leg-well. His headlights exhibit the automobile up ahead off the roadway, crumpled around a telephone pole, having failed to hold a turn. Grimsrud sweeps his firearm off the front seat, unlatches his door, and exits. A young man in a down jacket is limping across the snowy field, away from the destroyed automobile. Grimsrud strides calmly out after the wounded lad, raises his firearm, and fires. With a poof of feathers, a cavity opens up in the lad's back, and he tumbles into the snow. Grimsrud walks up to the wreck and peers in its half-open door, where a young woman is trapped inside the distorted wreckage, wounded. Grimsrud raises his firearm and fires. A blue-winged teal in flight over a marshy swamp. The chamber in which it hangs is dim, and the continuing track reveals a couple in bed, sleeping. The man, fortyish, pajama-clad, is large and large-bellied with his mouth open. He snores while his arms are flung over a woman in her thirties, wearing a nightgown, mouth also open, not snoring."

The trooper is grabbed by Grimsrud, who reaches across Carl, by the hair, and his head is slammed down onto the car door. With his free hand, the glove compartment is popped by Grimsrud, a gun is brought out, and the trooper is shot at the back of the head by him as he reaches across Carl. Jean screams as he is released, and the policeman's head slides out the window and his body flops back onto the street. Out at the cop in the road, Carl looks, gets out, and the body is hoisted up by him as he leans down. Headlights appear: an oncoming car that he notices as the car approaches, slowing. In the headlights, Carl, with the trooper's body hoisted halfway up, freezes. The silhouettes of two occupants in front are carried by the car as he slides into the driver's seat. Past and away, the car is accelerated, roaring. Into a U-turn, a squeal is made by Grimsrud, and the driver's door is slammed shut by him with his spin.

The red tail lights ahead start to turn, and with a distant crunching sound, they disappear. The empty road is now shown by the headlights, starting to turn the car.

The policeman, wearing a thoughtful expression on his face, carefully pats the crisp fifty-dollar bill into the man's bill-fold and hands it back to him through the open car window. As the transaction concludes, Carl's nervous smile begins to diminish, replaced by a soft, whimpering sound that suddenly fills the air around them. For a moment, the policeman hesitates, then leans forward into the car, listening attentively. At that instant, with a sudden and forceful movement, Grimsrud reaches across Carl, grabbing the trooper by the hair, and viciously slams the officer's head down onto the car door. With his other hand, Grimsrud deftly pops open the glove compartment, retrieves a gun, and once again reaches across Carl, this time firing a shot at the back of the trooper's head. Jean lets out a piercing, blood-curdling scream as Grimsrud releases the policeman, whose head slides lifelessly out the window, and whose body flops heavily back onto the street with a dull thud. Carl stares out at the fallen officer lying motionless on the road, gets out of the car, and leans down in an attempt to hoist up the body. Just then, headlights appear in the distance: an oncoming car that Grimsrud notices as it approaches, steadily slowing down. Caught in the glaring bright headlights, Carl, with the trooper's body hoisted halfway up, is frozen in place. The approaching vehicle carries the silhouettes of two occupants seated in the front as Grimsrud quickly slides into the driver's seat. The car roars past and speeds away into the night with increasing velocity. Grimsrud performs a dramatic, squealing U-turn, and the driver's door slams shut with the force of his maneuver.

As the red tail lights up ahead start to turn, they are accompanied by a distant crunching sound and then vanish from view. His headlights now illuminate only the empty road beginning to turn the car. Realizing he is not gaining on the disappearing tail lights, Grimsrud frowns and decelerates.

Grimsrud raises his gun once more and fires. In a separate scene, a blue-winged teal is seen in flight over a swampy marshland. The room in which it hangs is dark, and the camera track reveals a couple lying in bed, asleep. The man, who appears to be in his forties, is clad in pajamas and has a big, big-bellied physique, his mouth agape.

Simultaneously, with his other hand, Grimsrud deftly pops open the glove compartment, retrieves a gun, and reaches across Carl once more, aiming and firing at the back of the trooper's head. Jean's scream pierces the air as Grimsrud releases the policeman, whose lifeless head slides out the window, and his body flops back onto the street. Carl, momentarily stunned, looks out at the cop lying in the road, then gets out of the car, bending down to hoist up the body.

The camera continues to track, revealing a couple in bed, asleep.

The policeman, wearing a uniform denoting his authority and duties in maintaining law and order, thoughtfully pats the fifty-dollar bill, a form of currency that traces its origins to the mid-19th century in the United States, into the bill-fold and hands it back into the car. Carl's nervous smile fades as there is a whimpering sound, reminiscent of distress commonly associated with fear or pain. The policeman hesitates, a cautious act often performed to reassess a situation, and leans forward into the car, listening to the now eerie silence. Grimsrud, whose violent nature is revealed in his abrupt actions, reaches across Carl, grabs the trooper by the hair, and slams his head down onto the car door, a move intended to incapacitate through blunt force. With his free hand, Grimsrud pops the glove compartment, a small storage area typically found in the dashboard of vehicles, brings a gun out, and reaches across Carl, shooting at the back of the trooper's head. Jean, presumably a passenger caught in this chaos, screams as he releases the policeman, whose head slides out the window and whose body flops back onto the street. Carl, possibly in shock but driven by a grim resolve, looks out at the cop in the road, gets out, and leans down to hoist up the body, an act of desperation to conceal the crime. Headlights appear: an oncoming car that Grimsrud notices as the car approaches, slowing. The car carries the silhouettes of two occupants in front, indicating potential witnesses, as Grimsrud slides into the driver's seat. The car accelerates, roars past, and away, leaving behind a trail of danger. Grimsrud squeals into a U-turn, a maneuver used to quickly reverse direction, the driver's door slamming shut with his spin. He takes the cigarette from his mouth and stubs it in his ashtray, a small receptacle for cigarette ash, commonly found in older car models. Small red tail lights, a safety feature designed to signal a vehicle's presence and actions, fishtail up ahead as Jean starts screaming in the back seat. The red tail lights ahead start to turn, and with a distant crunching sound, they disappear, signaling a potential accident. The headlights now show only empty road, ominously starting to turn the car. Grimsrud is not gaining on the tail lights, so he frowns and slows, indicating his calculated approach. The wrecked car's headlights shine off into a snowfield abutting the highway as Grimsrud applies brakes. Jean slides off the back seat and thumps into the leg-well, a compartment meant for comfort but here serving as a harsh landing zone. His headlights show the car up ahead off the road, crumpled around a telephone pole, an outdated but common infrastructure element that carries communication wires, having failed to hold a turn. Grimsrud sweeps his gun, a tool of violence and lethal force, off the front seat, opens his door, and gets out. A young man, dressed in a down parka designed for warmth in cold climates, is limping across the snowfield, away from the wrecked car. Grimsrud strides calmly out after the injured boy, raises his gun, and fires, a cold execution. With a poof of feathers, a hole opens up in the boy's back, and he pitches into the snow, a tragic expression of Grimsrud's ruthlessness. Grimsrud walks up to the wreck and peers in its half-open door, where a young woman is trapped inside the twisted wreckage, injured and unable to escape. Grimsrud raises his gun and fires, ending the struggle. A blue-winged teal, a species of duck known for its striking coloring and migratory habits, flies over a swampy marshland. The room in which it hangs is dark, and the continuing track reveals a couple in bed, sleeping in a state of vulnerability. The man, fortyish, pajama-clad, is big and big-bellied with his mouth agape, soundly asleep. He snores while his arms are flung over a woman in her thirties, wearing a nightie, mouth also open, not snoring but deeply asleep."

With her extra paw, Whiskers unzips the backpack, pulls a map out, and reaches over Marge, pointing at the back of the engineer's shoes. Lucy hollers as she releases the astronaut, whose foot slides out the window and whose coat flaps down onto the runway. Marge gazes out at the chef in the grass, steps out, and bends down to lift the hat. Signals appear: a distant kite that Whiskers spots as the kite approaches, hovering. Marge, with the engineer's hat lifted halfway up, is frozen in the signals. The kite holds the shadows of three birds in the sky as Whiskers slips into the passenger seat.

Whiskers strolls up to the kite and peers in its open door, where a young frog is lodged inside the crumpled kite, puzzled. Whiskers lifts her map and writes.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

          "description": "Carl nervously offers his wallet to a policeman, who accepts a bribe before hearing a noise. As the officer leans in, Grimsrud violently attacks him and shoots him through the head. Jean screams as the policeman's body falls onto the street. Carl attempts to move the body when another car with two people approaches, its occupants briefly illuminating the scene before driving past. Grimsrud pursues, but the car crashes into a telephone pole. Grimsrud exits his vehicle, gun in hand, and shoots a fleeing young man, who collapses into the snow. He then approaches the crashed car and fires at an injured woman trapped inside. The scene shifts to a dark room where a middle-aged couple sleeps, the man snoring loudly."
