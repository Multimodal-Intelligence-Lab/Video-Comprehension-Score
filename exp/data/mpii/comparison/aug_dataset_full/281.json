In a nearby apartment, Miss Torso lies face down on her divan bed, her back exposed and illuminated only by the soft glow of a reading lamp, wearing nothing but a pair of brief dark blue shorts. As she reads, she pauses to lift her torso slightly, brushing away the crumbs that have settled beneath her. Lisa leans forward from her seat to glance out the window, curious about what has caught Jeff's attention. She then turns to face him with a blank, questioning stare. Oblivious to her reaction, Jeff looks at her momentarily before his thoughts return to Miss Torso, though soon he shifts his attention elsewhere, deep in contemplation. Meanwhile, Lisa suddenly sits upright on the divan, swiftly reaching back to pull the overhead light on. Concurrently, the songwriter resumes his work in the nearby apartment, his music gaining new depth and melody. As he continues composing, trying various renditions to advance his theme, Lisa fixes her gaze on Jeff, who is visible over her shoulder, engrossed once again in the view outside the window. Her voice interrupts the moment, leading Jeff to raise a restraining hand, gesturing her to pause. Just then, the salesman appears in the corridor, carrying a large coil of sturdy rope slung over one shoulder. As he crosses from the living room into the bedroom, Jeff quickly grabs his binoculars to focus on the salesman's apartment. Observing this, Lisa, who has been lounging on the divan and watching Jeff, abruptly sits up. She stands, approaches Jeff, and, with the camera following her movement, unexpectedly swivels his chair around until his back faces the window, causing him to drop the binoculars onto his lap in surprise. As she leans over him, gripping the chair's sides, Jeff attempts to turn back toward the window, but she firmly holds the chair in place. With a slight adjustment, she positions the wheelchair to her left, directing his attention to the newlyweds' apartment where a dim light burns behind drawn shades. Jeff glances back at Lisa, humor dancing in his eyes as he suppresses a chuckle. She remains fixated on the view outside, engrossed in the scene, while his left hand comes to rest on the nearby telephone receiver.

She is reading a book held in one hand, a tattered mystery novel by Agatha Christie, while eating a sandwich in another, an iconic Reuben from the neighborhood deli. Miss Torso, a former ballet dancer renowned for her grace, is lying, face down, on her divan bed. The only light in the apartment is from a reading lamp, an antique from the 1930s. Her back is bare, and all she wears is a pair of brief dark blue shorts. At one point, she lifts her torso up slightly to brush crumbs out from beneath her, the remnants of her quick snack. Lisa leans forward and looks out the window, curious to see what Jeff is referring to. She turns back to him with a blank stare, perplexed by his comments. Jeff turns and looks at her, quite unaware of her surprise at his comment, absorbed in his own thoughts. He looks away from Miss Torso, thoughtfully contemplating the complexities of urban life. Lisa sits bolt upright on the divan, suddenly recognizing the tension in the air. She reaches back quickly and pulls on the overhead light, a bright fixture that illuminates the cozy room. He is beginning his song again, the songwriter who lives across the courtyard, and it has taken on new fullness and melody, inspired by his recent experiences. At that moment, the songwriter returns to his composing, determined to finish his creation. Although it is not complete, it is farther along than before, and he plays his theme a number of different ways, trying to move it note by note to its completion, reminiscent of the works of Gershwin.

Jeff is staring out of the window again, captivated by the scenes around him. Over this, we hear Lisa's voice, filled with a mixture of curiosity and concern. Jeff puts out a restraining hand, calming her before she speaks. At last, the salesman, known for his odd hours and mysterious demeanor, is seen coming along the corridor. Slung over one shoulder, with his arm through it, is a large coil of sturdy rope, a tool of his trade. He goes through the living room into the bedroom, continuing his nightly routine. Jeff reaches quickly for his binoculars, intrigued by the salesman's actions, and trains them on the salesman's apartment.

He drops the binoculars into his lap in surprise, startled by her assertiveness. The camera moves in as Lisa leans over Jeff, gripping both sides of his chair, her determination evident. Jeff tries to turn around, but she won't let the chair move, standing firm in her resolution. She turns the wheelchair slightly to her left so that he can see the newlyweds' apartment, a cozy nook decorated with love and promise. A dim light burning behind them casts a warm glow. The drawn shades of the newlyweds' apartment suggest privacy and intimacy. Jeff looks, turns back to her, trying to suppress a chuckle at the situation's absurdity.

Dave leaps calmly for his telescope, and fixes them on the librarian's office. Carla, still curled up on the carpet blinking at Dave, suddenly leaps upwards and then, skipping down to Dave, the spotlight coming with her. In an instant boredom stunt, he spins his cot partially sideways so that his front is to the closet. He tosses the telescope onto his head in boredom. The spotlight shifts out as Carla crouches under Dave, lifting both sides of his cot. Dave struggles to twist forward, but she won't let the cot shift. He flips the bedside lightly to his right so that she can feel the campers' office. A bright noise hissing before them. The furled curtains of the campers' office.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
