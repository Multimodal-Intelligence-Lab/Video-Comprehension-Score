The jeep travels to a bustling research facility, where upon arrival, Jackson takes a moment to smooth back his black hair with his hand.

Later, Jackson is seated in his limo, busy typing on his laptop when he suddenly notices Charlie nearby, who is broadcasting from an RV surrounded by newspaper clippings. Charlie, with a beard that is noticeably darker than his unkempt long hair, glances around cautiously before leaning in close to the camera. Jackson's expression changes to one of skepticism, but he eventually nods with an air of calm acceptance. Meanwhile, inside a supermarket, Gordon embraces Kate affectionately. She offers a playful smirk as outside, a crack forms in the parking lot, rumbling ominously beneath a car and moving toward another. The crack continues its path into the supermarket, leading Gordon to quickly find an item nearby and hand it to Kate at the checkout. As a customer's trolley slowly rolls away unattended, a crack emerges on the floor beneath it. Cereal boxes start to tremble and rattle as Kate instinctively reaches out to steady them, only for a substantial fissure to tear through the floor between her and the shelves.

Seated beside the glamorous, young, blonde Tamara, Uri turns his attention to his mobile phone, pressing his thumb against the screen to authenticate his identity. Uri then looks up with a blank expression, stands, and exits the arena, checking the time on his watch as he moves through the crowd, all while Tamara rises and calls out to him, trying to catch his attention. Noticing Uri's departure, Sultan, a fighter in the ring, is struck by a massive hit and rushes toward the canvas, feeling the urgency of the moment. Meanwhile, Jackson remains behind the wheel of the limo, driving while the kids gradually drift off to sleep in the back seat, their eyes closing in the gentle motion of the vehicle."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

          "description": "Jackson, sitting in an army jeep with his kids and soldiers, arrives at a research facility to meet Professor West. Adrienne, in conversation with Satnam online, notices Jackson with Lily and Noah. At Yellowstone, Charlie spies on them as night falls. Adrienne boards a helicopter, while Anheuser, in the White House, observes from his office. At the campsite, Jackson uses Google Maps to check Yellowstone. Noah sends a text, which Jackson intercepts. Meanwhile, Charlie broadcasts from an RV as Jackson watches. In a supermarket, Gordon and Kate encounter cracks appearing in the floor, causing chaos. At Yellowstone, Lily scratches, and Noah looks concerned. In the White House, Anheuser enters the situation room, while in a boxing arena, Uri checks his phone, leaves abruptly, and Sultan is hit during the fight. Jackson drives his kids in a limo as they sleep in the back seat."
