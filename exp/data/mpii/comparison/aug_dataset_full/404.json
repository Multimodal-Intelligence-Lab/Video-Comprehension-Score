Fergus looks to the man down in the street, a parody of rejection with his things in his arms, echoing scenes common in break-up dramas. Dil grabs a large goldfish bowl, reminiscent of a domestic aquarium often used to keep ornamental fish, and flings it down, which breaks to bits on the pavement, and goldfish thrash around in the street, desperately struggling for the water they need to survive. Upstairs, Dil closes the window shut. Fergus stands as Dil hands him a glass, and he walks past a photograph, likely of sentimental or nostalgic value, and sits down. He looks from her to the picture, nods toward it, and she looks down into her drink, perhaps contemplating the image's emotional weight. They fall into one another's arms, and she stretches up with her whole body over him as they grow suddenly and violently passionate, with the photograph above them seeming to smile, an artistic depiction of approval or irony. He draws up her dress with his hands, but she suddenly pulls away, comes up toward him once more, opens the buttons on his shirt, and her mouth travels down his chest. Fergus tries to draw her up toward him, but her hand reaches up to his mouth and presses his head back while her other hand undoes his pants, kisses his stomach, and her mouth moves down his body. Fergus stares at the picture of Jody, whose eyes seem to burn through him, a haunting reminder of a deeper relationship or past trauma. Dil raises her head and kisses his mouth, with tears in his eyes possibly indicating internal conflict or vulnerability.

She embraces him, sits back down in front of the mirror, and Fergus leaves as she reapplies her lipstick, a ritual that can signify regaining composure. A singer in a blue dress performs, evoking a classic cabaret or jazz club atmosphere, while Dil and Fergus are by the bar, both drinking drinks with colorful umbrellas, often signifying tropical or festive cocktails. Dave comes up behind them with his neck brace, a sign of recent injury or surgery, stands, and steps two feet back, while Fergus takes Dil's arm. The woman is singing, Dil holds her cheek close to his, looks at him out of the corner of her eye, draws back, looks at him, and dances closer. In the bar, people sing along with the music as Col sings, a name suggesting a regular performer or local favorite, and Dave sits at the bar sulking. She puts her cheek against his, and Dave slams his drink down, stands up to leave, and on the stage, the act finishes, possibly signaling the end of a set or the climax of emotion. Dil draws Fergus back to the bar, Col, the barman, pours her drink, and Col pours and smiles, indicating familiarity or an ongoing rapport. He drinks, grimaces, as strong spirits often provoke, she throws it back in one, takes the bottle herself, fills their glasses, slams it back, and he sips as she tilts his glass back, and he swallows it in one. She enters; Fergus walks in slowly, and he looks from the cricket whites, traditionally worn for the genteel sport of cricket, symbolizing a connection to a past or different cultural aspect, that are hanging up behind a curtain to the photographs, which may chronicle personal or shared history."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
