Camille eliminates a gunman with a boat hook, then the dinghy turns for another pass.

Fire was opened by the general's men while a struggle was caused between Camille and Bond, and the boat was swerved sideways. Control was regained by Bond, and a hail of bullets was ducked by them as the inflatable was stared at straight. A gunman was taken out by Camille with a boat hook, then another run is made by the inflatable. Fountains of spray were kicked up by the swerving boats, and more boats were crashed through by Bond as frantic hand signals were exchanged by their pursuers to coordinate a two-boat attack. The two inflatables were sped at head-on by Bond, crashing between them and men were sent sprawling. A weapon was wrestled with by one gunman as an engine was rammed by Bond, which was exploded. The wheel was grabbed by Bond as the other boat was closed in, the chase was heading for the tightly packed marina. The throttle was backed off by Bond, causing the other boat to rear-end them so hard their stern was mounted, knocking Camille down. With the two boats locked together, a grappling hook was grabbed by Bond and was thrown into the inflatable. The rope was unrolled and became taut, and the inflatable was hurled away from their boat. The boat was turned around in calm water by Bond and the scene was headed away from with barely a backward glance. With Camille unconscious in the bottom of the boat, a quiet inlet with rolling tree-covered highlands was headed from by Bond towards a landing stage near a development of opulent white buildings. The boat was stopped at the jetty by him and Camille was carried through crowds of retirement-aged tourists, and she was dumped on a puzzled member of staff. Luxury yachts being maneuvered on trailers were walked past by Bond and the GPS tracker on his phone was consulted. A 4 by 4 with its door open was approached by him, the yard was glanced around, then the wheel was slipped behind. Run-down suburbs were driven through and a call was made to his neat glass-partitioned headquarters. Meanwhile, M's office was headed for by an agent, and two black 4 by 4s were arrived at an airfield. Dominic Greene and his guard were getting out of the car; an executive jet was walked onto by Greene. Greene and the black agent with a beard were carried off by the plane. Sugar was added to coffee by the thin German, turbulence was hit as a comfort break was returned from by Greene, and he was glared at by the black agent. A noncommittal look was given by Greene, while a cold smile was given by his colleague and Beam Bond's photo was shown on his camera. The phone was tossed to the surly agent, who studied the picture, closed the phone, and handed it back, then eyeballed his colleague. The jet was taxied outside a hangar, and a car was got into by Greene, a glance was given up at the CIA agents, and a grin was given. A bitter smile was given by Felix, then Beam was followed up the plane's steps."

Meanwhile, the general, consumed by a burning rage, points vehemently and bellows orders with all the authority he can muster. In a flash, an inflatable boat takes off rapidly, joining the pursuit with urgency. The general's men quickly commence firing, unleashing a barrage of bullets that fill the air, while Camille and Bond, amidst the chaos, battle to keep their balance. The boat they occupy begins to swerve chaotically from side to side. With his remarkable reflexes and steady hand, Bond regains control of the vessel, allowing them to duck under the relentless hail of bullets, all the while keeping their eyes fixed on the approaching inflatable boat with unwavering focus. Displaying her quick thinking and resourcefulness, Camille deftly uses a boat hook to eliminate a gunman. The inflatable boat pivots around aggressively, preparing for yet another daring approach. As the swerving boats tear through the water, they send up dramatic fountains of spray, creating a spectacle of chaos. Bond crashes through several more boats in the tumultuous waters as their determined pursuers frantically exchange hand signals, trying desperately to coordinate a well-timed two-boat attack. With fearless precision and nerve, Bond steers directly at the two inflatables, crashing decisively between them and sending the men inside sprawling helplessly into the water. One gunman struggles with his malfunctioning weapon as Bond rams into an engine, which suddenly erupts with a loud and startling explosion. Bond swiftly regains control, grabbing the wheel just as the other boat closes in, the chase now hurtling towards the crowded and tightly packed marina. With strategic foresight, Bond throttles back, causing the pursuing boat to collide with such force that it mounts their stern, effectively knocking Camille down. The two entangled boats now locked together, Bond seizes a grappling hook and expertly throws it into the inflatable. The rope unfurls and stretches taut, violently yanking the inflatable away from their own boat. Turning the boat around in the now calm water, Bond speeds away from the chaotic scene with hardly a backward glance. Camille, having been knocked unconscious, lies at the bottom of the boat as Bond steers from a serene inlet, surrounded by rolling hills covered in lush trees, towards a landing stage near a development of opulent, gleaming white buildings. Here, he stops the boat at the jetty and carries Camille through crowds of curious, retirement-aged tourists, depositing her with a bewildered member of staff. Bond passes by luxury yachts being maneuvered on trailers, consulting the GPS tracker on his phone for further directions. He proceeds to a 4 by 4 with its door invitingly open, casting a cautious glance around the yard before slipping behind the wheel. Driving through rundown suburbs, he makes a crucial call to his neat, glass-partitioned headquarters. Concurrently, an agent heads purposefully towards M's office, and two black 4 by 4s arrive at an airfield. Dominic Greene, alongside his guard, exits the vehicle with confidence and strides onto an executive jet. The plane, with Greene and the black agent sporting a beard aboard, takes off smoothly into the skies. The thin German, a passenger, stirs sugar into his coffee, and as turbulence hits, Greene returns from a brief comfort break. The black agent glares at him with a suspicion that cannot be easily masked. Greene, maintaining a facade of indifference, while his colleague offers a cold, calculating smile and reveals Bond's photo on his camera to Beam. The phone is casually tossed to the surly agent, who scrutinizes the picture with intense focus. Closing the phone with a decisive snap, he hands it back and exchanges a knowing glance with his colleague. As the jet taxis outside a hangar, Greene steps into a car, casting a triumphant glance upwards at the CIA agents.

Samantha dispatches a skateboarder with a fishing net, then the skateboard veers for another approach. The veering hovercrafts spray fountains of popcorn, and Dracula shatters through more hovercrafts as their followers swap frantic semaphore signals to orchestrate a dual-hovercraft maneuver. Dracula glides at the two skateboards head-on, weaving between them and sending acrobats tumbling. One skateboarder breakdances with his propeller as Dracula collides with a windmill, which combusts. Dracula seizes the helm as the other hovercraft draws near, the pursuit heading for the densely packed carnival. Dracula taps the brakes, causing the other hovercraft to nudge them so hard it catapults onto their deck, jolting Samantha. With the two hovercrafts entangled, Dracula snatches a lasso and casts it into the skateboard. The coil unfurls and cinches tight, propelling the skateboard away from their hovercraft. Dracula pivots the hovercraft around on tranquil water and drifts away from the commotion with hardly a glance back.

He halts the hovercraft at the pier and carries Samantha through swarms of retirement-aged performers, depositing her on a baffled staff member. Dracula strolls past opulent sailboats being maneuvered on cranes and checks the map app on his wristwatch.

The lanky Frenchman stirs honey into tea, turbulence strikes as Blue emerges from a meditation session, and the bearded agent scowls at him. Blue appears indifferent, while his associate grins icily and reveals Dr. Dracula's portrait on his tablet.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

He drives through suburbs, contacting headquarters, while an agent heads to M’s office. Meanwhile, Dominic Greene boards a jet with agents, including a black agent studying Bond’s photo. As the jet prepares for takeoff, Greene observes the CIA agents, grins, and Felix follows Beam onto the plane."
