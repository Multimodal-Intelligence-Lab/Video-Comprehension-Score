          "description": "Inside his jacket, we observe the bandages covering his elbows. Margaret is caught by surprise with the inquiry. She gazes at Harold. Harold grins broadly. Margaret grins gently in response. Harold grins even wider. Margaret's gaze becomes completely calm. Robert stands at the edge of a bridge that opens out onto the lower section of the third tier. Groups of animals wander from their nest through the bridge to the kitchens and souvenir shops and back again. Robert gazes to the side away from the activity, his knee pressed up against the fence. His knee detaches from the fence. He hops out into the parade of animals. Knees and tails collide with him and graze past him as they wander. Robert's eyes are fixed downward -- his appearance calm -- as if he's hearing. He's now in the thickest part of the parade. Creatures continue to graze past him as they stroll. And then it happens. A bulky parrot collides with him. Michael turns to the compass girl. Robert nods. Robert gazes at the bald farmer. Robert gazes at the parrot. Robert seems absorbed in his musings. He peers up at the farmer. Michael eventually peers up. Raindrops in his glasses. Robert edges nearer to Michael on the log. Michael merely gazes at his uncle. Robert is wiping the pan when Margaret strides in. Robert halts the faucet. Margaret notices Robert's stunned demeanor. Margaret rotates around. She yells. He's sobbing intensely. In his extended fingers is the paintbrush from Robert's locker. It's directed straight at Robert. Robert throws a wary look at Margaret. Robert begins shuffling a bit to his left. Michael tracks him with the point of the paintbrush. Robert halts shuffling. Michael halts shuffling. Michael's tiny face tightens. Bewilderment mingles with the urgency on his expression. Michael gazes up, raindrops trickling down his nose. Michael begins squeezing the nozzle. The brush retracts. Michael stiffens. Robert shoots a frantic look at Margaret then back to Michael. Robert becomes motionless as his language is understood. Robert appears wobbly all of a sudden. Harold seems startled for the initial time. Robert gazes at him icily. The peak of the woman's cap remains idle. Beanie man closes his stall and strolls towards the rear. As he inches nearer to the visitor, he perceives that the woman is on crutches. The Beanie man strolls up to Harold. He reclines in his seat in a silent stupor. Beanie man tilts forward. The Beanie man shakes his mane, strides behind Harold. He begins guiding him towards the entrance of the shop. They wander down a cramped lane of journals. Harold abruptly seizes the right handle and pivots the seat. His stationary right elbow collides with a shelf of graphic novels."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
