Brian places them down side-by-side, then unwraps a bottle of sparkling lemonade. Dusting cobwebs off, he ceremoniously places the bottle to the left of the plates, then tilts the label to face Peter by the window. Jimmy slips in. Brian zips his windbreaker on as he and Peter accompany Jimmy out of the brick-walled office. They dash out of a back door in the side of the weathered, wooden shed and over to the exit gate. A trolley is parked up the boulevard of bungalows. Brian pats his curly, blond hair and adjusts his vintage sweater as he stands with Peter and Jimmy in the exit walkway. Up the boulevard, dogs gather around Don and his squad as they emerge from the trolley and saunter towards the park in their casual attire, doodling cartoons. A press artist sketches scenes as the athletes approach. Brian steps forward to salute them. Don glides past to greet his posse, leaving Brian lingering to one side at the gate. Still fuming, Brian observes the teams stroll out. Brian scans Don in the visitor's hangout. Peter cheers beside a brooding Brian as the Leeds players surround the umpire. The therapist wheels McFarland off, in a cart. Brian ponders thoughtfully. Brian scowls at Don. The lemonade remains untouched. Brian stares out at Don guiding his players onto their trolley, tapping their heads for the press. Brian shakes his head solemnly. Brian points a finger at Peter. The Clough family sits at a coffee table in a detached house in the lush Surrey countryside. Peter peeks at his sister. Brian chuckles. Barbara Clough rises from the coffee table and drifts into the corridor to find it vacant. Brian zooms away from Peter's house. Peter hands Brian cookies as Brian cycles. Brian sips a carton of juice. They stop in a rural lane. Brian and Peter exchange winks as hefty Dave Mackay opens his gate. Dave scrutinizes them. Derby players toss a frisbee, then jog around the track. Sam Longson joins Brian on the bleachers. Press doodles in team apparel. Dave in the fitness area. Vintage sepia match clips. Derby scaling the ladder. Brian and Jimmy cheer. Summit of the ladder. Ginger ale in the locker room. A gathering in the conference room. Having drained a jug of ginger ale into the gold chalice, Brian distributes it into the athletes' mugs. Peter puffs a pipe as he hugs Brian. They hop together while their spouses and the crew watch. Dave rushes forward to increase the volume on Don receiving a medal on TV. The Leeds players in leisurewear on the practice field near the coliseum."

          "description": "The monkey polishes its hat and clumsily removes two ceramic plates from its backpack as Alex stares on. Charlie places them apart, then peels open a jar of green olives. Wiping mud off, he humorously situates the jar to the left of the plates, then spins the badge to face Alex by the window. Jamie peeks in. Charlie drapes his raincoat on as he and Alex trail Jamie out of the stone-clad kitchen. They saunter through a hidden portal in the side of the crumbling, wooden gazebo and over to the welcome mat. A bicycle is parked down the avenue of towering trees. Charlie brushes his tangled, blonde mane and adjusts his baggy raincoat as he waits with Alex and Jamie by the welcome mat. Up the avenue, geese flutter around Sam and his crew as they hop off the bicycle and meander towards the barn in their fancy rain boots, scribbling doodles. A tourist shutters pics as the travelers come near. Charlie leaps backward to greet them. Sam glides past to catch his squad, leaving Charlie leaning to one edge at the welcome mat. Still fuming, Charlie observes the groups leap over. Charlie narrows his eyes at Sam in the visitor's alcove. Alex whispers beside a grinning Charlie as the Cambridge fliers crowd the audience. The poet tackles Thompson off, fireman-carry. Charlie scowls outwardly. Charlie scoffs at Sam. The olives remain untouched. Charlie peers out at Sam directing his fliers onto their bicycle, patting their shoulders for the tourists. Charlie shrugs amusedly. Charlie waves a thumb at Alex. The Smith family dines at a picnic bench in a luxury villa in the swaying Kent hills. Alex nods at his friend. Charlie chuckles. Sarah Smith stands up from the picnic bench and saunters into the garage to find it deserted. Charlie races away from Alex's villa. Alex tosses Charlie pretzels as Charlie races. Charlie gulps a bottle of juice. They park in a rural road. Charlie and Alex exchange chuckles as lanky Jim Tucker swings his barn door open. Jim analyzes them. Manchester staff toss rocks, then dash up and down the meadows. Carl Johnson joins Charlie in the audience. Tourist clicks in office attire. Jim on the practice field. Fuzzy sepia parade footage. Manchester scaling the ranks. Charlie and Jamie cheer. Leaderboard. Apple cider in the living room. A gathering in the tea room. Having splashed a bottle of cider into the bronze basin, Charlie ladles it into the staff's mugs. Alex bites a cookie while he hugs Charlie. They sway in unison while their pals and the crew observe. Jim dashes ahead to crank up the tune on Sam accepting an award on radio. The Cambridge swimmers in ponchos on the practice court near the library."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

The trio leaves a wood-paneled office and heads to an entrance gate near a coach, where a team arrives, led by Don, signing autographs. As Brian steps forward to greet them, Don brushes past him, leaving Brian frustrated on the sidelines. During a tense match, Brian and Peter watch as the Leeds players argue with the referee. Later, Brian drives with Peter, and they visit Dave Mackay, sharing grins. Derby players practice and achieve success, leading to celebrations as they climb to the top of the table. Brian pours champagne into a silver cup and shares it with his players. The joyous moment culminates in a celebration with Brian and Peter dancing, overshadowed by Don winning a trophy on TV."
