He observes a moment, then cautiously lifts the field glasses again. He pivots and again glances out of the pane. The individual is now shifting out of the sitting room, and the field glasses track him through to the small cookery, which is seen through a side pane. The individual begins to occupy himself in this cookery with his back to us, but the image is very dissatisfactory. Jeff lowers the field glasses, and there is an expression of vexation on his visage. He tosses the field glasses down, and then looks about him. He retreats his seat up swiftly toward the main cupboard on his left. He inclines down, opens a cupboard door, and extracts a long-focus lens. From a ledge above, he extracts a small Exacta camera. He swiftly removes the existing lens and places the telephoto lens in its stead. He wheels himself back to the pane and raises the camera to his eye. Through the viewfinder of the camera, we are now brought into close proximity with the vendor in his compact cookery. His back is still to us. He half-turns and grasps a used periodical. He unfurls it along the drainboard. From the basin, he extracts a large butcher's blade and a long, narrow saw. They vanish from sight as he places them on the periodical and proceeds to enfold them. Having finalized his task, he emerges from the cookery toting the periodical-wrapped package. For a moment, he is obscured behind the barrier that separates the cookery alcove from the sitting room. Jeff lowers the camera for a moment and observes tensely. Abruptly, he raises it to his eye again. Half of an individual's physique is now visible in the sitting room. He sits down on a sofa with a display of exhaustion. He is not toting anything. Then the vendor pivots and shifts to the center of the room. He yawns and extends out of sight at full length on the sofa. Jeff lowers the camera. He observes the sitting room for a moment, then his eye travels briefly back to the cookery and returns to the sitting room. The thermometer outside of Jeff's pane registers 83 degrees. The camera pans off to the left until it comes to rest on the composer's studio. He is attired only in swimming trunks and is vigorously tidying his rug with a carpet sweeper. In the midst of his sweeping, he halts, hurries a step or two to the piano, and plays a couple of tones with one hand while he stands."

At this point, the man has begun moving out of the living room, and through the lens of the binoculars, Jeff pans to follow him into the modest kitchen, which is visible through a smaller side window. There, the man proceeds to busy himself with various tasks in this small kitchen, his back turned to us, though the resulting image is far from satisfactory. With a look of clear exasperation, Jeff lowers the binoculars, an expression of frustration evident on his face. He tosses the binoculars aside in annoyance and glances about the room. He quickly maneuvers his wheelchair backward toward the main cabinet situated on his left side. Leaning down, he opens a cupboard door and retrieves a long-focus lens from inside.

He slightly adjusts his position and once again directs his gaze out of the window. At this particular juncture, the man in question has commenced moving out of the living room, and through the lens of the binoculars, Jeff skillfully pans to track him into the small, modest kitchen, which is visible through a secondary, smaller side window. There, within this small culinary space, the man busies himself with various unidentified tasks, his back turned to our view, although the resulting image is decidedly unsatisfactory. Displaying an expression of clear exasperation, Jeff lowers the binoculars cautiously, the frustration evident on his face. In his irritation, he tosses the binoculars aside and casts a glance around the room. He swiftly maneuvers his wheelchair backward toward the prominent main cabinet situated on his left side. Leaning down with intent, he opens a cupboard door and carefully retrieves a specialized long-focus lens from within. From an upper shelf, he selects a small Exacta camera. With swift, practiced movements, he removes the existing lens and adeptly replaces it with the telephoto lens, preparing it for immediate use. He then efficiently wheels himself back to the window and raises the camera to his eye, peering through the precise viewfinder. This new perspective brings us into a closer, more intimate view of the salesman situated within his compact kitchen environment.

          "description": "Upon completing the meticulous cleaning of the case, the salesman carefully places it onto the floor, prompting Jeff to swiftly lower his binoculars and retreat a few inches, maintaining a safe but curious distance. As he observes intently for a moment, his curiosity compels him to cautiously lift the binoculars once more, adjusting his focus by turning and allowing his gaze to sweep out of the window anew. Through the lenses, he tracks the salesman as he exits the living room and moves steadily into the small kitchen, visible only through a side window. The salesman begins to busily engage in activities within the kitchen, presenting his back to the observer, yet the image remains blurry and unsatisfactory, causing Jeff to lower the binoculars in frustration. His face portraying exasperation, he hastily discards the binoculars and scans his immediate surroundings. Backing up his wheelchair swiftly toward the main cabinet on his left, he leans forward, opens a cupboard door, and extracts a long-focus lens. Simultaneously reaching to a shelf above, he retrieves a small Exacta camera, deftly unscrews the existing lens, and attaches the telephoto lens in its stead. With urgency, he wheels himself back to the window and eagerly raises the camera to his eye. Through the viewfinder, the scene becomes sharply detailed as we are now drawn into closer proximity with the salesman, who continues his activities in the cramped kitchen with his back facing us. He makes a half-turn to retrieve a used newspaper, spreading it out methodically along the drainboard. From the depths of the sink, he produces a large butcher's knife followed by a long, narrow saw, placing them upon the newspaper and wrapping them with deliberate care. Upon completing this meticulous task, he steps out of the kitchen, the newspaper-wrapped parcel carried discreetly, momentarily vanishing behind the wall that divides the kitchen recess from the living room. Jeff, gripped by tension, lowers the camera momentarily to watch the unfolding scene with bated breath. Abruptly resuming his surveillance, he raises the camera once more to view half of the man's body reappearing in the living room. The salesman, wearing an air of exhaustion, collapses onto the couch, evidently unburdened by any objects. As he turns and moves toward the room's center, he stifles a yawn and stretches out of sight at full length on the couch. Jeff lowers the camera, his focus alternating between the now-empty living room and the kitchen, his mind piecing together the scene. The thermometer outside his window reads a sweltering 83 degrees. Redirecting his focus, the camera pans leftward until settling upon the songwriter's studio, capturing the scene of the songwriter himself, clad only in bathing trunks, as he energetically cleans his rug with a carpet sweeper. Engrossed in his task, he abruptly pauses, hurries to the piano with a couple of hurried steps, and playfully strikes a few notes with one hand while remaining in a standing position."

The man is now moving out of the living room, and the binoculars pan him through to the small kitchen, which is seen through a side window that provides limited visibility. The man starts to busy himself in this kitchen with his back to us, but the image is very unsatisfactory due to the angle. Jeff lowers the binoculars, and there is an expression of exasperation on his face, a reflection of his growing frustration. He throws the binoculars down, and then looks about him, considering his next move. He backs his chair up quickly toward the main cabinet on his left, which houses various photographic equipment. He leans down, opens a cupboard door, and takes out a long-focus lens known for its clarity over distance. From a shelf above, he takes a small Exacta camera, a high-quality model favored by many photographers of the era. He quickly takes off the existing lens and puts on the telephoto lens in its place to improve his view. He wheels himself back to the window and raises the camera to his eye. Through the viewfinder of the camera, a tool of precision, we are now brought into close proximity with the salesman in his little kitchen. His back is still to us, obscuring much of his activity. He half-turns and takes a used newspaper, common for wrapping items. He spreads it open along the drainboard. From the sink, he takes out a large butcher's knife and a long, narrow saw, tools that suggest he might be engaging in more than simple food preparation.

The camera pans off to the left until it comes to rest on the songwriter's studio. He is dressed only in bathing trunks, appropriate for the heat, and is vigorously cleaning his rug with a carpet sweeper, a necessary task to maintain his workspace. In the middle of his sweeping, he stops, hurries a step or two to the piano, and plays a couple of notes with one hand while he stands, perhaps inspired by a sudden musical idea."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby cafÃ©, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
