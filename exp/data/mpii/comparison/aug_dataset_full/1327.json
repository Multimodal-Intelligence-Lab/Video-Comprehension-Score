Bob, feeling the urgency of the situation, heads back into the diner, where he finds Kyle seated comfortably at the counter, enjoying a plate of golden banana pancakes. Just as Kyle prepares to strike up a conversation with Bob once more, Bob's focus is suddenly drawn elsewhere.\n\nThe flickering, unstable image on the television screen catches his attention. Despite several attempts to clear the image, it remains unsteady until Bob gives it a firm slap, causing the picture to finally snap into clarity. It reveals the stark, unmistakable graphic of the Emergency Broadcasting System, accompanied by its chilling, hollow tone that fills the entire diner, capturing the attention of everyone inside. At this moment, all activities cease as every patron turns to stare at the TV. Bob, hoping for different news, changes channels only to find they all display the same dire message. Feeling an unusual sense of urgency, he steps off the chair and moves backward, as if increasing the physical distance might somehow improve the situation. In doing so, he accidentally bumps into Kyle, who quickly maneuvers around Percy.\n\nMeanwhile, Charlie is busy clearing the dishes from the Andersons' table, yet every patron's gaze remains fixated on the television screen. Kyle, clearly irritated, picks up the phone to retry a call, and everyone around him seems to instinctively look at Howard, seeking reassurance. At this moment, Kyle reappears in the diner, and outside, Jeep is diligently working under the hood of a U-Haul truck. An elderly lady turns to speak to the Andersons just as a pesky fly begins to buzz annoyingly around Gladys's head, though she merely smiles in an oddly unsettling way. Sandra, unsure of how to interpret the old woman's expression, nods in acknowledgment as the fly crawls across her cheek, yet she shows no sign of discomfort.\n\nHoward and Sandra exchange concerned glances as the diner door jingles, announcing Jeep's entrance. He quietly approaches Bob for a discreet conversation, ensuring he keeps a watchful eye on the peculiar old lady near the Andersons. Across the buzzing diner, Charlie places a juicy, blood-red steak in front of Gladys, resting a comforting hand on her own belly. As a fly lands on the steak, Charlie attempts to shoo it away, only for another to promptly take its place, prompting her to pause in her actions. Kyle watches the scene unfold from his vantage point at the counter while Charlie shakes her head in disapproval at Gladys. She slaps the check down on the table with a sense of finality and briskly walks back to the kitchen, passing by Jeep and Bob along the way.\n\nGladys, seemingly unfazed, begins to laugh innocently as she continues eating her meat, even as flies swarm around her with sudden intensity. This sight shocks Sandra and Howard, who are left baffled, wondering how so many flies could have possibly gotten into the diner. Sandra hastily covers her mouth, and everyone's attention shifts squarely onto the enigmatic old lady. Howard rises to his feet, and panic spreads when he suddenly collapses to the floor. In a frenetic response, Gladys springs to her feet, overturning her table, with blood smeared across her face and chest in a gruesome display. Percy is the first to react, grabbing a hefty metal frying pan from behind the counter and hurling it with force at Gladys, causing her head to snap sideways from the impact."

Kyle seems poised to speak, but before he can utter a word, Bob's attention is abruptly diverted elsewhere. The television screen captures his focus, its image flickering intermittently. He tries to fix it, without improvement, until a decisive wallop from him finally snaps the picture into clear focus, revealing the stark graphic of the Emergency Broadcasting System. This image, paired with its hollow tone, reverberates throughout the diner, causing everyone to freeze and redirect their eyes towards the TV. In an attempt to find normalcy, Bob switches through the channels, only to discover they all display the same broadcast, inducing him to step off the chair and instinctively back away, as if putting distance between himself and the unsettling broadcast would help. In his retreat, he inadvertently bumps into Kyle, who is maneuvering past Percy just as Charlie clears dishes at the Andersons' table. Despite the activity, everyone's attention remains glued to the TV. Feeling frustrated, Kyle picks up the phone and redials, his eyes conveying tension, while everyone else looks expectantly at Howard. In the midst of this tension, Kyle reappears in the scene, while outside, Jeep is focused on working under a Uhaul's hood. Meanwhile, an old lady turns her attention to the Andersons as a fly starts to buzz persistently around Gladys's head. Despite the annoyance, Gladys smiles in a way that seems off. Unsure of how to interpret this interaction, Sandra nods at the old woman, even as the fly lands and crawls across her cheek unheeded. Howard and Sandra exchange perplexed looks just as the door jingles with Jeep's arrival. He quietly pulls Bob aside for a private conversation, all the while keeping a cautious eye on the peculiar old lady near the Andersons.

Observing from the counter, Kyle watches as Charlie gives Gladys a disapproving shake of her head, then decisively slaps the check down on the table and strides towards the kitchen, passing by Jeep and Bob. Meanwhile, Gladys begins to laugh innocently as if unaffected, continuing to eat her meat as an unexpected swarm of flies gathers, startling Sandra and Howard, who are baffled by the sheer number suddenly present. With disbelief etched on her face, Sandra covers her mouth, and the collective focus now centers on the old lady. In a moment fraught with tension, Howard stands up, but chaos erupts when he collapses to the floor, causing panic to ripple through the diner.

Kyle is about to speak to Bob again when Bob's attention is stolen elsewhere. The image flickers on the TV, an outdated model notorious for poor reception, but doesn't improve until Bob gives it a final wallop, and the picture snaps into focus on the stark graphic of the Emergency Broadcasting System, a service used to deliver urgent messages to the public, accompanied by its hollow tone, filling the diner.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby cafÃ©, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
