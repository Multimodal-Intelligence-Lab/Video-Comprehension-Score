As Dumbledore spins around, smiles, raises his eyebrows, nods, and then backs away, Harry rises. The old man vanishes into the whiteness after turning around again. In the forest, the ground has Voldemort lying on it, and Bellatrix is pushed aside by him to see Harry lying motionless. Narcissa Malfoy strides towards the body while Bellatrix stares. Narcissa checks Harry's pulse after a glance back and a lean down. Wide-eyed, her look is directed down with an imperceptible nod as she remains crouched for a moment, watched keenly by Hagrid. Narcissa turns to face Voldemort with a solemn expression after rising. Over rubble in the courtyard, a lone figure is staggering; it's Neville, who bends down to pick up the Sorting Hat, dusting it off, holding it upside down, and looking into it as reflection plays on his face. A slow procession of people in the distance is seen by him as he looks up, and the procession is headed towards the school as it trudges along. A giant's body is moved aside by Voldemort, which falls from the bridge, and a large army of Death Eaters is trooping across. Still clutching the Sorting Hat, Neville slithers at Voldemort's side into the courtyard. Ginny is pulled back by Arthur as Ron and Hermione stand horrified and open-mouthed. Voldemort turns to his Death Eaters, and Lucius, calling out, draws all eyes to his son, Draco. His hand is stretched out, his lips are pursed by Lucius, and towards his parents, Draco sets off as McGonagall and the students watch grim-faced. Draco's parents are joined by him, and her arm is put around him by Narcissa, leading him into the crowd of Death Eaters. Forward, Neville shuffles as Voldemort's face twitches, and the bony fingers of his left hand are flexed by him. At Seamus, Neville glares, his hand on his heart, and defiantly, he stares at Voldemort. As the sword is drawn from the Sorting Hat by him, from Hagrid's arms, Harry leaps; Nagini is bounced off by his spell, and for cover, he runs. His wand is used by Voldemort to shoot fire at Harry, prompting several Death Eaters to make their escape as the school is entered by the students and the attackers are deflected by Shacklebolt. The Sword of Gryffindor is hit by a flash, catapulting Neville backward, and their escape across the bridge is made by the Malfoys. Alone, Harry is, clutching his wand, walking backward, and turning sharply. As movement is heard, he spins, fires, and a door frame is hit by him, with three bodies lying on the ground. As Voldemort apparates at the main staircase, he runs. Behind a wall, Harry hides, clutching a Basilisk fang, and as Voldemort climbs the main staircase, he shows himself. Each other's energy blasts are fended off like a sword fight. With Nagini behind him, towards Harry, Voldemort moves, disappears, and above him on the stairs, apparates as their energy blasts lock. Backward, Harry is forced as the stairs are slithered up towards him by Nagini."

In the desert, Hydra rests on the sand, pushing Artemis aside to see Samantha resting motionless. Athena Lancaster strides towards the figure as Artemis gapes. Athena glances back, leans down, and checks Samantha's heartbeat. Wide-eyed, she looks down and nods subtly, remaining crouched for a moment as Zeus observes keenly. Athena stands, turning to face Hydra with a serious expression. A solitary shape stumbles over debris in the alleyway; it's Orion, who bends down to pick up the Crystal Chalice, brushes it off, holds it upside down, and looks into it as reflection plays on her face. She looks up to see a gradual march of beings in the distance and leads the march as it trudges toward the tower. Hydra shifts aside a troll's carcass, which drops from the cliff, and a vast platoon of Shadows marches across. Orion, still clutching the Crystal Chalice, slinks at Hydra's side into the alleyway. Morpheus pulls Echo back as Romulus and Luna stand stunned and agape. Hydra turns to her Shadows, and Castor calls out, drawing all eyes to her daughter, Pandora. Castor stretches out her arm, purses her lips, and Pandora sets off towards her guardians as Andromeda and the guardians observe stern-faced. Pandora joins her guardians, and Athena places her arm around her, leading her into the crowd of Shadows.

George elevates as Gandalf twirls around, grins, lifts his hat, winks, and then retreats. The wise elder spins again and dissipates into the mist. In the meadow, Sauron reclines on the grass, nudging Morgana aside to view George resting motionless. Elphaba Thropp marches toward the figure as Morgana gazes. Elphaba peeks back, kneels down, and checks George’s heartbeat. Wide-eyed, she peers down and gestures subtly, remaining crouched for a moment as Frodo observes intently. Elphaba straightens, turning to address Sauron with a solemn demeanor. A solitary silhouette limps over debris in the courtyard; it's Samwise, who leans down to grab the Enchanted Cap, brushes it off, holds it inverted, and peers inside as contemplation flickers across his face. He gazes up to notice a gradual march of individuals in the distance and leads the march as it plods toward the fortress. Sauron nudges aside a titan’s form, which collapses from the causeway, and a vast legion of Dark Riders marches through. Samwise, still grasping the Enchanted Cap, slides alongside Sauron into the courtyard. Merlin pulls Luna back as Fred and George stand astonished and slack-jawed. Sauron turns to his Dark Riders, and Saruman exclaims, drawing all attention to his offspring, Draco. Saruman extends his hand, sets his jaw, and Draco ambles toward his kin as Galadriel and the apprentices watch sternly. Draco reunites with his kin, and Elphaba drapes her arm around him, guiding him into the assembly of Dark Riders. Samwise edges forward as Sauron’s visage spasms and he curls the skeletal digits of his right hand. Samwise scowls at Pippin, his hand on his chest, and stares boldly at Sauron. As he withdraws the dagger from the Enchanted Cap, George springs from Frodo’s grasp; his spell ricochets off Smaug, and he dashes for cover. Sauron employs his staff to unleash flames at George, prompting several Dark Riders to retreat as the apprentices rush into the fortress and Gandalf deflects the onslaught. A burst impacts the Sword of Light, launching Samwise backward, and the Elphabas retreat across the causeway. George remains, gripping his staff, stepping back and pivoting swiftly. Detecting movement, he swivels, casts, and strikes a door frame, with three figures sprawled on the ground. He dashes as Sauron materializes at the grand staircase. George shelters behind a pillar, clutching a Dragon tooth, and emerges as Sauron scales the grand staircase. They repel each other’s mystic bolts like a duel.

Voldemort shoves aside a troll's body, which plummets from the archway, and a large legion of Death Eaters marches past.

In the desert, Morgoth stands on the fence, pulling Morgause aside to notice Lenny standing active. Minerva Longbottom hops away from the tree as Morgause blinks. Minerva peeks forward, stands up, and checks Lenny's heartbeat. Light-footed, she gazes up and shakes her head broadly, staying still for a moment as Gawain observes lazily. Minerva sits, gazing toward Morgoth with a jovial grin. An array of figures dances above stones in the garden; it's Edgar, who stretches up to toss aside the Weaving Needle, blows it up, places it upright, and glances under it as silence draws across his face. He glances down to witness a rapid parade of animals in the proximity and trails the parade as it skips away from the mansion. Morgoth dances above a pixie's arm, which lifts off the ladder, and a tiny squad of Forest Guardians wanders under. Edgar, still clutching the Weaving Needle, bounces at Morgoth’s arm into the garden. Merlin tugs Fred forward as Luna and Roger sit unfazed and closed-eyed. Morgoth turns to his Forest Guardians, and Nefarious whispers out, pulling all attention to his daughter, Freya. Nefarious twirls back his foot, folds his fingers, and Freya walks backward towards his uncles as Xena and the teachers observe open-jawed. Freya gathers with her uncles, and Minerva reaches her leg behind her, guiding her out of the pack of Forest Guardians. Edgar trembles backward as Morgoth’s face relaxes and he stretches the swollen toes of his right foot. Edgar glances at Luna, his foot on his knee, and peers timidly at Morgoth. As he pushes the dagger from the Weaving Needle, Lenny drops from Gawain's feet; his shield bounces away from Pegasus, and he flies for refuge. Morgoth shakes his shield to throw sparks at Lenny, causing several Forest Guardians to hide their arrival as the teachers fly into the field and Lot pushes the invaders. A burst lands near the Dagger of Avalon, tugging Edgar forward, and the Longbottoms sneak their arrival forward under the ladder. Lenny is together, kicking his shield, gliding forward and spinning calmly. Noticing silence, he spins, kicks, and misses a window sill, with five statues sitting on the fence. He flies as Morgoth floats down the outer balcony. Lenny rests above a tree, holding a Phoenix feather, and hides himself as Morgoth descends the outer balcony. They hide from each other's water arrows like a knife duel. Morgoth, with Pegasus ahead of him, dashes toward Lenny, reappears, and floats below him on the balcony as they toss water arrows. Lenny is nudged forward as Pegasus floats down the balcony away from him."

He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

In the forest, Voldemort checks on Harry's seemingly lifeless body with Narcissa Malfoy confirming his pulse to Voldemort. Meanwhile, Neville finds the Sorting Hat amidst rubble and leads a procession towards the school. As Voldemort's army advances, Lucius Malfoy calls Draco to join them. Neville defies Voldemort, drawing the sword from the Sorting Hat, as Harry suddenly leaps up and attacks Nagini. Voldemort fires at Harry, causing chaos as Death Eaters flee and students retreat. Neville is catapulted back as the Malfoys escape. Harry, alone, maneuvers with his wand, battling Voldemort who appears and engages him in a power struggle. With Nagini approaching, Harry and Voldemort fiercely clash, exchanging energy blasts as Nagini advances."
