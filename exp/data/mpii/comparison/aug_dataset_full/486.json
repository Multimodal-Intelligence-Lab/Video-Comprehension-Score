A tiny circle of light hits Norman's face from the hole in the wall behind the picture. This end of the room is very dim, allowing us to see clearly the light striking Norman's face. We move close to Norman, extremely close, until his profile fills the screen, and the tiny spot of light hits his eye. We see the small hole through which the light comes, and Norman peeps through. Through the hole, we look into Mary's cabin and see Mary undressing; she is in her bra and half-slip. She stoops over a bit, places her hands behind her upper back, and begins to unhook her bra. Norman watches as Mary removes her bra, and we see his eye run up and down the unseen figure of Mary. Mary is just slipping into a robe, covering her complete nudity. Norman turns from the hole, faces us for a moment, continues turning until he can look out the small parlor window. Quickly and precisely, he rehangs the picture over the hole in the wall, turns, and starts out of the parlor. We see him go through the office and out onto the porch, not even bothering to close the door behind him. Norman walks along the porch, in the direction of the big house. Once on the path, he pauses, looks up at the light in the bedroom window, then pulls himself up, squares his shoulders, and strides manfully up the path. He opens the door of the house and enters. We see him pause at the foot of the stairway and look up at the bedroom door just at the head of the stair. He bypasses the stairs and slowly makes his way to the kitchen at the far end of the hall. He enters the kitchen and drops wearily into a chair. Meanwhile, Mary is seated at a small desk, engrossed in figuring in a small notebook. After a moment, she tears the page out of the notebook and, rising, begins to rip it into small pieces. She goes into the bathroom, drops the pieces into the toilet bowl, and flushes the toilet. Then she drops her robe, steps into the tub, and turns the shower on. For a moment, we watch Mary as she washes and soaps herself. We then see the bathroom door being pushed slowly open and the shadow of a woman fall across the shower curtain. Mary's back is turned to the curtain.

          "description": "Norman is looked at by a picture hanging on the far end of the wall he is leaning against. It is reached by him, touched, and the small frame is reluctantly lifted off the wall by him. A tiny circle of light is hit on Norman's face from the hole in the wall behind the picture. This end of the room is dimmed to such a degree that the light striking Norman's face is seen clearly by us. Norman is approached by us, extremely close, until the screen is filled by his profile, and his eye is hit by the tiny spot of light. The small hole through which the light comes is seen by us, and through it, Norman peeps. Into Mary's cabin, we look through the hole and Mary is seen undressing; her bra and half-slip are worn by her. A bit is stooped over by her, her hands are placed behind her upper back, and her bra is begun to be unhooked by her. As Mary removes her bra, she is watched by Norman, and the unseen figure of Mary is run up and down by his eye. A robe is just slipped into by Mary, and her complete nudity is covered. From the hole, Norman turns, and for a moment, we are faced by him before turning continues until the small parlor window can be looked through by him. The picture is quickly and precisely rehung over the hole in the wall, by him, he turns and the parlor is started out of by him. Through the office and out onto the porch, he goes, the door not even being bothered to be closed behind him by him. Along the porch, Norman walks, and the big house is walked towards. On the path, a pause is made by him, the light in the bedroom window is looked up at by him, then he pulls himself up, his shoulders are squared, and up the path, he strides manfully. The door of the house is opened by him and he enters. At the foot of the stairway, he pauses and the bedroom door just at the head of the stair is looked up at by him. The stairs are bypassed by him, and he slowly makes his way to the kitchen at the far end of the hall. Into a chair, he drops wearily as he enters the kitchen. Meanwhile, at a small desk, Mary is seated, engrossed in figuring in a small notebook. After a moment, the page is torn out of the notebook by her and rising, it is begun to be ripped into small pieces by her. Into the bathroom, she goes, the pieces are dropped into the toilet bowl by her, and the toilet is flushed by her. Then her robe is dropped, into the tub, she steps, and the shower is turned on by her. For a moment, Mary is watched by us as she washes and soaps herself. The bathroom door is then seen being pushed slowly open and across the shower curtain, the shadow of a woman falls. To the curtain, Mary's back is turned. Suddenly, a hand reaches up, the shower curtain is grasped, and it is ripped aside by the hand, causing a look of pure horror to erupt on her face."

He is leaning against this wall, lost in his thoughts. After a moment of hesitation that seems to weigh heavily on him, he reaches out with a certain cautiousness, touching the picture gently with his hand. With a sense of reluctance that is almost palpable, he carefully lifts the small frame off the wall. As he performs this action, a tiny circle of light suddenly emerges, casting a distinct glow on Norman's face. This light comes from a hole in the wall that was previously concealed behind the picture. This particular section of the room is enveloped in dimness, which allows us to clearly observe the way the light illuminates Norman's face. Slowly, we move in closer to Norman, getting extremely close, until his profile completely fills the screen, and the small spot of light is seen reflecting in his eye. We notice the small hole through which this light is coming, and we see Norman peering through it. Through this hole, our view shifts into Mary's cabin, where we see Mary as she is undressing; she is wearing her bra and a half-slip. She bends over slightly and places her hands behind her upper back, beginning the process of unhooking her bra.

She proceeds into the bathroom, drops the pieces into the toilet bowl, and flushes them away. Then, she lets her robe fall, steps gracefully into the tub, and turns the shower on. For a moment, we watch Mary as she washes and soaps herself, lost in the simple act of cleansing. We then see the bathroom door being pushed slowly open, and the ominous shadow of a woman falls across the shower curtain. Mary's back is turned to the curtain, completely unaware of what is happening. Suddenly, a hand reaches up, grasps the shower curtain, and violently rips it aside, causing a look of pure, unadulterated horror to erupt on her face."

He pushes himself off the wall, takes a few steps forward, and reaches the picture. His fingers extend to touch the frame, feeling its texture, and with a hint of reluctance, he carefully lifts the small frame off the wall. As he does so, a tiny circle of light emerges from the hole behind the picture, casting a beam onto Norman's face. The dimness of this end of the room accentuates the light, making it clearly visible as it strikes his features. We draw closer to Norman, inching nearer until his profile dominates the screen, and the pinpoint of light aligns perfectly with his eye. Through this small hole, Norman peers, and we follow his gaze into Mary's cabin. Inside, Mary is undressing, clad in her bra and half-slip. She bends slightly, her hands reaching behind her upper back as she begins to unhook her bra. Norman observes intently as Mary removes her bra, his eye tracing the contours of her unseen figure. Mary then slips into a robe, concealing her nudity. Norman, having seen enough, turns away from the hole, momentarily facing us before continuing his turn to look out the small parlor window. With swift precision, he rehangs the picture over the hole, concealing it once more, and turns to leave the parlor. He moves through the office and steps out onto the porch, leaving the door ajar behind him. Norman walks along the porch, heading towards the big house. Upon reaching the path, he pauses, glancing up at the light shining from the bedroom window. He gathers himself, straightening his posture, and strides purposefully up the path. He reaches the house, opens the door, and steps inside. At the foot of the stairway, he pauses, his gaze lifting to the bedroom door at the top. Choosing not to ascend, he bypasses the stairs and proceeds slowly down the hall to the kitchen at the far end. Entering the kitchen, he drops into a chair, weariness evident in his demeanor. Meanwhile, Mary sits at a small desk, absorbed in calculations in a small notebook. After a moment, she tears a page from the notebook, rises, and begins tearing it into small pieces. She moves to the bathroom, drops the pieces into the toilet bowl, and flushes them away. She then lets her robe fall, steps into the tub, and turns on the shower. For a brief moment, we watch as Mary washes and soaps herself. Suddenly, the bathroom door creaks open slowly, and the shadow of a woman is cast across the shower curtain. With her back turned to the curtain, Mary remains unaware until a hand suddenly reaches up, grasps the shower curtain, and yanks it aside, causing a look of pure horror to erupt on her face."

A tiny circle of light hits Norman's face from the hole in the wall behind the picture, a peep hole cleverly concealed by his late mother to spy on guests in the adjacent room. This end of the room is very dim, allowing us to see clearly the light striking Norman's face. We move close to Norman, extremely close, until his profile fills the screen, and the tiny spot of light hits his eye. We see the small hole through which the light comes, and Norman peeps through. Through the hole, we look into Mary’s cabin, at Norman's family-owned motel where each cabin offers a sense of rustic seclusion, and see Mary undressing; she is in her bra and half-slip. She stoops over a bit, places her hands behind her upper back, and begins to unhook her bra. Norman watches as Mary removes her bra, and we see his eye run up and down the unseen figure of Mary. Mary is just slipping into a robe, covering her complete nudity. Norman turns from the hole, faces us for a moment, continues turning until he can look out the small parlor window. Quickly and precisely, he rehangs the picture over the hole in the wall, turns, and starts out of the parlor. We see him go through the office, part of the modestly run-down facade of the once-busy motel, and out onto the porch, not even bothering to close the door behind him. Norman walks along the porch, in the direction of the big house, a Victorian structure that looms ominously behind the motel and is widely rumored to be haunted. Once on the path, he pauses, looks up at the light in the bedroom window, then pulls himself up, squares his shoulders, and strides manfully up the path. He opens the door of the house and enters. We see him pause at the foot of the stairway, known for its creaky steps lined with worn carpet, and look up at the bedroom door just at the head of the stair. He bypasses the stairs and slowly makes his way to the kitchen at the far end of the hall. He enters the kitchen and drops wearily into a chair. Meanwhile, Mary is seated at a small desk, engrossed in figuring in a small notebook, which contains calculations regarding the sum of money she plans to keep hidden. After a moment, she tears the page out of the notebook and, rising, begins to rip it into small pieces. She goes into the bathroom, drops the pieces into the toilet bowl, and flushes the toilet. Then she drops her robe, steps into the tub, and turns the shower on. For a moment, we watch Mary as she washes and soaps herself in an old claw-foot tub that features prominently in the lore of the motel. We then see the bathroom door being pushed slowly open and the shadow of a woman fall across the shower curtain. Mary's back is turned to the curtain. Suddenly, a hand reaches up, grasps the shower curtain, and rips it aside, causing a look of pure horror to erupt on her face."

We move close to Norman, extremely close, until his profile fills the screen, and the tiny spot of light hits his eye. We see the small gap through which the light comes, and Norman peeps through. Through the gap, we look into Mary's cabin and see Mary undressing; she is in her tank top and half-slip.

We shift close to Norman, extremely close, until his profile covers the screen, and the tiny spot of light touches his ear. We observe the small hole through which the light emerges, and Norman glances through. Through the hole, we peer into Mary's cabin and see Mary rearranging her clothes; she is in her bra and half-slip.

A tiny square of light catches Eleanor's cheek from the crack in the bookshelf behind the sculpture. This corner of the library is very dim, allowing us to see clearly the light touching Eleanor's cheek. We move close to Eleanor, incredibly close, until her silhouette fills the screen, and the tiny beam of light touches her nose. We see the small crack through which the light enters, and Eleanor peeks through. Through the crack, we look into Sarah's hut and see Sarah changing clothes; she is in her tank top and shorts. She bends slightly, places her hands behind her head, and begins to untie her tank top. Eleanor watches as Sarah removes her tank top, and we see her gaze travel up and down the unseen form of Sarah. Sarah is just slipping into a gown, covering her entire nudity. Eleanor turns from the crack, faces us briefly, continues turning until she can look out the small study window. Quickly and precisely, she replaces the sculpture over the crack in the bookshelf, turns, and begins to leave the study. We see her move through the hallway and out onto the patio, not even bothering to close the gate behind her. Eleanor strolls along the patio, in the direction of the large cottage. Once on the trail, she hesitates, glances up at the glow in the attic window, then draws herself up, squares her shoulders, and strides boldly up the trail. She opens the door of the cottage and enters. We see her pause at the bottom of the staircase and look up at the attic door just at the top of the stairs. She bypasses the stairs and slowly makes her way to the pantry at the far end of the corridor. She enters the pantry and drops wearily into a stool.

This section of the hallway is very dim, allowing us to perceive clearly the light landing on Frank's neck. We glide near to Frank, exceedingly near, until his silhouette fills the frame, and the tiny patch of light strikes his cheek. We observe the tiny gap through which the light emerges, and Frank peers through. Through the gap, we look into Lily's study and see Lily dressing; she is in her sweater and jeans. She bends over a bit, places her fingers behind her lower back, and starts to fasten her jeans. Frank stares as Lily secures her jeans, and we observe his cheek move over the unseen outline of Lily. Lily is just slipping into a sweater, covering her complete nudity. Frank swivels from the gap, faces us briefly, continues swiveling until he can glance out the small dining room window. Swiftly and meticulously, he rehangs the painting over the gap in the ceiling, swivels, and ambles out of the dining room.

A small square of shadow grazes Norman's cheek from the crack in the shelf behind the painting. This side of the library is very bright, allowing us to see clearly the shadow grazing Norman's cheek. We drift away from Norman, moderately far, until his silhouette vanishes from the screen, and the small square of shadow grazes his shoulder. We glimpse the large crack through which the shadow emerges, and Norman peers through. Through the crack, we peer into Mary's room and see Mary dressing; she is in her blouse and skirt. She bends over slightly, places her hands before her lower legs, and begins to tie her shoes. Norman observes as Mary puts on her shoes, and we see his eye glide left and right along the unseen shape of Mary. Mary is just slipping out of a dress, revealing her complete attire. Norman pivots from the crack, turns to see us for a moment, continues rotating until he can glance out the large hallway window. Slowly and randomly, he slides the painting over the crack in the shelf, pivots, and steps out of the library. We see him move through the lobby and onto the deck, not even caring to open the door before him. Norman strolls along the deck, in the direction of the small shed. Once on the trail, he stops, glances down at the shadow on the garden path, then pushes himself down, rolls his shoulders, and marches boldly down the trail. He closes the window of the shed and exits. We see him pause at the top of the ladder and glance down at the basement trapdoor just at the bottom of the ladder. He bypasses the ladder and quickly guides his way to the lounge at the near end of the corridor. He enters the lounge and sits heavily into a couch. Meanwhile, Mary is perched at a large table, intrigued in drawing on a large notepad. After a moment, she folds the sheet into the notepad and, falling, begins to toss it into large chunks. She walks into the bedroom, tosses the chunks into the sink, and fills the sink. Then she pulls her dress, steps onto the rug, and turns the fan on. For a moment, we watch Mary as she dries and powders herself. We then see the bedroom window being slid quietly closed and the silhouette of a man cast across the curtain blinds. Mary's front is turned to the blinds. Abruptly, an arm reaches down, snatches the curtain blinds, and snaps it aside, causing a look of pure curiosity to appear on her face."

A small beam of darkness grazes Daisy's hand from the crack in the door behind the poster. This side of the attic is quite bright, obscuring the shadow hitting Daisy's hand. We drift away from Daisy, incredibly distant, until her silhouette vanishes from view, and the faint trace of darkness grazes her foot. We observe the large crack through which the shadow emerges, and Daisy glances around. Through the crack, we peer into Tim's attic and find Tim dressing up; he is in his coat and coat-tails. He stands up straight, places his feet on the lower floor, and stops fastening his coat. Daisy listens as Tim puts on his coat, and we notice her foot dance side to side with the unseen silhouette of Tim. Tim is just stepping out of the suit, uncovering his entire brightness. Daisy turns away from the crack, turns towards us for a second, keeps turning until she can gaze into the large hallway mirror. Slowly and casually, she unhooks the poster at the crack in the door, turns, and wanders into the closet. We watch her stroll through the hallway and into the yard, not even attempting to shut the window behind her. Daisy skips across the yard, towards the tiny cave. Once on the trail, she halts, glances down at the shadow in the living room ceiling, then hoists herself down, narrows her knees, and hops gracefully down the trail. She shuts the window of the cave and exits. We observe her halt at the head of the ladder and gaze down at the living room window just at the foot of the ladder. She crosses over the ladder and swiftly makes her way to the pantry at the near side of the room. She exits the pantry and stands energetically on a table. Meanwhile, Tim is lying on a large couch, absorbed in painting on a large canvas. After a moment, he sticks the page onto the canvas and, falling, ceases to tear it into large chunks. He enters the cellar, sticks the chunks onto the ceiling tiles, and opens the window. Then he lifts his suit, jumps out of the pool, and shuts the lights off. For a second, we observe Tim as he dries and dresses himself. We then glimpse the cellar window being yanked swiftly closed and the shape of a child rise beneath the pool tiles. Tim's front is facing the tiles. Instantly, a foot reaches down, releases the pool tiles, and bolts them away, causing a look of utter joy to erupt on his face."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
