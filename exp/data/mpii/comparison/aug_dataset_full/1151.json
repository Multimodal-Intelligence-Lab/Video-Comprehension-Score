          "description": "Dumbledore gazes intently at the small piece of parchment in his hand, reading the name inscribed upon it. As Viktor hears it, he punches the air triumphantly, his fist slicing through the surrounding space. His friends erupt into cheers and surround him, offering hearty congratulations with pats on the back and excited shouts. Viktor stands up from his seat, his chair scraping the floor subtly, and steps forward confidently to meet Dumbledore. As he approaches, he extends his hand, and Dumbledore clasps it firmly in a congratulatory handshake. With a nod of acknowledgment, Viktor turns and strides purposefully out of the hall, leaving behind the murmurs and applause. Suddenly, the flame within the goblet surges up powerfully once more, capturing everyone’s attention. Dumbledore retrieves a second piece of parchment from the fiery display, carefully noting its singed, smoldering edges. Fleur's face lights up with pleasure as she realizes her name has been called, and she steps forward gracefully. She reaches Dumbledore and offers her hand, which he takes in a warm handshake, acknowledging her success. Following Viktor's path, she exits the hall with a light and proud step. Another student, smiling broadly, steps up next, repeating the process. He shakes Dumbledore's hand with enthusiasm and trails behind Viktor and Fleur, leaving the room to join them. As the excitement simmers, Crouch unveils a stunning trophy, made of dazzling crystal and gleaming silver, capturing the room's attention momentarily. Snape, standing nearby, suddenly edges forward, his expression one of alarm, as the goblet of fire unexpectedly erupts in flames once again. Dumbledore, taken aback by this unforeseen flare, turns sharply, his eyes following the trajectory of the vibrant blue flame as it leaps magnificently into the air. The flame shifts from blue to an intense red hue, sparking with energy. Karkaroff, watching the scene, narrows his eyes into a fierce glare as vibrant sparks fly meticulously from the newly scorched piece of parchment. This fragment flutters down, caught by an almost imperceptible gust, and lands securely in Dumbledore's hand. As he reads the name aloud, every eye in the room shifts to focus on Harry, who sits in discomfort and surprise. Feeling a mix of fear and confusion, Harry sinks into his seat, his mind racing. Hagrid, observing from a distance, shakes his head slowly in disbelief. Beside Harry, Hermione leans in, quietly but firmly encouraging him to stand up and face the situation. Meanwhile, Ron watches with a darkened expression, his brow furrowed. Harry begins his daunting walk towards Professor Dumbledore, each step hesitant and marked by an acute awareness of the unfriendly stares directed at him by the surrounding students. Dumbledore, holding the smoking parchment which still releases tendrils of smoke from its edges, extends it for Harry to grasp. Harry, looking visibly stunned, accepts it and proceeds to walk the length of the massive hall, his mind swirling with the gazes of his peers and colleagues. As he passes, Snape scrutinizes him with narrowed eyes, a critical gaze following Harry’s every movement. Professor McGonagall, sensing his distress, gently pats his shoulder with a reassuring touch that offers some small comfort. Mad-Eye Moody fixes Harry with a piercing stare, his eyes unwavering as the pair of iron gates ahead swings open for Harry to pass through. Inside, the three other competitors react with surprise upon seeing him join their ranks. The room fills with palpable tension as Dumbledore enters energetically, accompanied by a procession including Karkaroff, Snape, Crouch, Moody, Professor McGonagall, and Madame Maxime. Dumbledore’s grip on Harry’s shoulder is firm and supportive, bringing him to the center of attention where every eye scrutinizes him intensely. Harry swallows, feeling the dryness in his throat, aware of the torrent of rain pouring outside from the mouth of a gargoyle, its sound blending with the atmosphere of anticipation. High above, in a secluded tower, the Hogwarts professors gather for a conference, their expressions grave and contemplative. Professor McGonagall, casting worried glances at Dumbledore, watches as he carefully places his wand at his temple. With a slow, deliberate motion, he extracts a silvery thread of memory, allowing it to drift delicately into a waiting bowl. As the professors consult, a piece of parchment with Harry's name rises to the surface, its presence noted by all. Later that evening, Harry finds himself in the solitude of the dormitory, sitting contemplatively on his bed. Nearby, Ron methodically hangs a wet towel by the stove, the fabric emitting steam from the residual heat, before climbing into his four-poster bed, deliberately turning his back to Harry in a gesture of silent disapproval. Harry, feeling the weight of the day, clambers into bed, removing his glasses and carefully setting them aside before pulling up the covers to shield himself from the cold. As he does so, he senses Ron’s gaze flickering in his direction but remains silent. Ron lies still, his face pressed into his pillow, awake yet choosing to maintain his silence. The next day, the competitors gather for a photograph, and amidst the flashing lights, she directs her gaze towards Harry, acknowledging his presence with subtle recognition. In a cramped room, a green quill hovers expectantly over an open notebook. Rita, with a mischievous glint, ushers Harry inside, the door closing behind them with a soft click. The quill quickly comes to life, dancing across the page, capturing every word as Rita winks knowingly at Harry. Harry, bemused, motions towards the quill, acknowledging its peculiar independence. Meanwhile, a small, sleek black owl wings its way over the sprawling grounds of Hogwarts, heading directly towards a tall, secluded tower with determined purpose. In the owlery, Harry waits with eager anticipation as the black owl swoops gracefully through the window, alighting smoothly on the perch before him. Carefully, he removes a note securely fastened to its beak, unfolding it eagerly to decipher its contents. As he reads, he inadvertently sucks on his finger, pecked by the owl’s beak in its urgency to deliver the message. On Saturday night, with a sense of urgency, Harry hurries down into the familiar warmth of the Gryffindor common room, the evening’s events still vivid in his mind."

His friends, fellow students from Durmstrang known for their prowess and ambition, congratulate him as he rises from his seat and shakes Dumbledore's hand before leaving the hall designed for grand events like these. The flame flares again, and Dumbledore reads a second piece of smoldering parchment, which names Fleur Delacour, a student from the Beauxbatons Academy, renowned for its elegant and spellbinding magic. Beaming with pleasure, Fleur, whose Veela heritage grants her stunning beauty, shakes Dumbledore's hand and follows Viktor. Smiling broadly, Cedric Diggory, the popular and talented Hufflepuff champion, shakes Dumbledore's hand and follows Viktor and Fleur out of the hall. Crouch, a high-ranking official in the Ministry of Magic, uncovers a magnificent crystal and silver trophy, known as the Triwizard Cup. Snape, the enigmatic and often mistrusted Potions Master, steps forward alarmed as the Goblet of Fire, an ancient magical artifact used to select champions, flares once more, and Dumbledore turns in surprise as the blue flame leaps high into the air. The flame turns red, indicating an unusual occurrence, and Karkaroff, the shifty headmaster of Durmstrang, glares as sparks fly from a piece of scorched parchment, which flutters down into Dumbledore's hand. He reads it, and all eyes turn to Harry Potter, the unexpected fourth champion, who sits down nervously. Hagrid, the gentle half-giant and Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts, shakes his head while Hermione, Harry's intelligent and steadfast friend, forces Harry to his feet. Ron, feeling betrayed and envious, glowers as Harry walks hesitantly towards Professor Dumbledore. The piece of parchment is still smoking at the edges when Dumbledore thrusts it into Harry's hand. Looking stunned, Harry walks the length of the Great Hall, uncomfortably aware of unfriendly looks from his fellow students. Snape narrows his eyes as Harry passes him, and Professor McGonagall, the stern but fair deputy headmistress, pats his shoulder reassuringly. Mad-Eye Moody, a seasoned and eccentric Auror known for his magical eye, gives him a hard stare, and a pair of iron gates opens in front of Harry. The other three competitors look surprised to see him as Dumbledore bursts into the room, followed by Karkaroff, Snape, Crouch, Moody, Professor McGonagall, and Madame Maxime, the towering headmistress of Beauxbatons. Dumbledore grabs Harry, and every eye in the room is focused on him. He swallows nervously as rain pours from the mouth of a gargoyle outside, a feature common in Hogwarts' architecture. In a high tower, the Hogwarts professors meet and consult together, and Professor McGonagall looks anxiously at Dumbledore, who puts his wand to his temple. A thread of memory drifts into a Pensieve, a magical device for storing thoughts, and a parchment with Harry's name surfaces. Later, Harry sits on his bed in the Gryffindor dormitory while Ron hangs a wet towel beside the stove, climbs into his four-poster bed, and turns his back. Harry scrambles into bed, takes off his glasses, and pulls up the covers as Ron looks across at him. Ron lies awake, his face buried in his pillow, conflicted by his feelings. The competitors pose for a photo, a tradition to commemorate the tournament, and she looks at Harry. In a tiny room, a Quick-Quotes Quill, known for its embellishing writing style, hovers over a notebook as Rita Skeeter, the sensationalist reporter, pushes Harry inside. The quill writes while she winks at him, and Harry gestures to the quill, aware of its inaccuracies. A small black owl, typically used for delivering messages in the wizarding world, swoops over Hogwarts School, heading towards a tall, isolated tower. Harry is waiting in the owlery, a place filled with the sounds of hooting owls, as the black owl flies in through the window. He takes the note from its beak, unfolds it eagerly, and reads, then sucks his pecked finger.

          "description": "Gandalf scribbles on the napkin, and Boris stomps the ground. His classmates applaud him as he hops off the boat and twirls Gandalf's umbrella before exiting the temple. The bonfire dims again, and Gandalf inspects a third piece of glowing napkin. Grinning with delight, Esmeralda twirls Gandalf's umbrella and traces Boris. Chuckling boisterously, she twirls Gandalf's umbrella and traces Boris and Esmeralda outside of the temple. Bartok reveals a stunning sandstone and gold medallion. Merlin leaps backward startled as the cauldron of soup sizzles once more, and Gandalf pivots in astonishment as the green steam spirals upward. The steam glows purple, and Zaragoz scowls as embers dance from a piece of burnt napkin, which drifts downward into Gandalf's grasp. He inspects it, and all gazes shift to Leo, who collapses hesitantly. Fergus shakes his head while Penelope hoists Leo to his feet. Neville scowls as Leo tiptoes suspiciously towards Sir Gandalf. The piece of napkin is still sizzling at the tips when Gandalf shoves it into Leo's grasp. Feeling bewildered, Leo paces the breadth of the temple, keenly aware of frosty stares from his fellow wizards. Merlin squints as Leo ambles by, and Dame Athena taps his wrist encouragingly. Mad-Eye Merlin scrutinizes him, and a pair of bronze doors unhinge in front of Leo. The other two challengers appear startled to spot him as Gandalf storms into the space, flanked by Zaragoz, Merlin, Bartok, Mad-Eye Merlin, Dame Athena, and Lady Mariana. Gandalf clasps Leo, and each glance in the space is riveted on him. He gulps anxiously as thunder crashes from the jaws of a dragon outside. In a grand tower, the Cambridge tutors convene and consult together, and Dame Athena peers worriedly at Gandalf, who places his monocle to his forehead. A string of recollection drifts into a chalice, and a napkin with Leo's surname emerges. Subsequently, Leo perches on his mattress while Neville dangles a drenched scarf beside the hearth, slips into his plush couch, and averts his gaze. Leo clambers into his couch, removes his monocle, and lifts the blankets as Neville glances askance at him. Neville remains restless, his visage buried in his quilt. The challengers strike a pose for a drawing, and she glimpses at Leo. In a cramped chamber, a red crayon looms over a parchment as Greta nudges Leo inside. The crayon scribbles while she blinks at him, and Leo waves at the crayon. A small white pigeon flutters over Hogwarts Academy, flying towards a tall, secluded spire. Leo is standing in the aviary as the white pigeon darts in through the crevice. He plucks the scroll from its talon, unfurls it eagerly, and scans, then nibbles his pricked thumb. On Sunday eve, he rushes upward into the Ravenclaw lounge."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

In Gryffindor Tower, tension rises as Ron gives Harry the cold shoulder. During a photo session, a journalist named Rita uses a magical quill to interview Harry. Later, in the owlery, Harry eagerly reads a note delivered by an owl, despite its peck. On Saturday, he heads to the Gryffindor common room."
