As he begins his descent back down the stairs, he takes a brief glance back, while Kate remains at the top, grinning to herself, cherishing the shared intimacy. Meanwhile, in a dimly lit room graced with an ambiance of amber light, Kate is deeply asleep in her bed, completely relaxed until the door, left ajar, creaks slightly. This allows a sliver of hallway light to stream in as Zoe quietly sneaks past, holding a video with care. The soft movement alerts Kate, who opens her eyes and sees Zoe, prompting her to get out of bed, still clad in her pajamas. Kate then slowly wanders down the hallway, her gaze fixed on the dull, flickering light emanating from the lounge where the video seems to be playing. As she reaches the open lounge door, she comes to a pause, observing Zoe seated comfortably on the floor, engrossed in watching a home movie. On-screen, Christine frolics on a drab, wind-swept beach, animatedly flapping her arms in a playful imitation of flight as she runs down to meet the moody grey sea. Drawn to the scene and Zoe's quiet company, Kate steps into the lounge and sits beside Zoe, their eyes glued to the TV. The screen is soon filled with images of Christine and Zoeâ€™s joy-filled faces, capturing a moment where Christine kisses Zoe on the cheek lovingly and beams back warmly at the camera. Christine, with her striking long blonde hair, tosses her hair back with an infectious laugh, her joy apparent even as tears gently form in Zoe's eyes, reflecting a mix of emotions. Kate diverts her gaze from the TV to Zoe, noticing her niece's emotional reaction, and gently wraps an arm around her in a comforting gesture. Zoe leans into Kate's embrace, finding solace as the video continues, showing Christine running along the beach, waving energetically before the camera, her jacket and scarf caught in the breeze until the grainy video eventually fades out. The following morning, in the gentle embrace of daylight streaming into the room, Kate and Zoe lie in Zoe's bed, facing each other. Zoe, with a soft arm resting across Kate's shoulder, emits a steady, serene presence as Kate watches Zoe in her sleep. Zoe's lips part into a brief, unconscious smile, a flicker of contentment crossing her features before her eyes flutter shut again. Mirroring her niece, Kate places an arm around Zoe, her eyes slowly closing as peaceful sleep reclaims her. At the restaurant, amidst the bustling noise and activity, Bernadette reads a letter, engrossed in its contents. Later, Zoe bursts out of her bedroom, her small feet pattering down the corridor with Kate in playful pursuit. As Zoe streaks past the lounge, Kate skillfully ambushes her, and with a shared mischievous spirit, they engage in a boisterous pillow fight, exuberantly swinging the cushions at each other until feathers erupt into the air, floating down in gentle chaos. Overcome with laughter and fatigue, they both collapse onto the hall floor, lying side by side as feathers continue to drift and settle around them like a soft, whimsical snowfall. In a different scene, the restaurant is alive with activity, Nick orchestrates the hustle and bustle of a hectic kitchen with confidence and authority. In the adjacent dining room, the tables fill with patrons as Paula and her team of waitstaff expertly navigate the crowd, attending to guests with efficiency and care. Eventually, the pace winds down, and Paula and Nick find a moment to unwind, savoring a brandy together. Paula observes Nick with a smile, her eyes conveying warmth and camaraderie. Back at home, deep into the night, Kate lies fast asleep in bed when she suddenly awakens, her fingers reaching almost instinctively to flick on her bedside lamp. Rising from her slumber, she puts on her dressing gown and makes her way to the intercom, responding to an unexpected call. Later, Nick and Kate sit across from each other at a desk in the warmly-lit lounge. There, Nick indulges in a playful game as he spoon-feeds the blindfolded Kate a sample of sauce from a container positioned between them. In the soothing glow of the lamp, Nick watches Kateâ€™s reaction with a satisfied smile, appreciating the moment they share in the intimate setting."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby cafÃ©, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Zoe and Kate bond, sharing a comforting moment in bed overnight. In the morning, they enjoy playful antics with a pillow fight that leaves them breathless amidst floating feathers. Meanwhile, Nick is busy managing a bustling restaurant, sharing a relaxed moment with Paula afterward. That night, Nick visits Kate, and they share an intimate moment in the warmly lit lounge, with Nick feeding Kate a sauce while she wears a blindfold, both appearing content and connected."
