Hours later, the lights are dimmed, and most of the passengers are asleep, including Josephine, whose head is propped against Will's shoulder with her hands tucked under her belly. A beat passes, and Will notices a bored boy in the next row using his hands to cast shadows on the seat back under the reading light, making a convincing bird, passable monkey, and finally a dog.

Abruptly, this Edward thrusts both palms into the liquid, seizing hold of a catfish and raising it to his visage, gazing it directly in the eye. After a moment, the Beast expels Edward's gold band. Over the din of precipitation, a telephone rings on a chair, and by the tone, it is evident we're not in the U.S. -- it has that persistent European sound. As it continues ringing, the mostly vacant residence is visible, with only a few partially unpacked boxes and a cradle still in its carton. Keys are in the lock, followed by mirth in the corridor as the door swings open to reveal a drenched Will, carrying four sacks of provisions with disintegrating bottoms from the rain. His spouse Josephine pushes past him to get the phone and hands it to Will, apprehensive. Half-stripped, Will takes the phone, recognizing this won't be favorable news. He covers the mouthpiece and looks over to Josephine. Will has a window seat in coach with Josephine beside him, applying hand lotion. Hours later, the lights are dimmed, and most of the travelers are asleep, including Josephine, whose head is propped against Will's shoulder with her hands tucked under her abdomen. A moment passes, and Will notices an uninterested boy in the next row using his hands to cast silhouettes on the seat back under the reading light, creating a convincing bird, passable monkey, and ultimately a dog. Focusing on the final silhouette, Edward is seen forming the shapes as a youthful Will sits in his pajamas on the floor next to him, the endtable lamp lying between them with its shade off to cast large shadows on the partition. Edward looks around for a moment to see if his spouse is within earshot, then leans in, complicitous, as Will beams, thrilled to hear the forbidden tale. Edward raises his hand, enumerating names on his fingers, as his hand moves past the light, and a flashlight sweeps by. The night is whirring and exhaling, animate, with the moon hanging low, casting long silhouettes. Five children walk past in silhouette, four with flashlights on, while the fifth keeps stumbling, crashing into young Edward. Advancing up behind the children, they stand at the gates, staring in through the portal. Edward looks back at the eerie abode, hands Zacky his flashlight, and starts ascending the gate, dropping down on the far side. Truth be told, Edward is frightened, but he forges onward nonetheless."

After a brief moment's pause, the Beast remarkably spits out Edward's gold ring. Amidst the persistent sound of falling rain, a phone begins to ring insistently from its position on a chair, and by its distinctive ringing tone, it becomes unmistakably clear that we are not located in the United States—it possesses that persistent, distinctively recognizable European cadence. As the phone continues its relentless ringing, the camera pans over a mostly empty apartment, which is sparsely furnished with just a few half-unpacked boxes scattered about and a cradle still resting neatly in its carton.

His wife, Josephine, swiftly moves past him to answer the phone, handing it over to Will with an expression of concern etched on her face. In the midst of undressing, Will takes the phone, immediately sensing that the news he is about to receive will not be good. He covers the mouthpiece with his hand and glances over at Josephine. Later on, Will finds himself seated by a window in the coach section, with Josephine seated right beside him, carefully applying hand lotion to her hands.

The sound of keys jangling in the lock is followed by the cheerful noise of laughter emanating from the hallway, and the door swings open to reveal Will, drenched from the rain, struggling to maintain his grip on four sacks of groceries whose bottoms are threatening to give way. His wife, Josephine, quickly moves past him, her focus on the ringing phone, which she retrieves and hands to Will with a look of concern.

As they move up behind the group, they pause at the gates, peering through with a mix of curiosity and trepidation. Edward, feeling a mix of fear and determination, glances back at the eerie house, hands his flashlight to Zacky, and begins to climb the gate, his heart pounding as he drops down on the other side. Despite the fear gnawing at him, Edward pushes forward, driven by a sense of adventure and the need to confront the unknown."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
