In his chair, Jeff aligns his focus on the window while Stella stands close by. In a sudden motion, Jeff's arm inadvertently jostles Stella, nearly causing her to lose her balance. He then propels his wheelchair backward with urgency, prompting Stella to sidestep with unexpected deftness. Both cast into shadow by the room's lighting, Jeff's focus remains unwaveringly fixed on the window. The salesman, having scanned the surrounding neighborhood, now has his attention snagged by something directly below his window. His focus abruptly shifts downward, and his body visibly tenses. Jeff gently places a restraining hand on Stella, signaling her to pause as he cautiously inches his chair forward to discern what has captured the salesman's interest. As the camera pans downward, it reveals an elderly lady with a hearing aid leaning over a fence, scolding a dog. The salesman leans forward, clasping the window sill tightly, his attention riveted on the scene unfolding below. The camera moves forward with purpose, and upon reaching the window's edge, it pans downward to reveal the spectacle that has drawn the salesman's focus: a small dog, previously lowered in a basket, now sniffing curiously around the salesman's flower bed. Jeff's eyes dart up to observe the salesman's reaction. Faintly, the old lady's voice reaches them, cautioning the dog that trouble awaits if it continues its mischief. Dressed in a faded house-robe, the old lady commands the dog's attention, prompting it to heed her warning and retreat. Amused by the entire incident, Jeff's demeanor reflects a moment of levity. Behind him, Stella moves to the center of the room and begins meticulously stowing her equipment back into her black bag while keeping an eye on Jeff. As Jeff's attention returns to the salesman's apartment, his amusement dissipates, replaced by a focused intensity. Inside, the salesman methodically wipes down the interior of an aluminum case with a dust cloth, the case positioned prominently on the table near the room's center. Jeff observes with deep concentration, his facial expressions betraying a mind at work. Intently watching the salesman, Jeff remains engrossed. Stella secures her bag, pauses briefly to take in Jeff's back before making her way towards the door. Just as she reaches the top of the steps, Jeff swivels halfway around in his chair to catch her attention. Stella stops, turns, and follows Jeff's gesture towards a coat-stand near the door. Understanding his unspoken request, she sets her bag down, retrieves the binoculars from their case and descends the stairs to deliver them to him. With a subtle sniff, Stella heads towards the door, offering a comment as she exits. As Stella leaves, the camera zooms in on Jeff, framing his head and the binoculars prominently within the screen. Without hesitation, Jeff pivots to face the window, lifting the binoculars to his eyes in one fluid motion, ready to resume his scrutiny."

The salesman, having just raised the shades in the living room of this modest urban apartment, is now looking out the window. His eyes move closer toward Jeff's apartment, which is on the second floor of a building known for its lively and observant residents. Jeff, in his chair facing the window, Stella beside him, who is a visiting home healthcare worker with a knack for quick thinking. Jeff nearly knocks the startled Stella off her feet with his arm that reacts to unexpected movements. He propels his chair backward quickly, and Stella moves to the side with surprising agility, a skill honed from years of dance classes in her youth. They are both in shadow as dusk falls over the city. Jeff keeps his eyes trained on the window, a habit formed from his days as a photojournalist seeking the perfect shot. The salesman completes his searching glance at the neighborhood, which is known for its eclectic mix of old and new architecture. Then something directly below his window catches his attention. He looks sharply downward, his body visibly tensing with a detective's instinct for noticing anomalies. Jeff, with a restraining hand to Stella, begins to edge his chair cautiously forward so that he can see what the salesman is looking at. The camera pans down, and we now see that the old lady with the hearing aid, a retired schoolteacher with a soft spot for animals, is leaning over the fence admonishing the dog. The salesman leans forward and grips the window sill as he watches the dog, a small terrier known in the neighborhood for its curious antics. The camera moves forward, and as it reaches the edge of the window, pans down and shows us what the salesman is looking at. The little dog that was lowered in the basket, a common practice in the area for dog owners living in apartments without elevators, is sniffing at the salesman's personal flower bed filled with rare orchids. Jeff's eyes move up quickly to look at the salesman, noting the tension in his stance. We can faintly hear her voice saying something to the effect that he'll get into trouble if he doesn't move. The old lady is wearing a faded house-robe that she received as a gift from her late husband. The dog turns to glance at her and, apparently taking heed, moves away. Jeff is amused at the dog incident, a brief comic relief in an otherwise tense setting. Behind him, Stella moves to the center of the room, saying with a tone suggesting she’s seen it all before. She begins putting her equipment back into her black bag, a well-worn item she’s carried throughout her career. Jeff's eyes lift to the salesman's apartment, and the amusement drains from his face as he observes the meticulous cleaning, indicative of someone who is used to hiding evidence. He is carefully wiping out the interior with a dust cloth. The salesman has his aluminum case, which resembles those often used by traveling salesmen in the mid-20th century, on the table near the center of the room. Jeff continues to watch the salesman, his face showing a great concentration of thought, piecing together a puzzle of suspicion. Jeff watching intently with the focus of a seasoned investigator. Stella picks up her bag, stares at Jeff's back a moment, then starts for the door, sensing the urgency in his demeanor. Jeff swings halfway around in his chair just as Stella reaches the top of the steps. She turns around. Jeff points to a coat-stand near the door, gesturing towards the binoculars hanging there. She puts down her bag, reaches for the binoculars, takes them out of the case, a gift from Jeff’s journalism days. She comes down the stairs, brings them to him, understanding the unspoken request. Stella sniffs, then goes to the door, as she says with a hint of resignation about the unfolding drama. As Stella goes out the door, the camera moves in until Jeff's head and the binoculars are filling the screen, creating a frame of intense scrutiny and anticipation. He immediately swings to the window and lifts them to his eyes, determined to uncover the truth hidden in plain sight."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
