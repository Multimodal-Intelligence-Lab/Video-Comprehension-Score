He heads over to Alison, who wears a black wig and holds a cigarette in a long holder, a nod to 1920s flapper fashion. He removes the fangs.

He eyes the pancakes, salmon, yogurt, avocados, kale, and pastry. He runs away with a scarf over his shoulder. Denver fluffs a blanket on her wooden chair and picks her sister’s magazine from the sideboard. In doing so, she knocks Marcus’s scarf to the ground.

The cluster disperses but Marcus lingers. He glances as she wanders away. Into her bedroom mirror. She sticks some fake whiskers in. She crinkles her eyebrows. With green face powder, whiskers, and a cloak, she holds a cup of milk as she encounters Horace dressed as Greta Garbo. He lounges laughing. Denver strolls away.

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

          "description": "Sydney is in his kitchen cooking breakfast, while Alison, in his pajamas, notices a black and white photo he's examining. Feeling unwell, she rushes away. Sydney accidentally knocks her handbag, spilling its contents, and secretly reads her red notebook. Alison catches him, shrugs, and starts collecting her things. They share a lighthearted moment, dancing to the soundtrack of \"La Dolce Vita.\" Later, Alison works at her desk when Sydney, eavesdropping, accidentally sets off a fire alarm and quickly hides. At a costume party, Sydney sees Alison with Lawrence, who gives her champagne and a cheek kiss, leaving Sydney unsettled as they silently drink together."
