In the dim light that later fills the room, Graham and Merrill remain deeply engrossed, even as the children have drifted off to sleep. Graham's eyes meet Merrill's, who momentarily looks away as his smile fades, leaving Graham with a somber expression. Feeling uneasy, Merrill reflects on this and then remembers something, which causes his face to brighten slightly, and he smiles. Graham continues to watch the TV as Merrill turns to glance at him and then gives a slight nod. Graham exchanges a knowing look with his brother, who, with a forlorn expression, diverts his gaze back to the TV.

With a sense of determination, Graham fixes Merrill with a piercing stare, his face showing traces of anger, his features taut, and his eyes shining as he turns his focus back to the television.

Now comfortably seated on the couch, Morgan pauses for a moment to use his inhaler, which is conveniently positioned beside him, near Merrill, while Bo finds her spot at the very end of the sofa next to her father. All four of them are utterly mesmerized by whatever captivating scenes are currently unfolding on the television screen, on top of which rest two glasses of water, casting faint reflections. As dim light gradually envelops the room, Graham and Merrill remain profoundly engrossed in the broadcast, even as the children have peacefully drifted off to sleep. Graham's eyes lock onto Merrill's, who momentarily looks away, and at that instant, his smile disappears, leaving Graham with a somewhat somber expression on his face. Feeling a sense of unease, Merrill reflects on the situation and then, as if recalling something, his face brightens slightly, and a warm smile spreads across his features. As Graham continues to watch the television intently, Merrill turns to glance at him and then gives a slight nod of understanding. Graham shares a knowing look with his brother, who, with a forlorn expression, diverts his gaze back toward the TV screen. With a vacant, distant stare, Graham's eyes lock onto Merrill's, who silently shakes his head in response. With a burgeoning sense of determination, Graham fixes Merrill with a piercing stare, his face etched with traces of anger, his facial features taut, and his eyes shining with intensity as he refocuses on the television. Merrill, appearing contemplative and thoughtful, lowers his gaze momentarily before turning his attention back to the TV once more, the two of them watching together in what seems to be a trance-like state. Now, we see Graham, looking fresh-faced and dressed in black attire with a contrasting white dog collar, as he drives slowly along a winding country road under the cover of night. In the distance, the flashing lights of emergency vehicles catch his attentive eye, and Caroline becomes visible on the road, energetically waving her arms above her head in an attempt to signal him. With a long face reflecting concern, Graham brings the car to a halt and steps out as Caroline approaches to meet him halfway. Soon after, Graham, now waking up on the sofa, scans the room with eyes that remain glazed and unfocused, as natural light pours generously through the windows into the comfortably furnished space. He pushes himself into a sitting position and remains still for a moment, taking in his surroundings, before noticing a black cable winding its way across the polished dark wood floor. Rising to his feet, he follows the cable's path as it extends gracefully across the room and into the adjoining hallway, eventually discovering that it leads into a closet situated beneath the stairs. Upon opening the door, Graham finds Merrill, with bleary eyes, sitting completely still as he stares blankly at the TV, looking up with a hint of surprise at Graham's unexpected presence. Feeling uncomfortable and somewhat out of place, Graham exits quietly, allowing the doors to gently close behind him. Later, we see Graham in a soft blue dressing gown, moving softly out of the bathroom while drying his ear with a towel, a frown clouding his face as he makes his way towards a window to peer into the empty garden, which features an array of inviting swings, a sturdy climbing frame, and a rustic picnic bench. Upon hearing a disembodied voice, Graham raises his eyebrows in curiosity, walks along the landing, and steps into the children's room, where he finds Morgan and Bo perched on a bed, adorned with playful, cone-shaped hats made of shiny silver foil. They look up with wide eyes as Morgan holds a book open, and Bo eagerly points to her hat. Graham enters, situating himself between his children on the bed, gazes thoughtfully down at Morgan's book, and watches with interest as Morgan gently closes it with care."

Morgan then takes a seat, ensuring he is comfortably settled next to Merrill, and calmly takes a moment to use his inhaler. Meanwhile, Bo is positioned at the other end of the sofa, comfortably nestled beside her dad. They all are engrossed, their eyes glued to the television where two glasses of water rest on top, capturing their attention. As time passes, the room dims, yet Graham and Merrill remain fixated on the screen while the children succumb to sleep. Graham's unwavering gaze meets Merrill's, but as Merrill's eyes divert, the warmth in his smile gradually dims, and Graham's expression shifts to one of somber contemplation. A sense of unease washes over Merrill as he processes Graham's demeanor until a sudden recollection causes a slight uplift in his spirits, allowing a grin to spread across his face. Graham continues to watch the screen intently while Merrill turns to observe him before giving a slight nod. Graham exchanges a look full of understanding with his brother; however, Merrill, overtaken by a forlorn air, redirects his attention back to the TV. Graham's expression turns vacant as his eyes find Merrill's, who responds with a subtle shake of his head. Determined, Graham fixes Merrill with a piercing stare, his emotions bordering on anger as tension tightens his features, and a glistening intensity flashes in his eyes before he resolutely shifts focus back to the TV. Merrill casts his eyes downward, lost in thought, before aligning his gaze with the TV, and together, they watch, their faces blank, caught in what seems like a trance. The scene transitions to a rejuvenated Graham, now dressed in clerical black with a white dog collar, driving unhurriedly down a lonely country road under the cover of night. Ahead, the scene ushers him to a halt as the flashing lights of emergency vehicles come into view and Caroline becomes visible, standing on the road energetically waving her arms. Graham, face drawn and weary, brings his car to a stop and exits as Caroline approaches him purposefully. Without warning, Graham awakens from this reverie on the sofa, his eyes glazed as sunlight pours into the well-furnished room, casting warmth and brightness. He sits up slowly, absorbing the room around him until his attention is captured by a black cable lying along the polished dark wood floor. Curiosity propels him to his feet, and he traces the cable's path across the room and into the hallway, ultimately leading him to a closet nestled under the stairs. Opening the door reveals Merrill inside, his eyes bleary but fixed on the TV; he remains motionless until Graham's presence causes him to look up, registering mild surprise. Feeling awkward, Graham retreats, allowing the door to close behind him. Time moves forward, and Graham, now clad in a blue dressing gown, emerges from the bathroom, absently drying his ear with a towel while his brow furrows. He approaches a window, gazing out at the empty garden adorned with swings, a climbing frame, and a picnic bench. The sound of a voice catches his attention, prompting him to raise his eyebrows in curiosity. He walks deliberately along the landing and enters the children's room, where Morgan and Bo are positioned on a bed, silver foil hats shaped in pointy cones perched atop their heads. As Graham steps in, they both look up at him with expectant eyes; Morgan holds a book open while Bo gestures toward the hat she wears. Graham enters further, taking a place on the bed between his children, and peers down at the book Morgan has open in his hands. Without words, Morgan closes the book, signaling the end of their shared moment as Graham sits comfortably between them."

Now seated, Morgan, who has asthma, uses his inhaler beside Merrill, while Bo is at the other end of the sofa beside her dad. All four of them are hypnotized by the TV, on which sit two glasses of water, a common technique in their home to observe any unusual movements or vibrations. Later, in the dim light of the living room, Graham and Merrill remain transfixed, while the children sleep peacefully. Graham stares ahead and meets Merrill's gaze, who looks away as his smile fades, and Graham appears somber. Uneasy, Merrill ponders this before recalling something significant from their past, causing his face to brighten a little, and he grins. Graham watches the TV, which now displays a news report on mysterious crop circles, while Merrill looks at him and then nods. Graham gives a knowing glance to his brother Merrill, who, looking forlorn, returns his gaze to the TV. Graham stares vacantly as his eyes meet Merrill's, who shakes his head, possibly remembering their shared childhood challenges. With conviction, Graham stares piercingly at Merrill, determined to convey his thoughts, looking almost angry, his features taut and eyes glistening as he turns to face the TV. Merrill looks down thoughtfully, then turns to the TV as well, and they watch together with blank expressions, as if in a trance, perhaps lost in their individual reflections on recent events. Now, a fresh-faced Graham, a former reverend, dressed in black and wearing a white dog collar, drives slowly down a country road at night. Ahead, the lights of emergency vehicles flash, indicating an accident, and Caroline, a close family friend, stands in the road, waving her arms above her head to signal him. His face long, Graham pulls to a stop and climbs out as Caroline walks up to meet him, breaking the somber news. Graham wakes up on the sofa, scanning the room with glazed eyes reflecting his restless nights, as light floods through the windows into the comfortably furnished room that was once his sanctuary.

Uncomfortable, Graham leaves, and the doors shut with a soft click. Later, Graham, in a blue dressing gown that suggests a touch of routine comfort, pads out of the bathroom drying his ear with a towel, frowning as he goes to a window and looks into the empty garden with its swings, climbing frame, and picnic bench, memories of happier days echoing in his mind. Hearing a voice, Graham raises his eyebrows, walks along the landing, and enters the children's room, where Morgan and Bo sit on a bed wearing pointy, cone-shaped hats made of silver foil, playing a game inspired by science fiction tales they've read. They look up as Morgan holds a book open, perhaps one of their favorite bedtime stories, and Bo points to her hat, proud of their creation. Graham enters, sits down between his children on the bed, peers down at Morgan's book, filled with fantastical adventures, and Morgan closes it, signaling a pause in their imaginative journey."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
