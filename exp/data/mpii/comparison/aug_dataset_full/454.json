Buttercup is touched as before but then seems stunned as she advances on Buttercup now, who is more and more panicked. Buttercup comes out of her nightmare, alone in her castle bedroom, and as she frantically grabs a robe, she starts to run. She bursts into the Prince's chambers where Count Rugen stands nearby, just stunned. Finally, softly, he begins to talk, and she nods. The trees are unusual in one respect: all of them are extraordinarily heavily knotted. Humperdinck and Rugen walk into the grove of trees, deeper into the grove now as Rugen searches around. Rugen smiles and hurries down the stairs as the tree slides back perfectly into place. Count Rugen drags Westley up alongside the thing—levers and wheels and wires, you name it, it's there. Westley has suction cups on his head now, on his temple, on his heart, his hands and feet. He says nothing, keeps control of himself, and then opens the flood gate, water pours down the chute, turning the wheel, which in turn really gets The Machine going.

The throng suddenly descends to its knees, wave after wave of silent bowing individuals, all of them down. Buttercup is touched as before but then seems astonished as she progresses on Buttercup now, who is more and more terrified. Buttercup emerges from her terror, solitary in her castle chamber, and as she feverishly takes a robe, she begins to sprint. She bursts into the Prince's rooms where Count Rugen stands nearby, merely astonished. Finally, softly, he commences to speak, and she nods. The trees are unusual in one respect: all of them are remarkably heavily knotted. Humperdinck and Rugen wander into the grove of trees, deeper into the grove now as Rugen searches around. Rugen grins and hurries down the staircase as the tree slides back perfectly into position. Count Rugen hauls Westley up alongside the apparatus—levers and gears and wires, you name it, it's present. Westley has suction cups on his cranium now, on his temple, on his heart, his hands and feet. He says nothing, maintains control of himself, and then opens the floodgate, water gushes down the chute, turning the wheel, which in turn really activates The Machine. Westley is reclining on the table, and he's only flesh and the shackles are metal and thick, but such is his despair it almost seems he might break them. It continues to come as we finally see he switches off The Machine, picks up a large journal and pen, and settles in a chair. Westley is in torment so profound it is vertiginous, and powerless, he weeps. Count Rugen observes the tears, then starts to write in his quarters, inundated, with piles of documents scattered all over. Now Yellin, a pale, shifty, quick-eyed man, appears in the doorway, entering. The Prince and Yellin turn to her in the doorway as she glides out. A lot of shouting is going on as the thieves are being gathered up by the Brute Squad, a large assembly of large men, with Yellin standing on a cart in the midst of all the scuffling, and his cart starts, and as it does, Inigo, intoxicated as a skunk, sprawls in front of a hovel, a bottle of brandy in one hand, the six-fingered blade in the other. He looks dreadful, unshaven, puffy-eyed, gaunt. Inigo feels a hand on his back and compares it to his own smaller hand, and as the Assistant Brute is just about to club Inigo's brains out, Fezzik lets fly with a stupendous punch."

Buttercup, touched yet stunned, advances toward the now-panicked Buttercup.

Count Rugen drags Westley to a contraption with levers, wheels, and wires, attaching suction cups to his head, temple, heart, hands, and feet. Westley, silent and composed, opens the flood gate, releasing water that powers The Machine. Chained to a table, his desperation nearly breaks the metal. Rugen switches off The Machine, observes Westley's tears, and starts writing amid piles of papers. Yellin, a pale, quick-eyed man, enters, and the Prince and Yellin turn as she exits.

          "description": "As the cinematic moment is frozen in time, with Humperdinck halted mid-sentence, we observe that the Kid is now half-sitting. He is not fully strong yet, not entirely robust, but he is undeniably more vigorous and resilient than when he was first introduced to us. Accompanying these words, as we witnessed earlier, Buttercup makes her appearance. The entire crowd, without exception, suddenly cascades to its knees. Wave after wave of silent kneeling brings all the gathered people down to the ground. Buttercup is initially moved, as before, by this scene, but she then appears utterly stunned as she moves forward toward Buttercup, who becomes increasingly panic-stricken with each step. Abruptly, Buttercup awakens from her nightmare, finding herself alone in the solitude of her castle bedroom. In a state of panic, she hurriedly grabs a robe and begins to run. She dashes into the Prince's chambers, where Count Rugen stands nearby, utterly taken aback by the sudden intrusion. After this moment of surprise, he begins to speak softly, and she acknowledges his words with a nod. The grove of trees they enter is peculiar in one distinctive respect: every single tree is heavily knotted, more so than any ordinary tree. Humperdinck and Rugen venture deeper into this grove, as Rugen searches intently around the area. A moment later, he smiles and quickly descends the stairs as the tree slides back seamlessly into its original place. Count Rugen drags Westley to a large, ominous apparatus composed of levers, wheels, and various intricate wires—practically every conceivable mechanical component is present. Westley now has suction cups affixed to his head, his temples, his heart, and even his hands and feet. He remains silent, exerting a formidable control over himself, and then proceeds to open the flood gate. Water cascades down the chute, causing the wheel to turn and truly activating The Machine. Westley is lying there, restrained to the table, his body made of mere flesh while the chains confining him are made of dense metal, formidable and thick. Yet, despite this, his desperation is so intense it almost seems that he might shatter those chains. The process continues as we finally observe Count Rugen switching off The Machine. He then picks up a large notebook and pen, seating himself in a chair. Westley is plunged into a depth of anguish so profound it is dizzying; he remains helpless and succumbs to tears. Count Rugen watches as the tears fall, and then he begins to write in his quarters, which are cluttered and overwhelmed with piles of strewn papers everywhere. Meanwhile, Yellin, who is a pale, shifty man with quick eyes, appears, entering at the doorway. The Prince and Yellin both turn toward her as she gracefully exits through the doorway. There is a significant amount of shouting as the thieves are being rounded up by the Brute Squad. This formidable group consists of numerous large men, and Yellin stands prominently on a wagon amidst the chaos and scuffling. As the wagon sets into motion, Inigo, drunk beyond measure, lies sprawled in front of a hovel with a bottle of brandy in one hand and the six-fingered sword in the other. He appears in a dreadful state—unshaven, with puffy eyes, and gaunt. Inigo suddenly feels a hand placed upon his back and compares its size to his own smaller hand. Just as the Assistant Brute is about to strike Inigo, intending to incapacitate him, Fezzik intervenes, delivering a stupendous punch."

Abruptly, Buttercup awakens from her terrifying nightmare, finding herself alone in the solitude of her grand castle bedroom.

At that moment, as previously observed, Buttercup emerges into the scene. The crowd, as if guided by an invisible force, suddenly and silently descends to its knees, creating wave after wave of kneeling people, all uniformly lowered in reverence. Buttercup, initially touched by the scene, becomes visibly stunned as she advances, only to find herself growing more and more panicked. Abruptly, Buttercup snaps out of her nightmare, finding herself alone in her castle bedroom. In a frantic response to her sudden awakening, she hurriedly grabs a robe and begins to sprint. Bursting into the Prince's chambers, she discovers Count Rugen standing nearby, utterly stunned at her unexpected entrance. Finally, with a soft demeanor, the Prince begins to speak to her, and she responds with a nod. Meanwhile, the surrounding trees stand out due to their unusual characteristic of being extraordinarily heavily knotted. Within this grove, Humperdinck and Rugen traverse deeper, with Rugen meticulously searching around. A confident smile spreads across Rugen’s face as he hastens down a set of stairs, allowing a tree to slide seamlessly back into position. Count Rugen then proceeds to drag Westley up beside a complex contraption filled with levers, wheels, and wires—a machine of intricate design and purpose. At this point, Westley finds himself adorned with suction cups placed strategically on his head, temples, heart, hands, and feet. Despite the dire situation, he maintains his composure, saying nothing, and then proceeds to open the floodgate, causing water to cascade down the chute. This action energizes the wheel, setting The Machine into vigorous motion. Westley lies on the table, his flesh vulnerable and constrained by thick metal chains, yet his desperation is so potent it seems almost conceivable that he might somehow break free. The relentless activity culminates as Count Rugen finally switches off The Machine. He then picks up a large notebook and a pen, settling into a chair to document his observations. Meanwhile, Westley experiences an anguish so profound it becomes dizzying, rendering him helpless and causing him to weep. Count Rugen observes these tears with keen interest before he starts to write amidst his quarters, which are overwhelmed with piles of disorganized papers scattered across the space. At this juncture, Yellin, a man of pale complexion, shifty demeanor, and quick eyes, makes his appearance at the doorway, stepping inside. The Prince and Yellin turn towards her as she smoothly exits through the doorway. Concurrently, a cacophony of hollering fills the air as thieves are forcefully gathered by the Brute Squad—a formidable group of men, large in both stature and number. Yellin stands directing activity atop a wagon amidst the chaos, and as the wagon begins to move, Inigo, heavily intoxicated and sprawled in front of a hovel, clutches a bottle of brandy in one hand and the six-fingered sword in the other. His appearance is disheveled and wretched: unshaven, with puffy eyes and a gaunt frame. Inigo, feeling a hand on his back, instinctively compares it to his own smaller hand. Just as the Assistant Brute is poised to deliver a brain-shattering blow to Inigo, Fezzik intervenes with an exceptionally powerful punch, altering the course of events."

Both shocked and silent, he starts speaking softly, while she listens and nods. \n\nHumperdinck and Rugen enter a grove of unusually heavily knotted trees. As they delve deeper, Rugen discovers a secret staircase, smiles, and descends swiftly, the tree sliding back into position. In the underground chamber, he secures Westley to a contraption filled with levers, wheels, and wires, attaching suction cups to various parts of Westley's body. Maintaining composure, Westley watches as Rugen releases water, activating The Machine. Chained and desperate on the table, Westley struggles with all his might.

Buttercup, who is renowned in the land for her unparalleled beauty, steps forward, causing the crowd to suddenly go to its knees, wave after wave of silent kneeling people, all of them down. Buttercup, touched as before by their reverence, then seems stunned as she advances on Buttercup now, who is more and more panicked. Buttercup comes out of her nightmare, alone in her castle bedroom, a lavish room adorned with tapestries and fine furnishings, and as she frantically grabs a robe, she starts to run. She bursts into the Prince's chambers where Count Rugen, the sadistic inventor of The Machine, stands nearby, just stunned. Finally, softly, he begins to talk, revealing his usual calm demeanor, and she nods. The trees are unusual in one respect: all of them are extraordinarily heavily knotted, a result of the unique soil conditions in the kingdom's enchanted forest. Humperdinck and Rugen walk into the grove of trees, deeper into the grove now as Rugen searches around for the secret passage. Rugen smiles, knowing the hidden mechanism, and hurries down the stairs as the tree slides back perfectly into place, concealing their tracks. Count Rugen drags Westley, the daring farm boy turned hero, up alongside the thing—levers and wheels and wires, you name it, it's there as part of his torture device. Westley has suction cups on his head now, on his temple, on his heart, his hands and feet, part of the apparatus designed to inflict and measure pain. He says nothing, keeps control of himself, and then opens the flood gate, water pours down the chute, turning the wheel, which in turn really gets The Machine, infamous for its cruelty, going. Westley is lying on the table, and he's only flesh and the chains are metal and thick, but such is his desperation it almost seems he might break them. It keeps on coming as we finally see he switches off The Machine, picks up a large notebook and pen, the tools for documenting his cruel experiments, and sits in a chair. Westley is in anguish so deep it is dizzying, and helpless, he cries. Count Rugen watches the tears, fascinated by the suffering, then starts to write in his quarters, swamped, with piles of papers strewn all over, evidence of his dark research. Now Yellin, a pale, shifty, quick-eyed man, who serves as the chief of security in Florin, appears in the doorway, entering. The Prince and Yellin turn to her in the doorway as she glides out. A lot of hollering is going on as the thieves are being rounded up by the Brute Squad, a large group of large men notorious for their brute force, with Yellin standing on a wagon in the midst of all the scuffling, overseeing the operation, and his wagon starts, and as it does, Inigo, drunk as a skunk, sprawls in front of a hovel, a bottle of brandy in one hand, the six-fingered sword, a legacy weapon from his father, in the other. He looks dreadful, unshaven, puffy-eyed, gaunt. Inigo feels a hand on his back and compares it to his own smaller hand, and as the Assistant Brute is just about to club Inigo's brains out, Fezzik, the gigantic and gentle giant with unmatched strength, lets fly with a stupendous punch."

Honeysuckle is moved as before but then appears bewildered as she advances on Honeysuckle now, who is more and more frantic. Honeysuckle emerges from her nightmare, alone in her lighthouse loft, and as she frantically grasps a cloak, she begins to sprint. She bursts into the King's chambers where Duke Marlin stands nearby, just bewildered. Finally, softly, he starts to converse, and she agrees. The rocks are peculiar in one aspect: all of them are extraordinarily heavily tangled. Barnacle and Marlin stroll into the grove of rocks, deeper into the grove now as Marlin pokes around. Marlin grins and scurries down the ladder as the rock slides back perfectly into position. Duke Marlin hauls Waverly up alongside the device—levers and cogs and cables, you name it, it's there. Waverly has suction disks on his scalp now, on his brow, on his core, his palms and soles. He says nothing, maintains control of himself, and then opens the sluice gate, liquid rushes down the channel, spinning the cog, which in turn really gets The Apparatus churning. Waverly is lying on the slab, and he's only flesh and the restraints are metallic and hefty, but such is his urgency it almost seems he might shatter them. It keeps on coming as we finally see he deactivates The Apparatus, picks up a large journal and stylus, and reclines in a perch. Waverly is in torment so profound it is nauseating, and powerless, he weeps. Duke Marlin observes the sobs, then starts to document in his quarters, overwhelmed, with heaps of scrolls strewn all over.

He appears dreadful, unkempt, swollen-eyed, emaciated.

The unicorn is amused as before but then seems delighted as she dances on the unicorn now, who is more and more excited. The unicorn comes out of her dream, alone in her forest cabin, and as she playfully grabs a cloak, she starts to jump. She leaps into the King's chambers where the Chef stands nearby, just amused. Finally, quietly, he begins to sing, and she listens. The clouds are unusual in one respect: all of them are extraordinarily brightly colored. The rabbit and the Chef stroll into the meadow of clouds, deeper into the meadow now as the Chef examines around. The Chef claps and races up the stairs as the cloud floats back perfectly into place. The Chef swings Westley up alongside the contraption—bells and whistles and lights, you name it, it's there. Westley has feathers on his head now, on his shoulder, on his feet, his arms and knees. He hears nothing, keeps control of himself, and then closes the flood gate, water evaporates up the chute, turning the fan, which in turn really gets The Device going. Westley is sitting on the floor, and he's only fabric and the ropes are silk and shiny, but such is his boredom it almost seems he might untangle them. It keeps on fading as we finally see he switches on The Device, picks up a tiny journal and pencil, and lies on a couch. Westley is in joy so deep it is overwhelming, and delighted, he laughs.

Now Buttercup, a bright, cheerful, wide-eyed woman, appears in the portal, exiting. The King and Buttercup glance at her in the portal as she floats away. A lot of cheering is going on as the acrobats are being gathered up by the Circus Troupe, a small group of small children, with Buttercup perched on a horse in the midst of all the cheering, and her horse gallops, and as it does, Fezzik, cheerful as a bird, dances in front of a circus tent, a bouquet of flowers in one hand, the colorful hat in the other. He looks joyful, sparkling, bright-eyed, cheerful. Fezzik feels a gust of wind on his back and contrasts it with his own smaller breath, and as the Dancing Brute is just about to leap over Fezzik's head, Inigo lets out a mighty cheer."

Buttercup is tickled as before but then seems perplexed as she retreats from Buttercup now, who is more and more bewildered. Buttercup walks out of her illusion, alone in her garden tent, and as she casually grabs a shawl, she starts to stroll. She tiptoes into the Prince's lair where Count Rugen lounges nearby, just puzzled. Finally, loudly, he begins to whisper, and she shakes her head. The flowers are peculiar in one aspect: all of them are extraordinarily heavily branched. Humperdinck and Rugen skip into the field of flowers, further into the field now as Rugen glances around. Rugen grins and leaps down the ladder as the flower slides back perfectly into place. Count Rugen hauls Westley up alongside the structure—pipes and beams and rails, you name it, it's there. Westley has magnets on his head now, on his chin, on his elbow, his knees and toes. He whispers nothing, maintains control of himself, and then opens the window, light pours down the path, turning the lever, which in turn really gets The Device buzzing. Westley is sitting on the bench, and he's only wood and the ropes are cotton and thin, but such is his eagerness it almost seems he might unravel them. It keeps on flowing as we finally see he shuts off The Device, picks up a giant folio and brush, and reclines on a sofa. Westley is in sorrow so profound it is exhilarating, and powerless, he laughs. Count Rugen watches the chuckles, then begins to sketch in his kitchen, overwhelmed, with stacks of books stacked all over.

The assembly abruptly collapses to their elbows, ripple after ripple of silent crouching individuals, all of them flattened. Daisy is brushed as before but then appears bewildered as she tiptoes towards Daisy now, who is increasingly agitated. Daisy snaps out of her illusion, solitary in her fortress chamber, and as she hastily snatches a cloak, she begins to stroll. She crashes into the King's quarters where Duke Peabody stands nearby, just perplexed. Gradually, softly, he starts to mumble, and she gestures. The shrubs are distinctive in one attribute: all of them are exceptionally densely twisted. Fiddlesticks and Peabody march into the glen of bushes, further into the grove now as Peabody investigates around. Peabody grins and scurries down the ladder as the bush slides back flawlessly into location. Duke Peabody pulls Marvin up alongside the contraption—levers and gears and strings, you name it, it's present. Marvin has suction pads on his forehead now, on his cheeks, on his chest, his toes and fingers. He whispers zilch, maintains mastery of himself, and then unleashes the sluice gate, liquid cascades down the ramp, spinning the cog, which in turn truly gets The Device whirring. Marvin is reclining on the platform, and he's only skin and the restraints are steel and hefty, but such is his yearning it almost seems he might shatter them. It persists in descending as we ultimately perceive he deactivates The Device, seizes a vast journal and quill, and reclines in a lounger. Marvin is in torment so profound it is bewildering, and powerless, he weeps. Duke Peabody observes the sobs, then commences to scribble in his study, inundated, with heaps of scrolls littered all over. Now Gaston, a wan, sly, quick-glimpsed fellow, manifests in the entryway, entering. The King and Gaston pivot to her in the portal as she drifts away. A lot of bellowing is occurring as the marauders are being collected by the Giant Group, a substantial assembly of towering folk, with Gaston perched on a chariot in the midst of all the scuffling, and his chariot begins, and as it does, Antonio, inebriated as a fox, lounges in front of a shack, a flask of rum in one hand, the seven-fingered sword in the other. He appears ghastly, unshorn, swollen-eyed, emaciated. Antonio senses a palm on his shoulders and contrasts it with his own tinier palm, and as the Deputy Giant is just about to batter Antonio's skull in, Rocky lets loose with a tremendous kick."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

          "description": "In a paused scene, Humperdinck is silenced while the Kid appears stronger than before. Buttercup, overwhelmed by a kneeling crowd, wakes from a nightmare in her castle bedroom, grabs a robe, and rushes to the Prince's chambers, where she finds a stunned Count Rugen. In a grove of heavily knotted trees, Humperdinck and Rugen uncover a mechanism. Rugen descends stairs, revealing a complex machine to which Westley is bound with suction cups on his body. As Rugen activates the machine, Westley struggles against his restraints in desperation, eventually crying in anguish. Rugen observes and begins writing notes, surrounded by a mess of papers. Meanwhile, Yellin, a shifty man, enters to find the Prince and Yellin engaged. Outside, the Brute Squad rounds up thieves, with Yellin overseeing from a wagon. Amidst the chaos, a drunk and disheveled Inigo sprawls with brandy and his six-fingered sword. As an Assistant Brute is about to strike Inigo, Fezzik intervenes with a powerful punch, saving him."
