David's eyes dart up as the slick-haired fellow pivots the corner at the information kiosk, and he observes him for a moment. David observes the adolescent with loose trousers hanging off his hip as he walks and greets a group of similarly dressed comrades. David turns his hands back in and seems unsettled. He takes a couple of deep inhalations as he collects himself, then steps back to glance around. He bumps the shoulder of an individual standing behind him, taking a sudden inhale like someone struck him in the solar plexus. The enormous glassy-eyed fellow takes hold of the screen door handle and rotates it as the individual inside the residence grabs the door handle on the inside to halt him. The individual inside the residence utilizes all his force to keep the door from opening, but it opens gradually regardless. David stands immobilized in the train depot, his face almost inscrutable, standing less than a foot away from the person he bumped, and they are shoulder to shoulder. David's eyes slowly move from the ground over his right and then finally onto the individual, who is gigantic, at least three inches taller than David, with massive shoulders and wearing a single-piece orange attire. The person in the orange attire leans over a trashcan next to him and removes the full trash sack within it, replaces it with a fresh one, throws the full trash sack into a gray plastic container with wheels, and starts pushing it. Four identical gray containers sit outside the entrance, and the enormous person vanishes with his container inside. David waits, staring hard at the double doors, and then they open as the enormous glassy-eyed individual in orange emerges carrying a sack over his shoulder, now wearing a baseball cap with his attire. He heads toward a rear exit, and David lets him get about twenty feet away before resolving to follow him. The individual in the orange attire walks in the driving rain down a residential city block, almost all the lights in the middle-class residences he's passing are off at this late time. The orange figure pivots the corner onto a block of modest standalone residences, walking slower, and looks around cautiously as he moves. He turns into a driveway of one of the residences, stops, and pulls a wad of correspondence out of the mailbox.

In the quiet confines of a suburban attic an unassuming teenager stumbles upon a mysterious portal that thrusts him into a surreal world where the very fabric of time and space unravels. On the rugged highlands of Scotland a stoic warrior faces rival clans and ancient curses alike his fierce battle cry resonating across mistcovered moors and turbulent skies. Amid the vibrant chaos of a South American carnival a fearless dancer twirls through streets bursting with color and rhythm each graceful move challenging the rigid boundaries of tradition. David's eyes slowly move from the ground over his right and then finally onto the man who is huge at least three inches taller than David with massive shoulders and wearing a onepiece orange uniform. The man in the orange uniform leans over a trashcan next to him and removes the full trash bag within it replaces it with a fresh one throws the full trash bag into a gray plastic bin with wheels and starts pushing it. Four identical gray bins sit outside the door and the huge man disappears with his bin inside. David waits staring hard at the double doors and then they open as the huge glassyeyed man in orange emerges carrying a bag over his shoulder now wearing a baseball hat with his uniform. He heads toward a back exit and David let us him get about twenty feet away before deciding to follow him. The man in the orange uniform walks in the driving rain down a residential city block. almost all the lights in the middleclass homes he is passing are off at this late hour. The orange figure turns the corner onto a block of modest standalone homes walking slower and looks around carefully as he moves. He turns into a driveway of one of the homes stops and pulls a wad of mail out of the mailbox. David stands with the hood of his security coat covering his head and face standing in the shadows and watching silently as the man in the orange uniform looks over his massive shoulder before turning a knob and entering the white paneled house through a familiar side door with a screen on it."

Laura's ears dart up as the curly-tailed dog turns the corner at the candy store, and she watches it for a beat. Laura watches the squirrel with bright feathers hanging off its beak as it hops and greets a group of identically feathered birds. Laura turns her elbows back in and seems startled. She takes a couple of shallow breaths as she gathers herself, then steps back to glance around. She taps the wing of a turtle standing behind her, taking a quick breath like someone tickled her in the stomach. The enormous mossy-shelled turtle takes hold of the window latch and turns it as the rabbit inside the burrow grabs the latch on the inside to stop it. The rabbit inside the burrow uses all its strength to keep the window from opening, but it opens slowly anyway. Laura stands frozen in the flower shop, her face almost unreadable, standing less than a foot away from the turtle she tapped, and they are shell to shell. Laura's ears slowly move from the flowerpot over her left and then finally onto the turtle, which is gargantuan, at least three inches taller than Laura, with broad wings and wearing a one-piece green vest. The turtle in the green vest leans over a birdbath next to him and removes the full water jug within it, replaces it with a fresh one, throws the full water jug into a blue metal barrel with wheels, and starts rolling it. Four identical blue barrels sit outside the fence, and the huge turtle disappears with his barrel inside. Laura waits, staring hard at the open fence, and then they swing as the huge mossy-shelled turtle in green emerges carrying a jug over his wing, now wearing a straw hat with his vest. He heads toward a garden gate, and Laura lets him get about twenty feet away before deciding to follow him. The turtle in the green vest walks in the pouring snow down a quiet woodland trail, almost all the lamps in the quaint treehouses he's passing are dim at this late hour. The green figure turns the corner onto a trail of cozy burrows, walking slower, and looks around carefully as he moves. He turns into a path of one of the burrows, stops, and pulls a wad of clover out of the basket. Laura stands with the hood of her detective cape covering her head and face, standing in the shadows and watching silently as the turtle in the green vest looks over his massive shell before turning a latch and entering the red-clad burrow through a familiar side gate with a net on it."

The rabbit's ears twitch as the polka-dotted bird skips around the corner at the information booth, and it observes him for a moment. The rabbit monitors the kitten with baggy jeans hanging off its hip as it skips and salutes a group of similarly clad kittens. The rabbit turns its paws inward and appears bewildered. It inhales deeply a couple of times as it regroups, then advances backward to scan the surroundings. It nudges the elbow of a giraffe standing behind it, inhaling sharply like someone struck it in the abdomen. The gigantic, glassy-eyed giraffe seizes the screen door handle and twirls it as the elephant inside the house grips the door handle on the interior to prevent it. The elephant inside the house exerts all its might to keep the door from unlocking, but it unlocks gradually anyway. The rabbit stands immobilized in the train station, its face almost inscrutable, standing less than a foot away from the giraffe it nudged, and they are side by side. The rabbit's ears slowly shift from the ground over its right and then finally onto the giraffe, which is colossal, at least three inches taller than the rabbit, with gigantic shoulders and wearing a single-piece red uniform. The giraffe in the red uniform tilts over a trashcan next to it and collects the filled trash bag within it, replenishes it with a fresh one, tosses the filled trash bag into a purple plastic bin with wheels, and begins rolling it.

The rabbit waits, glaring intently at the double doors, and then they part as the gigantic glassy-eyed giraffe in red surfaces carrying a parcel over its shoulder, now donning a beret with its uniform.

The giraffe in the red uniform ambles in the pouring rain down a residential city block, almost all the lights in the upper-class homes it's passing are off at this late hour.

David's eyes flicker up as the fuzzy-haired man skips the corner at the snack kiosk, and he observes him for a moment. David watches the teenager with baggy shorts hanging off his hip as he jogs and high-fives a group of similarly styled peers. David clasps his fingers back in and seems unsettled. He takes a couple of short breaths as he composes himself, then pivots back to glance around. He grazes the elbow of a woman standing beside him, inhaling sharply like someone nudged him in the ribs. The enormous starry-eyed woman takes hold of the fireplace poker and waves it as the resident inside the cabin grips the fireplace shovel on the inside to halt her. The resident inside the cabin uses all her effort to prevent the window from closing, but it closes slowly anyhow. David stands still in the bus terminal, his expression almost inscrutable, standing less than a foot away from the woman he bumped, and they are elbow to elbow.

David waits, glaring intently at the revolving doors, and then they swing open as the large starry-eyed woman in yellow reappears carrying a folder over her shoulder, now sporting a knit scarf with her jumpsuit. She strides toward a side entrance, and David allows her to reach about twenty yards away before choosing to trail her. The woman in the yellow jumpsuit strolls in the pouring rain down a suburban avenue, nearly all the windows in the middle-class apartments she's passing are dark at this late hour.

The elephant's trunk rises as the curly-tailed cat slides past the lemonade stand, and it follows the cat for a moment. The elephant observes the child with floppy boots dragging by their knees as they skip and whisper to a clowder of similarly adorned kittens. The elephant spins its ears inward and seems confused. It takes a couple of shallow gulps as it steadies itself, then rolls forward to survey the area. It brushes the wing of a bird perched beside it, gasping suddenly like someone splashed ice water on its head. The diminutive beady-eyed squirrel clutches the fence post cleat and pulls it as the lizard up the tree clutches the post from the top to hold it steady. The lizard up the tree exerts all its might to steady the post, yet it wobbles loosely anyway. The elephant stands stiff in the forest glade, its expression nearly inscrutable, standing less than a handspan from the bird it nudged, and they are beak to beak. The elephant's gaze drifts from the pebbles to its left and then finally meets the bird, which is gargantuan, at least a claw length taller than the elephant, with wide wings and wearing a flowing red cape. The bird in the red cape leans over a picnic basket beside it and extracts the hefty picnic blanket from it, replaces it with a pristine one, drops the hefty picnic blanket into a blue metal container with legs, and begins rolling it. Four matching blue containers rest beside the fence, and the gargantuan bird vanishes with its container into the meadow. The elephant waits, glaring fiercely at the wooden gate, and then it swings open as the enormous beady-eyed squirrel in red appears carrying a loaf atop its back, now wearing a sunhat with its cloak. It ambles toward a hidden path, and the elephant trails at a distance of about seven strides before choosing to pursue it. The bird in the red cape flies into the clear sky above a rural mountain road, nearly all the windows in the upscale cabins it's traversing past are closed at this early dawn. The red entity glides over a string of humble single-story cottages, fluttering slower, and glances about anxiously as it proceeds. It swoops onto the porch of one of the cottages, pauses, and extracts a bouquet of blossoms from the flowerpot. The elephant waits with the hem of its raincoat obscuring its trunk and eyes, blending into the undergrowth and observing quietly as the bird in the red cape glances around with its broad beak before lifting a latch and entering the blue shingled cabin through a recognizable side window with drapes over it."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
