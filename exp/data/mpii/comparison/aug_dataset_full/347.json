Amid the applauding throng, Eowyn advances towards Aragorn with a goblet, and their gazes meet. Eowyn glances at her uncle as Theoden follows her glance and observes concerned as her uncle moves away, unsettled by his manner. Merry and Pippin are in full song, on top of one of the tables, holding very large tankards of ale in their hands, while Gandalf chuckles and applauds at the hobbits. Aragorn steps up beside Gandalf, grinning at the entertainment, and Gandalf turns swiftly to Aragorn, watching his comrade's countenance, seeking reassurance. Frodo and Sam lie asleep amid scrubby shrubs near a stagnant pool, with Smeagol nearby, muttering in his sleep. Smeagol rouses suddenly, trembling, his visage drenched in perspiration, eyes wide in terror, as his features transform into the wicked face of Gollum. Smeagol glances over his shoulder at the slumbering Frodo and Sam as he climbs off his rock, silently edging towards the edge of a stagnant pool. He gazes into the cloudy depths of the water, where the surface ripples as the face of Gollum appears as Smeagol's. Smeagol is seen strangling Deagol, with fingers clamped tight around his neck as his eyes flicker open. Sam's reflection is mirrored in the water as he strikes Gollum on the head with his pot, drops the pot, and hurls himself on top of Gollum, who shrieks and thrashes wildly. Frodo staggers over to Sam and pulls him off Gollum, who is curled on the ground weeping, as Sam makes for Smeagol again with a look of murderous fury. Frodo seizes Sam's arm, but Sam pulls away and gazes at Frodo bewildered, his expression softening. Frodo beckons to Gollum, who turns slowly, staring at Sam through hooded, hate-filled eyes, and grins. Aragorn joins Legolas on the stairs to the Golden Hall, oblivious to the brisk breeze as they gaze out across the slumbering metropolis to the looming mountain range beyond, with dark clouds marking the sky. Legolas gazes at Aragorn with realization on his countenance. He is awake, sits up uneasy, hops out of bed, and sneaks towards the slumbering form of Gandalf. Pippin gasps with fear as Merry sits up, wiping sleep from his eyes, and moves on. A slumbering Gandalf lies with eyes wide open, but Pippin is undeterred."

          "description": "With a heavy heart burdened by an unavoidable sense of reluctance, Pippin slowly and hesitantly hands over the mysterious, enigmatic palantir to the wise and ever-watchful Gandalf. Gandalf, without delay, wraps it securely in his cloak, casting a troubled and reflective glance back at Pippin, who seems to be filled with a mix of emotions. Meanwhile, a determined group of resolute riders gallops swiftly and with purpose towards the majestic and grand city of Rohan, known as Edoras. Outside the grand, impressive Golden Hall, Eowyn stands all by herself, her demeanor patient and composed as she waits silently. Within the hall's grand confines, a large, roaring fire crackles and provides a welcoming warmth while a lamb roasts slowly on a spit, its enticing aroma filling the air. Long tables are heavily laden with a wide assortment of delicious, appetizing food, and barrels brimming with fine, exquisite wine stand ready in anticipation of the returning soldiers' enjoyment and celebration. Amidst the cheering, jubilant crowd that fills the hall with a lively atmosphere, Eowyn gracefully moves towards Aragorn, a chalice held delicately in her hand, and their eyes meet for a moment charged with unspoken understanding and shared purpose. Eowyn's gaze shifts to her uncle, Theoden, who follows her line of sight and observes with visible concern, as her uncle moves away, visibly disturbed by his own tone and thoughts. Merry and Pippin, full of energy and cheer, are in full voice, standing triumphantly atop one of the sturdy tables, merrily holding oversized mugs of ale, their spirits high. Nearby, Gandalf laughs heartily, a sound of genuine delight, and claps with enjoyment at the hobbitsâ€™ lively antics, which add charm to the occasion. Aragorn steps up beside Gandalf, a smile playing on his lips, clearly amused by the lively floorshow, and Gandalf quickly turns to Aragorn, his eyes seeking reassurance and comfort in his friend's familiar expression.\n\nIn a different location altogether, Frodo and Sam lie peacefully asleep amidst the scrubby, sparse bushes near a stagnant, unmoving pool, with Smeagol nearby, muttering incoherently in his fitful and restless slumber. Smeagol suddenly snaps awake with a start, trembling and shaking uncontrollably, his face drenched in sweat, eyes wide with a palpable horror, as his features ominously shift into the sinister, malevolent face of Gollum. Smeagol glances anxiously over his shoulder at the sleeping forms of Frodo and Sam as he cautiously clambers off his rocky perch, silently sidling towards the edge of the stagnant pool. He peers deeply into the murky, mysterious depths of the water, where the surface begins to ripple, reflecting the sinister, haunting face of Gollum as if it were his own cursed reflection. A disturbing and distressing vision unfolds as Smeagol is seen choking Deagol, his fingers locked tightly around his throat, with eyes wide open in the vision. Sam's reflection then appears in the water as he strikes Gollum on the head with a heavy pot, letting it fall, and subsequently throws himself forcefully on top of Gollum, who screams frantically and flails his limbs wildly in desperate response. Frodo staggers over to Sam, pulling him off the now sobbing Gollum, huddled on the ground in distress. Sam makes another attempt to go after Smeagol, a look of murderous rage and intensity in his eyes. Frodo urgently grabs Sam's arm in an effort to hold him back, but Sam pulls away and turns to stare at Frodo, his expression softening as he seems at a loss. Frodo then beckons to Gollum, who turns slowly, his eyes hooded and filled with hate as he stares at Sam and smiles faintly, malevolently.\n\nBack in Edoras, Aragorn joins Legolas on the steps leading up to the grand, imposing Golden Hall, both seemingly oblivious to the chill, biting wind that whistles around them. They gaze out across the serene, quiet city, now resting peacefully, towards the vast, looming mountain range beyond, where dark, ominous clouds are thickly scattered across the expansive sky. Legolas looks at Aragorn, realization gradually dawning on his face. Meanwhile, Pippin awakens suddenly, gasping with unmistakable fright, as Merry sits up next to him, groggily rubbing sleep from his eyes and moving slowly. Nearby, Gandalf lies seemingly asleep, yet his eyes remain wide open and alert. However, Pippin remains undeterred and unaffected by this sight."

          "description": "Reluctantly, with visible hesitation, Pippin extends his hand and passes the palantir over to Gandalf, who instantly wraps it tightly within the folds of his cloak, ensuring it is completely concealed from view, and then turns back to Pippin with a troubled expression etched upon his face, conveying a shared but unspoken concern. Meanwhile, a group of riders, with their horsesâ€™ hooves pounding rhythmically against the ground, swiftly gallop towards the Rohan city of Edoras, creating a sense of urgency in the air. Eowyn stands alone, positioned firmly outside the Golden Hall, her gaze steady and patient as she awaits their arrival. Inside the hall, a large, roaring fire emits warmth and light, providing a comforting backdrop to the scene where a lamb is slowly rotating on a spit, its enticing aroma wafting through the room. Long tables are meticulously arranged and laden with a bountiful array of food and barrels of wine, setting a feast-like atmosphere ready to welcome the returning soldiers. As the room fills with the sounds of a cheering crowd, Eowyn gracefully moves through the gathering towards Aragorn, her path purposeful, and when their eyes meet, a momentary connection sparks between them. With a slight glance, Eowyn shifts her attention to her uncle, Theoden, who catches her gaze and observes her with a concerned, discerning look, sensing something amiss in her demeanor as her uncle turns away, troubled by his inner thoughts. Nearby, Merry and Pippin are exuberant, standing atop one of the tables, singing forthrightly with large mugs of ale enthusiastically gripped in their hands, their energetic display eliciting laughter and applause from Gandalf, who is thoroughly entertained by the hobbitsâ€™ antics. Aragorn approaches the scene, stepping up beside Gandalf, a smile playing on his lips as he enjoys the lively floorshow, prompting Gandalf to pivot quickly towards Aragorn, his eyes searching his friend's face for some form of reassurance. Elsewhere, Frodo and Sam lie dormant amidst a cluster of scrubby bushes positioned near a stagnant pool, their forms motionless in sleep, while Smeagol, lying nearby, mutters softly, caught in the throes of his slumber. Suddenly, Smeagol jolts awake, shaking uncontrollably with his face slick with sweat, his eyes wide with terror as they transform into the malevolent visage of Gollum. Anxiously, Smeagol casts a wary glance over his shoulder at the still sleeping Frodo and Sam, then discreetly climbs down from his rocky perch, moving stealthily towards the pool's edge. He peers into the clouded depths of the water, where the surface shifts and distorts, reflecting back at him the features of Gollum as though merging with his own. A vision unfolds of Smeagol choking Deagol, his fingers clenched tightly around Deagolâ€™s throat as an unbidden memory surfaces, causing his eyes to flicker open. Meanwhile, Sam's image appears in the waterâ€™s reflection just as he brings his pot down with a sharp smack against Gollum's head, the impact causing Sam to drop the pot as he throws himself onto Gollum, who reacts with a wild scream and frantic flailing. Hastily, Frodo stumbles over to Sam, reaching out and tugging him off Gollum, who is now curled on the ground, sobbing uncontrollably. Sam, however, driven by an overriding fury, makes another move towards Smeagol, but Frodo intervenes, grabbing Sam's arm. Although Sam initially pulls away, he pauses to stare at Frodo, his anger melting into confusion as his features soften. Frodo then gestures towards Gollum, who turns around slowly, his eyes narrowed with a mix of malice and mistrust as he fixes his gaze on Sam, allowing a sinister smile to cross his lips. Meanwhile, Aragorn joins Legolas on the broad steps leading up to the Golden Hall, both seemingly unaffected by the chill wind that sweeps around them, as they quietly survey the sleeping city spread out before them, their eyes drawn towards the imposing mountain range that looms in the distance, the sky above marked by ominous dark clouds. A flicker of understanding dawns upon Legolas as he glances at Aragorn, realization written clearly across his features. Inside, Pippin stirs restlessly, gradually becoming alert as he sits up with a start, his anxiety driving him from his bed as he tiptoes cautiously towards the sleeping figure of Gandalf. Pippin gasps in fright when he notices Merry sitting up, rubbing sleep from his eyes, continuing on unaware. Despite Gandalf lying peacefully, his eyes unexpectedly open, Pippin remains undeterred, compelled by a sense of urgency that propels him forward."

A memory of Smeagol choking Deagol flickers, then Sam's reflection appears in the water as he strikes Gollum with a pot and tackles him.

A group of riders gallop towards the Rohan city of Edoras, known for its thatched-roof homes and the towering fortress of Meduseld. Eowyn, a noblewoman of Rohan renowned for her courage and skill in combat, stands alone outside the Golden Hall, waiting.

Amidst the cheering crowd, Eowyn moves towards Aragorn with a chalice, an ancient ceremonial cup of Rohan, and their eyes meet. Eowyn looks at her uncle, King Theoden, as Theoden follows her gaze and watches concerned as her uncle, weary from the burdens of leadership and recent battles, moves away, disturbed by his tone. Merry and Pippin are in full voice, on top of one of the tables, holding very large mugs of ale crafted from the renowned barley of the Westfold in their hands, while Gandalf laughs and claps at the hobbits. Aragorn steps up beside Gandalf, smiling at the floorshow that celebrates their few moments of respite, and Gandalf turns quickly to Aragorn, watching his friend's face, seeking reassurance about the road ahead. Frodo and Sam lie asleep amidst scrubby bushes near a stagnant pool, far from the comforts of the Shire, with Smeagol nearby, muttering in his sleep. Smeagol wakes suddenly, shaking, his face drenched in sweat, eyes wide in horror, as his features transform into the malevolent face of Gollum, his darker alter ego corrupted by the One Ring. Smeagol glances over his shoulder at the sleeping Frodo and Sam as he clambers off his rock, silently sidling towards the edge of a stagnant pool that reflects his inner turmoil. He stares into the murky depths of the water, where the surface ripples as the face of Gollum appears as Smeagol's, revealing the internal struggle he faces. Smeagol is seen choking Deagol, a scene from his past that forever haunts him, with fingers locked tight around his throat as his eyes flicker open. Sam's image is mirrored in the water as he smacks Gollum on the head with his pot, a simple cooking tool from their supplies, drops the pot, and flings himself on top of Gollum, who screams and flails wildly. Frodo staggers over to Sam and pulls him off Gollum, who is huddled on the ground sobbing, as Sam makes for Smeagol again with a look of murderous rage, driven by despair and fatigue. Frodo grabs Sam's arm, but Sam pulls away and stares at Frodo at a loss, his face softening with the realization of their shared burden. Frodo beckons to Gollum, who turns slowly, staring at Sam through hooded, hate-filled eyes, and smiles with the cunning of someone who knows more than he reveals. Aragorn joins Legolas on the steps to the Golden Hall, oblivious to the chill wind as they look out across the sleeping city to the looming mountain range beyond, with dark clouds marking the sky and hinting at the challenges yet to come. Legolas looks at Aragorn with realization on his face. He is awake, sits up anxious, hops out of bed, and creeps towards the sleeping form of Gandalf, the wise and revered wizard whose guidance they depend on. Pippin gasps with fright as Merry sits up, wiping sleep from his eyes, and moves on. A sleeping Gandalf lies with eyes wide open, but Pippin is undeterred, showing a curiosity that often leads him into trouble."

Amidst the shouting throng, Arwen drifts towards Legolas with a goblet, and their gazes connect. Arwen glances at her cousin as Elrond tracks her look and gazes worried as her cousin walks off, shaken by his demeanor. Merry and Bilbo are in full song, atop one of the benches, clutching very large pitchers of cider in their hands, while Boromir snickers and stomps at the dwarves. Legolas slides up alongside Boromir, smirking at the entertainment, and Boromir turns promptly to Legolas, studying his companion's expression, seeking confirmation. Frodo and Sam nap amidst thorny bushes near a stagnant marsh, with Gimli nearby, murmuring in his slumber. Gimli awakens abruptly, trembling, his face slick with perspiration, eyes wide in shock, as his features morph into the sinister face of Gollum. Gimli peers over his shoulder at the napping Frodo and Sam as he scrambles off his perch, silently creeping towards the edge of a stagnant marsh. He peers into the cloudy shallows of the pool, where the surface distorts as the face of Gollum materializes as Gimli's. Gimli is seen shaking Deagol, with thumbs pressed tight against his throat as his eyes flutter open. Sam's reflection is mirrored in the water as he smacks Gollum on the forehead with his ladle, drops the ladle, and hurls himself onto Gollum, who yelps and squirms violently. Frodo shuffles over to Sam and tugs him off Gollum, who is curled on the dirt weeping, as Sam lunges for Gimli again with an expression of deadly anger. Frodo seizes Sam's shoulder, but Sam jerks away and peers at Frodo confused, his features softening. Frodo summons Gollum, who pivots gradually, glaring at Sam through narrow, furious eyes, and grins. Legolas joins Gimli on the steps to the Silver Cottage, indifferent to the biting breeze as they survey the resting town to the towering hill range beyond, with ominous clouds blemishing the sky. Gimli gazes at Legolas with recognition on his countenance. He is alert, rises nervous, hops out of bed, and sneaks towards the dozing figure of Boromir. Merry gasps with fear as Pippin rises, rubbing drowsiness from his features, and moves forward. A slumbering Boromir rests with eyes wide shut, but Merry is unfazed."

Smeagol casts a glance over his shoulder at the snoozing Frodo and Sam as he crawls off his boulder, quietly slinking towards the edge of a brackish pond. He gazes into the opaque shallows of the water, where the surface quivers as the face of Gollum manifests as Smeagol.

Boromir saunters up beside the wizard, grinning at the spectacle, and the wizard spins quickly to Boromir, scrutinizing his comrade's visage, seeking comfort. Aardvark and Anteater rest asleep amidst thorny hedges near a brackish swamp, with Monkey nearby, babbling in his slumber. Monkey rouses abruptly, shivering, his face soaked in tears, eyes wide with panic, as his features morph into the sinister visage of Gremlin. Monkey peeks over his shoulder at the dozing Aardvark and Anteater as he scrambles off his perch, quietly sliding towards the brink of a brackish swamp. He peers into the murky depths of the swamp, where the surface ripples as the face of Gremlin emerges as Monkey's. Monkey is observed throttling Parrot, with claws clamped tightly around his throat as his eyes flutter open. Anteater's reflection is mirrored in the swamp as he slaps Gremlin on the face with his pan, drops the pan, and lunges onto Gremlin, who shrieks and thrashes wildly. Aardvark stumbles over to Anteater and drags him off Gremlin, who is crouched on the earth wailing, as Anteater charges at Monkey again with a glare of furious wrath. Aardvark grabs Anteater's shoulder, but Anteater shrugs off and gapes at Aardvark baffled, his expression softening. Aardvark gestures to Gremlin, who turns slowly, glaring at Anteater through narrowed, malevolent eyes, and smirks. Boromir joins Gimli on the stairs to the Silver Tower, indifferent to the biting breeze as they gaze out over the dozing village to the towering cliff beyond, with ominous fog painting the sky. Gimli glances at Boromir with comprehension on his expression. He is awake, leaps up tense, bounds out of his hammock, and tiptoes towards the slumbering form of the wizard. The rabbit gasps with dread as Tom sits up, rubbing sleep from his eyes, and shuffles forward. A sleeping wizard lies with eyes wide shut, yet the rabbit is relentless."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby cafÃ©, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Riders gallop towards Edoras, where Eowyn awaits outside the Golden Hall. Inside, a feast awaits the returning soldiers. Eowyn approaches Aragorn with a chalice, their eyes meeting, while Theoden watches with concern. Merry and Pippin entertain on a table with mugs of ale, as Gandalf and Aragorn look on. Frodo and Sam sleep near a pool, with Smeagol muttering nearby. Smeagol wakes, transforming into Gollum, and approaches the pool. A vision of him choking Deagol appears, then Sam attacks Gollum, whom Frodo stops. Frodo gestures to Gollum, who eyes Sam hatefully. Aragorn and Legolas stand on the steps of the Golden Hall, observing the city and mountains. Pippin awakens, startled, and sneaks towards Gandalf, undeterred by his open eyes."
