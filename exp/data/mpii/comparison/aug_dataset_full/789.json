Willie, with a mischievous glint in his eye, snaps a popper, the sound echoing in the confined space and drawing a sharp glare from Marcus, who is focused on the task ahead. Meanwhile, outside the room, the security guard is engaged in his routine, bidding farewell to the last of the shoppers as they exit the premises. Seizing the moment, Marcus begins his ascent, carefully crawling through the narrow confines of the vent. As the final shopper departs and Willie follows suit, the security guard, now alone, checks his watch with a practiced glance and proceeds to tap a code into the alarm system, ensuring the building is secure. Unbeknownst to him, Marcus is already positioned within the air conditioning duct, peering down at the security booth below. With a calculated press of a button on his remote control, Marcus deftly switches off all the security cameras, plunging the surveillance system into darkness. He then hastens back along the duct, moving with urgency. Reaching a vertical section, he plunges downwards, his descent culminating in a dramatic crash through a vent positioned above a strategically placed table of sweaters, which Lois had thoughtfully repositioned to cushion his fall. The table collapses under the impact, but Marcus is undeterred, springing to his feet with agility and sprinting towards the alarm console. With mere seconds to spare, he successfully deactivates the alarm system. At this moment, a service elevator opens, revealing Marcus and Willie stepping out, with Willie in tow, pulling a trolley laden with safe-cracking equipment. They make their way into an office, where Marcus approaches a large safe, his eyes fixed on it with determination, while Willie stares at it in disbelief. Still fixated on the safe, Willie lowers himself into a seated position, contemplating his next move. Later, he attempts to crack the combination, his concentration unbroken, as Marcus wheels a handcart through the mall, gathering items for his annual shopping spree, indulging in the various goodies Lois had meticulously listed. Back in the office, having failed to crack the combination, Willie resorts to drilling, his face contorting in frustration as he withdraws the drill bit from the safe's door. Undeterred, he dons a pair of dark goggles and attempts to cut his way in with an arc welder, but the welding process proves unsuccessful. Meanwhile, at home, Thurmond is meticulously laying the table for dinner, selecting a bottle of wine with care. In the mall, Marcus, in the midst of his spree, takes a red camisole from a shop dummy, planting a playful kiss on its left breast. He then approaches another dummy, this one modeling a mink stole, but its height poses a challenge. After a few futile jumps, he pauses to catch his breath and notices another mannequin holding a golf club. Seizing the club, he attempts to dislodge the stole from the dummy's neck, but it remains stubbornly in place. Frustrated, he abandons finesse and uses the club like an ax, chopping the dummy's legs off to bring it down. Meanwhile, in the office, Willie, having exhausted his options, resorts to brute force, wielding a sledgehammer against the safe door. Despite his efforts, the safe remains unyielding, but Marcus, having successfully felled the dummy, triumphantly retrieves the stole from around its neck. As Willie listens intently to the back of the safe, tapping it in a last-ditch effort, Marcus enters the office just as Willie emerges from behind the safe, their efforts converging in the shared space."

Willie snaps a popper, a small device that makes a loud noise and is often used for pranks, causing Marcus to glare at him. While the guard, who usually finishes his shift at the end of the business day, bids farewell to shoppers, Marcus crawls through the vent, a cramped space used to circulate air throughout the building. Once Willie and the last of the shoppers have gone, the security guard checks his watch, a habit from his military days, and taps a code into the alarm system, ensuring the premises are secure. Marcus is in the air conditioning duct overlooking the security booth, a strategic point for monitoring activity, and presses a button on a remote control designed for disabling electronics, switching off all the security cameras, then hurries back along the duct. He plunges down the duct, heading straight down, and smashes through a vent above a table of sweaters that Lois, a meticulous store employee, had repositioned earlier to break his fall. The table collapses, and he leaps to his feet, running to the alarm console, a sophisticated device linked to the store’s security network, and turning it off with two seconds to spare. A service elevator, used primarily for transporting goods between floors, opens, and Marcus and Willie step out, Willie towing a trolley of safe-cracking equipment that he had borrowed from a friend with questionable connections. They break into an office, the administrative heart of the store, and Marcus walks over to a large safe, with Willie staring at it aghast, overwhelmed by its size and complexity. Still staring at the safe, Willie sits down, and later he tries to crack the combination, while Marcus wheels a handcart through the mall, an upscale shopping center bustling with evening shoppers. At home, Thurmond, an old friend of Marcus, carefully lays the table for dinner and selects a bottle of wine, a rare vintage he had been saving for a special occasion. Marcus is on his annual shopping spree, helping himself to all the various goodies Lois had meticulously listed in preparation for the holiday season. Having failed with the combination, Willie falls back on drilling to crack the safe, grimacing as he withdraws the bit from the door, a technique he learned from watching heist movies. Next, he dons dark goggles and tries to cut his way in with an arc welder, but the welding doesn't go well, reflecting his lack of experience with such equipment. At home, Sue, an accomplished chef, takes a sauce bottle from the fridge and hands it to Thurmond, who is preparing dinner. Meanwhile, Marcus takes a red camisole off a shop dummy, an elegant display figure, and kisses its left breast, then comes to the dummy modeling the mink stole, which is too tall for him to reach. After jumping up and down a bit, he catches his breath and spots another mannequin holding a golf club, a prop intended to attract the attention of sports enthusiasts. He takes the club and tries to remove the stole from around the dummy's neck with it, but it won't budge. Eventually, he gives up and uses the club like an ax to chop the dummy's legs off, a destructive but effective solution. Down in the office, Willie has resorted to brute force and uses a sledgehammer on the safe door, a last-ditch effort to break it open. Willie doesn’t crack the safe, but Marcus succeeds in felling the dummy and takes the stole from around its neck. Willie listens to the back of the safe, a classic heist move, and taps it as Marcus comes into the office just as Willie emerges from around the back of the safe, defeated but determined to try again."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
