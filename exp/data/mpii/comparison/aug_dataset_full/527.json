Meanwhile, Hare Krishna music gently fills the air, accompanying a sunlit and sweeping view of the majestic Manhattan skyline, with the vibrant greenery of Central Park contrasting against the urban backdrop. The camera gracefully moves downwards to reveal a vivid scene where a large group of Hare Krishnas, resplendent in their traditional attire, are energetically dancing on the expansive green lawn, surrounded by various New Yorkers who are out and about, enjoying the lively day.

As he ambles off, Mickey nonchalantly flips through the pamphlet in his hand, his eyes scanning the pages, before he directs his gaze straight ahead, lost in a contemplative thought. He thoughtfully raises his hand to his mouth, the film momentarily shifting to another scene, transitioning smoothly to a title appearing on a black screen. This new scene opens by showing a bench strategically facing some aged wharf pilings, with the rhythmic, gentle lapping of the water against them creating a serene ambiance. Lee enters the frame, her hair tousled gracefully by the wind, and she pauses to stand facing the expansive water, her gaze stretching towards the distant skyline visible across the bay. In this tranquil moment, Lee is alone, her hands comfortably nestled in her pockets, as she takes in the peaceful scenery around her. The background concerto music comes to a stop, seamlessly ushering in a new scene that cuts to Holly, who is seen leaning into an open phone booth conveniently situated near a bustling subway entrance. The throng of people, characterized by hurried movements, rush past Holly, eagerly descending into the subway, while others steadily ascend the station steps. Holly, multitasking with a cigarette poised between her fingers, converses animatedly on the phone, engaging in a dialogue with Hannah on the other end. The conversation concludes as Holly hangs up the receiver with a definitive click, then takes another contemplative drag on her cigarette. Her eyes drift off into the distance, a smile subtly spreading across her face as the film transitions to a crowded living room scene.

Hare Krishna music, known for its rhythmic devotionals, is heard over a sunlit view of the Manhattan skyline, iconic for its towering skyscrapers like the Empire State Building, and the green trees of Central Park, an urban oasis designed by Frederick Law Olmsted. The camera moves down to reveal a large group of Hare Krishnas, followers of a movement originating from the Gaudiya Vaishnavism tradition of Hinduism, dancing on the broad green lawn among other New Yorkers enjoying the day. The leader, holding some pamphlets about spirituality and peace, stands by a chain-link fence a few feet away from his group, talking to someone on the other side. It's Mickey, as the camera soon shows, wearing a short-sleeved shirt suited for the warm weather, a paper tucked under his arm, perhaps the New York Times, known for its comprehensive coverage of daily events. Mickey walks off, the Hare Krishnas still dancing and singing on the other side of the fence, their mantra spreading through the air. He flips through the literature as he walks, then looks straight ahead, pondering the philosophies presented. Mickey puts his hand to his mouth, deep in thought, as another title appears on a black screen. A bench faces some wharf pilings, remnants of New York's bustling shipping industry; the water gently laps against them as Lee walks into view, the wind from the bay blowing her hair. She stands and faces the water and the distant skyline across the bay, where the Statue of Liberty stands as a beacon of freedom. Lee is alone; her hands are in her pockets, perhaps contemplating the vastness before her. The concerto, an orchestral composition of emotional depth, stops, and the movie cuts to Holly, leaning into an open phone booth near a subway entrance, where commuters hustle through the city's vast transit system. People rush past Holly towards the subway; others are walking up the station steps, carrying the rhythm of the city's pulse. Holly smokes a cigarette, a moment of pause amidst the urban chaos, as she talks on the phone to Hannah. Holly hangs up the phone and takes a drag on her cigarette. She looks off in the distance, smiling, as the film cuts to guests crowded together in the living room, surrounding the piano, where Evan is sitting and flipping through some sheet music, perhaps preparing a piece by a classical composer such as Bach or Beethoven. Norma stands behind him, leaning against a book-laden wall, suggesting a love for literature. The guests are chattering, enjoying themselves; a lamp glows on the corner of the piano, casting a warm light over the scene. A little boy sitting in a chair next to Evan is talking animatedly with a girl who is leaning over the arm of the sofa, their conversation full of childhood curiosity. An adult guest talks to the little boy; another guest takes a sip of wine from a glass she'd placed on the bookshelf behind her as Evan turns and addresses the group. The guests laugh appreciatively, the room filled with camaraderie. A woman comes over to Evan and hands him some wine, a gesture of goodwill. He laughs; the guests laugh with him, sharing in the moment. The guests continue to laugh; they are charmed by the evening's conviviality. Evan continues to laugh with everyone as he starts to play the piano, filling the room with melodies. A nearby woman toasts him with her drink, celebrating the night. The camera moves around the room as he plays, showing the various guests, who are chattering over the music, some reminiscing about past memories, others forming new connections. Some are in clusters, in private conversations, while others listen and watch the offscreen Evan, captivated by his performance."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
