The slimy black Symbiote slithers off the ledge that Peter is on and snakes down the bell tower, where a globule lands in the palm of Brock's hand and spreads around him. As more lands on Brock's shoulder, it wraps itself around his body like ivy. Brock drops to his hands and knees, consumed by the black tendrils that push him to the floor as if he were stuck in a pool of tar. The Symbiote devours Brock’s face, and like a wild cat with jagged teeth, he lurches forward as Venom.

A sliver of Symbiote drops onto Brock's shoulder, while above him, Peter continues shredding the disintegrating Symbiote from his form. The slick ebony Symbiote slides off the brink that Peter is on and glides down the bell tower, where a droplet lands in the palm of Brock's hand and spreads around him. As more lands on Brock's shoulder, it coils itself around his form like vine. Brock collapses to his hands and knees, engulfed by the ebony tendrils that press him to the ground as if he were ensnared in a pool of tar. The Symbiote consumes Brock’s visage, and like a feral feline with serrated teeth, he lunges forward as Venom. Later in his chamber, Peter is in the shower with water pouring over his tightly shut eyes, and then they gradually open with a dead, empty expression. A short period later, he’s seated on his floor, solitary and leaning against the French windows. He trudges to the portal and clutches it, which comes off in his hand. He pries the portal open with his fingertips as Aunt May looks around his dilapidated chamber. He places the door knob down on a shelf and extends the betrothal ring, dropping it into her palm. He turns away from his aunt’s probing eyes and goes over to the French windows, his sorrowful face lit by a spectral azure glow from the metropolis outside. Aunt May places the ring on the table, and Peter half-turns towards her. As she softly exits the chamber, Peter turns his melancholy gaze back to the window. In a form-fitting ebony Spider-Man-style attire, Venom swings through the metropolis on web-like threads, only to be seized by Flint in an alleyway. Venom retaliates and hurls Flint to one side. At night, Peter walks under the lit awning of the theater across the thoroughfare from Mary Jane’s apartment structure, where he catches a glimpse of Mary Jane moving about her apartment in a illuminated top-floor window. His mournful azure eyes slowly fill with tears, and he bows his head and walks away. As Peter trudges off down the thoroughfare, Mary Jane looks out of the window at the vacant corner where he was standing moments earlier. A short time later, she emerges from her apartment block in her waitress uniform and hails a taxi. Meanwhile, armored vehicles are hurled aside like toys by bursts of sand, and Peter is in a throng outside an electrical store, watching the TV coverage in wide-eyed shock."

His hands move with urgency as he begins to tear the tattered, skin-tight black fabric that clings to his chest. A small piece of the Symbiote detaches and falls delicately onto Brock's shoulder below, while Peter continues his relentless effort to pull the unraveling Symbiote from his body, tearing it away piece by piece. The slimy black substance slithers off the ledge where Peter stands and snakes its way down the bell tower, eventually landing with a soft, wet sound in the palm of Brock's hand. The substance spreads rapidly over Brock's skin, wrapping around him like tendrils of ivy. As more of the Symbiote lands on his shoulder, it spreads with increasing speed, enveloping his body. Overwhelmed, Brock falls to the ground on his hands and knees, the black tendrils of the Symbiote forcing him down as if he were ensnared in a viscous pool of tar. The Symbiote covers his face entirely, transforming him as he lunges forward with the ferocity of a wild cat, revealing his new identity as Venom.\n\nAt a later moment, Peter is in the confines of his room, standing in the shower with water cascading over his face, his eyes tightly shut. Gradually, they open, revealing a dead, vacant expression. Some time passes, and he finds himself sitting on the floor, leaning against the French windows, a picture of loneliness. Slowly, he rises and makes his way to the door, only to have it come off in his hand. With careful effort, he uses his fingertips to pry the door open, allowing Aunt May to survey his shabby surroundings. Gently, he places the doorknob on a shelf and extends his hand to offer her the engagement ring, letting it drop smoothly into her palm. Turning away from his aunt's questioning gaze, he walks toward the French windows, the ghostly blue light from the city casting an ethereal glow over his mournful face. Aunt May places the ring down on a table, and Peter momentarily half-turns in her direction. As she leaves the room with a soft presence, Peter refocuses his doleful gaze on the window.\n\nMeanwhile, Venom, clad in a skin-tight black Spider-Man-style suit, swings confidently through the city on web-like strands, until Flint intercepts him in an alleyway. Venom retaliates with strength, tossing Flint aside. Under the cover of night, Peter walks beneath the illuminated canopy of the theater across from Mary Jane's apartment building.

A slither of Symbiote, an alien life form known in comics for bonding with hosts to grant them enhanced abilities, falls onto Brock's shoulder, while above him, Peter continues tearing the unraveling Symbiote from his body. The slimy black Symbiote slithers off the ledge that Peter is on and snakes down the bell tower, a significant setting where this dramatic confrontation occurs, where a globule lands in the palm of Brock's hand and spreads around him. As more lands on Brock's shoulder, it wraps itself around his body like ivy, much like how the ivy plant climbs surfaces, suggesting entrapment. Brock drops to his hands and knees, consumed by the black tendrils that push him to the floor as if he were stuck in a pool of tar, a substance known for its sticky, immobilizing nature. The Symbiote devours Brock’s face, and like a wild cat with jagged teeth, a comparison often used for ferocity, he lurches forward as Venom. Later in his room, Peter is in the shower with water streaming over his tightly closed eyes, and then they slowly open with a dead, vacant expression, indicative of his emotional exhaustion. A short time later, he’s sitting on his floor, lonely and leaning against the French windows, a common architectural feature in classic New York apartments. He trudges to the door and holds it, which comes off in his hand, suggesting the disrepair of his living situation. He pries the door open with his fingertips as Aunt May, a moral compass in Peter's life, looks around his shabby room. He puts the door knob down on a shelf and holds out the engagement ring, a significant symbol of his relationship with Mary Jane, dropping it into her palm. He turns away from his aunt’s inquiring eyes and goes over to the French windows, his mournful face lit by a ghostly blue glow from the city outside, a city known for its vibrant yet overwhelming atmosphere. Aunt May puts the ring on the table, and Peter half-turns towards her. As she softly leaves the room, Peter turns his doleful gaze back to the window. In a skin-tight black Spider-Man-style suit, Venom, a notorious antihero in the Marvel universe, swings through the city on web-like strands, only to be grabbed by Flint, who as Sandman can manipulate sand, in an alleyway. Venom fights back and tosses Flint to one side. At night, Peter walks under the illuminated canopy of the theater famous for hosting Broadway shows across the street from Mary Jane’s apartment building, where he catches a glimpse of Mary Jane, an aspiring actress, moving about her apartment in a lit top-floor window. His sorrowful blue eyes slowly fill with tears, and he bows his head and walks away. As Peter trudges off down the street, Mary Jane looks out of the window at the deserted corner where he was standing moments earlier. A short time later, she comes out of her apartment block in her waitress uniform, a reminder of her current struggle to make ends meet, and hails a cab. Meanwhile, armored vehicles are tossed aside like toys by bursts of sand, a testament to Sandman's formidable power, and Peter is in a crowd outside an electrical store, watching the TV coverage in wide-eyed shock."

A fragment of Peppermint falls onto Jordan's elbow, while above him, Oliver continues shredding the unraveling Peppermint from his clothing. The sticky pink Peppermint slides off the hammock that Oliver is on and slinks down the lollipop, where a droplet lands in the indent of Jordan's foot and spreads around him. As more drops on Jordan's elbow, it coils itself around his limbs like a vine. Jordan collapses to his elbows and toes, enveloped by the pink filaments that press him to the ground as if he were submerged in a vat of honey. The Peppermint engulfs Jordan’s forehead, and like a feral rabbit with serrated claws, he springs forward as Licorice. Later in his chamber, Oliver is in the tub with rain cascading over his tightly shut lips, and then they slowly part with a blank, hollow expression. A brief time later, he’s perched on his carpet, solitary and leaning against the sliding doors. He shuffles to the entrance and grips it, which detaches in his grip. He nudges the entrance open with his fingernails as Uncle John glances around his messy chamber. He places the knob down on a mantle and extends the friendship bracelet, dropping it into his palm. He averts his uncle’s probing gaze and heads over to the sliding doors, his wistful face illuminated by an eerie red glow from the street beyond. Uncle John places the bracelet on the chair, and Oliver partially turns towards him. As he quietly departs the chamber, Oliver directs his melancholic stare back to the doors. In a dazzling pink cheetah-patterned ensemble, Licorice swings through the metropolis on vine-like cables, only to be seized by Jasper in an alleyway. Licorice retaliates and hurls Jasper to one edge. At dusk, Oliver strolls beneath the glowing awning of the bakery across the avenue from Sarah's condominium, where he glimpses Sarah bustling about her condo in a lit upper-floor panel. His mournful green eyes gradually brim with tears, and he bows his chin and departs. As Oliver plods away down the avenue, Sarah peers out of the panel at the vacant curb where he had stood moments prior. Shortly after, she exits her condominium in her florist apron and flags a trolley. Meanwhile, armored bicycles are scattered like marbles by waves of feathers, and Oliver is in a throng outside a toy shop, observing the radio broadcast in wide-eyed disbelief."

As more lands on Harry's shoulder, it coils itself around his body like vines. Harry falls to his elbows and feet, engulfed by the red tendrils that pin him to the ground as if he were trapped in a bog of mud. The Goo engulfs Harry’s face, and like a feral wolf with jagged claws, he lunges forward as Phantom. Later in his bathroom, Jonathan is in the tub with water pouring over his tightly closed eyes, and then they gradually open with a lifeless, dull expression.

The scaly green Lizard tumbles off the platform that Gina is on and winds down the clock tower, where a droplet lands in the fingers of Keith's glove and spreads around him. As more lands on Keith's hat, it coils itself around his form like vines. Keith collapses to his elbows and toes, ensnared by the green vines that anchor him to the ground as if he were stuck in a vat of honey. The Lizard consumes Keith’s head, and like a feral dog with crooked claws, he leaps upward as Serpent. Later in her chamber, Gina is in the bath with water cascading over her slightly opened lips, and then they gradually part with a hollow, vacant look.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
