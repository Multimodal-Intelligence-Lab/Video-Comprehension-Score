Back in the storeroom, Snape, with his face twisted with anger, grabs Harry viciously and peers into his face. Harry cowers and runs from Snape's room, hearing crying in the corridor and finding the twins comforting a small boy while Umbridge stands watching them before she goes. During the O.W.L. exams, the great hall is set out with long rows of desks as Hermione writes busily, Ron sighs and looks worried, and Harry watches Umbridge standing on the stage in front of a huge swinging pendulum. Her smug smile fades as several students turn to look at the door, and Umbridge strides purposefully down the hall towards the great wooden doors. Everyone stops writing and turns to look as Umbridge opens the door, where a fizzing firework hovers in front of her nose and explodes inside. She looks anxiously around the empty hallway when suddenly Fred and George hurtle over her head on broomsticks, zooming backwards and forwards while flinging exam papers and whiz bangs into the air. The multicolored fireworks spiral down and explode, scattering papers everywhere, with Goyle getting a firework in his face, Crabbe a whiz bang up his backside, and another attacking Draco as Filch rushes in. One of the twins gives a signal, and his brother flings a large firework into the air, which explodes into a fiery dragon that heads for Umbridge, causing her to race for the door. The dragon bursts out after her, destroying the decrees Filch has nailed to the wall, as frames clatter down in a shower of glass, paper, and splintered wood. Fred and George fly from the building, swooping over the battlements on their broomsticks and flinging fireworks. Delighted students rush into the courtyard, applauding, while Professor Flitwick looks confused and a huge fiery letter W appears in the sky. Ron smiles with pride, Professor Flitwick punches the air, then looks around self-consciously as Harry's face grows pale and he collapses in slow motion. Hermione notices him fall as he is overwhelmed by an image of Sirius being tortured by Voldemort. Sirius gasps, his face contorted with pain, as Harry sees the number 97, the glass sphere, the black corridor, and the blue door. Hermione kneels beside him anxiously, looking at Ron before they enter Umbridge's study, where a white cat leaves his China plate through a cat flap. Harry throws flue powder into the fire as Draco drags in Neville, Umbridge leans over Harry, and he looks at Ron and Hermione.",

Once back in the storeroom, Snape, with his usually guarded face now twisted with intense anger and frustration, seizes Harry violently, pulling him close and glaring into his eyes with fierce intensity. Filled with fear, Harry cowers under Snape’s furious gaze and quickly races out of Snape's room. As he flees, he hears the sound of someone crying in the corridor, and upon reaching it, he finds the twins offering comfort to a small boy, all while Umbridge stands nearby, observing with her usual stern demeanor before she decides to leave.\n\nDuring the O.W.L. exams, the great hall is meticulously arranged with long rows of desks stretching across the room. Students are distributed in their designated spots: Hermione, focused and diligent, writes rapidly, while Ron, filled with anxiety, sighs frequently and appears worried. Meanwhile, Harry's attention drifts to Umbridge, who stands prominently on the stage in front of a massive, swinging pendulum. Her smug smile gradually dissipates as she notices several students turning their heads to glance towards the entrance. With a sense of urgency, Umbridge strides purposefully down the hall, aiming for the great wooden doors. As everyone halts their exam writing, they collectively turn to look, curiosity piqued, as Umbridge opens the door. Just then, a fizzing firework hovers directly in front of her nose and bursts spectacularly inside. She glances anxiously around the now-empty hallway, when suddenly Fred and George zoom overhead on their broomsticks. They navigate back and forth energetically, tossing exam papers and whiz bangs into the air. The vibrant fireworks spiral downward, exploding in a kaleidoscope of colors, scattering papers everywhere. One playful firework strikes Goyle in the face, another mischievously targets Crabbe, and yet another catches Draco off guard, as Filch bursts into the scene, frantically reacting. In a synchronized move, one of the twins signals, and his brother launches a massive firework into the air, which explodes into an enormous, fiery dragon. The dragon, with intimidating ferocity, heads straight for Umbridge, prompting her to dash for the door in panic. The fiery creature bursts out behind her, wreaking havoc by destroying the decrees Filch has fastened to the wall. The walls are left bare as frames cascade to the ground in a chaotic shower of glass, paper, and shattered wood. Fred and George make their grand escape from the building, gliding triumphantly over the battlements on their broomsticks, continuing to fling fireworks into the air. Excited students rush into the courtyard, thrilled by the spectacle and applauding wildly. Meanwhile, Professor Flitwick observes, initially puzzled by the unexpected scene, until a giant, fiery letter W appears majestically in the sky. Ron beams with pride at the audacious display, while Professor Flitwick rejoices by punching the air, only to immediately look around self-consciously. Amidst the excitement, Harry's demeanor changes as his face turns pale, and he begins to collapse in slow motion. Hermione is quick to notice as Harry hits the ground, overtaken by a vivid and haunting vision of Sirius being tortured by Voldemort. In Harry's mind, Sirius appears, gasping in agony, his face twisted in excruciating pain. Harry simultaneously sees fragmented flashes of the number 97, a mysterious glass sphere, a long, black corridor, and a familiar blue door. Hermione rushes to his side, kneeling beside him with deep concern, exchanging worried looks with Ron. They soon find themselves entering Umbridge’s study, where a white cat casually exits through a cat flap, leaving behind his China plate. In a frantic moment, Harry throws flue powder into the crackling fire as Draco drags in Neville. Umbridge leans over Harry with a menacing presence, while he casts urgent glances at both Ron and Hermione, seeking their silent support amidst the chaos."

Here, he becomes an unseen observer of a poignant scene from the past, revealing the teacher's unhappy and deeply troubled childhood. It is during this glimpse into history that Harry sees Snape being cruelly humiliated by his father. Once Harry finds himself back in the dimly lit storeroom, he is confronted by Snape, whose usually guarded and stern expression is now twisted with an overwhelming mix of intense anger and fiery frustration. Seething with rage, Snape seizes Harry with a violent grip, drawing him forcefully close while glaring into his eyes with a fierce intensity that can only be described as terrifying. Overwhelmed with fear, Harry cowers under the weight of Snape’s furious gaze and, in a desperate bid to escape, races out of Snape's oppressive room. As he flees down the corridor, he is stopped by the sounds of someone crying. Upon reaching the corridor’s end, he discovers the twins, who are offering comfort to a small boy, their voices full of kindness. All the while, Umbridge stands nearby, observing the scene with her usual stern demeanor, before she decides to leave, seemingly unmoved by the emotions around her.\n\nDuring the O.W.L. exams, the great hall is meticulously transformed and arranged with long rows of desks that stretch across the expansive room. Each student is carefully distributed in their designated spots: Hermione, with an air of focus and diligence, writes rapidly, while Ron, filled with anxiety, sighs frequently, his face bearing the worried look of someone under great stress. Meanwhile, Harry finds his attention drifting to Umbridge, who stands prominently on a stage in front of a massive, slowly swinging pendulum. Her smug smile gradually fades as she notices several students turning their heads to glance with curiosity towards the entrance. With a heightened sense of urgency, Umbridge strides purposefully down the long hall, aiming directly for the great wooden doors. As she moves, everyone in the room halts their exam writing, collectively turning their attention to look, their curiosity piqued, as Umbridge reaches the door. Just then, a fizzing firework hovers precariously in front of her nose and bursts spectacularly with a loud explosion. She glances around anxiously, her eyes flitting across the now-empty hallway, when suddenly Fred and George zoom overhead on their broomsticks. They maneuver back and forth energetically, tossing handfuls of exam papers and colorful whiz bangs into the air. The vibrant fireworks spiral downward, exploding in a dazzling kaleidoscope of colors, scattering papers everywhere. One playful firework strikes Goyle directly in the face, another mischievously targets Crabbe, while yet another catches Draco completely off guard, as Filch bursts into the scene, frantically reacting to the unfolding chaos. In a synchronized move, one of the twins signals to his brother, who then launches a massive firework into the air. This firework explodes into an enormous, fiery dragon that, with intimidating ferocity, charges straight for Umbridge, prompting her to dash for the door in absolute panic. The fiery creature bursts out behind her, leaving a path of destruction by tearing down the decrees Filch has fastened to the wall. The previously adorned walls are left bare as frames cascade to the ground in a chaotic shower of glass, paper, and shattered wood. Fred and George make their grand escape from the building, gliding triumphantly over the battlements on their broomsticks, continuing to fling fireworks into the night sky. Excited students rush into the courtyard, thrilled by the exuberant spectacle and applauding wildly. Meanwhile, Professor Flitwick observes, initially puzzled by the unexpected scene, until a giant, fiery letter W appears majestically in the sky. Ron beams with pride at the audacious display, his face glowing with admiration for the twins. Professor Flitwick rejoices by punching the air, only to immediately appear self-conscious as he glances around. Amidst the excitement, Harry's demeanor changes drastically as his face turns a ghostly pale, and, in what seems like slow motion, he begins to collapse. Hermione quickly notices as Harry hits the ground, overtaken by a vivid and haunting vision of Sirius being tortured by Voldemort. In Harry's mind, Sirius appears, gasping in agony, his face twisted with excruciating pain. Harry simultaneously witnesses fragmented flashes of the number 97, a mysterious glass sphere, a long, dark corridor, and a familiar blue door. Hermione rushes to his side, kneeling beside him with deep concern etched across her face, exchanging worried looks with Ron. They soon find themselves entering Umbridge’s intimidating study, where a white cat casually exits through a small cat flap, leaving behind his China plate. In a frantic burst of action, Harry throws flue powder into the crackling fire as Draco drags in Neville. Umbridge leans menacingly over Harry, her presence exuding a threatening aura, while he casts urgent, pleading glances at both Ron and Hermione, seeking their silent support amidst the chaos unfolding around him."

Abruptly returning to the storeroom, Harry is confronted by Snape, whose face is twisted with anger. Snape seizes Harry viciously, peering intently into his face, prompting Harry to cower and hastily flee from Snape’s room. As he rushes down the corridor, the sound of crying reaches his ears, drawing his attention to the sight of the twins comforting a small boy, with Umbridge standing nearby, observing the scene before eventually leaving. During the O.W.L. exams, the transformation of the great hall into an orderly arrangement of long rows of desks captures the atmosphere as Hermione writes busily, Ron sighs with a worried expression, and Harry's eyes are fixed on Umbridge, who stands on the stage accompanied by a huge swinging pendulum. Her smug smile wavers as several students direct their attention toward the door, prompting Umbridge to stride purposefully down the hall towards the imposing great wooden doors. The collective attention of everyone writing is diverted as they turn to observe Umbridge opening the door, only to be met by a fizzing firework that hovers directly in front of her nose and erupts inside. She anxiously surveys the now empty hallway when, unexpectedly, Fred and George, mounted on broomsticks, hurtle over her head, zooming back and forth while enthusiastically flinging exam papers and whiz bangs into the air. The vibrant, multicolored fireworks cascade downwards and burst, scattering papers in all directions, with calamity striking as Goyle receives a firework to the face, Crabbe experiences a whiz bang up his backside, and Draco is besieged by another as Filch charges in. At a decisive moment, one of the twins signals, prompting his brother to hurl a significant firework into the air, which detonates into a fiery dragon that heads straight for Umbridge, provoking her to race for the door. The dragon fiercely bursts out after her, obliterating the decrees Filch has affixed to the wall as frames fall with a cacophony of clattering glass, paper, and splintered wood. Fred and George triumphantly swoop from the building, skillfully maneuvering over the battlements on their broomsticks while launching additional fireworks. In the aftermath, delighted students pour into the courtyard, applauding with fervor, while Professor Flitwick, appearing bemused, witnesses a huge fiery letter W materializing in the sky. Simultaneously, Ron beams with pride, Professor Flitwick punches the air in celebration before glancing around self-consciously, and Harry’s complexion pales as he collapses in slow motion. Hermione, observing his fall, is alarmed as Harry is overwhelmed by a vivid image of Sirius undergoing torture by Voldemort. Sirius's tortured gasps, accompanied by his pained expression, vividly play out in Harry's mind alongside the sinister presence of the number 97, a glass sphere, the ominous black corridor, and the enigmatic blue door. Hermione, kneeling beside Harry with evident concern, exchanges a worried glance with Ron before they venture into Umbridge’s study, where a white cat nonchalantly departs his china plate through a cat flap. In a desperate move, Harry throws flue powder into the fire amid the chaos as Draco drags Neville into the room, with Umbridge leaning over Harry, who in turn seeks reassurance in the presence of Ron and Hermione."

Back in the storeroom, dimly lit with ancient potion ingredients lining the shelves, Snape, with his face twisted with a rage that echoes the humiliation he once suffered, grabs Harry viciously and peers into his face. Harry cowers, feeling the oppressive air of Hogwarts' dungeons, and runs from Snape's room, hearing crying in the corridor and finding the Weasley twins, known for their mischievous nature and bright red hair, comforting a small boy while Umbridge, the notorious Hogwarts High Inquisitor with a penchant for pink, stands watching them before she departs. \n\nDuring the O.W.L. exams, critical assessments for fifth-year students that determine their future career paths in the wizarding world, the great hall is set out with long rows of desks as Hermione, ever the studious and top-of-her-class student, writes busily, Ron sighs and looks worried, and Harry watches Umbridge standing on the stage in front of a huge swinging pendulum, a symbol of the oppressive regime she enforces. Her smug smile fades as several students turn to look at the door, and Umbridge strides purposefully down the hall towards the enormous and intricately carved great wooden doors. Everyone stops writing and turns to look as Umbridge opens the door, where a fizzing Weasleys' Wildfire Whiz-bang, a popular magical firework product created by the twins, hovers in front of her nose and explodes inside. She looks anxiously around the empty hallway when suddenly Fred and George hurtle over her head on broomsticks, manufactured by the renowned Nimbus Racing Broom Company, zooming backwards and forwards while flinging exam papers and whiz bangs into the air. The multicolored fireworks spiral down and explode, scattering papers everywhere, with Goyle, a known associate of Draco Malfoy, getting a firework in his face, Crabbe a whiz bang up his backside, and another attacking Draco as Filch, the cantankerous caretaker of Hogwarts, rushes in. One of the twins gives a signal, and his brother flings a large firework into the air, which explodes into a fiery dragon, a tribute to the Hungarian Horntail, that heads for Umbridge, causing her to race for the door. The dragon bursts out after her, destroying the Educational Decrees Filch has nailed to the wall, edicts that Umbridge uses to control the school, as frames clatter down in a shower of glass, paper, and splintered wood. Fred and George fly from the building, swooping over the battlements of the ancient castle on their broomsticks and flinging fireworks. Delighted students rush into the courtyard, applauding, while Professor Flitwick, the tiny Charms professor known for his expertise in magical spells, looks confused and a huge fiery letter W, a triumphant mark of the Weasley twins, appears in the sky. Ron smiles with pride, Professor Flitwick punches the air, then looks around self-consciously as Harry's face grows pale and he collapses in slow motion. \n\nHermione notices him fall as he is overwhelmed by a terrifying vision, an ominous warning, of Sirius being tortured by Voldemort, the dark wizard feared by all. Sirius gasps, his face contorted with pain, as Harry sees the number 97, the glass sphere that holds a prophecy, the black corridor of the Department of Mysteries, and the blue door leading to danger. Hermione kneels beside him anxiously, looking at Ron before they enter Umbridge's study, notorious for its oppressive décor and surveillance equipment, where a white cat, a testament to Umbridge's fondness for felines, leaves his China plate through a cat flap. Harry throws flue powder, a magical substance for transportation through fireplaces, into the fire as Draco drags in Neville, Umbridge leans over Harry, and he looks at Ron and Hermione, trusting them as he prepares to face the imminent threat."

The sparkling streamers drift upward and disappear, tossing hats everywhere, with Zabini getting a streamer on his foot, Parkinson a sparkler in her mouth, and another wrapping around Blaise as Madam Pomfrey strolls by. One of the cousins makes a gesture, and his sister tosses a massive streamer into the wind, which transforms into a fiery unicorn that rushes towards Trelawney, prompting her to tiptoe towards the gate. The unicorn gallops after her, dislodging the posters Madam Pomfrey has glued to the ceiling, as chandeliers tumble down in a cascade of feathers, fabric, and cracked tiles.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
