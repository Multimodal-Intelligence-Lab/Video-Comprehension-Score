Between stone pillars, Gatsby is walked off into the dark grounds and amongst the dark trees dotted with fireflies, finding Daisy, who is standing by a tree near Nick's cottage. Dressed in a dark dinner suit and bow tie, Daisy is slowly approached by Gatsby, and each other's eyes are gazed into by them.

Her waist is wrapped around by his arm, pulling her close, and her neck is kissed by him. With her eyes closed, Daisy's head is tilted back by her, enraptured.

Inside, up is cleared by the staff as Gatsby stands on the terrace looking out across the bay while the mess is cleared up by his staff. At Tom Buchanan's mansion, the green light on the dock gently pulses. Down some steps, Nick comes, tossing a bottle in the pool. His suit jacket is grabbed by Gatsby, his eyes are clenched shut by him, and the bridge of his nose is pinched by him. In the flashback, Daisy is followed by Gatsby to an upstairs room where close to each other they stand about to kiss, then back is moved by Gatsby. Across the night sky, a shooting star flies as each other is transfixed by them. Closer, Gatsby leans, Daisy is kissed by him, and into a passionate embrace, they sink, together lying. Her soft white skin is kissed by him, and in each other's arms, they lie. Alone, Daisy's grand house stands lit up at night until the light fades. Up is pointed by him as a star shoots by and something is tossed by him into the illuminated pool. Wistfully, they both smile. Across the dark bay, Gatsby looks, a smile is given confidently by him, and to Nick he steps over, who frowningly looks down."

With tenderness, he cups his hand gently against her cheek, leans in closer, and kisses her passionately on the lips. Embracing the moment fully, he wraps his arm snugly around her waist, pulling her closer to him, and tenderly kisses her neck.

Gatsby walks between stone pillars that once belonged to a grand estate, now merely remnants leading off into the dark grounds and amongst the dark trees dotted with fireflies, finding Daisy, the object of his unending affection, standing by a tree near Nick's modest cottage. In a dark dinner suit and bow tie, a symbol of his carefully curated persona, Gatsby slowly approaches her, and they gaze into each other's eyes, reminiscent of their passionate past in Louisville. He cups his hand against her cheek, leans closer, and kisses her passionately on the lips. He wraps his arm around her waist, pulls her close, and kisses her neck. Her eyes closed, Daisy, who is often torn between the love of her life and her privileged marriage, tilts her head back, enraptured. Drink in hand, Nick stands on the terrace looking out into the darkness, pondering the complexities of love and wealth. Looking slightly disheveled, Tom Buchanan, Daisy's wealthy and unfaithful husband, walks up behind him, causing Nick to turn to Tom and frown. Tom smooths his hair back and turns to the barman, who has become a silent witness to the evening's unfolding drama. Gatsby continues to cover Daisy in kisses and pauses, lifting his head with a slight smile, meeting Daisy's gaze, reminiscent of their youthful innocence. Nick points his cottage out to Tom, who looks towards the cottage with a sense of disdain. Gatsby touches Daisy's face and steps away from her as Slagle, a shady character from the underworld Gatsby is entangled with, and his associates are fighting with the staff. Tom puts down his glass, and Nick lifts his, contemplating the night's events. Daisy turns to see Nick walk through the trees as Gatsby goes to Herzog, another figure in Gatsby's mysterious dealings. Daisy watches pensively as Gatsby goes with Herzog. The party winds down, and Wolfsheim, Gatsby's business associate known for his involvement in organized crime, paces in front of Gatsby in his study, discussing matters best left unspoken. Tom and Daisy are driven away from the mansion, and Gatsby watches from a window as they are driven away, feeling the pangs of longing and loss. Standing at the window, Gatsby looks thoughtful as four of his men march Slagle out through the gates, with one of them laying into Slagle with heavy punches to the face, a brutal reminder of the criminal world entwined with his glamorous life. Inside, the staff clear up as Gatsby stands on the terrace looking out across the bay, where the infamous green light on the dock at Tom Buchanan's mansion gently pulses, symbolizing Gatsby's unreachable dreams. Nick comes down some steps, tossing a bottle in the pool, a moment of reflection and resignation. Gatsby grabs his suit jacket, clenches his eyes shut, and pinches the bridge of his nose, feeling the weight of his unfulfilled dreams. In the flashback, Gatsby follows Daisy to an upstairs room where they stand close to each other about to kiss, then Gatsby moves back, hesitant about their future. A shooting star flies across the night sky as they stand transfixed by each other, a fleeting symbol of hope. Gatsby leans closer, kisses Daisy, and they sink into a passionate embrace, lying together, momentarily escaping reality's constraints. He kisses her soft white skin, and they lie in each other's arms, lost in the illusion of their perfect world. Daisy's grand house stands alone lit up at night, a stark contrast to their momentary bliss, until the light fades. He points up as a star shoots by, marking their ephemeral moment, and tosses something into the illuminated pool, a gesture full of wistful longing. They both smile wistfully, aware of their unattainable desires. Gatsby looks across the dark bay, smiles confidently, and steps over to Nick, who looks down, frowning, contemplating the inevitable unraveling of dreams."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

          "description": "Gatsby stops and turns with a smile to Nick as he heads into the dark grounds, finding Daisy by a tree near Nick's cottage. Dressed in a dark suit, Gatsby approaches Daisy, and they share a passionate kiss, wrapped in each other's arms. Nick watches from the terrace, where Tom joins him, prompting a terse exchange. Meanwhile, Gatsby pauses his embrace with Daisy, who watches him depart with Herzog. As the party winds down, Wolfsheim paces in Gatsby's study, and Tom and Daisy leave in a car, observed by Gatsby from a window. Outside, four men escort Slagle through the gates with force. Gatsby stands on the terrace, contemplating the green light across the bay. Nick descends some steps, tossing a bottle into the pool. Gatsby remembers a moment upstairs with Daisy, sharing a kiss as a shooting star glides by. They hold each other in a passionate embrace. The vision fades, leaving Gatsby smiling confidently by the bay."
