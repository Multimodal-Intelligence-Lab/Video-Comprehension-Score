    "576": "A flicker of a shadow appears from behind the corner of the obscured glass at the section of the room most distant from Parrish, indicating a shape is there. Parrish falls silent, the sound and tone of the voice rendering him mute. He takes a step backward and struggles to make sense of what he is hearing. After a moment, the figure, who is the source of the voice, steps forward, revealing himself to be the young man seen previously in the coffee shop, but with a change; he seems odd, off-center, not handsome but terrifyingly beautiful. A moment passes with Parrish beside himself as the young man steps closer to him, his face inches from Parrish's, daring him to identify him. Parrish turns away, but the young man reappears in front of him, spectacularly. Stunned and terrified by the realization, Parrish surveys the young man, who now seems bewildered by his own effect. A hopelessly confused Parrish does not respond for a moment, then a sound at the door causes him to look at Luisa and then at the young man, verifying the young man's presence has been acknowledged by Luisa. Luisa nods perfunctorily and exits, leaving Parrish frozen, dumbfounded, and frightened by the response. Hesitant, Parrish then obediently leads the young man out of the library, down a long hallway, and across the foyer. As they enter, Allison's voice is heard in the background. Parrish and the young man appear at the table, and an awkward pause ensues as the unannounced guest’s presence at a family dinner is noted, with the guest himself being carefully surveyed. Horribly uncomfortable, Parrish watches as the young man looks at each person as if discovering a face for the first time, leading to another awkward pause, with the group waiting patiently. Parrish desperately searches for a last name, with a furtive glance at Joe, and a name tumbles from his lips as Luisa sets a plate in front of Joe and returns Parrish's plate, which was taken to the kitchen to be warmed. Joe looks over at the other guests, picks up his utensils gingerly, tries to copy the others, and stops, staring at his food. Parrish falls silent again, searching for an answer, as Susan kisses Drew in a light, humorous way, their heads bobbing like plastic water toys, lips meeting mid-air, and at the kiss's conclusion, Susan suddenly notices Joe is present and has been watching.",
    "1069": "Drover staggers, distraught, through the burning wreck of the Carney house, sobbing in uncontrollable grief, as the flickering flames illuminate the calm figure of King George, while others mill around trying to help. Drover walks through the town, with King George shadowing him, looking out across the bay at the broken, burning hulks of ships, and walks towards the shattered pub where some people are trying to patch it up, while others sit around staring or drinking vacantly. He approaches Ivan, who's sweeping up in the bar, followed by Magarri. Drover looks around, taking in the white drinkers and his nervous black brother-in-law, then turns slowly back to Ivan, who stares as tears of grief and rage run down his face, while the bar patrons stare as he looks round at Magarri. Magarri enters tentatively, removes his hat, and approaches the bar, as a woman glares at him, drawing on a cigarette. Ivan has placed a glass and a tin cup on the bar, and tears roll down Drover's cheeks. Reluctantly, Ivan replaces the cup with another glass, and looks at Magarri, raising a glass. Magarri eyeballs him, glances at Drover, and they all take a drink, placing the empty glasses on the bar. Magarri wipes away a tear as Drover frowns in disbelief. Dutton checks the body on the stretcher as Sarah comes in, and his eyes bore into her, trying to make her understand. Meanwhile, a priest is down at the wharf, as Drover releases the mooring, takes a chain out of Bull's unconscious hand, and runs onto the small Mission Island sailing boat, while the priest prays. Magarri holds a rifle and Drover stands holding a rope as they get underway, while Sarah stares, grief-stricken, at the devastation. The wooden buildings of the Mission burn fiercely in the night, as Drover, Magarri, and Ivan stand staring on the beach. Drover nods to Magarri, who moves off, then moves fearfully up the beach, weapons raised, passing burning buildings and approaching the tree line. Drover looks into a building and sees a row of boys' shoes, looks horrified, and lowers his rifle, as his eyes fill with tears. He turns towards a noise, raising his rifle as something moves in the undergrowth, and a boy emerges. Drover lowers his weapon as more children come out of the undergrowth and smiles with relief as Magarri beckons the boys forward. Another figure with long hair appears, and they embrace, throwing their arms around one another. Drover holds the boy out at arm's length, grins happily, stroking his hair, as Nullah hangs his head sadly. A torch beam sweeps across the water towards them as they look around fearfully, while armed figures march out of the jungle through the smoke.",
    "516": "She listens to the music, her eyes closed. The record plays for a few moments in the quiet room, as Elliot walks over to Lee and leans against the shelf near her. Lee, smiling, continues to listen to the music, her head down; Elliot stares at her. Elliot nods. Elliot stares at Lee, who continues to look down, her arms around her chest. Lee looks down again; the music plays softly and Elliot continues to stare at her, thinking. As Elliot's thoughts are heard over the scene, Lee glances around the loft, then begins to walk away. The camera follows her as she goes past the nude drawings, which become the focus of attention as Lee walks offscreen. Lee walks back onscreen, to the bookshelf behind the drawings. She takes the Edward Estlin Cummings book from the shelf and flips through it as she walks back to Elliot, who is still leaning by the stereo, still ruminating. Elliot leaps up, grabs Lee, and kisses her passionately. Lee, surprised, pushes him away. He kisses Lee again. He clumsily turns around; she bumps against the stereo unit. As Lee pulls away, she smashes into the turntable. Lee, shocked, is gasping. Elliot quickly turns away from Lee. She tries to compose herself and the film cuts to the loft entranceway. Frederick enters the loft first, followed by a confused Dusty. They stride across the loft past Lee, who is standing by the stereo. Elliot, standing near the nude drawings, is looking through a book. Dusty settles down in the backseat and closes the door. Elliot leans down to the chauffeur's window, signaling for him to start driving. The limousine drives off. Elliot runs to a phone booth across the street. He picks up the phone and dials. The film cuts to Frederick in his loft, standing near the phone. Frederick picks it up. When no one answers, Frederick, reacting, hangs up, and the film moves back outside to the phone booth, where Elliot, the phone receiver to his ear, listens for a moment, then hangs up. He walks out of the booth, reacting, then walks down the sidewalk, where he bumps into a frantic Lee, just turning the corner. Elliot, uneasy, glances up in the direction of Frederick's loft. He leads Lee a few yards up the street, away from any prying eyes. She sighs. Lee looks at him. She sighs. She walks off. Elliot stares after her, grinning. He laughs. A taxi turns a West Side street corner and stops in front of Evan and Norma's building, which is decorated with a long metal awning. It's an overcast day. A station wagon on the opposite side of the street pulls away as Hannah, a white scarf fluttering over her shoulder, gets out of the cab.",
    "1384": "Harry glances warily from the steaming tureen of green to Tom, who works a grimy thumb into his gum and frees a walnut sliver, while Fudge turns and smiles nervously. Harry eyes the stack of books, noticing that one is bound by a rope, and through the window, the rooftops of London are visible. As a train passes, the camera pulls back to reveal Harry standing with Hedwig; he turns and eyes his schoolbooks. He studies the growling tome, The Monster Book of Monsters, and gives the rope a tug, causing the book to leap to the floor, with pages flying and book covers snapping. Harry gives chase, but the book turns and begins nipping viciously at his shoes. He vaults atop the bed, watches the book disappear underneath, and then grabs a pillow. Seconds later, the book scuttles into view, and Harry pounces, muffling the book's roar beneath the pillow. A young witch in maid's robes pushes a cart down the hall as Harry exits his room just as she knocks on a door. Upon opening the door, she's greeted by a thunderous roar and a rush of wind, and something small and fast dashes by Harry's feet. He sees a ragged-looking rat, Scabbers, pursued by an ugly orange cat, Crookshanks. As Harry moves down the stairs, voices emerge from below. Once he reaches the bottom, he finds Ron Weasley protectively cradling Scabbers, while Hermione Granger tries to restrain a hissing Crookshanks. Sensing another presence in the room, both Ron and Hermione turn to face him. In the accompanying photo, the entire Weasley family stands before the Great Pyramids, waving, with Ron in the middle and Scabbers perched on his shoulder. Mrs. Weasley takes Harry's face in her hands and smiles as Harry's eyes drift to the fugitive poster. Meanwhile, Mr. Weasley hesitates, unable to continue, then hesitates again, and she points. Just then, the compartment rattles, lanterns flicker, and the train lurches, beginning to slow. Harry rises, slides open the door, and peers into the corridor. From Harry's point of view, all along the carriage, heads look out curiously. Then the train jerks, the car sways, and the lamps running along the ceiling flicker and die. A thin wisp of steam escapes Ron's mouth as he stands, a dark silhouette against the window, wiping a patch of condensation from it. Suddenly, the car sways violently, and from the stick in the hands of R.J. Lupin emanates a shivering light; his face looks tired and gray, but his eyes are alert and wary. Hermione's troubled face hovers above Harry as he sits up, and Ron, pale and nervous, extends his hand to give Harry his glasses. As Harry leaves, he turns to Ron and Hermione, but she shakes her head. Harry then looks to the window, and the reflection in it comes into focus.",
    "1095": "At a rest stop, an old woman wrapped in a heavy shawl chews on some food. A man bites into an apple. Asael and Chaya sit together. People huddled on the ground look up at Tuvia, but only Zus stands up, draping his machine gun over his shoulder. Tuvia nods, and the two of them set off, both wearing caps and scarves wrapped around their necks. A Russian in a gray army coat and fur hat steps out from behind a tree. Soldiers surround the Bielski brothers, who put up their hands without resistance. Zus steps forward as the man shrugs and beckons for them to follow him. He strolls off ahead whistling and leads them into a military camp past a soldier on horseback. A middle-aged man with bags under his eyes, a black fur hat, and a black leather coat over his coffee uniform emerges from a tent. Zus shoots a glance at his brother's impassive face as the commander smirks. Tuvia salutes, and Panchenko returns the salute. The whistling Russian Gramov escorts them out of the camp. A view of a thick pine forest appears as Tuvia rides up on a white horse and with quiet pride, watches his flock, young and old, busily building a new camp. Aron and Asael saw wood, Arkady hammers a roof beam, Shimon in his hat, overcoat, and scarf wields an axe, and Malbin uses an axe handle to secure a nail. Tuvia tosses him a hammer while Zus overhears and scowls, listening uneasily. Later, Asael comes into the camp with more people. Bella is peeling potatoes. A man kneels down, taking off his hat and kisses the ground. He looks around eagerly and addresses Benzion. Tuvia glances at Malbin as Itzak bends to kiss Tuvia's hand. Malbin leads Itzak away past Zus, who scowls at Tuvia. Chaya turns to Asael. Tuvia smiles coldly, and Zus whacks Tuvia in the face as Asael and Chaya watch in dismay. Shimon, Malbin, Lazar, and the others look accusingly at Zus. Zus steps towards Tuvia, who's looking at the blood on his fingers. Tuvia hits back and launches himself at his brother. Benzion tries to pull them apart but is shoved to one side. Zus' next blow sends Tuvia reeling to the ground, and Aron looks at them both in shock. Zus rolls Tuvia on his back with a flick of his foot, and Tuvia slowly scrambles to his feet. Zus spits and whacks his brother again with another kick, then pulls him up with both hands and slams him back onto the muddy ground. As he goes to do it again, Tuvia fists him in the groin, pushes Zus down on his back, picks up a round stone, and prepares to throw it.",
    "401": "Jody runs, whipping through the trees--always ahead of him. The old man pours whiskey into a teacup, then pours Fergus more whiskey. The ferry churns into the sunset. FADE UP into an elegant, empty Georgian room, covered in clouds of dust. A figure among the clouds of dust is hacking at a wall with a sledgehammer. It is Fergus, dressed in laborer's overalls, covered in dust. He is knocking the bricks from an outer wall, working furiously and relentlessly, like a machine. We see the wall with the hammer striking it, and one brick falls away, then another. Daylight pours through the clouds of dust and the growing hole as more bricks fall away. Through the clouds of dust and the streams of daylight we now see a patch of green. His rhythm slows, and more bricks fall away. Then the hammer stops, and the dust begins to clear. The dust drifts across it, revealing a cricket pitch with tiny sticklike figures running on the green. Fergus, returning from work, crosses the street and enters through a white door. Fergus is dressing. He puts on a cheap suit, like any country boy in a big city, and takes Jody's wallet from the trousers of his overalls. He flips it open, sees the picture of the soldier and Dil, and puts it in the pocket of his suit. Fergus walks down a street looking for an address. Some distance down the street is a sign -- MILLIE'S UNISEX HAIR. Fergus stands as the crowds go by him, looking in the window. He has the picture in his hand. We see Dil from his point of view, then Fergus walks inside and enters. She leaves the salon, checks her watch, and stubs out a cigarette. She comes toward him and fiddles with his hair, pushes his head back into a basin behind him, and begins to knead his hair in hot water and shampoo. The hands with the purple nails run over his scalp. Fergus sits up as she begins to cut and imitates his accent saying it. Fergus laughs. Dil raises Fergus's head up, with his new-cut hair, and holds a mirror up behind his head so he can see the back. He looks like a young London stockbroker. He walks off through the crowds and then ducks into a doorway. Dil comes out, dressed in a pair of high heels, a very short skirt, different, more raunchy clothes on her than we saw inside. She locks the glass door and walks down the street, across the road, and into a pub called the Metro. Fergus follows. Dil makes her way through it and sits down at the bar. Fergus comes toward the bar and takes a seat.",
    "386": "The scenes begin with music and head credits playing over various bowling shots—pins flying, graceful releases, balls gliding down lanes, bowlers hoisting balls, sliding feet, and a ball return spinning up a ball. The music transitions into boomy source music from a distant jukebox as the credits end over a clattering strike. A lanky blonde man with stringy hair tied back in a ponytail turns from the strike to walk back to the bench. The focus shifts to a big man nursing a large plastic cup of Bud, with dark worried eyes, a goatee, hairy legs emerging from khaki shorts, and wearing a khaki army surplus shirt with the sleeves cut off over an old bowling shirt. Donny, the strike-scoring bowler, enters and sits next to Walter. The Dude, also holding a large plastic cup of Bud, has foam on his mustache. Reflected in a plaque, the Dude is seen entering the room with a young man. The plaque, from Variety Clubs International, honors Jeffrey Lebowski as Achiever of the Year. The Dude, wearing shorts and a bowling shirt, turns to look, as does Brandt, the young man in a suit with his hands clasped in front of his groin. The track and pan reveal a framed Life Magazine cover titled \"ARE YOU A LEBOWSKI ACHIEVER?\" with the Dude's sunglassed face on it, showing the display is mirrored. A fat sixtyish man in a motorized wheelchair, Jeff Lebowski, enters, wheeling himself behind a desk. The Dude sits facing him as Brandt withdraws. The Dude rises and heads for the door, opens it, and shuts it on the old man's bellowing. Outside, a houseman with a rolled-up carpet on one shoulder walks through a back lawn past a swimming pool to a garage, followed by Brandt and the Dude. They arc around a woman's foot as she finishes painting her nails emerald green, looking up at the Dude. In her early twenties, she leans back and extends her leg toward him. The Dude pulls his sunglasses down his nose, peeks over them, tentatively grabs hold of her extended foot, and she waggles it, giggling. The Dude looks over at the pool, where a man in his thirties with long stringy blond hair is passed out in an inflatable chair.",
    "87": "The preacher's eyes crinkle as he turns to Pearl, smiling brightly, but then his eyes snap back to John and his voice becomes like a whip, never leaving John's eyes. Pearl gapes up at John as he speaks, and as he gets up, the cellar door is in the background. The children cross him towards the door, preceding the preacher who carries a candle in a holder, while Pearl is gaping at John's lie. John looks left and right, casing the joint, and now they are at the bottom of the stairs. John sees Pearl's expression, takes her hand, squeezes it harder, and points. He points out a place beneath a shelf laden with Mason jars, at the most distant part of the cellar from the stairs. The preacher starts toward it, leaving them at the foot of the stairs, then turns, catching John's ruse, and shepherds them ahead of him. They arrive beneath the shelf, where the preacher sets the candle on a barrel near a shelf-prop and sinks to his knees below shot as Pearl gapes at John and John looks stony, and she seems about to speak. The preacher's hands sweep dust and expose concrete. He straightens on his knees and turns to the children in the close background, his sincerity beyond doubt, and takes his knife out, springing it open. She starts to sob, and the preacher is astounded as his hands fall away from John. He leans back against the wall and talks through laughter, his eyes all over the place. The preacher makes a lunge across John for the doll, but John ducks under his arm, pulls Pearl forward with his left hand, turns backwards, and with his free hand, knocks over the candle and pulls out the support on the shelf. Jars shower over him; one crowns him and breaks, shedding guck, which he wipes from his eyes, and they start up the stairs. He makes one step forward, steps on a rolling jar, and falls. They are near the top of the stairs as John slips and they nearly fall backward, but John recovers, and the preacher enters the shot, his back to us. The children get through the open door as the preacher reaches the top, and John slams the door, catching the preacher's hand. The preacher screams as John's astonished eyes peer through the crack in the door, which loosens; the preacher yanks his hand loose, sucks it, groaning, and the door slams shut, the bolt is shot home, and he snarls like the Big Bad Wolf. Pearl, dangling her doll, cries, as John, panting, leans against the wall by the door, wondering what to do next. A pretty, pastoral shot of the house in light mist is seen as they run across and leave the shot, and before they disappear, we hear the preacher's fists hammering against the door.",
    "102": "At the ribbon-cutting ceremony, a postman delivers a letter to Bubba's mom, who opens it surrounded by her many children, looks at the check, and faints. A door opens as a white woman serves Bubba's mom some shrimp. Forrest rides the mower, and as he steps onto the porch, he looks down the road. Jenny's image walks and then vanishes, causing Forrest to look away. He turns and walks into the house, where Jenny walks across the lawn to him. Jenny lies asleep in bed, followed by Forrest and Jenny walking together. She breaks a window, collapses to the ground and sobs, and Forrest kneels down next to her. They sit on a limb together, and later, Jenny sits by the vase of flowers and looks out the window. Forrest closes his eyes as he sits on the porch. Jenny places a box of Nike running shoes in his lap as they sit on a log together looking at the river, and Jenny places her arms around Forrest. She turns off the TV and walks outside. Forrest stands, puts down his Dr. Pepper, and watches Jenny walk toward the stairs. Forrest turns and walks toward the door, while Jenny turns and walks up the stairs. Forrest stands outside as the house stands in the rain. He lies in bed as the door opens and Jenny gets into bed next to him. Jenny and Forrest kiss, and Jenny takes off her nightgown as they make love. Jenny carries her purse and walks toward a waiting cab that drives away while Forrest is asleep in his bed. The Congressional Medal lies on a table by a ping-pong paddle as Forrest holds a glass of milk and wears his bathrobe, looking at the medal he had given to Jenny. Jenny's bed is made, so Forrest stands in the doorway looking at the room and bed where Jenny had been, standing still as if in a trance. Forrest sits on a rocking chair with his running shoes on and slowly puts on his Bubba-Gump cap. He stands, walks off the porch, and begins to jog across the lawn, with his speed increasing as he runs farther away. Forrest runs down the driveway away from his house, runs to the end of the drive, turns right, and runs down the highway. Three men sit as they watch the television while Forrest runs through the main street of town, under the sign, and onto the pier. He runs to a pier at the Atlantic Ocean, where a lighthouse stands at the end. Forrest runs across the pier, continues running along the highway, and down a road between fields of wheat, passing a mountain river.",
    "614": "Sidney scurries off excitedly, and back at his apartment, he types on a laptop at his coffee table. Grinning proudly, he scratches his chin and looks down at a pile of magazines on the table. He takes some of Sophie's promotional literature from the pile and regards it with a grimace. It's Chihuahua, as Sophie stares back at him from the page. He dials a number on his cell phone. A van sweeps past the Soho Grand Hotel as Sidney fidgets while trying to get comfortable on a sofa in the spacious white lobby. The cushion he's sitting on slips forward, causing him to sink awkwardly into the crack. A tall, slender woman emerges from a lift to find him struggling with the cushion, his shirt and tank top having ridden up unflatteringly. The woman towers over him, and Sidney's eyes widen as she shrugs. Sidney plonks the fishbowl down on the bar, and she stifles a self-conscious smile. On a TV, Alison's eyes are downcast. Sidney comes back for the fishbowl and heads off. Alison stares down sadly at an untouched glass of White Russian. Meanwhile, Clayton presides over a staff meeting, and Sidney's irked. Sidney scowls as Lawrence basks in the adulation of his colleagues, and Sidney catches up with him outside the meeting. He grins broadly, then heads off before turning back heavy-browed. Sidney screws up his face as Lawrence gives him a jaunty nod and saunters off. Lawrence takes a seat behind his desk to address his underlings. A blonde stripper reveals a penis as Mrs. Harding and her two young daughters look on. Sidney quickly cups Bobbie's dangling penis. A stone-faced receptionist stares at Sidney, who sits outside Clayton's office, obsessively scrubbing his hand with a tissue. The receptionist frowns as Sidney looks in at Eleanor and Clayton, who stand at a desk discussing an A3 mock-up of a potential magazine cover. Eleanor exits and walks uneasily past Sidney, while Clayton looms large in the doorway. Sidney skulks into the office with his head hung low, sits as Clayton paces, and then Clayton is behind Sidney. Clayton walks round to face him, and Sidney looks him in the eye, but Clayton stares coldly. Clayton turns away in his high-backed swivel chair as Sidney lopes out with his tail between his legs. Seated party guests eat under white marquees on the lawn outside Clayton's sprawling mansion. Alison's puzzled as Sidney rises from the table and lets his hand linger on Alison's shoulder before sauntering away. Alison looks behind her, then she too rises from the table. Sidney, dressed in long shorts and a Hawaiian shirt, spots Sophie approaching Lawrence. Sidney joins Lawrence and Sophie and gawks, then lopes off. Sidney spies on them from behind a bush as Lawrence stands with Alison, playfully tossing nuts into his mouth.",
    "151": "He takes out the ticket with a hint of bluster in his attitude, which is cut off by a cold rebuff from the European, leading him to gesture to the back of the train. Gandhi, nonplussed and feeling a little less sure of himself, reacts with a touch of irony. The porter, wanting to avoid trouble, reaches for Gandhi's suitcases, while Gandhi reaches into his waistcoat to produce a card for the conductor, leaving the porter amazed. He then turns and walks out of the compartment. Meanwhile, in a large Victorian parlor in a well-to-do home, Gandhi faces Khan, an impressive Indian, Singh, who is slighter and older but wiry, capable of physical and intellectual strength, and Khan's twenty-year-old son, Tyeb Mohammed. Something is said with dignity and strength that makes the statement bewildering, leaving Gandhi looking around helplessly. Mr. Baker, a wealthy white lawyer whose home it is, pokes the fire, slightly amused at Gandhi's naivety, while Gandhi holds a British legal document and lifts it pointedly, looking at Mr. Baker in disbelief. Mr. Baker smothers a smile as Gandhi looks at Khan incredulously, who smiles with eyes showing that it's no joke. Gandhi absorbs the inconceivable as his innocence fuses with anger at the injustice of it all. The chilling tone shakes Gandhi's firmness a little, while Khan studies him with wry interest. Gandhi glances at Tyeb Mohammed and Baker, then stiffens, plainly frightened by the challenge yet determined to take it. A wire basket is placed on supports over the fire. A small crowd of mostly Indian people, with a few curious Whites, gathers in front, where Gandhi whispers, trying to ignore the crowd as the English reporter waits skeptically. Nearby, five policemen, including a sergeant and four constables, try to be inconspicuous, with a horse-drawn paddy wagon beside them. Among the crowd are five or six women in saris, featuring Gandhi's wife, Ba, at the front, possessing delicate features and large expressive eyes but feeling ill at ease and uncertain, forcing herself to act against her wishes. Gandhi wets his lips nervously, glances with apprehension at the police, then takes notes from his pocket and moves to the front of the fire.",
    "767": "Lily wears her winter hat, and the whole family group stares at one another before they form a group hug. Gordon watches from the steps, grasping onto the handrails as they fly over mountains. Jackson and Yuri stand behind the others as the plane approaches to land, while Sasha struggles with the controls to keep the aircraft level. As the plane skims the ground, Jackson and Yuri join the others. In the cargo hold, the two families run to a Bentley, and Jackson unbuckles it, allowing them to climb inside. Gordon heaves a lever, opening the cargo door, then turns and heads for the steps. The plane thumps against the ground, and reaching the cargo hold, Gordon sprints between the rows of cars towards the open rear door. Jackson inserts a key into the Bentley's dashboard, turns it, puts the car into gear, and accelerates towards the cargo exit. The car shoots down the ramp and bumps on the glacier. As the plane continues landing, the cars are tossed out of the cargo door. The Bentley's airbags deploy as Sasha gets the plane on the ground. Sasha crosses himself, closes his eyes, and it comes to a stop as he opens his eyes. The plane comes perilously close to the drop. Sasha breathes in then grins, but the grin vanishes from his face as the plane starts to go down a steep incline, rapidly gaining speed, and it falls into an abyss and explodes. Watching from above, Tamara sobs. Jackson looks skywards when he hears a helicopter, seeing a fleet of helicopters carrying wild animals in suspended harnesses. The group on the ground stares, and Gordon starts to wave. The Chinese crewmen on the helicopter see the group below. The helicopter lands, and a man in uniform rushes out to them. Yuri and the twins step forward, but Tamara is stopped. The boys, Yuri, and Popi are on board the helicopter, as the crew gets aboard. The helicopter speeds over mountains as the morning sun throws light on the summits. David and Laura sit together. The helicopters make their way to the complex built deep into the mountains, approaching the bustling landing area. Hearing the corgis, Professor West turns and sees the Queen, struggling with her leads and holding onto her hat. A bus zooms Anheuser and his group through the mountain on an elevated track, passing massive structures with ongoing work on various arks. Yuri is at the R3 Boarding gate while Gordon walks with Tamara, and they all stop when Lily spots light. They run down to a truck on the road, and Jackson lobs a stone at the vanishing truck, which a grandma in the back hears.",
    "553": "The spectacular Grecian facade of the temple is carved directly into the rock, and Indy, Sallah, Henry, and Brody creep forward to see. A Turk stands alone in the center of the Temple, walking slowly. Giant columns define the Temple's perimeter, and they watch him from a safe distance as he is about to approach the spot where a Turkish soldier lies dead, decapitated. The Turk stops just one step away from the beheaded soldier, then takes one more fatal step. Indy, Henry, Brody, and Sallah react to the sight as two Nazi soldiers force another Turk forward, and everyone turns to discover Indy and his party surrounded by Nazi soldiers. Indy's group is relieved of their guns and brought forward by the Nazi soldiers. Indy laughs before Donovan shifts his aim slightly and shoots Henry, with the bullet entering below his ribs, causing Henry to collapse with blood flowing from the wound. Brody and Sallah rush to assist him as Indy spins toward Donovan with murder in his eyes, prompting Donovan to point the gun at him. The two decapitated men lie a few yards in front of Indy as he walks to the entranceway, flanked by two stone lions. Silent reaction shots capture Elsa, Sallah, Brody, and Donovan registering their different emotions as Indy proceeds forward, opening the Grail Diary and taking a few steps before stopping where two men have just died. Indy looks at Henry, then steps forward through the cobwebs, which begin to move, and instinctively rolls forward on the ground out of harm's way. From his new position, he sees the cause of the trouble: a razor-sharp triple pendulum, which has been guarding a small corridor that turns left fifty yards ahead. Wooden wheels turn, controlling the spinning blades, and Indy loops a rope around the wheels, jamming the mechanism and stopping the blades mid-swipe. Brody and Sallah smile, relieved, while Henry shakes his head. Holding the Grail Diary, with his fedora covered in cobwebs, Indy pulls away cobwebs to reveal a cobblestone path, each cobble engraved with a letter. Henry lifts his head painfully, still lying in Sallah's arms, as Indy takes a step and immediately a stone breaks away, causing Indy to fall up to his hip, with his leg stuck through the hole where the stone once was. He grunts as he pulls himself from the hole, with the Grail Diary in his hand.",
    "55": "A small sign in elegant neon scroll gives the name of the place, which sits on rolling green lawns. Evelyn's car pulls up before the elegant Spanish rest home, its entryway illuminated by streetlights. Gittes gets out of the car with Evelyn, offers her his arm, and they go up the walkway to the entrance. They are approached by an unctuous man in his forties, with a flower in his buttonhole, who gets a clear look at Gittes, bruised, with torn trousers. He sees Evelyn first, who shakes her head and can't quite conceal her surprise at his question, staring back at Gittes, amused and appalled, but she manages to nod. Gittes locks eyes with Palmer and points to the wall. After Evelyn looks, she turns to Gittes, who strolls toward the women knitting and working on a quilt. Two of the ladies giggle, while a third gives them a curt look and goes back to her knitting. Gittes approaches her and looks at the quilt, spotting the head of a fish among the rest of the crazy quilt pattern, with Evelyn beside him. Evelyn gestures as if there's someone behind Palmer, and Gittes looks up to see Palmer standing in the doorway, looking taut and a little drawn. Mulvihill walks up beside Gittes, and he makes the mistake of opening the glass door in the entryway, putting his back to Gittes momentarily. Gittes swiftly pulls Mulvihill's jacket up over his head, spins him around, and hammers away at him, beating him against the glass door and along the wall, pounding his fists into the cloth until it turns red and Mulvihill begins to sink to the red tile floor. Mulvihill's gun clatters to the floor. Gittes jumps in as she takes off across the lawn, tilting the elegant little neon sign as she goes. Evelyn drives, looking straight ahead, and after a moment takes one hand off the wheel to rub her left eye a little, as Gittes watches her. Gittes stands on the veranda, smoking a cigarette and staring off into the night, then turns as Evelyn comes out, carrying a tray with whiskey and an ice bucket. They drink, with Gittes looking sharply at her, and then she looks at him. They're very close now as she goes over a mouse very near his eye. The view shifts to include Gittes in bed, watching Evelyn next to him as she talks on the phone. Gittes stares at her silently, then she kisses him, rushes to the bathroom, and shuts the door. Gittes stares at the door for a moment.",
    "1254": "A guy walks onto the stage. He's around 60 and tanned with white hair. He smiles at his adoring fans. Even Carl smiles and claps. Carl holds up his hand expectantly and then nods knowingly. Everyone else claps. He glances around. A spotlight picks Carl out. Carl smiles awkwardly. The audience points at him. Terrance slips off his shoes and sprints down the aisle. He reaches Carl and grabs a chair. He sits facing Carl. Someone gives him a mic. Nick waves. Carl takes a sharp breath. He presses the mic against Carl's nose. Terrance lowers the mic and edges closer to Carl, who inches backwards. He hits Carl with the mic. Carl furrows his brow. Transfixed, Carl stares at him. Terrance stands and yanks him up. Terrance throws Carl down. Nick catches him. His eyes bulging, Terrance raises his arms in the air victoriously. He strides back down the aisle towards the stage. Carl laughs and cries alternately. He claps with the rest of the crowd. Terrance stands on the stage and raises his arms. Some of the audience stand. Nick puts his fingers in his mouth to whistle. Carl and Nick amble along outside the conference venue. A guy smiles at Carl. Carl grins and Nick heads off. Carl frowns. Carl and the vagrant guy get into Carl's car. By the door. Carl stares ahead pensively. He takes his phone out and hands it to the guy. Nick gives Carl the thumbs up and slams the car door shut. The vagrant dials on Carl's phone. They drive up a dark road into Elysian Park. The guy's on Carl's phone. Carl smiles wryly. He pulls up beside some trees. Carl takes his phone back. His brow creased, Carl reaches into his pocket. He smiles. He pulls out some bank notes. He offers the guy all his money. The guy has to yank it out of Carl's hand. Carl smiles and waggles his finger. The guy jogs off and dives through a hedge at the side of the road. Carl nods pensively, then reverses his car. He turns the car around. It splutters and stalls. Carl's walking. Carl jogs along a dark road through the park. Carrying a jerrycan, he reaches a garage. He glances over at the garage shop, which is closed. He saunters over to a pump and swipes a card in it. He takes it out and rubs it on his arm agitatedly. He swipes again. It asks if he wants credit. A scooter careers down the road and turns into the garage. Carl turns to look at the pretty dark-haired woman on the scooter. She gets off and undoes the strap on her blue helmet that has eyes painted on it.",
    "677": "Octavius covers his face while Spider-Man fires more webs. Spider-Man somersaults back, jumps to avoid the mechanical limbs, and limbos under a bridge. With two webs attached to two limbs, Octavius catapults Spider-Man towards a covered walkway. Spider-Man lands on Octavius and knocks him off the roof. Octavius uses one of the limbs to thrust Spider-Man into the train. Spider-Man crashes through a door, stops at the opposite one, spins around two poles, and tangles with Octavius, who struggles through and climbs up to the roof. Spider-Man turns to see why and presses himself to the side of the train to avoid an oncoming one. While it passes, he clambers out of the roof. Spider-Man spots a limb moving under the train and crawls down. The passengers find Spider-Man at one window and Octavius at the one opposite. Octavius punches Spider-Man, who falls onto the street below. Quick webs grab him out of the way of cars and up into the air. Spider-Man swings along beside the elevated track, bounds over high buildings, and flings himself down, shooting a web at Octavius and landing on him. Octavius gains the upper hand by clutching Spider-Man with two of his long metal limbs and smashing him into a train window. Spider-Man flails but manages to stick his feet to the side of the train. Octavius holds Spider-Man tightly in his arms, causing his head to smash through signs on the side of the track. As a train comes the other way, Octavius lets go, and the train hits Spider-Man. He swings gracefully with a long web. Seeing him come, Octavius pulls two passengers from the train and holds them up, tossing a woman at Spider-Man, who swoops down, catches her, and deposits her into a web safety net. Next, Octavius throws the man he's holding, and Spider-Man sweeps up the passenger before he hits the track, then places him in a web mat. Spider-Man punches the driver, and as he lands behind Octavius, a limb pushes a lever, causing the train to pick up speed, sending the passengers whining. Octavius tosses the lever to Spider-Man and leaps off the train. Spider-Man heads for the front, where a further explosion burns his mask, which he peels off. Blinking to clear his eyes, he realizes the train is hurdling through the city towards the end of the line. The unmasked Spider-Man leaps down onto the track, raises himself against the train, and uses his feet to shove against the sleepers in an attempt to decelerate. He jumps back onto the train, clutching his right knee as it continues its relentless surge through the city. Spider-Man leaps anxiously from side to side, then shoots webs right and left.",
    "277": "At this moment, his attention is drawn to something across the way. While Jeff is continuing his phone conversation, we see the object of his look. He looks up, expectantly. There is almost a touch of eagerness in his expression. Two pretty girls have appeared on the distant roof. They are smiling and talking, although we cannot hear their dialogue. Each wears a terrycloth robe. With their backs to the camera, they take off the robes, slipping them down over their shoulders slowly. Then they spread the robes in front of them, and lie down on the roof, and out of sight. They at least have all of Jeff's attention. Jeff seems a little disappointed. Jeff's eyes become set upon something else in the neighborhood he sees. Jeff's attention is now drawn to another feature of his backyard entertainment. Jeff asks, eagerly and alertly. She gracefully moves across the room to the rhythm of the music and dance, toward the ice box. The camera is now focused on the window of the small building where we earlier saw the girl behind the oscillating fan. Loud ballet music is pouring from her open window. She begins the first graceful movement of a modern ballet interpretation. With her feet still moving, she throws open the door, and then rhythmically moving back to the center of the room, gnaws the chicken bone, occasionally waving it in the air as part of the choreography. She now twirls over toward a table at the other side of the room on which is an open package of bread slices, some butter nearby. The girl, now dressed in dark and revealing leotard, and ballet slippers, has just turned away from a portable record player. With swaying body, she puts down the chicken leg, and gracefully and rhythmically butters a slice of bread. She picks up both bread and chicken leg and continues her interpretive dance, alternately munching the bread and butter and chicken leg. Jeff's eyes drop from the ballet dancer's room to the one underneath. She looks up in the direction of the music and in a calm routine fashion adjusts the volume of her hearing aid. She is a faded, refined type. It is a simple, but broken, melody as if someone was just learning to play the piano, or carefully composing a song. At this moment we hear the sounds of a piano playing. Jefferies glances out across to the other apartments as he sees. It irritates Jeff as he looks in the direction of the new music. On the second floor, a man has entered the living room from a hallway door. We see a three-storied, flat-roofed apartment house. He carries a large aluminum sample case common to salesmen.",
    "120": "Phyllis' shot did hit Neff, and he realizes this as he looks at the blood on his fingers with a dazed expression. He quickly leaves the room the way he came and exits the house, closing the front door with his right hand while his left arm hangs limp. Neff takes a few steps down the walk before hearing someone approaching, prompting him to move behind a nearby palm tree. A man, Zachetti, comes up the steps towards the front door, but Neff calls to him, causing Zachetti to turn and approach slowly. Neff then takes some loose change out of his pocket and tries to drop a nickel into Zachetti's handkerchief pocket, but Zachetti knocks his hand away and just stares at him. Neff attempts again to put the nickel into his pocket, and this time, Zachetti allows him to do so before going slowly past Neff. Neff then grabs Zachetti and pushes him almost violently down the walk, watching as Zachetti goes out of shot and the sound of his steps fades away. Neff then moves through the shrubbery toward the side of the house where his car is parked. Meanwhile, the desk lamp remains lit while the dawn breaks outside the windows. Neff, still clutching the horn of the dictaphone, is very weak, and his voice is filled with exhaustion. He suddenly stops his dictation, sensing he is not alone in the room, and as he turns in his chair, the camera pulls back to reveal the office door wide open. Keyes stands a few steps inside, with the night watchman and the colored janitor peering curiously over Keyes’ shoulder. Keyes slowly, without taking his eyes off Neff's face, reaches back and shuts the door. Neff hangs up the dictaphone horn and looks at Keyes with a faint, tired grin, speaking very slowly. Keyes moves a few steps closer, staring at Neff without responding. Neff indicates the used cylinders on the desk, and they stare at each other for a long moment. With immense effort, Neff stands up, swaying slightly, his face covered in sweat and his shoulder bleeding. He is on the verge of collapse but manages to stagger towards the door, holding himself upright with great effort. Upon reaching the door, he twists the knob and drags it open, then turns to look back at Keyes' implacable face.",
    "20": "Leslie is telling the story of the traumatic audition which may have turned her life. As they pass Melvin, she does not break stride nor give him notice, though she is aware of him -- resentfully so -- hard not to be since he is giving a moment-to-moment commentary on her every action. Melvin stops, and she passes behind him to deliver an uncharacteristic rabbit punch. Melvin just looks at her. She exits. The greenhouse studio is a busy sanctuary as Simon puts the finishing touches on his painting of Vincent. Vincent quickly and expertly picks a CD to meet his immediate needs and puts it on, dying a little at every second of silence during the transition; he gestures Vincent to take it down. A beat and then a strange figure crosses between the CAMERA and the scene, gone before we can examine him further, where it is not clear that a robbery is in progress—Vincent's two friends from the street sweep all objects into large sacks—one of them, Doug, pauses to look past the terrace to the studio. And he uses the hat rack first as a spear, then as a club, as the brief savage attack begins. The three attackers leave, and Vincent starts to go toward Simon and then scurries back in fear. A single BARK from VERDELL. A mass of OFFICIAL PEOPLE clutter the hall as a gurney is whisked down to the elevator. Melvin is standing against the wall near his door, and a cop, RAY, is interviewing him. Frank stands upset, anxious, holding a dog bowl, a leash, and VERDELL, who is more upset, making pathetic little CRYING. As we FOCUS BRIEFLY ON Verdell, Frank is talking to the Sweet-Faced Woman. A short laugh makes us realize that Melvin has witnessed and enjoyed Frank's hostile mutterings. VERDELL starts WHIMPERING as a pissed Frank approaches his mugger. Frank pushes open the door to Melvin's apartment and places Verdell inside. We STAY with the dog during the O.S. VERDELL STOPS—gives Melvin wide berth—slinking along the far wall. Melvin finds Verdell's fear of him a bit calming. Melvin breaks two eggs over a large pile of prime chopped meat, sticks raw pieces of bacon into it, and exits the room. Ignoring Verdell, he sits at the piano and hits one key repeatedly, his recent past making him suspect this feast is a trick. Verdell looks over with surprise and pleasure. Verdell shifts his body so he is eating from the bowl with his tail to Melvin. Frank is on the phone. As Jackie enters, he turns toward her. Simon's face is something of a horror, and the sight is a jolt.",
    "1227": "The scene fades to black. In the garden, rain bounces off the abandoned dinner table where droplets plop into half-empty glasses of white wine. A candle flame flickers in a struggle to stay alight. Emily and Tim lie in each other's arms in bed. They caress each other's faces. She stares into his eyes. Tim strokes her arm as he stares into her adoring eyes. Emily plays gently with his ear, then lowers her eyes and lightly touches his lips with her fingertips. Emily stares at him earnestly. Emily looks tearful and puts her lips to his shoulder. A large tear rolls down Emily's nose. Tim hugs her to him. She buries her face in his chest. They kiss. The pulse in Emily's neck jumps rhythmically. Golden light bathes her face as she lies sleeping peacefully. Tim lies beside Emily, watching her closely. Emily's hand rests palm-up on the empty pillow beside her. She twitches slightly but doesn't wake. The scar on the upper part of her left breast shows just above the sheet. Tim, now dressed in his jeans, stands at her bedside and pulls on his polo shirt. Looking troubled, he stares down at Emily. Tim leaves the house by the French windows. He sets off slowly across the dark garden in the pouring rain, then jogs to the picket fence. He jumps over it. Tim runs frantically down a street of shops, some of which have neon-lit signs. Soaked to the skin, Tim bursts into a hospital corridor and strides down it to the nurses' station. The nurse eyes Tim warily. Looking fraught and agitated, Tim turns away from the nurses' station, paces a little and sits down on a chair beside a water cooler. He stares at the floor. Tim looks up when Dr. Briar enters the corridor and walks to meet her. She looks alarmed. Tim raises a hand helplessly, marches back along the corridor and pushes through the double doors. The hospital's main doors slide open. Tim walks out into the night. The rain cascades as a grief-stricken Tim strides away from the hospital. As he walks, he takes his mobile phone from his jeans' pocket and taps in a number. Dan and Michelle lie asleep in each other's arms. Dan reaches for the phone on his bedside cabinet. Tim rings off. Dan, now sitting up in bed, remains with the phone to his ear and drops his head. Tim returns to his motel room and pauses in the doorway. His expression is slightly glazed, as if consumed by his own sad thoughts. He turns and stares outside, then closes the door. Tim sits on the edge of his bed, panting. Regaining his composure slightly, Tim reaches for the phone on his bedside cabinet and makes a call.",
    "278": "He quickly turns his wheelchair around to the window until he is in profile. The salesman, having just raised the shades in the living room, is now looking out the window. His eyes move closer toward Jeff's apartment. Jeff in his chair, facing the window, Stella beside him. Jeff nearly knocks the startled Stella off her feet with his arm. He propels his chair backward quickly, and Stella moves to the side with surprising agility. They are both in shadow. Jeff keeps his eyes trained on the window. The salesman completes his searching glance at the neighborhood. Then something directly below his window catches his attention. He looks sharply downward, his body visibly tensing. Jeff, with a restraining hand to Stella, begins to edge his chair cautiously forward so that he can see what the salesman is looking at. The camera pans down, and we now see that the old lady with the hearing aid is leaning over the fence admonishing the dog. The salesman leans forward and grips the window sill as he watches the dog. The camera moves forward, and as it reaches the edge of the window, pans down and shows us what the salesman is looking at. The little dog that was lowered in the basket is sniffing at the salesman's personal flower bed. Jeff's eyes move up quickly to look at the salesman. We can faintly hear her voice saying something to the effect that he'll get into trouble. The old lady is wearing a faded house-robe. The dog turns to glance at her and, apparently taking heed, moves away. Jeff is amused at the dog incident. Behind him, Stella moves to the center of the room, saying. She begins putting her equipment back into her black bag. Jeff's eyes lift to the salesman's apartment, and the amusement drains from his face. He is carefully wiping out the interior with a dust cloth. The salesman has his aluminum case on the table near the center of the room. Jeff continues to watch the salesman, his face showing a great concentration of thought. Jeff watching intently. Stella picks up her bag, stares at Jeff's back a moment, then starts for the door. Jeff swings halfway around in his chair just as Stella reaches the top of the steps. She turns around. Jeff points to a coat-stand near the door. She puts down her bag, reaches for the binoculars, takes them out of the case. She comes down the stairs, brings them to him. Stella sniffs, then goes to the door, as she says. As Stella goes out the door, the camera moves in until Jeff's head and the binoculars are filling the screen. He immediately swings to the window and lifts them to his eyes.",
    "215": "The ranks of hooded men, chanting in a high hillbilly wail, intersect and shuffle like a marching band at halftime. At length, they stop in perfect formation, still chanting, to face the Imperial Wizard, who stands in front of the burning cross dressed in a red satin robe and hood trimmed with gold. An aisle leads through the middle of the formation to the burning cross, before which a gibbet has been erected. The backmost row has stopped, facing away, only a few yards from the bushes that hide Delmar, Pete, and Everett. As the chanting continues, two Klansmen lead a black man, whom they grasp by either arm, up the aisle toward the gibbet. It is indeed Tommy Johnson. Over in the bushes, Everett, Delmar, and Pete are straightening up and adjusting their appropriated robes and hoods, having disposed of the color guard. A huge roar - and now the ranks resume their chanting. The color guard hustles up the aisle to draw up behind the two men leading Tommy to the gibbet. Everett hisses. Tommy looks back over his shoulder. Everett is oblivious to the big man approaching from behind. Whoosh - arriving Big Dan whips the hood from Everett's head. Everett is exposed - in blackface. The chanting abruptly stops. The crowd is stunned. Big Dan whips off the other two hoods - Delmar and Pete, in blackface. Everett, Pete, Tommy, and Delmar, bearing the Confederate flag, are retreating across the neutral ground separating the mob of Klansmen from the burning cross. The mob pursues in full cry. When the intruders reach the foot of the cross, Delmar turns. He javelins the flagpole up and out toward the pursuing crowd. Homer Stokes is mortified. The crowd gasps and watches, heads tilted back, in silence. The only sound is the fluttering flag. Homer Stokes' eyes rise, hesitate and start to fall as the flag reaches its zenith and starts to descend. We boom down with the hurtling flag toward a sea of upturned white hoods. Dead in the middle is bareheaded Dan Teague. His arms are tensed out at his sides like a waiting kick-off returner. He squints up with his one good eye, judging distance and trajectory. From somewhere, we hear a loud BOINK, as of a wire popping. The flag flutters. The crowd is silent. Big Dan sets and WHAP! He snaps his hands up and together. He has caught the flagpole. The flag has not touched the ground. The crowd cheers. Big Dan looks around, beaming acknowledgement of the cheers. From somewhere, another BOINK. As Big Dan's look reaches front again, his smile fades. His eye tracks up - up - CREEEEEEK! The fiery cross is twisting and starting to fall.",
    "1301": "Graham stares at his view of the floor, sensing that something is wrong. He then looks at his family huddled on the couch and absorbs the news as he moves to the stairs, taking a seat on the second to last step, partially obscured by the balusters. The words hang in the air as Graham sits quietly, and suddenly all four family members put their hands in the air before lowering them and sitting in silence. Merrill stands and leans against the wall while everyone sits quietly for a moment; he glances at Graham, who turns and looks at Merrill, and they exchange a silent conversation. The sink is piled with pots and pans, as if every utensil and dish in the kitchen had been used, and one side of the dining room is lined with windows that have been boarded up. The table is set, and the Hess family sits around it. Morgan's face is hard, but tears still fall. Graham watches his children cry at the table, then takes big scoops of every dish onto his plate, digs his fork into it, and eats. He swallows and then Merrill furiously nails boards to the children's bedroom door while the master bedroom door is open with a board leaning next to it, and Graham is in his bedroom. Graham walks to the window, looks out onto his backyard at the crops stretching into the darkness, moves closer to the glass, watches the corn stalks sway with the wind, and backs away toward the middle of the room. He turns to see Merrill with the last board in the hall, moves out, shuts the bedroom door, and Merrill starts hammering the board into the frame. Graham picks up his hammer to join in, glancing to his right at Bo and Morgan standing together at the top of the stairs, Bo holding Morgan's hand. Graham continues hammering as he speaks, then stops while Merrill finishes. Graham smiles at the memory, looks at his daughter, brushes her hair aside as Merrill lifts Morgan, and all four turn to look at the three boarded-up bedroom doors before Merrill puts down Morgan.",
    "1114": "Harry runs down a gloomy brick tunnel, disturbing rats that scuttle from under his feet. Rounding a corner, he finds the tunnel blocked by an iron gate and desperately shakes it, but it is firmly fixed. He turns to see a serpent appearing behind him, blocking the tunnel's tract. Harry backs against the gate as the gigantic mouth of the serpent opens, with dripping poisonous fangs inches from his face. His fingers find a loose piece of stone, and he throws it back along the tunnel. The distracted serpent draws back, withdrawing its head, then glides backwards and makes its way down a different tunnel. Harry follows it cautiously, watching as it slips away and disappears altogether. He breathes a sigh of relief, then quickly runs out of the dank tunnel and back to the main chamber, where he finds Tom Riddle standing next to the unconscious Ginny. Harry kneels beside her, and the serpent rises up behind him. Something glows inside the Sorting Hat—a silver sword. Harry grabs it, waiting as the serpent moves across the stone floor towards him and starts to climb. The serpent uncoils its massive body out of the water, lifting its head towards him. Balancing on an edge, Harry lashes out with the sword, keeping the creature at bay. It smashes its head blindly against the stone carving, and Harry almost loses his grip. As it continues to smash against the stone, chunks of stone fall into the water below, causing Harry to cling with one hand. He regains his footing and climbs higher, standing on the very top of the curved head. Swinging the sword wildly, Harry lands a lucky blow as the serpent aims for the sound of the slashing sword. However, Harry loses balance and drops the sword, making a grab for it as it slips over the curved stone surface. The serpent lunges, and Harry thrusts the sword up towards the loop of its escaping mouth, but a huge poisonous fang breaks off and buries itself in his arm. He quickly pulls it out as the serpent writhes in agony and ultimately crashes lifelessly to the ground. Tom Riddle stares in disbelief at the dead serpent, then looks up and narrows his eyes as Harry staggers towards him, holding the bloody sword in one hand and the poisonous fang in the other. Wincing with pain, Harry clutches the wound on his arm, takes a few steps more, and collapses to the ground after dropping the sword.",
    "1327": "He shifts his gaze up the highway to the north where dark clouds are pushing their way over the distant mountains, signaling a coming storm. Bob reenters the diner to find Kyle at the counter with banana pancakes. Kyle is about to speak to Bob again when Bob's attention is stolen elsewhere. The image flickers on the TV but doesn't improve until Bob gives it a final wallop, and the picture snaps into focus on the stark graphic of the Emergency Broadcasting System, accompanied by its hollow tone, filling the diner. Everyone stops and looks at the TV. Bob switches channels, but they are all the same, leading him to step off the chair and back away as if distance will help. He bumps into Kyle, who hustles past Percy, and Charlie clears dishes at the Anderson's table, while all eyes remain on the TV. Kyle, stewing, picks up the phone to redial, and everyone looks at Howard. Kyle reappears in the diner as Jeep works under a Uhaul's hood outside. An old lady turns to the Andersons as a fly begins to buzz around Gladys's head, smiling strangely. Sandra, unsure of what to make of the response, nods at the old woman as the fly crawls across her cheek without her reacting. Howard and Sandra exchange looks as the door jingles and Jeep enters to have a quiet huddle with Bob, keeping one eye on the old lady near the Andersons. Across the diner, Charlie places a bloody red steak in front of Gladys, resting a hand on her belly. A fly lands on the steak, and Charlie tries to wave it away, but another fly lands in its place, causing Charlie to freeze. Kyle glances over from the counter as Charlie shakes her head at Gladys, slaps the check down on the table, and walks to the kitchen, passing Jeep and Bob. Gladys begins to innocently laugh as she continues eating her meat while flies swarm suddenly, shocking Sandra and Howard as they wonder how so many got in. Sandra covers her mouth, and everyone's focus shifts to the old lady. Howard gets up, and everybody freaks when he crumbles to the floor. Gladys rockets to her feet, knocking her table over with blood covering her face and chest. Percy reacts first, hurling a heavy metal frying pan from behind the counter that knocks Gladys's head sideways.",
    "478": "Salieri enters the private quarters of Amadeus and moves slowly into the 'holy of holies,' picking up objects with great reverence - a billiard ball, a discarded wig, a sock, and a buckle - then objects more important to him. Standing at Mozart’s desk, strewn with manuscripts, he picks up Mozart’s pen and strokes the feather, touches the inkstand, and stealthily picks them up. Close-up on the pages, then another page - the title page - written in Mozart’s hand. Close-up on Salieri, who stares amazed. They all sit, save Mozart, as the room suddenly looks like a tribunal with all eyes on the Emperor. Joseph nods, and Mozart falls to his knees, giggling. Mozart sits on stage at a harpsichord rehearsing the singers taking the parts of Figaro and Susanna in the opening bars of the first act of The Marriage of Figaro, as Figaro measures the space for his bed on the floor, singing, with Susanna looking on, trying on the Countess’ hat. Orsini-Rosenberg and Bonno sit with Salieri, and the company disperses, curious. The musicians look at Orsini-Rosenberg, to whom Mozart hands the score from which he is conducting. Mozart then rips out a page, and Bonno watches in terror as he goes on tearing the pages determinedly. A servant opens the door to announce, and Mozart grabs Salieri, kisses his hand, and giggles with relief and gratitude. The Emperor stealthily enters with Von Strack, his finger to his lips, motions everyone not to rise, and slips into a chair behind Salieri, Orsini-Rosenberg, and Bonno. The three conspirators look at each other wide-eyed. The recitativo summons up the march, but instead, there is silence, leaving everyone on stage looking lost, though they attempt to continue the story for a while. Consternation grows on the faces of the conspirators. Mozart glances back at the group seated in the theatre as the Emperor finally speaks in a whisper. Mozart strains to hear what they are saying but cannot, and we observe them. Orsini-Rosenberg acknowledges his defeat and rises to go down to where Mozart sits anxiously with the musicians, watching his approach. Close-up on Salieri in his box, tears on his cheeks as he watches the ensemble and listens for a long moment. He bows too, giggling, as Cavalieri, in a mythological Persian costume, bows to the rapturous throng below her, including Salieri. The Emperor, Von Strack, Orsini-Rosenberg, Bonno, and Von Swieten are seen applauding, then suddenly close-up on Mozart standing in a box and clapping wildly. Behind him, seated, are Schikaneder and the three girls previously seen in Mozart’s apartment. Close-up on Salieri staring fixedly at Mozart, with Mozart still clapping, apparently with tremendous enthusiasm, and Salieri bows his head.",
    "95": "He opens a box of chocolates and holds it out for the nurse, who shakes her head, a bit apprehensive about this strange man next to her. Forrest eats a chocolate as he looks down at the nurse's shoes, and the black woman stares at Forrest as he looks down at his own shoes. Forrest closes his eyes tightly, just as a little boy closes his eyes tightly; it is young Forrest as he sits in a doctor's office. Forrest has been fitted with orthopedic shoes and metal leg braces, and the doctor sets Forrest down on his feet. Forrest walks around stiffly as his mother, Mrs. Gump, watches him clank around the room awkwardly. Forrest walks foreground past the doctor and Mrs. Gump, and a loud thud is heard as, outside, Forrest falls. Mrs. Gump and young Forrest walk across the street with Forrest walking stiffly next to his mother. A black and white photo of General Nathan Bedford Forrest turns into live action as the General dons a hooded sheet over his head and is in full Ku Klux Klan garb, including his horse. The General rides off, followed by a large group of Klan members dressed in full uniform. Mrs. Gump and Forrest walk across the street, and Forrest stops suddenly as his brace gets stuck, caught in a gutter grate. Mrs. Gump bends down and tries to free Forrest while two old cronies sit in front of a barber shop and watch. Mrs. Gump and Forrest walk along the sidewalk past the two old men, with Mrs. Gump holding tightly onto Forrest's hand, and they walk along a dirt road where a row of mailboxes stands to the left before walking along the Gump Boarding House driveway. Mrs. Gump leads Forrest to the porch and bends down to look him in the eye. The principal sighs and then stands up as Forrest sits outside the principal's office and waits. The principal stands in front of Mrs. Gump while Forrest, sitting left, listens and sits outside the principal's office. Loud organic male grunts are heard coming from inside the house as Forrest sits on a swing outside. Forrest sits on the swing as the grunts continue, and the principal steps out of the Gump House, wiping sweat from his face. Forrest is sitting on the porch, and the principal wipes the sweat from his neck, then looks back at Forrest, who grunts, imitating him. Embarrassed, the principal turns and walks away. Forrest lies down on his bed and looks up, as a cab driver closes the trunk of the car while two women walk toward the house. A milkman steps down from the porch, and a man with a cane steps to the left across the hall.",
    "989": "Benjamin turns the ship's wheel while Mike grips a cigar between his teeth. Grinning, Mike takes the helm and sharply steers the boat left. Later, Mike and Benjamin stand at the bar in a shady watering hole, where Mike sips his liquor. He removes his shirt to reveal tattoos over his torso, strikes a boxing pose showing off the tattoos, and kisses his tattooed bicep. Mike grins at Benjamin just as a bevy of prostitutes gathers on the stairs, and a beautiful woman steps forward. They climb the stairs, and the woman emerges wearily from beneath the rapidly moving covers under the sheets, after which he leaves. Benjamin then trots down the stairs and out through the back door, past two scantily clad hookers, disappearing into a crowded back alley. His father, Thomas, leaves a hooker outside an adjacent building and spots Benjamin. Thomas's motorcar pulls up beside Benjamin as he strolls down a rain-washed street. Thomas, sporting a neat mustache, opens a door to Benjamin, who climbs in, and the car pulls away as Thomas turns to regard his son and smiles. A waiter addresses them while Thomas and Benjamin sit at a table. Two whiskeys are served, and Thomas looks away as they clink glasses, smiling wryly as Benjamin sputters on the whiskey. Later, as the bar staff are clearing up, Thomas raises his glass, coughs his whiskey, and grimaces, while Benjamin slugs his whiskey. Thomas then delivers Benjamin to his front gate, where he raises his fedora and teeters towards the front door. Benjamin staggers through the darkened hallway, where Queenie stands with her arms folded, and he spasms and vomits. Daisy, now about nine years old, is woken very early by Benjamin tiptoeing into her room. She nods, joins Benjamin outside in the early morning light, and Benjamin sprints on ahead of Daisy. They arrive at Captain Mike's tugboat, where the tattooed mariner lies in a deep, alcohol-induced slumber. Mike eventually comes round, and Benjamin shakes his head while Mike eyes Daisy. Mike rubs his bare, tattooed chest, sits up, and shoves a cigar in his mouth as the tug makes its way along the river through thick fog. Benjamin and Daisy stand at the prow, looking out, and Benjamin, wearing a woolen hat, glances back at Daisy. In the wheelhouse, Mike sips coffee from an enamel mug, peers through the window, and sees an ocean liner passing the other way. Daisy and Benjamin climb the steps up to the wheelhouse, Daisy waves to the larger vessel, and she and Benjamin share a smile. In the hospital, Caroline turns to Daisy, who stares towards the window as lightning flashes outside. Caroline sits down with the diary and reads. Benjamin stares at himself in the mirror, then at Mrs. Maple, who sits motionless in a chair with her head resting against the seat back, her eyes dull and her mouth slightly open.",
    "746": "At the Holbrooks', Hilly with her hair in curling clips is scowling at the newspaper. Her eyes shoot up at Yule Mae who is clearing away some dishes. Yule Mae goes towards the kitchen, then stops and puts the plates back down. William and Hilly both lower their newspapers. William glances at his watch. He pecks his wife on the cheek and goes. Yule Mae picks up the plates. With a supercilious smile, Hilly picks up her paper. Chubby-faced Sugar who towers above Minnie listens obediently. Sugar gets on the bus leaving Minnie behind. Minnie gets on another bus. He deposits her outside a set of gates and a long drive beyond. Minnie walks up the drive towards an imposing white painted mansion. Celia bursts barefoot through the door with a cheery wave. Minnie walks towards her. Long and slender Celia puts on her stilettos in the hall. Minnie points to a mark on Celia's cheek. She drags Minnie into the state-of-the-art kitchen. Minnie looks at the messy kitchen table. Celia coyly touches her slender waist. Minnie shrugs a yes. Celia hugs her. She ushers Minnie into the house, swigging from a bottle of cola. Celia sinks down on a chair like a naughty child. She swigs some more Coke. At the Holbrooks', Hilly is addressing a meeting of the junior league. Skeeter is sitting near the back. Hilly dismisses Mary Beth with a wave of her hand. Skeeter sits back down with a blind smile. Later, Skeeter pulls up outside Brent's Drug Store Diner and hurries in carrying her briefcase. Elizabeth and Hilly are already sitting in a booth. With a knowing smile, Hilly commands Elizabeth to budge up. Elizabeth slides a milkshake in front of Skeeter. Hilly's face softens. Hilly and Elizabeth smile conspiratorially. Skeeter gives Hilly a long look. She forces a smile at Elizabeth's enthusiasm. At Hilly's the front lawn is being mowed and Yule Mae is hoovering. She goes to move the sofa away from the wall. Spotting something she reaches down. It's a ring. She looks about her catching her breath and slips it into the pocket of her white apron. At Elizabeth's, Aibileen lays Mae Mobley down to change her nappy. As she unpins the nappy, her face stiffens with displeasure. In her kitchen, she sits facing Skeeter. She fixes Skeeter with a determined expression. Minnie barges in. Seeing Skeeter she puts her hands on her ample hips. Outside she starts to stride away from Aibileen's house, then stops and walks right back inside. Skeeter obediently moves back her chair. Skeeter gawks nervously as Minnie heaves her full round hips onto the table and folds her arms. Skeeter whips off her specs.",
    "384": "The Dude is hurled against the chief's desk, which he bounces off of, to come to rest more or less seated in a facing chair. His wallet is tossed onto the desk. The chief leans forward, takes the wallet, and sorts through it with disgusted incredulity, looking at the Ralph's Shopper's Club card. The Dude stares. The Chief hurls his steaming mug of coffee at the Dude, hitting him in the forehead with a thud, and the scalding coffee splashes everywhere. The Chief is already up off his chair, rounding the desk. He kicks the chair out from under the Dude, and then starts kicking at him. The Dude, in the back seat of a taxicab that rocks and squeaks with every bump, is gingerly touching sore spots on his face and scalp. The back of the driver, a large black man with rasta dreds under a knit cap, is visible. The place is a wreck. Furniture has been overturned, upholstery slashed, drawers dumped. Quiet ensues. Maude emerges from the bedroom wearing a bathrobe. She pulls open the bathrobe as she approaches, and the Dude is stupefied. A match is dragged across a headboard; the Dude is lighting himself a joint. He climbs out of bed, but Maude remains in it. She wedges a pillow into the small of her back and clasps a hand on each kneecap, pulling her knees in toward her chest to keep her pelvis raised. He picks a White Russian off the bedside table and spits some. The Dude is staring off into space, thinking. The Dude is leaving the bedroom. The man nervously complies, and the Dude flinches at the man's movement as he gets out. The man cringes, reacting to the Dude's flinch. He is wearing a cheap blue serge suit, is bald with a short fringe, and has a mustache. The Dude shouts to cover his fear and is stunned as he fumbles in his wallet. The Dude looks at the picture, which is probably a school portrait, unmistakably Bunny, but fresh-faced, much younger looking, with a corn-fed smile and straight Partridge Family hair and bangs. He is holding out another picture of a bleak farmhouse and silo, the only features on a flat snow-swept landscape, and hands back the picture. The Dude steps out to meet Walter's car as it pulls up, its passenger window open and the pomeranian leaning out and yapping. Four people sit at a booth: Dieter, Kieffer, Franz, all in black leather, and a young woman with long stringy blonde hair, wearing torn and patched jeans and a ribbed sleeveless tee-shirt, worn thin with age. A waitress enters with a checkpad and pen.",
    "678": "Spider-Man attaches two webs to buildings on either side of the track, but the web breaks, causing him to fall forward. As the train hurtles towards the river, Spider-Man fires webs at buildings, and a block of web shoots out. Spider-Man takes the strain, and although it rips his costume in several places, he uses the webs to restrain the train's forward thrust. His features are contorted as some of the webs start to break. The train approaches the buffers, crashes through them, and careens forward to the edge, with the first carriage teetering over. Spider-Man stands glued to the front, holding the webs attached to the buildings. The train grinds to a halt, and Spider-Man's eyes close as he releases the web and slumps forward. Hands prevent him from falling, and the passengers lift the unconscious, unmasked Spider-Man into the carriage. His head falls back as he's passed along over people's heads until he's gently lowered to the floor. His face visible, the passengers stare at him. As the kid's eyes open and his gloved hands touch his face, a worried look shows as he realizes he is without a mask. He sits up as a passenger crouches down, looks around, and two boys step forward. The younger one stretches out his hand with Spider-Man's mask, which Peter takes. Through tear-filled eyes, Peter gazes at the boys, then lowers his head, and slips on the mask to become Spider-Man again. He sits up straight, struggles to rise, and is helped to his feet by more hands that steady him. The door behind Spider-Man clatters in as Octavius climbs on board, facing him. A passenger steps forward, followed by others who step between Spider-Man and Octavius. Octavius simply smiles and sweeps them aside using two of his limbs, leaving a clear path to Spider-Man. Spider-Man gestures to those around him and staggers forward, but a punch from a mechanical limb sends him to the floor, where he lies helpless. Meanwhile, an electric storm hovers over the Osborn home, and inside, Harry drinks. He turns to see Octavius holding Spider-Man above his head. Harry points to the couch, where he had seen Spider-Man stand over his dead father, and Octavius lays the bound figure down.",
    "456": "He lays Westley down across a bench by the fireplace, picks Westley's arm up, and lets it drop limp. He studies Westley a moment, checking here, checking there. He goes to get a huge bellows. Inigo does. Max inserts the bellows in Westley's mouth and starts to pump. He stops pumping. And he presses lightly on Westley's chest. And as Valerie shrieks excitedly we. It is somewhat smaller than a tennis ball. Pull back to reveal Max and Valerie, exhausted, looking at the lump with beautific pleasure, as Valerie, cooking utensil in hand, covers the thing with what looks like chocolate. Inigo and Fezzik stare at the thing too, but more dubiously. Inigo accepts the pill as Fezzik takes Westley, who is stiff as a board now. During this, Fezzik, using all his strength, has managed to get Westley into a right-angled sitting position, while Inigo brings out the miracle pill. Pill in hand, he drops it into Westley's mouth. Inigo and Fezzik react. Westley is the only one not amazed. He sits there, immobile, like a ventriloquist's dummy. He is watching his fingers, one of which twitches now. Fezzik helps Inigo raise Westley just high enough so he can see for himself. Westley, absolutely stunned. He shakes his head from side to side. Inigo and Fezzik do. They move along the wall in silence for a time. Then these words come to us on the wind. Buttercup, in her bridal gown, and she's incredible. The Prince, fastening a pearl necklace around her. Buttercup, and she couldn't seem more serene. Westley and Inigo and Fezzik, looking out at the enemy. This is it. Inigo and Fezzik shake hands. Westley can't even do that, but after a bit of rocking back and forth, he manages to get enough momentum to catapult his arm over and onto his friend's. The most intelligent-looking, the most impressive appearing clergyman imaginable. Buttercup and Humperdinck kneel before the Clergyman. Behind them sit the mumbling old King and Queen. Standing in the back is Count Rugen. Four guards are in position flanking the chapel door. He has an impediment that would stop a clock. The Brutes and Yellin, by the gate, for it is indeed they who are making the commotion, frightened, pointing. And it is a bit unnerving--a giant seems to be floating toward them out of the darkness, a giant in a strange cloak, and with a voice that would crumble walls. And he seems to be floating because he's standing in the wheelbarrow, as Inigo, hidden behind him, busts a gut by pushing it and supporting Westley. Yellin, keeping the Brutes in position, or trying to, shouting orders, instructions and as yet the Brutes hold.",
    "423": "Findley spots Bert, takes a long drag on his cigarette, and saunters toward them. Bert points to Eddie and snaps his fingers, pretending to forget Findley's name; he nods to them all and leaves. Sarah gives Bert a look. The camera tilts upward from a Dixieland combo blaring out a bouncy tune to find Sarah descending the stairs, looking on at the party below. Holding the rail with one hand, and a champagne glass in the other, she maneuvers her way down the steps. She stops a waitress on the way upstairs and exchanges her glass for a new one. We follow her unsteady, doll-like descent as she moves slowly, dreamily past the combo, past Eddie, who is cornered by a chic blonde in a low-cut dress, and past Findley, alone with his drink, observing his guests; she continues past the bleary-eyed couples on the dance floor, until she comes to the bar. Bert is there too, his head bobbing to the Dixie beat, his eyes running over her body so plainly covered by a cotton print dress. Spinning away from him, she takes her glass and goes to a corner of the room. Bert walks casually to her side, leans over, and whispers something in her ear. Her face hardens, and angrily she turns and throws her champagne in his face and smashes her glass on the floor. She starts to cry and starts to fall, but Bert holds her up by the shoulders. The music stops, and the dance couples strain to get a look at what has happened. Eddie shoves through the gawking crowd, tries to take her in his arms, but she beats on his chest, sobbing, unable to make words. Eddie drags her limp, trembling body across the dance floor to the stairs while Bert watches them go, wiping the champagne off his coat lapels. The music starts up again. A Negro maid sits patiently in the room, watching over Sarah and the coats that Sarah is lying on. A woman enters and, disgusted, pushes Sarah off her fur coat. Eddie appears in the doorway, and the woman takes her coat and leaves. Eddie looks at Sarah for a moment, then turns and walks out. Findley, drink and cork-tipped cigarette in hand, escorts Bert and Eddie down the stairs to his game room. It is a beautifully appointed salon, wood-paneled, filled with plush divans and decorated with terra cotta Roman statuary. In the center of the room is the billiard table, now covered by a cloth. Findley goes to the bar, Eddie eagerly pulls back the cloth that covers the table, but it's not a pool table -- it's a billiard table. Eddie finishes uncovering the table.",
    "996": "Myrtle lands dead in the road with a gash in her chest, and Daisy and Gatsby drive on. The other driver gets out and stares at the scene, while the eyes on the ragged billboard for the oculist, Dr. T.J. Eckleburg, stare blankly in the darkness. Tom drives up with Nick and Jordan, and later, police have arrived. They get out and walk towards Wilson's garage, where a crowd has gathered. Tom sees a bereft Wilson and frowns with concern as policemen hold the crowd back. One of them lays a sheet over Myrtle's body, which lies on a table, and Tom steps closer. He reaches out and pulls the sheet back, revealing Myrtle's blood-spattered corpse, gasping as Nick removes his cap. Tom just stares and holds his hand up to the cop, tearfully shaking his head and looking at Nick. Tom stands with his head bowed, restrains Wilson, and an old cop frowns dubiously before walking away. Wilson sits looking dazed, and Tom sits facing him, handing him a drink. Tom stares at him, and with tears rolling down his face, Wilson drinks and presses the glass against his face. Tom touches Wilson's face and lets Wilson rest his head against his shoulder, rubbing his back comfortingly. Nick covers Myrtle's body with the sheet, and Tom drives away with Jordan as they stare ahead, the shiny blue coupe heading down the dark road. They arrive at the Buchanan mansion, where servants come out, and Tom walks up to open the front door. Nick and Jordan stand on the porch as Tom studies Nick, who stares back, frowning. With a dismissive glance, Tom goes inside, and Nick glares at Jordan, who, shocked, marches into the house. Looking deeply troubled, his brow pinched, Nick turns and walks off and looks around incredulously, walking over to Gatsby, who's hiding behind a bush. Gatsby's face is suddenly bathed in light as lights come on in the house and the butler, Henri, comes out onto the porch, looks around but doesn't see anyone, and goes back inside. Nick stares at Gatsby gravely, and Gatsby glances up at the lights in the upstairs windows, then back at Nick. There is a flashback of Gatsby grabbing the wheel, and Gatsby and Daisy watch in horror as Myrtle slams against the windscreen and hurtles through the air. Daisy is in the driving seat. Recounting events, Gatsby looks distraught as Nick stares at him, wide-eyed. Gatsby turns away and sits, resting his face against his hand. Nick nods sharply and attempts a smile, surreptitiously walking around to the terrace, where he sees Tom and Daisy sitting at the dining table, talking. Daisy sits looking dazed as Tom moves closer and puts his arm around her.",
    "735": "He pulls Rose up. Three nearby sailors turn and run toward Jack. Rose grips the railing with her free hand as Jack holds her up and onto the poop deck as Jack wraps his arms around Rose's torso and lifts her back over the rail. Jack falls on top of Rose as she is spilled onto the deck. The sailors run up to them. One sailor glances at Jack and then at Rose's torn dress. Jack stands and places his hands into his trouser pockets. Later, Rose is wrapped in a blanket as men handcuffed Jack. Jack glances at wide-eyed Rose. Cal rubs Rose's arms. Cal strides back to Jack. Rose glances at Jack before leaving with Cal. Jack motions over Cal's brown-haired manservant. He steps up to Jack and holds out a cigarette case. Jack takes two cigarettes, placing one in his mouth and the other behind his left ear. Jack looks down at his unlaced boots. Jack looks down as the man walks off. In her berth, Rose sits at a vanity table and holds her silver hand mirror. She sets down the mirror as Cal opens the door. Cal opens a box containing the heart of the ocean. He fastens the necklace with a blue heart-shaped diamond on Rose. Rose strokes the necklace as she gazes at her own reflection on the vanity mirror. Cal kneels beside Rose. She stares at him. Cal smiles at the blank-faced Rose who blinks then turns and stares at her reflection. She places her right hand over the diamond. Daytime, Jack and Rose walk along in the upper deck. Rose holds out her engagement ring. Rose shakes Jack's hand up and down. She releases his hand and walks away. She stares at him with her mouth open. She snatches Jack's sketchbook. Jack sits beside Rose as she flips through his drawings. She studies a sketch of a woman breastfeeding an infant. She turns to a drawing of a nude woman lying on her side with a cigarette in her mouth. Another sketch depicts a nude woman standing against a ballet bar. Rose closes the sketchbook as another passenger walks past. Smiling, Rose turns to his sketch of a nude dark-haired woman lying with one arm stretched over her head. Another drawing of just a pair of hands. Rose looks down open-mouthed as Jack flips to another drawing. A fully-clothed middle-aged woman. Rose smiles at Jack. Her smile fades. In a dining room, Ruth sips tea with two other women. Ruth nods at Molly then strides off. Nearby mustached Ismay sits with the captain. Jack takes Rose's hand. He pulled her to a different section of the railing. Jack spits.",
    "773": "He reports into a walkie-talkie on the activity by the basin as Long-hair Charlie scarfs a pickle. Jackson sits in the passenger seat of an army jeep, the kids in the back, while soldiers crouch behind him. They arrive at a busy research facility where Jackson smooths back his black hair. In an office with Professor West, Adrienne talks to Satnam via the Internet and observes the great expression worn by Satnam and West. Mouth agape, Adrienne straightens away from the computer screen, then wide-eyed, she frowns while looking out the window and spotting Jackson knocking about with Lily and Noah. She watches as Jackson lifts up Lily and looks around furtively at West, who sits behind him. Satnam disconnects and turns to his wife Aponna, kneeling by his son, Ajeet. At Yellowstone, Charlie spies on Jackson and the kids as night falls. Adrienne climbs on board a helicopter, while in his darkened office at the White House, Anheuser hangs up the phone and looks out of the French windows. At the campsite in Yellowstone, Jackson watches the chopper fly overhead, bringing up Google Maps on his laptop to show Yellowstone. In the tent, Noah swats a bug, but Jackson spots him sending a text on a cell phone and takes it from him. Noah zips the door closed on Jackson, who sits back and reads the text. Jackson sits in his limo, typing on his laptop when he spots Charlie nearby broadcasting from an RV. Newspaper clippings surround Charlie, who has a beard darker than his long, straggly hair and looks around furtively, then leans in close. Jackson frowns dubiously, then nods calmly. Meanwhile, Gordon hugs Kate in a supermarket, and she smirks as a crack appears in the car park outside, rumbling beneath a car and approaching another. As it spreads in the supermarket, he finds something nearby and hands it to her at the checkout, where a customer's trolley rolls slowly away, and a crack appears on the floor. Cereal boxes shake as Kate reaches out for them, and a large crack tears through the floor between them. At Yellowstone, Lily scratches, and Noah looks gravely at Jackson. Anheuser follows Wilson into the White House situation room, while a well-dressed, middle-aged man approaches the boxer's corner of the ring as the fight begins. Sitting by a glamorous, young, blonde Tamara, Uri looks at his mobile and presses his thumb to the screen to confirm his identity. Uri looks up blankly, stands up, and leaves the arena, checking his watch as he goes, while Tamara stands and calls after him. Sultan spots Uri leaving, a massive hit on Sultan, and he runs to the canvas. Jackson drives the kids in the limo as they fall asleep in the back seat.",
    "836": "Diana plugs a flash drive into the credit card burner. On the records computer, Sandy logs into the network and opens the folder. In his office area, Ken stares off with a furrowed brow before sitting at his computer and logging into company records. Diana enters Cornish's information into a card burner and inserts a blank card. On Ken's computer, he sees Cornish's actual photo and quickly stands. The burner finishes processing and prints out the card, which Diana hands to Sandy, who eyes it. Ken swiftly moves through the offices, approaches the records room doors, inputs the code, and they slide open. As he quickly enters, Ken finds the room vacant and steps toward the computer with wide eyes. Meanwhile, Sandy and Diana exit the building through an unmarked alley door. Diana grabs the card, and they enter an upscale hotel lobby, approaching reception. In their silver sedan, Julian and Marisol speed across a bridge into St. Louis. As Diana follows Sandy into the luxury suite, her mouth falls open, and she grabs a grape from a fruit platter. Loosening his tie, Sandy enters a room, removes his suit coat, tosses it onto a chair, and flops back on the bed. In a frothy bubble bath, Diana blows a handful of suds, finishes off a large bottle of champagne, and lowers the gushing shower head beneath the frothy surface while Sandy sleeps in the same outstretched position. She slaps the side of the tub, and her foot jolts out of the water. Meanwhile, Trish speaks on her phone as Diana enters in a robe. In a salon, Diana gently applies lavender eye makeup to her eyelids. Three stylists watch as she moves around the sampling table, grabs a can of hair spray, shakes it, sniffs it, and sprays her hair. Leaning back and forth, Diana douses her entire mop of hair, shakes it around, and faces the mirror, surrounding her head in a cloud of hairspray. Looking up, she spots the giggling stylists who abruptly stop and look away. Diana blinks rapidly, shifts in place, turns toward the checkout counter with an armful of products, strides forward, stops, lowers her gaze, slowly turns around, and approaches the stylists with her lips pressed together. A male stylist steps forward, and Diana sits down as he spins her toward the mirror. In the swanky hotel restaurant, Sandy slouches alone at the bar with a glass of water, sits up, glances around, and takes a sip. Wearing a chic black dress, Diana rounds the corner in slow motion, stepping forward with her auburn hair straightened and makeup beautifully applied.",
    "260": "Hi is shaking his head while Gale chuckles, and Hi continues to shake his head as the camera moves closer to show Hi staring glumly at Gale. A motorcycle's rear wheel and fender with twin exhaust pipes are visible, with flames in each pipe as the bike roars. We see from behind the Biker's head as he rides through the night, creeping in toward a window with a feeble yellow light. Hi, composing a letter in voice-over, is hunched over the kitchen table writing, illuminated by a yellow lamp, the only light in the trailer. We creep in on Gale and Evelle sprawled on the sofa and easy chair, on a pimply-faced Cashier asleep behind the counter with a dirty magazine lying open on his chest, on Nathan Jr. asleep in an ottoman armchair in the living room, lit by the TV snow, a half-full glass of milk beside him, his robe disheveled, and eyeglasses slid down his nose, on Ed and Nathan Jr. asleep together in the double bed with Ed's arm draped protectively over the infant. The rumble of the motorcycle starts up again as we see the night sky, and the motorcycle tire enters the frame as it halts, the Biker planting a jackbooted foot while the engine rumbles. We crane up over the Biker's back to reveal his view of a bluff overlooking the trailer park with a glowing yellow light in one trailer window below. The biker sits motionless, legs outstretched against his parked motorcycle, staring at the campfire as we float closer to his face and realize something peculiar: his unblinkingly open eyes show only fire, either a reflection or something burning inside. A jackbooted foot grinds it out, leading into the showroom as the Biker's mail-and-chained fist pushes the door open, jackboots strolling through a showroom of unpainted furniture and fixtures, while the Biker's hand produces a fresh cheroot from nowhere, either sleight-of-hand or magic.",
    "1199": "As rain lashes the house, Marley jumps up at a window while more lightning flashes. John arrives at the airport in the pouring rain, and Jenny comes out of the terminal sheltering under a newspaper. The rain has stopped as they pull into the drive in the old hatchback, and Jenny's holding a stuffed alligator. With the alligator under her left arm, she hauls open the garage door and stares at a scene of devastation. Marley spots some pigeons and struggles away from two bikini girls. The birds scatter, and he hops down the beach full of sunbathers, running along the shoreline with John in pursuit. Marley runs straight into the arms of a guy, whose dog hurtles to his side. Later, they're back at the house, and with one of Jenny's bras in his mouth, Marley charges again, bursts through the screen door, and out into the garden. He bolts over the back fence as the Grogans give chase, passing a neighbor cooking at a barbecue, who nods. An older Marley drags Jenny through a hedge, and she lands in front of another dog owner. John's glumly making notes and screwing them up again. Jenny, with Marley, joins the other trainers, and Marley leaps up, wags his tail, then jumps up at John and tries to run off again. A woman walks off with arrogant confidence, and he sprints away as the trainer reaches for a whistle. Dog stops, turns, looks at her, then bounds happily back. Marley knocks the trainer over and starts humping her leg as John and Jenny rush to help. John stares at Jenny, then shakes his head. Marley lolls out of the window, ears flapping in the breeze as John clutches his hindquarters. The dog's out of the window, walking on his front paws, as Jenny gets out to help while traffic streams past. Arnie reads John's copy and shakes his head, with glasses perched on his nose and his face screwed up. John leaves the glass-fronted office with a grin, walks through the open-plan newsroom with fists clenched in triumph, and sits at his cube workstation to start typing on his computer. Marley spots another dog, pairs off with the table, and with paws on Jenny's shoulders, licks her face. He smiles. John, Jenny, and Marley are at the dog beach; it's a tough one, and he grimaces, while grinning, she pats him sympathetically on the back. They tumble, fully clothed, onto their bed, kissing and rolling around, as John picks up a pillow and dumps it on the dog's head. Arnie hands John back some copy, and John rummages for his phone. Back home, John lets Marley off the leash and sits on the bed. He feigns enthusiasm as she goes back into the bathroom; John composes himself, then she makes another entrance.",

Fantine puts on a show of courage as she leads the captain into the ship's hulk, which is a brothel. Fantine, pale and frail, her bodice loosened, leads the captain down to the damp dregs of the ship. We see the rotting straw mattress within as they enter, then Fantine lays down. CLOSE ON a man's hand leaving money. MOVE TO FIND Fantine lying alone on the mattress. She pulls herself into a sitting position against the head of the mattress. She has seen and recognised Valjean, some way off. He's out in the harbour district. He is talking to a beggar. Before he moves on, he hands over some money. She moves past the anchored ships, beneath the bowsprits, trying pathetically to attract custom. Fantine is out on the snow and ice-covered quayside, shivering, waiting for trade. She looks pale and sickly, but still attempts an alluring smile. As Fantine watches Valjean on his mission of mercy, a well-dressed young man, Bamatabois, comes up to her. He arrives with two friends and a valet. Javert is quietly coldly furious. He shows the blood. Fantine is almost fainting with fear, still racked with occasional spasms of coughing. Valjean steps out of the shadows. Javert turns to Fantine. Javert's assistants pick Fantine up. Javert indicates to the two policemen to drag Fantine away. To Fantine, it's as if he's come to her in a dream. Javert looks on, containing his anger, as Valjean reaches out a hand to Fantine. He holds Fantine's hands, looking into her face. Valjean picks Fantine up in his arms. As Valjean and Fantine move away, Javert stares after them, then turns and quietly instructs his assistant to follow after them. As Javert walks up the steps to his police station, his assistant stops him with an urgent letter. Javert seizes it, opens it, and reads. As he reads, his expression changes. Appalled, he realizes he's made a terrible mistake. Valjean is at his desk in his office, going through his papers once everyone else has gone when Javert enters and stands before him. Valjean conceals his shock. He looks up. Valjean is sitting staring at the Bishop's candlesticks. Valjean is furiously packing stuff up. The driver is Valjean, hesitating. Close on two horses panting. Valjean pushes through the crowds at the back of the courtroom. Before the judge has a chance to speak, the doors open and Valjean bursts in. The man accused of being Jean Valjean, a wretched down-and-out, stands before the judge. He looks uncannily like the real Valjean. Sensation in the court.",
    "939": "Watson watches as Moriarty heads off. The photographer. Holmes is outside on a balcony, drinking from a hip flask. The rocking back fall stumble into the darkness nearby. Moriarty comes out and joins him. Moriarty goes to a table and picks up a chess timing clock. He puts the clock on another table beside a chessboard. Holmes takes a seat in front of the board. Moriarty fetches a blanket and puts it around Holmes' shoulders. Moriarty picks up a second blanket and drapes it around his own shoulders. Holmes and Moriarty both smile. Then Moriarty's expression hardens. He starts by moving a white pawn. He sets the time clock. Inside, Watson and Sim move amongst the guests. Outside on the balcony, Holmes advances a second black pawn on the game of chess. Inside, Watson and Sim meet up again. They look over at the delegates. Holmes' knight takes one of Moriarty's pawns. Moriarty advances a bishop. A man smokes a cigar. Sim studies the faces of the potential assassins. A hyperemic needle is concealed inside an especially-adapted Winchester cartridge case. Watson glances around the photographer about to take the delegates' photo. Watson deliberately knocks a tray of drinks out of a footman's hands. As it crashes onto the marble floor, everyone looks around in surprise except one man in the corner. Watson peers at the man's hairline and notes that he drops his cigar. Sim stares at the man as he steps away from the delegate he was talking to. She looks over at Watson, who nods. The man reaches inside his jacket with his left hand just as Sim steps up to him. Another man continues assembling the hyperemic cartridge. He shoves her aside and draws a gun. Watson tackles him as he takes a shot. Mycroft steps forward and his arms ready. Soldiers drag him away. The hyperemic cartridge is loaded into a weapon. As Rene is dragged away, Moran surreptitiously shoots him with a hyperemic cartridge fired from a gun hidden in his cane. Something occurs to Watson. He runs out of the ballroom and joins the soldiers guarding Rene. He's collapsed. The soldiers allowed him to tend to Rene who's convulsing on the floor. Watson quickly finds a hyperemic dart lodged in Rene's leg. He pulls it out and tastes the compound it's injected. Moran watches with a smile. Sim runs to Rene. Watson spots Moran leaving. He turns back to Rene who's fading fast. On the balcony. Holmes looks troubled. Unsettled, Holmes sits back in his chair. Moriarty shrugs the blanket off her shoulders and gets up on the table. Holmes removes his blanket and looks at the chessboard. Moriarty feels for his notebook and runs his thumb over the top line in his pocket.",
    "954": "A crash occurs, with the object hitting the Earth some distance away, producing noises from inside the damaged carriage as if an angry beast is trapped. On the remains of the platform, the Cinay camera runs out of film, while the largely intact yellow Coupe remains amid the devastation. Joe navigates past the car in search of the others, climbing onto twisted railway tracks where he sees Preston and gives a thumbs up. Joe notices a blood stain and walks toward it, with the others gathering around. Alice appears behind them, prompting a smile from Joe, who then turns back to the wreckage, retrieves his makeup box, and quickly pockets a locket Alice notices. He picks up a strange white cube from the wreckage before joining the others on top of a wrecked carriage, offering a view across the devastation. Joe points to the mangled remains of a white pickup truck. They descend from the carriage and approach the pickup, where a man sits unresponsive. Alice touches his limp arm, causing a document to spill from his hand, which she picks up and opens as the boys crowd around. It's a map that Dr. Woodward seizes, sitting up stiffly and looking around at the kids before pulling out a revolver as people approach. The kids flee, with Alice running to the Coupe, and the boys collecting their belongings, including the camera, before scrambling into the car. Alice drives them away as numerous soldiers arrive, brandishing guns and torches, with one soldier picking up a discarded Super 8 film box and pondering it. Back in town, the boys exit the car as Alice hands Joe the white cube he retrieved from the crash site. With faces grimed from explosions, Alice and Joe regard each other briefly before Alice drives away in the Coupe, watched by Joe and the others. At home, Joe sits in the bath, holding the knobbly-surfaced white cube, staring thoughtfully into the distance as the town's lights twinkle in the darkness from a hillside view. The next morning, Joe is seen sleeping in bed and later puts out dog food before running to the Kaznyk's house, script in hand, to join Charles, who is watching TV.",
    "963": "He holds her for another moment, then pulls away and glances at her. He forces a faint smile. Elise gives him a tender look. He turns away, and she watches him with concerned eyes. As he trudges out of the emergency room, a discouraged expression crosses her face. Exiting the ER, David walks down a corridor, his pained eyes staring straight ahead. A view from behind shows his lone form filing down the long hospital hallway. Now in a vast hallway lined with marble, Richardson joins Harry at a window overlooking New York City. Harry's gaze stays trained ahead. Meanwhile, Elise sits alone in the hospital waiting room. She blinks back tears, then shakes her head. Now a friend pushes Elise in a wheelchair. They head out. Harry gives him a skeptical look. Richardson puts on his fedora, gives Harry a pat on the arm, and walks off, leaving the younger officer alone at the window of the mid-century high-rise. Eleven months later, now on a sunny farm, David walks a green pasture. Later, in front of a barn and silos, he addresses a crowd. Sitting in a campaign bus, Charlie and an aide watch a news report on the vehicle's TV. Charlie heads outside. As David greets his supporters, the campaign chairman sits on a picnic table and reads a newspaper. He browses a page, folds it up, and frowns thoughtfully to himself. As voters disperse, David joins him. Charlie holds out the newspaper. An arts section feature shows photos of Elise, one dancing, the other with a bow. David stares at the photo, his brow cinched. As he leaves, Charlie gazes after him with pursed lips. Seated outside a waterfront warehouse, he wears a sober frown. Now under a dusky sky, David walks across a deserted shipping dock. He carelessly tracks his feet through a large glassy puddle and stops at the dock's edge, gazing toward the low sun. In her apartment, Elise sits at the foot of her bed, eyeing a document. She sets it aside, then lifts her troubled gaze. Now David approaches the ragged bar. As David disappears inside, Harry emerges from a neighboring door. Inside, David sits forlornly at the bar. The bartender hands him a slip of paper. David stares after her, then reads the note. At dusk, under pouring rain, he holds his jacket over his head as he runs along a dock to a warehouse. In the evening, he leans on the wall, waiting. Harry arrives in a fedora and trench coat, sheltered from the rain by an umbrella. He joins David. Harry lowers his gaze and takes a deep breath. He gives a grave shake of the head, then takes a seat on a stack of shipping pallets.",
    "1295": "Bo finally looks at her father and smiles softly. Graham looks in the direction of the boy's voice while Merill picks up Bo and rushes through the crops, finding Morgan standing with his hands in the pockets of his pajama bottoms. Merill puts Bo on the ground and moves right in front of Morgan, who looks deep in thought. Graham takes hold of Morgan's chin, turning his face so he's looking straight at him, and Morgan's eyes reveal he's come to some answer. Morgan takes hold of his father's unshaven chin and turns his face, forcing Graham to look to his right, where he sees something. Graham Hess slowly rises to his feet and starts moving forward towards something, walking through a thin layer of crops and emerging in a clearing. Graham Hess looks around in a daze as he walks out into the center, with Merrill, Bo, and Morgan following him. Two German Shepherds are running back and forth, clearly agitated. Graham turns off the phone, realizing his children are seated on the kitchen floor with one of their two German Shepherds, and there is a large puddle on the kitchen tiles. Graham looks at the majestic dog, shivering, as Morgan and Bo lead their dog out with worried expressions on their faces. A police officer stands on the other side of the screen door, and Officer Edgar Paski nods that he knows, with Graham staring at him. Morgan pokes the barbecue fork into two meat patties on the grill, places two pieces of cheese on the hamburgers, and walks over to Houdini. Bo is about to pour a glass of water into the dog bowl, moves to Houdini, who sits in the shade by the picnic table, and takes a tiny sip of the water first. She stops, holds the glass out to Morgan, who drinks. The two children sit down in the grass with the dog as Bo shrugs and pours the water into the bowl. Houdini just sits staring at them, not shivering, but unnaturally still, as Bo pushes the bowl closer. Houdini begins to growl, making the children turn white, and Bo stands up as Houdini crouches down, trembling, his body tightening as he's about to leap. Officer Paski stands up, turns back, and stares in the direction of the house. Morgan's attention moves as the crops part and his father and Officer Paski enter the backyard, stopping cold when they look in his direction. They begin a slow walk towards him, with Morgan Hess seated under the jungle gym with Houdini on his lap.",
    "689": "Spider-Man and Octavius crash through an office window, and Spider-Man pummels Octavius' face. Octavius' limbs grab Spider-Man's head and toss him about, causing both men to fall out of the window. The material of Aunt May's brolly starts to tear, and she slips down on it as Octavius tosses Spider-Man across the street into a window in the block opposite. Aunt May slips further down the brolly, but her feet land on a ledge. She looks way down to the ground, then up at the face of the statue whose outstretched arms she's hooked her brolly around, before she's lifted off the ledge. Spider-Man sticks two webs to the window frames and stretches them back like a catapult. As he launches himself through the air, a pincer on one of Octavius' limbs becomes a pointed spear. Octavius stretches out the spear-like limb towards Spider-Man, but Aunt May smacks Octavius on the head with her brolly. Spider-Man grabs the limb, and Octavius releases Aunt May. Spider-Man dives to her rescue, catches her, and they swoop and swing down the street. The police fire at Octavius, who, with bags of money in one pincer, disappears around the corner of the building. Spider-Man lands with Aunt May, cocks his head, then leaps up on a web. Girls flock to Aunt May, while firing webs as he goes, Spider-Man sweeps through the skies from building to building across New York City. The planetarium with its suspended glass curtain wall stands 95 feet high, and inside it is a sphere constructed of fabricated aluminum panels. Peter is in the crowded planetarium and reaches for food as someone grabs the last canope from a waitress's tray. A couple walks by, and he raises his camera, realizing the lens cap is still on and removes it, but by which time, the couple has walked away. Harry's poured a drink, snatching the bottle and knocking over his glass as Peter walks up to him. The two old friends stare defiantly at each other as the Mayor glares. All heads turn to look at the stairway down into the planetarium where Captain Jameson is in uniform, accompanied by a young lady walking beside him arm-in-arm. Everyone applauds, except Peter, who sees the young lady is MJ in a black strapless dress, her hair tied up. MJ stares at Peter and turns her head away as he gazes, mesmerized. Later, Peter makes his way out onto the balcony, where a server has a tray with one canope on it. He reaches for it as someone else whisks it away. Peter sees MJ alone, pauses, then walks up behind her. MJ turns to face him, and Peter gulps, his eyes filling up. He watches forlornly as MJ strides away from him, and a waitress passes by as Peter grabs a cocktail glass.",
    "135": "He is chairing the Congress, and Jinnah bows, takes his notes, and gestures to the auditorium—a man made for and loving the spotlight. At last, he moves back to his place on the platform, where Nehru clasps his hand in congratulation, and others crowd around him. Fleetingly, on the edge of the picture, we see Gandhi, the only one in an Indian tunic, sitting at the end of the second row on the platform, just watching the flood of enthusiasm for Jinnah. Patel approaches the microphone, stilling the house with upraised hands, and the audience cheers and applauds his little coda. He raises his hands again, stilling them, as Gandhi has already started to come toward the podium. Gandhi is greeted with mild applause because the convention is performing like one now that the spell of Jinnah's major speech has dissipated. As Gandhi reaches the podium, Patel gestures him to it, and Gandhi nods to him, acknowledging the residue of applause. Patel wanders back toward the others, his mind already on them, but he half-hears Gandhi's comment and turns with a smile, demonstrating a politician's flexibility. Gandhi grins and takes glasses from his sleeve—this is the first time we have seen them. He has one slip of paper with notes which he puts on the podium. He puts his glasses on and faces the convention, while on the platform, whispered politics continue, and on the convention floor, some listen as others talk of different things. Nehru, having caught Gandhi's last remark, turns, and now attention begins to focus on the floor of the hall too. Jinnah listens aloofly and challengingly, then takes off his glasses, folds them, and in silence, starts back toward his place on the platform as a cameraman flashes a picture, prompting tepid applause taken up here and there. On the platform, leaders join in perfunctorily as we see one peasant face, Shukla, who we will come to know, watching from the crowd of outsiders in the doorways. Nehru, who has been observing Gandhi with interest and some surprise, turns to Patel. An open touring car struggles along a bumpy trail with Nehru driving, accompanied by four friends as young as he, all dressed in the same expensive, British manner. Nehru looks a little harassed from the ragging and the rough ride. The ashram is half-finished, with unworked ground and partially completed buildings, looking like a primitive frontier outpost. They are finally brought to a halt by a goat tethered right across the path.",
    "2": "The wind carries something in a circle, sometimes violently or soaring skyward, before letting it float to the ground. Jane and Ricky sit on the bed watching his wide-screen TV. Jane watches Ricky and then takes his hand. He scans her eyes, curious about her reaction, and she kisses him softly. Lester sits at the table in sloppy clothes, eating voraciously and drinking beer, while Carolyn watches him with contempt. Jane stares at her parents, apprehensive. Jane obeys, surprised by his voice's power. Lester gets a plate of asparagus, serves himself, and then hurls it against the wall, frightening Carolyn and Jane, but continues eating as if nothing happened. Jane stares at her plate. She sits on her bed, hears a knock, rolls her eyes, and lets Carolyn in. Carolyn stares at Jane, starts crying, slaps her hard, and leaves embarrassed. Jane looks in the mirror, rubs her cheek, crosses to the window, and looks out. Across from Ricky's room, Ricky stands at the window with his digicam, videotaping her. Behind Ricky, he videotapes Jane, who waves, then starts to take off her shirt until she is in her bra. She clumsily takes off her bra as we zoom in, and on the TV behind him, we see Jane in her window. She stands exposed, trying to look defiant but is vulnerable. Suddenly, the Colonel enters, incensed. Ricky turns around, realizes the situation, and tries to dodge his father, but the Colonel punches Ricky, knocking him to the floor. Jane watches from her window, pulling the drapes. Ricky's lip bleeds, but he maintains his gaze at his father during the beating, and the Colonel continues to hit him in the window across from her.",

Andy nods and holds her hand out to receive the coat, but Miranda tosses it and her handbag onto Emily's desk and marches into her office. Andy stares at the coat, which has been slung over Emily's monitor screen and sits stiffly down in her own chair. Miranda comes to the door. Andy reluctantly picks up her telephone receiver and calls Emily, who's running down busy streets with some big bags. Emily is hit by a taxi and rolls onto its bonnet. The scarves flutter around her. Andy waits at the hospital, looking sheepish. Later, she's with Emily, who's lying in bed with a broken leg and some cuts and bruises. A man comes in with a dinner tray. Emily tucks into a jelly pot and some bread. Andy stands up and grabs her clutch bag. Andy's at a gallery show that Lily's curated. Lily leads Doug off, and Andy checks out the art, standing alone to admire the floor-to-ceiling, blown-up black-and-white photographs of street scenes. Christian is at the opening too. He spots Andy. Andy closes her eyes as rugged, fair-haired Christian kisses her cheek before leaving. Lily is seeing the kiss from across the room and walks off angrily. Andy tries to catch up. Nate follows Andy out. He stares at Andy, who gazes back, then glances aside. Nate nods, then turns and walks away. He turns back. Nate walks off. Swallowing her tears, Andy takes the call. An aerial view of Paris by night. The Eiffel Tower alive with sparkling lights. Andy is sitting in the back of a chic, chauffeur-driven car as they travel through the Paris streets and among the Champs-Élysées. She gazes out off the window, wide-eyed with excitement as they pass the city's grand buildings, shops, and hotels and the imposing Arc de Triomphe. Miranda occasionally glances over her spectacles at the view. Andy is sitting behind Nigel and Miranda, who are in the front row for the Valentino show. Models in an array of stunning gowns sashay down the runway as cameras flash. Nigel whispers in Miranda's ear.

    "310": "Jason finally sits and smiles warmly, speaking in over-enunciated tones. Instead of seeing his father across a table, Evan looks up at a ceiling, which is blocked by Jason's monstrous, rage-filled face and cuffed hands choking him. Jason wrestles a baton from under his chin, strikes an orderly in the kneecap, and comes for Evan, but Orderly #2 quickly beats Jason with his baton. Andrea hugs Evan, now in shock. All eyes turn to Evan as he takes his lit cigarette, breaks off the filter, and jams the fuse into the unlit end. Lenny paces beside the three-story mailbox, trying to appear nonchalant, then pretends to notice an untied shoe and bends to tie it. Other kids watch anxiously from the woods. Lenny finally throws the bomb in the mailbox and sprints back to the woods, where Kayleigh shakes Lenny's inhaler and hands it to him. Evan pats Lenny on the back, and the four watch the mailbox intensely. Evan smiles with a cigarette between his lips and covers Kayleigh's ears with his hands; she smiles back and presses his hands against her head. Tommy catches this, seems disturbed, and turns back to the mailbox. He loses his footing, falls to the ground, and Lenny falls on top of him. Evan gets up, starts running, but realizes he's not followed. Kayleigh and Tommy are helping Lenny up, carrying him. Evan notices Lenny is completely dazed, so he doubles back, grabs Lenny's arm, and he and Tommy drag Lenny through the woods as fast as possible. Lenny's mother, Mrs. Kagan, frantically loads him into an ambulance. Andrea turns to a trembling Evan on the front stoop, and he looks helpless. Evan lies on the couch, and Andrea suppresses a tiny proud smile. Suddenly, Evan's eyes roll back, and he moans and shakes. Blood trickles from his nose as a guttural sound emerges. Andrea moves to stop the bleeding. Kayleigh, repulsed, darts from the aisle and runs out with Evan following her to a small alcove, where she begins to cry. He reaches to comfort her, but she winces and pulls back her shirt collar, revealing a larger, darker bruise. She looks into his eyes, and they lean in for a tender kiss, but jerk back to see Tommy, shocked and betrayed, staring at them from across a small crowd.",
    "1377": "Harry frees Ron, and as Cedric and Cho emerge to a cheering crowd, Viktor and Hermione follow with chants of 'Krum, Krum, Krum' from the onlookers. The Beauxbatons girls appear worried, and Harry notices the blonde girl that Fleur could not rescue. He loosens the rope binding her and heads for the surface with both Ron and the girl. Attacked and held down, Harry pushes Ron and the girl upwards. They surface, coughing but safe, receiving help from a Beauxbatons girl. Underwater, Harry propels himself to the surface with a spell, bursting out onto the decking amidst the crowd. Fleur, Hermione, and even Fleur again, shower Harry with kisses, while Cedric and his friends cheer. As they walk away from the lake, Harry's friends continue cheering him on. Barty Crouch waits for Harry, and Mad-Eye approaches them, after which Barty walks away. Harry experiences pain in his head and sees Barty Crouch lying lifeless on the ground. Mad-Eye points to a door, which Harry enters, and he is left alone in the room. Harry reaches into a snack bowl, retrieves a handful, and it transforms into a small, biting creature. The man next to Dumbledore speaks, and Dumbledore shakes his hand; their handshake passes through Harry, who seems ghostly and without presence. A cage rises from the floor as proceedings begin, and Igor protests loudly, with Barty hitting the gavel repeatedly. Barty Crouch junior attempts to run and is zapped by Mad-Eye, falling into the court's center amidst an uproar. Guards seize Barty junior, as Dumbledore extracts a quivering string of magic from his head. The door opens to reveal Harry watching; Igor leaves, and Severus shuts the door in Harry's face. The champions emerge, greeted by crowd cheers and excitement from the Bulgarian crowd. As a cannon fires and Mr. Filch shrugs comically, Dumbledore groans, and Harry and Cedric enter the maze through separate entrances, which close behind them. The maze, tall and enveloped in heavy mist, confronts Cedric with closing walls, prompting him to run. Fleur, running scared, is attacked and knocked down, and Viktor finds her unconscious before continuing on. Harry sees Fleur being swallowed by undergrowth but arrives too late to help, so he sends up a red spark. A heavy wind starts blowing, and as walls close in, Harry runs.",
    "1128": "Hermione reaches out and grabs it, and they watch fearfully as the snake rears up and attacks. Hermione's spell stuns the snake, and she and Harry disapparate through the window. On a peaceful winter's day, a tree-lined river flows through a countryside white with frost. Hermione fetches water from the river and walks up the steep bank. Later, she sits reading by a smoking campfire with her back leaning against a tree, and Harry comes out of the tent, which is pitched behind her. They're both wearing warm winter sweaters, and Hermione has a blanket over her legs. She looks up at him, and he looks around. They both look thoughtful as she hands him Rita Skeeter's book, and he looks at the photographs while she frowns. A worried expression on her face, she lifts the blanket and reveals his wand in pieces. Harry sits keeping watch, leaning back against the tree, with the blanket over his shoulders, holding Hermione's wand. He takes out the piece of broken mirror and gazes into it, seeing the mirror reflect an empty room. He drops the mirror onto the ground and wraps the blanket tight around his shoulders, while behind him, a dim light glows inside the tent. Clutching Hermione's wand, Harry looks deep into the forest, his eyes widening as he spots a light in the distance. It comes closer, glowing ever brighter, taking the shape of a translucent silvery doe. Harry shrugs off the blanket, gets to his feet, and moves cautiously towards it. He stops and watches as the doe turns and moves slowly away, prompting Harry to follow. The doe stops and glances back, then moves on, trotting across a stretch of frozen water with a light covering of frost. The shape of the doe shrinks to a ball of light, and the tip of Hermione's wand glows as Harry steps gingerly onto the ice. As he nears the light, it floats towards him and then sinks below the ice. He crouches down and wipes away the frost from the surface to reveal a sword lying gleaming under the ice. Looking around cautiously, Harry aims the wand and stands up, causing the ice above the sword to crack and a hole to appear. At the water's edge, Harry removes his clothes, except for his boxer shorts, with the locket still around his neck. He treads barefoot and wearily across the frost-covered ice until he reaches the hole, places Hermione's wand on the edge, and submerges his right foot in the water. Shivering, he gazes at the sword, takes a breath, and drops feet first through the hole in the ice, swimming down towards the gleaming sword. He reaches out to grasp it but suddenly grabs the chain of the locket, struggling for breath.",
    "526": "The camera moves down the tree to reveal a well-kept, red-brick brownstone on a pleasant, sunny New York City street. A man wearing a summer suit walks by as the film moves inside the building to Elliot's analyst's office, where the psychotherapist sits in a comfortable armchair next to a curtained window. The music stops as the camera moves across the room to reveal Elliot, sitting in a wooden chair, holding a long, thin cigarette and wearing a gold Rolex watch. Elliot raises his cigarette to take a drag, and the camera follows the cigarette up to his face as he looks thoughtful, before the movie cuts to Lee, wearing jeans and carrying an armful of books, running up a broad set of steps in the sunlight, greeting other students as she passes. Lee stops on a portico and turns to greet Doug, a professor, who is running over to her, calling her name. They mouth hello, smiling, and begin to walk off together before the film cuts back to Elliot in his analyst's office. Back inside the scene transitions to a restaurant with glass and metal doors where a waiter in uniform stands holding a tray to his chest; a few people sit at the bar, and a large plant in a vase sits in the foreground. The camera follows the sisters, cutting to the restaurant's interior at the same time they walk in. The sisters walk toward the coatcheck area, deep in conversation. Hannah walks offscreen, farther into the coatcheck room, while she talks offscreen as Lee alone is seen, reacting and speaking as well. In the background, a waiter crosses over to the bar, then walks away. Lee takes off her gloves and scarf, stuffing them in her bag. The hostess appears, peeking around the corner of the coatcheck area and signals for the sisters to follow her. The sisters walk to their seats at a round table in the middle of the room, and the hostess puts down their menus before leaving. Other diners are seen in the background; a waiter is taking the order of a couple sitting on a banquette while other waiters clear off a table. As the camera slowly circles the table, Hannah is seen listening to Holly, her hand on her mouth. Lee looks up, her hand still on her mouth, watching Hannah as the camera slowly moves off her to show Hannah. The camera is back on Lee, who looks around tensely, barely listening to the conversation. She fidgets and puffs intensely on her cigarette as the camera slowly circles to Hannah's face, who looks equally intense, looking at both sisters as she speaks. She opens her menu, then turns to Lee, reacting suddenly to her sister, who is rubbing her forehead, looking terribly upset.",

Fully clothed, she is once again surrounded by the other girls as the high school band plays its last note, the Dancing Spartanettes strike their final pose, and the audience reacts. Carolyn claps along with the rest of the audience, while Lester just sits there, unable to take his eyes off Angela. The game is long over when Jane and Angela come out of the gym, and Lester and Carolyn stand at the edge of the parking lot. Jane crosses reluctantly toward her parents, followed by Angela, creating an awkward beat. As Jane starts toward the parking lot, Lester stays behind. Angela smiles, aware of the power she has over Lester, who is mesmerized and feels grateful. Close on a solitary red rose petal as it falls slowly through the air. We're looking down on Lester and Carolyn in bed, and even in sleep, Carolyn looks determined while Lester is awake and stares up at us. The rose petal drifts into view, landing on his pillow, and more rose petals fall onto the bed as he smiles up at them. Angela, naked, floats above us as a deluge of rose petals falls around her, her hair fanning out around her head and glowing with a subtle, burnished light. She looks down at us with a smile that is all things. Lester smiles back and laughs as rose petals cover his face. Jane stares at the floor and later gets out of the car, still laughing, and waves as Angela pulls away. We zoom toward Jane as she walks up the driveway. Suddenly, she turns, sensing our presence, and we see the colonial house next door where the moving van was parked earlier, with the front porch shrouded in darkness until a porch light abruptly reveals Ricky. As usual, Ricky is dressed conservatively. Irritated, Jane stares at him hard, and he looks back at her curiously, then raises his digicam and starts to videotape her. His point of view, on video, shows Jane, angry and self-conscious, turning and walking quickly toward her house, flipping us off as she goes. Jane enters, closes and locks the door, quickly turns off the light that's been left on for her, then peeks through a window and smiles. Jane turns back into the room, her heart racing. Lester, dressed for work, goes through Jane's address book and grabs Jane's phone to dial, standing with the receiver to his ear, nervous but frozen and unable to speak. He hangs up and exits quickly as Jane emerges from the bathroom, a towel wrapped around her torso, drying her wet hair. She picks up the phone. Meanwhile, Angela is sprawled across her bed, on the phone. Jane then notices her address book open to the H page.",
    "145": "At the small train station near the ashram, a train pulls in as Kallenbach, beside a new Ford touring car, watches. As people disembark, he moves forward through the crowded platform, his Indian tunic unable to disguise his incisive, patrician lawyer demeanor. Amidst the chaos of Third Class passengers, Maulana Azad emerges, carrying a baby wrapped in rags, followed by the child's mother with her two little ones. Azad hands the baby to the mother, who thanks him, and he makes a small salaam before moving toward the camera. Kallenbach is with Patel, who grins; like most witty men, he loves wit in others, though he groans at times. They turn back to the train just as Mirabehn (Madeleine Slade), a tall, pretty, and extremely English woman despite her sari, tips a porter and takes a small bag. She pauses upon seeing a now-startled Kallenbach. In a different setting, the camera pans from a row of sandals by the door to a room where Gandhi sits facing Patel and Azad, carding fiber to thread while Desai makes notes in the background. Mirabehn, seated near Ba, listens intently as Gandhi's discussions unfold. Ba's spinning remains constant as Gandhi, after a solemn exchange with Azad, turns to Mirabehn, noticing her sari approvingly before a shadow passes. Mirabehn beams, nods, and exchanges a warm, teasing smile with Ba, marking the start of a lasting friendship.

    "728": "Stacks of plates slide off the shelves and smash on the floor as a lifeboat flows with people away from the part of the ship which rises several stories into the night sky. People slide down the slanted deck, and Jack's eyes widen as he watches people and deck chairs smashing into each other. A brunette woman slips out of a man's grasp and slides on the deck on her stomach. All along the Titanic, people dangle from ropes, spill from railings, or slide down into the ocean. More people climb over the railing at the back of the ship. One man jumps and free falls into the icy water where small groups of survivors cling to floating debris. Standing at the rear railing, the black-haired baker watches a falling man bounce off one of the giant propellers and cartwheel into the sea. The baker pulls a flask out of his pocket and takes a drink. Jack wraps his arms around Rose as she grips onto the railing. Sitting beside Molly in a lifeboat, Ruth's eyes are glassy as she watches from a distance, while Ismay, also in a lifeboat, turns away from the carnage and squeezes his eyes shut. A crewman reaches towards a sparking circuit breaker, and a shock flings him. All along the Titanic, electric lights flicker, then go out as the rear of the ship continues to tilt upward. Blood streaming down his forehead, Lovejoy grips a side railing as it splits apart. Inside the ship, a ceiling collapses as several support columns fail, and small explosions shoot flames from portholes. A pair of men slide into the widening chasm, and the mighty ship snaps in half, sending the rear of the boat plunging back toward the sea. The back of the Titanic slaps down on the ocean surface, crushing dozens. The last of the funnels topples over as water rushes into the gap between the two sections, which are still joined at the bottom, and the Titanic rapidly fills with water and sinks. Jack climbs over the railing at the back of the ship as it tilts skyward rapidly, and passengers manage to scramble over the railing. Sheets of water glimmer in the moonlight, which rises up from the ocean, and people dangling from railings lose their grips and fall. One man bounces off a cab stand before slamming into other people hanging on below, creating a domino effect of falling bodies. A blonde maid dangles from the railing near Rose, who looks into the young woman's eyes as she loses her grip and falls. Her breath visible in the cold air, Rose turns toward the baker, who crouches on the railing beside her, and he returns her silent gaze. Finally, the entire ship sinks.",
    "1163": "The two of them step out into a corridor, the walls and floor lined with shiny black tiles. They see Fudge talking to Lucius Malfoy outside the courtroom. Harry nods nervously as the jurors exchange glances. He approaches Fudge while Dumbledore sighs and addresses the members of the jury. Some jurors murmur to each other as Fudge raises his hand. With a sickly smile, the Undersecretary raises hers, and others follow suit. Many more jurors raise their hands; Mrs. Figg raises hers, then makes to scratch her ear, and Amelia Bones raises her hand. Harry jumps to his feet, but Dumbledore has gone. At Kings Cross Station, Moody and Nymphadora Tonks lead Harry and the Weasley family across a footbridge, while a large black dog hesitates beside Harry. The huge dog trots into a waiting room and turns into a man, and Harry runs in after him. In a group photograph of 20 people, Harry's parents stand beside Sirius, and Harry hands the photograph back to Sirius. Harry walks along the platform crowded with Hogwarts' students and their families, seeing the tall, gaunt figure of Voldemort facing him. The Dark Lord twists and flexes his neck. On the train, Harry sits in a corner of the carriage, shifting uneasily and twisting his neck, while Hermione sits beside him and glances at Ron. As evening falls, the Hogwarts Express speeds along the coast, a plume of white smoke streaming from the funnel. Hogwarts School sits beside a river running down to the sea. They emerge from the train as Draco Malfoy struts along the platform. Ron holds Harry back, but Harry shakes Ron off. Outside the station, four girls sit in a horseless carriage, one of them being Cho, a pretty Oriental girl who smiles at Harry. The carriage pulls away, and Harry stares after it. As they wait for another carriage, Neville joins them, carrying a cactus. Harry turns and sees a strange creature behind him; it has a head like a horse and stretches its long leathery neck. Puzzled, Harry inspects the animal more closely. In the carriage behind it, a girl with long blond hair sits reading a magazine upside down. They all climb in, and Hermione shifts uncomfortably as they all look confused. In the great hall, Luna and the other students tuck into a luscious assortment of puddings, while Harry has an empty space beside him and looks over at Seamus, who pointedly ignores him. He stops as Professor Umbridge, the former Undersecretary, rises smiling primly. She's a small woman in a sugar-pink suit with matching accessories, and the twins are not convinced as she beams at Dumbledore. Filch applauds enthusiastically.

She takes a swig, and they kiss as the snow falls outside, with the snow turning into a dense blizzard. Sun blazes on a motor cruiser in a quiet bay, where crystal blue waters wash a coastal city shore, and large houses with pools are laid out amid lakes and a golf course while a palatial hotel backs onto the crowded beach. Speedboats create foaming wakes on the water. A stone bridge crosses a wide river with traffic including a red hatchback. The couple arrives at an office building, where she hustles him out, and Jenny waits by the car as he leaves the Sun-Sentinel offices. A 4x4 drives down a suburban street; John walks out of a bungalow to pick up newspapers, one being the Sun-Sentinel. The Grogans read their papers over breakfast while she moves to the sink, and John frowns and nods. Sebastian packs a knife. John and Jenny drive up a path near a large pen of dogs; Jenny, blindfolded with John's tie, pets the pups. The Grogans' hatchback arrives at the airport with the pup excitedly on the passenger seat. The pup paws at the upholstery, staring at John. A police car drives past as John pulls into the driveway, where a patrol car and people are gathered on the street. He gets out holding the pup, while Marley knocks over dog food and later stares up with sad eyes. John switches off the garage light, returning to the house, and brushes his teeth before bed, lying with the pillow clamped to his ears. He gets out of bed, goes to the garage to pick up the pup, leaves with Marley over his shoulder, and wakes up with Marley licking his face, having ripped open a pillow and clothes. John heads for the car, closes the garage door, and Marley fidgets anxiously in his box.",
    "731": "Below the sky along the horizon, lifeboats row toward a waiting ship anchored amid floating icebergs as Rose opens her eyes when they row up alongside the ship Carpathia. Later, Titanic survivors recover on one of the ship's lower decks as nurses and crewmen flit amongst them. Still dressed in a tuxedo, Cal walks down a staircase onto the lower deck, brushes past a man, and walks into the survivors. Rose sits on a bench with a blanket wrapped around her, hooding her hair and head, and she glances up at Cal's back as he surveys the passengers, then looks away as he turns toward her, closing her eyes as Cal paces behind her. Rose peers sideways at Cal as he walks away. Her hair wet and stringy, Rose stands in pouring rain on the deck of the ship and stares up at the Statue of Liberty, the torch and crown glowing in the night. A ship's crewman holding a clipboard steps up to Rose, but Rose continues to stare up at the giant statue as the crewman moves on. Lizzy smiles. On the ocean floor, the two submersibles shine their lights on the Titanic's remains, then rise, leaving the wreck and darkness. At the surface, crewmen work to recover the submersibles, while standing with Lizzy on the research ship, Brock sniffs a cigar and then throws it into the water. Staring at Brock, Lizzy smiles and shakes her head. He turns and watches lights glint off the surface of rolling waves. Later that night, wearing only a nightgown, across the desolate deck, Rose's loose white hair blows in the wind as she clutches her hands over her heart and walks to a railing at the back of the ship. She grips the railing with one hand, pulls herself up onto the bottom rung, and stares down into the water. She unclasps her left hand, revealing the Heart of the Ocean, a large heart-shaped blue diamond that glints in the moonlight. On the deck of the Carpathia, young Rose stands in the rain and stares at the Statue of Liberty, frowning as she looks down and pulls the Heart of the Ocean out of her jacket pocket. Back on the deck of the Keldysh, Rose tosses the diamond necklace into the sea, and as the necklace sinks, Rose smiles and exhales deeply, watching as it twirls down to the dark ocean depths. Later, Rose sleeps in her berth beside her collection of framed photographs. In one picture, Rose stands beside a large fish; in another, she sits on an elephant's back. In a third, Rose wears a long scarf around her neck as she poses beside a biplane, and in another, Rose smiles astride a horse.",
    "1062": "Jack's flummoxed as Jenny picks up her parcels and goes into the living room, glaring at her father, David, who hangs his head while Jenny sighs. Jack struggles to make the next move as David gleams at Jenny, who tries to suppress a broad grin, before they drive off for the evening. Jenny looks around the sparsely furnished room with modern wooden furniture and shoots him a glance. Later, they are lying in bed together, kissing face to face. In his pajama bottoms, David gets up while Jenny sits up, watching him go through to the other room as she self-consciously adjusts her nightie. Jenny is stumped and buries her face in her pillow, while David flops down on the bed, studies her uncertainly, smiles apologetically, and hangs his head. They sit side by side on the satin as Jenny grins at David, then reaches forward and grabs a banana. Sun shines on the Eiffel Tower as Jenny and David, in film star sunglasses, wander among booksellers on the banks of the Seine. Jenny finds a book she loves and looks imploringly at David, who smiles and reaches for his wallet, holding her hand as they walk along a high wall. David boxes Jenny into position for a photo with Notre Dame Cathedral in the background; she poses, and a guy on a bicycle checks her out as he rides past. David is less than impressed, then takes another photo. They run up steep stone steps and walk arm in arm, joining other couples slow dancing in the sunshine to a record playing on a small portable turntable. They lie cheek to cheek and drink wine with a picnic by the river at dusk, where Jenny rests her head on David's shoulder. In the morning, Jenny looks out from their hotel at the great dome of the Sacre-Coeur, smiles, thinks for a moment, then shakes her head. Jenny puts a bottle of Chanel on her teacher's desk but, disappointedly, puts the bottle back in her satchel as the teacher looks up when she leaves. The words hit home, and Jenny thinks hard, challenging Miss Stubs with a look, but Miss Stubs turns away. Gray hounds burst out of starting gates onto the track as Jenny, David, Danny, and Helen are in the crowd. They climb the stands to a private suite where David shakes hands with a man by the door, then they file in. Jenny gives her coat to Danny while their contact holds court in a white dinner jacket, and Danny and David move off. Jenny and Helen drink champagne, then Danny leads Jenny to the dance floor where they move flirtatiously. Helen worriedly watches David watching them as Jenny and Danny dance with their eyes locked together, Jenny smiling with her gaze never wavering from his.",
    "667": "In the arena office, $100 is laid on the desk in front of Peter, who waits expectantly. Peter screws up his face, glares at the promoter, and then storms out of the office, passing a tall, burly unshaven guy with bleached hair who barges in and throws a canvas bag at the promoter. In the corridor, Peter overhears and, through the frosted glass wall, sees the gunman rob the promoter and make his escape. Peter stands aside as the robber escapes in the elevator. The promoter, with a gash on the right side of his temple, sneers at him. Peter then heads back along the corridor after the security guard and smacks as he calls the elevator, outside wearing a hooded jogging top over his sweatshirt. He watches police cars draw up and sees a crowd of people milling around on the sidewalk. He looks on curiously and pushes his way through the crowd to find a gray-haired old man lying on the ground. Peter is beside him as the man opens his eyes and tries to focus. His eyes light on Peter, and he attempts a smile, taking his nephew's right hand in his. Uncle Ben's eyes close, his head lulls to one side, and his grip on Peter's hand loosens until his hand slips out of the youth's grasp. Peter, tears running down his cheeks, looks at the peaceful face of his dead uncle as the young man sobs. Having overheard the cop, Peter's face grows determined, his jaw set. He stands up and walks away, runs into a dark alleyway, pulls off his zipped-up jogging top, and puts on his balaclava. Spider-Man leaps up on a wall at the end of the alleyway, clambers, climbs, and leaps up the side of a building, scurrying along with great speed. He spots a flagpole on a building opposite, jumps sailing through the air, grabs the pole with both hands, and swings round and round to build the momentum to catapult him through the air onto the adjoining rooftop. He leaps from roof to roof until he lands on top of a dome. Far below, he sees the automobile being chased by police, shoots a web to an adjacent building, and looks up at the corners of the building to which his web is attached. Glancing down at the streets way below, he takes a deep breath and launches himself off the dome. As he races towards the building opposite, he shoots another web to pull him away, then another, as he zig-zags far above the trolling streets. Each time it seems he is going to plummet to the ground, he shoots out another web and pulls himself along, like Tarzan swinging from vine to vine.",
    "1076": "Sarah gapes open-mouthed at the soaring crags as the herd moves towards a dark canyon with sheer cliffs rising on either side, casting shadows at the bottom. King George keeps watch from the top of the cliffs as four horsemen approach, riding line abreast. A fire burns in the Drovers' camp where Nullah sits on a rock, and Sarah is in her tent, writing. Flynn stares at Nullah, and up on the cliff, King George makes a fire by drilling a stick into a piece of wood and some kindling. Sarah sticks her tongue out at Flynn as he closes his eyes, and King George looks up at the star-dusted sky. As the sun comes up, the horsemen arrive on the rocky ridge, looking down at the cattle huddled in the shadowy canyon. Flynn takes his harmonica from Nullah just as something spooks the cattle. Petrol from a metal can is sprinkled on the ground by Fletcher's men; Fletcher gets off his horse, and the bearded Bull holds up a flaming torch and hurls it into the canyon. King George observes from his perch as Flynn and Nullah watch the torch falling through the darkness, igniting orange flames that leap up as it hits the ground, causing the cattle to stampede as fire erupts behind them. Drover clambers onto a rock and sees the herd thundering out of the canyon, pursued by a wall of flame, with a sheer drop ahead beyond the mouth of the canyon. Drovers urge their horses on, desperately trying to get ahead of the herd, splitting into two groups on either side. Fletcher's crew follow on a path along the cliff above. Nullah gallops along the cliff edge, steering the herd away from the precipice, and grins at Flynn as cattle tumble into the abyss. Flynn's eyes widen in fear as the cliff edge curves in front of them, with a sheer drop on one side and a mass of cattle on the other. Up on the cliff, Fletcher urges his horse on as Flynn rides next to Nullah on the cliff edge, showing off and riding one-handed. Fletcher and his men stop to look down at the herd now heading across open ground, and Fletcher gives a signal, leading to another fire being lit. As a wall of flame appears in front of the herd, Flynn's horse trips, and he is thrown off. King George watches from a high outcrop as the fire cuts the herd off from open ground, funneling them towards the cliff. Nullah reins in his horse and looks towards Flynn, who is on the ground in the path of the stampede, while the other riders try to reach Flynn, who looks in terror at the oncoming herd.",
    "818": "Rebecca is handed a bouquet and hurries after the other maids of honor as Suze's father goes to take his daughter's arm. Rebecca turns around and runs into Suze's open arms, grinning happily as she races down the aisle to join the other three bridesmaids who are processing slowly towards the altar. Suze, with her black hair pinned up in an elegant bun, composes herself and looks towards the altar at Tarquin's smiling face. After the wedding, Rebecca and the rest of the guests wave as the newlyweds are driven off in a white Rolls Royce. Rebecca, standing among the well-dressed crowd in her spotted shrug, smiles fondly. As people begin to disperse, her face starts to cloud over, as if suddenly thinking of something sad and serious along with the good things. She turns away from the church and starts walking across a city street in her pink bridesmaid dress, with a heavy tulle petticoat and long, white gloves. She walks past the window of Yves St. Laurent where a black China mannequin knocks on the window. Rebecca lifts the hem of her pink dress and considers, as a second mannequin knocks on the glass and shows her the orange bag she's carrying. Rebecca compares it to her pink one, and the mannequin jiggles the bag seductively. Rebecca's eyes fill with wonder, and she smiles eagerly, but then, with a little shake of the head, she walks on. The two doll-like mannequins look at each other; the seated one with the bag stands up, and both clap their hands. The mannequins in all the fashion windows she passes applaud her, and Rebecca starts to laugh, swinging her skirt joyfully, then stops in her tracks. Luke is standing in front of her in the middle of the pavement. She looks at him like a kid who's been caught stealing sweets and shrugs inanely. She steps towards him, and he steps towards her; they're in front of Asprey's. She shakes her head hopelessly as he looks intently into her face, and a faint smile flickers across his lips. Reaching into his coat pocket, he brings out the green scarf and wraps it around her neck. Rebecca beams at him, and he kisses her on the lips. As they kiss, a pair of ankle boots is placed in a window display, and Rebecca spots them in the corner of her eye as a tall, white-faced mannequin tilts her head and winks at her. Rebecca grins and goes back to giving Luke's kiss her full attention as the screen fades to black, leaving just the green scarf. She introduces Alicia to Janne, who kisses Alicia's hand, and then dances with Luke. Luke spots Graham throwing himself about to the music, where Graham lies on his back and Jane turns his legs like a wheel.",
    "409": "Standing poised by the door, the classroom doors open and students start to file out. Elaine comes out of the classroom and starts walking down the corridor towards the exit door, with Ben following her, moving out of the way of the other students. Elaine and twenty other girls are in basketball uniforms as Elaine sits on the bench, watching. Ben stands behind her, and she turns and looks at him. Elaine jumps up, applauding a shot, and several other girls run onto the court while a number of girls run off the court to the bench. Later, Ben is seated across a study table from Elaine with many other students scattered around the room. She starts to get up and begins to move away. Ben and Elaine are standing at the entrance, and Ben remains standing in exactly the same position. After a few moments, the door opens, Elaine comes out, steps quickly to Ben, kisses him, then runs back inside. Ben turns and starts away from the door as a tall bearded man comes out and goes past Ben. Through the window of a hippy jewelry store, a saleswoman is modeling a ring for Ben. He nods, she takes it off, puts it in a box and gives it to him. He pays for it and exits past the camera, whistling. Ben enters carrying four oddly shaped boxes and some flowers, whistling happily as he runs up the stairs two at a time. He opens the door to his room and steps in; the room is dark and the figure of a man is silhouetted against the window. Ben freezes just inside the door before taking a step forward. Mr. Robinson stands at the door, opens it, and starts into the hall, then turns back from the hall. Mr. Robinson starts down the stairs, where Mr. McCleery is standing on the stairway, listening. Mr. Robinson turns and goes down the stairs, past Mr. McCleery, who looks up at Ben. Ben walks to the door, looks out into the hall at Mr. McCleery, then shuts the door. He stuffs the money back in his pocket and runs down the stairs and out of the building. Through the door, we see him run down the street and out of sight, with Ben reacting. The elevator at the end of the hall opens, and a fat girl walks toward us with an envelope in her hand, then walks into the camera. Ben is driving his car as the sound of an envelope being read is heard. Ben follows her through the hall into Mrs. Robinson's room, where Mrs. Robinson, without stopping, puts Elaine's clothes down next to a half-packed open suitcase on her bed and moves to a telephone on the night table.",
    "253": "Butch peers around a wall, taking in the vital information, walks out of the alley, and is ready for anything. He crosses the street and enters his apartment courtyard in North Hollywood, where everything appears normal: the laundry room, the pool, and his apartment door are undisturbed. Butch climbs the stairs to his apartment, number 12, steps outside the door, listens inside, and slowly inserts the key, quietly opening it to find that his apartment hasn't been touched. He cautiously steps inside, shuts the door, takes a quick look around, walks into his modest kitchen, and opens the refrigerator before going to the bedroom. His bedroom, like the rest of the apartment, is neat, clean, and anonymous, and sure enough, the watch is as he said it was—on the bedside table, hanging on his little kangaroo statue. He walks through the apartment back into the kitchen, opens a cupboard, takes out a box of Pop Tarts, puts down the milk, opens the box, takes out two Pop Tarts, and puts them in the toaster. Butch glances to his right and sees a small compact Czech M61 submachine gun with a huge silencer on the kitchen counter, which makes him laugh out loud. As he laughs, he flips a tape in the cassette player, and when the music starts, he sings along with it. He drives by the apartment but is stopped at the light on the corner across from Teriyaki Donut, still chuckling and singing along with the song. Marsellus Wallace exits Teriyaki Donut, carrying a box of a dozen donuts and two large styrofoam cups of coffee, steps off the curb, and crosses the street in front of Butch's car. Laughing boy stops when he sees Marsellus in front of him; Marsellus casually glances at Butch, continues walking, and Butch stomps on the gas pedal. The Honda slams into Marsellus, sending him, the donuts, and the coffee hitting the pavement at thirty miles an hour. Butch cuts into cross traffic and is broad-sided by a gold Camaro Z-28, breaking all the windows in the Honda and sending it up on the sidewalk. Butch sits dazed and confused in the crumpled mess of what was Fabienne's Honda, with blood flowing from his nostrils, as a pedestrian pokes his head inside. Marsellus Wallace lies sprawled out in the street, gawkers gather around the body, and the yelling makes Marsellus come to.",
    "459": "Inigo pushes slowly off from the wall again and attacks, slashing with wondrous skill, but none of his blows get through, so he moves forward as Count Rugen retreats more quickly around the table. Inigo drives for the Count's left shoulder, thrusts home where the Count had gotten him, and then his blade enters the Count's right shoulder, the same spot where Inigo was wounded. The six-fingered sword strikes, creating a slash bleeding along one of Rugen's cheeks; the great sword flashes again, leaving a parallel slash on Rugen's other cheek. Inigo, moving almost too fast for the eye to follow, strikes one final time, hitting dead center, and the sword is clear through the Count. They are almost frozen like that for a moment, then Inigo withdraws his sword, and the Count pitches down, lying dead. Rugen’s skin is ashen, and blood pours from the parallel cuts on his cheeks, with his eyes bulging wide, full of fear, while Inigo stares at him. Westley lies as before, unmoving with his head on the headboard, Yellin's sword at his side, as Buttercup is alongside the bed, her eyes never leaving his face. Humperdinck enters the room, staring at them, and pulls out his sword. Westley lies there comfortably, speaks quietly at first, gripping his sword, and then stops, as a look of fear returns to Humperdinck’s eyes. Humperdinck tries to hide the growing fear inside him, while Westley stares at him and slowly begins to move, turning his body, placing his feet on the floor, and standing with his sword in a fighting position. Prince Humperdinck, in a state of panic, doesn’t know whether to pee or wind his watch, eventually throws his sword to the floor. Westley speaks to Buttercup as Humperdinck sits, and as she sets to work, Inigo enters, looking around. Humperdinck begins wrestling with his bonds as they look at each other, then move to the balcony, where Fezzik stands below, leading four great white horses. He glances up to see them on the balcony as Inigo, Westley, and Buttercup look down at him. Fezzik holds out his arms as Buttercup floats through the air, jumping from the balcony so Fezzik can catch her, and her fall, appearing in slow motion, resembles flying.",
    "1354": "Alice, unexpectedly full of depth and truth in her role, begins to cry while performing her lines, stunning Charles, who watches in awe, feeling giddily transported. Joe, as he stares, becomes galvanised, realizing his interest in Alice has solidified, while Martin is taken aback by the passion and heart of her performance. During the heat of the moment, Alice looks at Charles, unsure, as he runs to her and takes her script pages. They prepare to film Alice with an approaching train in the background, as Charles puts on the headphones, and they start shooting. Joe glances back at the headlights and notices the distant vehicle turning onto the tracks, becoming unsettled. As the train passes them, Alice and Martin continue to yell their lines, and Charles is almost laughing at how good it looks, but Joe desperately looks back at the headlights. Joe swings the microphone down and yells, prompting everyone to run off. The train wheels' odd, dying chugs and screeches run out of momentum, accompanied by hisses of steam and the unnatural bending of steel. In the dust, Joe lies frightened on the ground with his eyes tightly shut, his mind racing and heart pounding, until he hears a loud metal bang. Joe quickly stands up and sees a mountain of twisted steel with upside-down train cars piled around him, realising he narrowly avoided being crushed. Hearing another metallic sound, Joe backs up, frightened by the labored groaning, whether mechanical or animal. As the crazy screeches and bangs continue, Joe grips his necklace locket tightly until a loud crash occurs, and a twisted ten-foot square train sliding door stabs the ground twenty feet away. Joe, stunned, turns to see the door and back to the noise's direction, but it's gone. Meanwhile, Charles' camera, on its side, finishes recording. Joe moves toward the camera, with Cary appearing behind him, smiling, having enjoyed the crash. As Joe whips around, he sees Alice standing in the dusty mess, shaken but alive. Joe beams, then suddenly realizes something and moves to the blood, reaching below the wheels as the others watch in horror. Joe pulls out his crushed makeup kit and brightens. They all move toward Preston, except for Cary, who heads off, to discover crates spilling from a nearby split car, many shattered, revealing thousands of small white-metal cubes littering the ground.",

DANTE dips his fingers into the shoe polish and writes large letters on the unfurled sheet, leaning on the cooler. DANTE stands on a garbage can and tucks a corner of the sheet under the awning. He jumps down. The banner reads I ASSURE YOU, WE'RE OPEN. The door sign shifts from CLOSED to OPEN. The clock reads 6:20. DANTE leans behind the counter, the morning routine completed. He stares ahead, catatonic, then drops his head in his hands. The store, with its makeshift banner looming in the dim morning hour, just after dawn. A car drives by. DANTE waits on a customer (ACTIVIST) buying coffee. The ACTIVIST leans on a briefcase and drinks his coffee. Another CUSTOMER leans in the door. The ACTIVIST lifts his briefcase onto the counter. He opens it and extracts a sickly-looking lung model. The ACTIVIST hands him something from the briefcase. Hands him a picture. The CUSTOMER exits. Another CUSTOMER comes up to the counter.

JAY pulls off his coat and swings it into the arms of SILENT BOB. SILENT BOB lights a smoke. SILENT BOB points to something off-screen. SILENT BOB nods. JAY makes blow job faces down an imaginary line of guys, looking quite like a performing seal. He throws a little humming sound behind each nod. He then hops up quickly. The small crowd begins to chant and jeer in DANTE's face. VERONICA enters and surveys the mess. The CROWD throws cigarettes at DANTE, pelting him in the face. Suddenly, a loud blast is heard, and white powder explodes over the throng. Everyone turns to face VERONICA as she stands in one of the freezer cases, holding a fire extinguisher. The CROWD looks among themselves. Someone points to O.C. The ACTIVIST carries his briefcase surreptitiously toward the door. VERONICA jumps off the freezer case, training the nozzle of the extinguisher on the ACTIVIST. She pokes the extinguisher nozzle at him, warningly. He reaches into his briefcase. He pulls out a business card and hands it to her. She reads it. He nods. He nods again. She blasts him with more chemical as he exits. He quickly flees. The CROWD sheepishly exits, one by one, offering apologetic glances. VERONICA watches the crowd disperse, disgusted. DANTE tries to regain his composure. The last of the crowd exits. DANTE is sitting on the floor, head in his folded arms. She slaps him.",
    "126": "She snaps the bag shut. He breaks off as a short, squatty woman, pushing a child in a walker, comes into sight and approaches. She stops beside Neff, who is pretending to read a label on a can. Phyllis puts a few cakes of soap into her basket. She nods. Neff reaches a can down from the high shelf and hands it to her. She moves away with her coffee and her child. Out of the corner of his eye Neff watches her go. He moves closer to Phyllis again. He goes off. She stares after him. He is wearing a light grey suit and has his hat on. He is standing behind his desk opening some mail, taking a few papers out of his briefcase, checking something in his rate book, making a quick telephone call. Keyes enters with some papers in his hand. The telephone rings on Neff's desk. Automatically Keyes grabs the phone and answers. Neff picks the phone up and answers. Phyllis is on the phone. Neff on the phone. His eye catches Keyes', who is walking up and down. He speaks into the phone as calmly as possible. Neff on phone. He covers the receiver with his hand and turns to Keyes, who is now standing at the window. He makes a gesture as if expecting Keyes to leave. Keyes stays right where he is. Neff looks at Keyes' back with a strained expression, then lifts the phone again. Neff on the phone. Neff gets up from his desk. He punches his stomach with his fist. Keyes nods slowly, a little sad and a little ashamed. He goes out. Neff is alone. He watches the door close, then turns and goes slowly to the water cooler. He fills a paper cup and stands holding it. His thoughts are somewhere else. After a moment he absently throws the cupful of water into the receptacle under the cooler. He goes back to the desk. He takes his rate book out of his brief case and puts it on the desk. He leaves the office, with his briefcase under his arm. Neff's coupe comes down the street and swings into the garage and goes down the ramp into the basement. There are about eight cars parked. A colored attendant in coveralls and rubber boots is washing a car with a hose and sponge. Neff's car comes into the shot and stops near the attendant. Neff gets out with his briefcase under his arm. He is folding a hand towel and stuffing it into his jacket pocket. He then takes a large roll of adhesive tape and puts that into his pants pocket. Neff's hand places a small card against the bell clapper in each of these.",
    "1232": "A bald boy in a dressing gown and pajamas spots Ben, who smiles and nods before briefly returning to his reading. Ben takes a paper cup, sucks on the straw, and observes the boys and a woman, who smiles as she watches the boys. The bald boy glances shyly at Ben and then looks down. Behind them, in Ben's line of sight, Emily sits at a table by a window. Ben resumes reading. Emily, in a short strappy dress over a vest top, approaches Ben's table, glances at the bald boy, and speaks, prompting Ben to get out his ID. Ben smiles, puts Emily's files back in his briefcase, and leaves with a polite smile while Emily remains at the table, looking drained and dejected. A blue and white neon sign for the Travel Inn glows in the night as Ben arrives in his saloon outside the motel, gets out, and goes to the reception window. He goes to look through an open door, where a pudgy bearded guy spots him and comes out from behind a lacy curtain. Ben returns to the reception window where the guy greets him, then lets himself into a dark room, carrying his cases, placing his keys on a table, and shutting the door. In dim lamp light, Ben sits on his bed, takes a book and a file filled with newspaper cuttings out of his bag, and studies the first cutting intently, beneath which are photos of the seven people killed. Ben watches an ice hockey practice where two players collide and fight. Elsewhere, Emily puts the phone down, scans the room, opens French windows, and goes outside, shocked to find Ben feeding Duke. Duke pulls her, then pulls Ben. Emily gets a container out of her fridge while Ben studies documents. Emily stares astonished at him, brow furrowed, as he stares down at the table they're sitting at. She fiddles with her collar, while he smiles good-humoredly and considers. Once again, Emily looks astounded as Ben grins and looks down, and she blinks, taken aback, as the decision sinks in. Ben gets up, and they share a lingering look. He smiles broadly and heads out while Emily ponders. He turns back, and Emily walks up to him, as he stares at her with sad, gentle eyes, raising his eyebrows before looking serious. She stares at Ben and blinks as he gives an awkward, white-toothed grin and makes for the front door. They hold each other's gaze.",
    "137": "The scene unfolds in the dimly lit station, where the camera angle restricts our view. A sergeant is positioned on the station's low sloping roof, and nearby, the captain sharply addresses two of his detail. He slowly turns his head, mouth agape, surveying the scene before him. The platform is densely packed with waiting crowds, extending from the station house and onto the narrow street lined with homes, their rooftops teeming with men, women holding babies, and children. As Gandhi disembarks from the train, guided by Shukla with Ba and Charlie a step behind, he moves through the silent crowd, hands in the pranam, bowing slightly. The crowd parts quietly, their clothing indicating a Muslim area, some offering a salaam or tentatively returning the pranam to Gandhi as he passes. Faces in the crowd appear gaunt and lean. Suddenly, a commotion arises; the sound of boots precedes the English captain as he pushes through to face Gandhi in the aisle formed by the crowd. The sergeant and part of the detail follow behind the captain, who stares before glancing suspiciously at the crowd with a hint of inner fear, then back at Gandhi. There's a flicker of uncertain recognition before another authoritative glance at the crowd. The captain, shaken by Gandhi's composed demeanor, glances at Charlie standing behind Gandhi, which further undermines his confidence. Attempting severity, the captain's demeanor falters, his weak authority evident. Unsettled by Gandhi's steady gaze, he looks at Charlie again, feeling the emptiness of his own weakness. Finally, he briskly turns, shoving past the crowd. Where silence once prevailed, excitement buzzes as Gandhi, having already won a subtle victory, continues forward, exchanging pranams with the crowd's warm greetings. The early sunlight bathes the scene, highlighting Meha, a middle-aged man appearing ill and drawn, lying on a straw mat.",
    "1003": "He nods to Nick and takes a deep breath as Gatsby sneaks furtively into the kitchen area and peers through the flowers into the room. Watching from the door, Nick takes off his boater and gestures for Gatsby to tidy his hair, which he smooths back with his hand. Finally, appearing confident and relaxed and with the old familiar glint in his eyes, Gatsby steps towards the room where Nick stands beneath a tree in the rain. Drenched, Nick returns and sees Gatsby and Daisy deep in conversation, then he rattles a bowl in the sink to make his presence known, but Daisy and Gatsby don't notice and continue looking into each other's eyes, smiling at each other. Nick gives up, walks in, and takes off his coat. Gatsby glances at the window then returns his unwavering gaze to Daisy, whose dark eyes return his gaze adoringly. Gatsby smiles, gets up, and opens the French windows, revealing a bright blue sky peeping through the diminishing rainclouds as sunlight glimmers on the calm bay. They step out onto the porch, rest against a pillar, and their fingers touch as they look at each other. He points across the bay before Gatsby walks back inside, and they walk up the drive. Daisy looks up in wonder, surrounded by gushing fountains and ornamental palms, they look up at the house. Gatsby looks at Daisy, framed by the fountain, and an orange-squeezing machine is there. Daisy, Gatsby, and Nick swim on his private beach, and Gatsby dives from a diving pontoon out in the water while Nick films Daisy hitting a golf ball. They tumble into the ballroom where Daisy marvels at the monumental organ, and Gatsby takes Daisy and Nick on a tour. He throws shirts from a balcony, and Daisy flops onto the pile of brightly colored shirts on the bed as Nick looks down from the balcony in the opulent bedroom. Noticing the change in Daisy's mood, Gatsby goes down to the bed where she sits, strokes her chin, and she looks up at Nick, who walks away somberly as Gatsby kisses her brow. Nick walks down a spiral staircase and looks at a wall and a desk where pictures and trophies are displayed, including a photograph of a distinguished old man. Gatsby sits on his bed, holding Daisy close to him, and Daisy rests her head in Gatsby's lap and follows his gaze to the window and beyond. Nick walks over, takes a book from a shelf, and opens it, touched, Daisy runs her fingers over them. Gatsby goes to the other side of the room to answer the phone, turning his back to Nick and Daisy. Outside, a strong swelling breeze whips up on the balcony, blowing the French windows open, which Nick closes and listens to Gatsby.",
    "256": "A weaving knee-level tracking shot follows a six-year-old boy in shorts and a dirty T-shirt as he tramps around the trailer, brandishing a big stick, before shifting focus to Hi, who bends down to pull a couple of beers from the refrigerator, raising his voice to be heard over the din of children. As Hi considers the situation, he looks down, starts laughing, then catches himself, while the bam-shouting six-year-old bangs a stick on the TV and a kid in a cowboy hat slaps Hi on the ass. Hi takes a sip of beer and looks at another child finishing off the T in FART in crayon on the wall as Glen chuckles at his errant child, just before the sound of shattering glass is heard. Glen looks around, then Dot faces Hi and Ed across a picnic table covered with grilled hamburgers, rolls, a green jello mold, and a cooler, as one younger child occasionally flings jello at Hi, unnoticed by the two women. Hi sits stock-still with a stony face as Dot shrieks, then he shrugs and flinches at jello hitting his shoulder while Dot looks offscreen. The scene shifts to tracking on Hi and Glen walking side by side, with Glen sopping wet, in a swimming suit and wing-tipped shoes, his body ghostly pale except for a bright angry red V-area and arms below the short sleeve line. Glen bursts out laughing, slaps Hi on the back, and chuckles as he eyes Hi shrewdly. Both stop walking; Hi looks puzzled at Glen, who lays a companionable hand on Hi's shoulder and speaks confidentially, nodding energetically through clenched teeth, until THWAK - Hi's fist connects with Glen's jaw, sending him airborne and landing in a heap. Glen rubs his jaw groggily as Hi approaches menacingly, prompting Glen to run, with Hi pursuing. Glen, looking back, shouts at Hi but crashes into a tree and drops like a sack of cement. Later, Hi drives with his jaw rigidly set and temple throbbing, while Nathan Jr. sits in a safety seat between him and Ed.",
    "279": "The salesman has completed his cleaning of the case and is in the act of placing it on the floor. Jeff quickly lowers the binoculars and edges back a few inches. He watches a moment, then cautiously lifts the binoculars again. He turns and again glances out of the window. The man is now moving out of the living room, and the binoculars pan him through to the small kitchen, which is seen through a side window. The man starts to busy himself in this kitchen with his back to us, but the image is very unsatisfactory. Jeff lowers the binoculars, and there is an expression of exasperation on his face. He throws the binoculars down, and then looks about him. He backs his chair up quickly toward the main cabinet on his left. He leans down, opens a cupboard door, and takes out a long-focus lens. From a shelf above, he takes a small Exacta camera. He quickly takes off the existing lens and puts on the telephoto lens in its place. He wheels himself back to the window and raises the camera to his eye. Through the viewfinder of the camera, we are now brought into close proximity with the salesman in his little kitchen. His back is still to us. He half-turns and takes a used newspaper. He spreads it open along the drainboard. From the sink, he takes out a large butcher's knife and a long, narrow saw. They disappear from sight as he lays them on the newspaper and proceeds to wrap them up. Having completed his job, he emerges from the kitchen carrying the newspaper-wrapped parcel. For a moment, he is lost behind the wall that separates the kitchen recess from the living room. Jeff lowers the camera for a moment and watches tensely. Suddenly, he puts it up to his eye again. Half of a man's body is now seen in the living room. He sits down on a couch with a display of fatigue. He is not carrying anything. Then the salesman turns and moves to the center of the room. He yawns and stretches out of sight at full length on the couch. Jeff lowers the camera. He watches the living room for a moment, then his eye travels briefly back to the kitchen and returns to the living room. The thermometer outside of Jeff's window registers 83 degrees. The camera pans off to the left until it comes to rest on the songwriter's studio. He is dressed only in bathing trunks and is vigorously cleaning his rug with a carpet sweeper. In the middle of his sweeping, he stops, hurries a step or two to the piano, and plays a couple of notes with one hand while he stands.",
    "449": "The scene plays in dimness, save for the shaft of light from the entrance hall. Wick goes and sits beside Don, taking the glass from his hand, and then bends over Don to loosen his tie. Ignoring the sound of steps coming from the staircase, Wick rises, places the glass of whiskey on the table, and is about to head towards the telephone when the doorbell rings in a pattern of short, short, long, short. Wick freezes, and Don sits up on the couch, pulling himself up by clinging to Wick's arm. Wick pushes Don through the doorway into the dark bedroom and closes the door after him. Wick then snaps on the living room lights, rolls the empty bottle under the couch, and hides the glass of whiskey behind a pile of records. As Wick starts towards the door, the bottle rolls out from under the couch, so he stops to roll it back before going into the hall to open the door. Helen enters, and as she speaks, Wick tries to approach the bottle without her noticing. Suddenly, she sees Wick trying to kick the bottle back under the couch. Wick then walks over to the records, picks up the glass, and listens with his head against the doorpost, harassed. Helen comes into the living room, and Wick takes a drink. Wick stands, startled with the glass of whiskey in hand, as Don enters unsteadily. Almost at the door to the entrance hall, Helen turns back into the room, staring at Don and beginning to realize that he's drunk. Don looks at the glass in Wick's hand, takes it from him, opens a drawer, removes two bullets, and holds them in his palm. Helen looks at him for a second, then removes and tosses her hat into a chair. Wick goes into the kitchenette, and Helen raises herself to her tiptoes to kiss him warmly. Meanwhile, Nat and Don are alone, with Nat behind the bar putting toothpicks into olives and arranging them on a plate. Don jumps up, runs to the bookcase, and starts pulling out books row by row. He goes to the closet, opens it wide, and throws all its contents on the floor before returning to the big chair to collapse, exhausted. His eyes again fall on the empty bottle and the empty glass, noticing something written on it distorted by the glass.",
    "1141": "Later, the pace hots up and the hall is jumping, with Tiny Professor Flitwick being passed over the heads of the dancers. To Parvati and Padma's annoyance, Harry and Ron won't dance, so the four of them sit glumly at the end of the room while Hermione dances wildly with Viktor, and Ron and Harry glare at Krum. Parvati is asked to dance, and she gets up with relief as Padma looks exasperated. Ron spots Krum kissing Hermione's hand before Viktor leaves her, and she spins around, her face flushed, before smiling happily as she sinks down beside Harry, Ron, and Padma. Ron gives a great sigh, and Hermione gets up to speak but thinks better of it, turns her back, and walks off, prompting Padma to glare at Ron before getting up and stalking off. Later, Ron tries to reason with Hermione, who wipes away a tear as the boys escape up the stairs. Meanwhile, Hermione flops miserably on the bottom step, takes off her party shoes, and rubs her feet. Neville is still dancing with Ginny, and Hagrid rests his head on Madame Maxime's chest, but his hand slips to her bottom and she puts it firmly back on her waist. Disturbed by the bell, crows rise into the darkness and swoop between the tall towers past one or two lighted windows, while snowflakes whirl outside the boys' bedroom. A large black crow flutters down onto the windowsill and peers in, while asleep in bed, Harry is having a nightmare. He sees the dark cemetery with the winged stone statue and the cloaked skeleton clutches the long scythe, with a snow-covered mansion behind it. Along the dusty paneled corridor, light shines from the open door, inside which Wormtail hovers as the young man kneels beside the armchair, revealing the dark mark tattooed on his arm, and a large snake whispers to the figure hidden in the armchair. A green flash occurs, and Harry's eyes spring open as Neville appears with his dancing shoes slung around his neck, waltzes off, and Harry smiles. Hermione looks concerned as Harry walks away, and Harry looks weary and nods, as Cedric gives Harry a knowing smile and goes. In the prefect's bathroom, Harry slips off his dressing gown and lowers himself into a bath the size of a small swimming pool, leans back under the bubbles, and is watched by a mermaid in a stained glass window who holds back her long golden hair. Harry turns to the golden egg standing on the side of the bath and opens it, but slams it shut again as a ghostly figure appears out of the lavatory, floats toward him, and dives into the bubbles. Harry grabs the egg, twists it open under the water, and as the egg glows brightly, Harry takes a deep breath and sinks down after it before bursting to the surface.",
    "470": "In a dimly lit room cluttered with disorder, with candlelight flickering and Leopold's portrait watching, papers cover the table, dirty dishes stack in the fireplace, and Mozart's Masonic apron lies on the forte-piano. Standing beside Constanze, who is asleep and worn out, an ill-looking Mozart approaches his sleeping son Karl, tenderly adjusting the child's blanket and resting his head beside him. Constanze awakens to see him, and Mozart rises, returning to their shared space. Suddenly, he gleefully dances alone, gesturing rudely at his father's portrait, reverting for a moment to childlike joy, until a gentle knock on the door interrupts him. As the music fades, Mozart opens the door to a masked stranger, turns to indicate Constanze, and Salieri observes them both before departing down the stairs, leaving Mozart to shut the door and close his eyes in fear, avoiding Constanze's tearful gaze. A sharp scream from Madame Weber transitions into the Queen of the Night's aria from The Magic Flute, revealing a fantastically dressed Queen urging her daughter on stage, as a captivated audience of German citizens watches in the rearranged theatre from which Schikaneder later arrives at Salieri's door, still in bird make-up with three actresses as attendants in The Magic Flute. Salieri empties a bag of coins in front of a shocked Mozart, then begins to write the key signature, guiding the composition by humming and conducting the bass vocal line.",
    "1067": "Nullah stares into the distance as Sarah rides up to the house. Drover comes out the back door, and she freezes, keeping her back to him. On the porch, he turns slowly and looks at her, then walks towards Magarri and the horses as her eyes fill with tears. She whirls around and goes back indoors as he rides away. Nullah's dog attacks a cop chasing him, and he turns slowly to look into the eyes of a half-naked black tracker. Callahan finds Fletcher at the movies. King George is flung into a cell as Nullah is dragged away. Sarah drives through crowds on the wharf where troopships crowd Darwin harbor. Nullah is with a group of half-caste children being shipped out as his grandfather hears in his cell. Sarah drives past lines of marching troops while Nullah stares at the white boy. Troops and civilians swarm towards the wharf, and Sarah stops at a barrier and gets out of the car. Callahan drags the white boy away as a priest pulls Nullah. Crocodile boots stop in front of him, and Nullah looks up into Fletcher's face. Sarah barges her way anxiously through the crowd on the wharf as smoke rises from ships' funnels. The priest leads Nullah to a waiting boat while Fletcher observes slyly. As Sarah runs down the wharf, Nullah runs to the stern of the boat. The small boat pulls out of the shadow of the huge liners evacuating the town. The boy looks up at Sarah, and Fletcher grins. Nullah waves to Sarah, who stops at the end of the wharf. Fletcher leans on the railing next to her as the boat sails away. He turns smugly to her, grins, and saunters off. On the back of the boat, Nullah turns and looks up at a priest as Sarah leans on the wharf rail in despair, trying to control her sobs. The children's boat sails away from the wharf between huge, grey navy vessels. A Japanese fighter skims through the clouds towards an island. Sarah steps out onto the balcony and looks out over the harbor. She looks across at Drover, who's standing thoughtfully by a tree. As he whistles, Magarri stares at Drover, who looks uncomfortable and tentatively lays his hand on the tree. Magarri turns away, and tears fill Drover's eyes. Their vehicles raise a cloud of dust on the other side of the river they are camping next to. Clouds fill the sky as fighters take off at dawn from an aircraft carrier. Mission Island sits peacefully in the grey sea, beneath the cloudy sky. The children are asleep in their dormitory when Nullah wakes up with a start. Smiling unpleasantly, Fletcher hangs up the phone in his office overlooking the whole of Darwin.",
    "926": "He takes the metal case and walks out, and a small car comes flying round a corner. He hesitates and clocks her handbag, opening it without her seeing. There's a guy on a moped behind them. She streaks across the traffic, causing coffins, and the moped guy has to stop. The brunette, with high cheek bones, turns the little car into an alley off the road, while their pursuer tries to work out where they've gone. She pouts sexily and gestures to the case. They look through papers as the moped guy looks for them, but the papers are all blank. He grabs her wrist as she fires, and then, as the moped gets closer, he jumps out of the car. He turns to see the moped guy approaching, flips the bike out from under him, kicks him in the face, then rides off. He's a few cars behind the girl, riding impassively and following the girl's little bronze car. They arrive at a quay where boats are being unloaded. Furiously, she storms past a guard in dark glasses, and Bond rides onto the quay, clocking the guard in a floral shirt carrying a sub-machine gun. The girl strides into an office as an official stamps a docket, standing over the Frenchman while the thin German speaker looks nervous. There's a body floating in the water under the quay, and a powerful speedboat approaches. He gives the guard a card and looks up at a security camera before walking off, as the German in square shades looks at a card from Universal Exports. Bond activates the tracking function on his phone. Pay attention next time. He approaches the heavyset general with the bushy mustache. He holds up a map, and the general eyeballs the little Frenchman, takes the map nodding. The girl glares at them, and he waves her over. A burly hand grabs her arm, and Bond watches with a frown before riding away. Camille is led to the speedboat. Bond rides through the busy docks, standing in the saddle to look around. Dominic waves an ironic goodbye as the boat with Camille on it pulls away, and she looks with sultry hatred in his direction. Bond jumps the bike off the quay into a boat, rides over some crates, jumps onto another boat, then abandons the machine. The launch is heading towards a huge luxury cruiser, and Bond runs across the closely packed boats crammed with merchandise. He leaps onto a small launch, pulls the starting cord on the outboard motor, and starts to shadow the general's boat. He rams the boat, and Dominic watches in disbelief as the crew on the cruise grabs weapons and jumps into an inflatable. Bond boards the launch, and Camille grabs a gun but Bond knocks it into the water, grabs her, and drags her off the boat into his.",
    "1283": "Stunned people pick themselves up off the ground as the vast metallic-skinned robot stands immobile with the sphere swirling in light and vapor behind it. The visitor's body is rushed to a medical facility on a covered gurney, with Helen accompanying it. A sarcophagus-like gurney is wheeled to a prefab hut in a hangar where the protective cover is unsealed. Mike looks baffled while Helen glances at him, and his scalpel cuts into the patient's gray, gelatinous skin, causing the gray skin to come apart as the surgeon drops the bullet into a sample tube. Helen slowly shakes her head as the surgeon, wearing a suit that even covers his feet, drops lumps of blubbery flesh into a basin. On the operating table, the naked, slime-covered body of a man curls up into a fetal position, and Mike and Helen stare in disbelief. The patient lies under a protective tent attended by a technician before Helen enters the room, descending three steps from the gallery area where she was watching, and cautiously approaches the tent. She peers in and sees the man's eyes fluttering. The patient begins thrashing around inside the tent, and Mike comes in to check a monitor. The Secretary's chopper touches down at Fort Linwood while the being lies on a gurney wearing gray hospital pajamas and an oxygen mask. Officials stand at a window overlooking the room as, watched closely by Helen, Mike removes the oxygen mask and offers the being a cup of water, which he takes and draws shakily towards him. They all watch him intently, the Secretary taking a step towards him as he uses both hands to steady the plastic beaker, while they all stare. Regina glances at the scientists as Helen steps forward to help him put down the cup, noting that he looks just like the climber from 1928. His head swivels towards her. Helen enters a storeroom with shelves full of vials of drugs, leans back against the door to compose herself, then takes a hypodermic in a sealed packet from a glass cabinet, putting it in her pocket and scanning the shelves. The agent hands her a vial which she pockets along with a vial of saline solution, then goes to the syringe cabinet, opens, and closes the door before turning around and holding up the syringe packet for the benefit of the suspicious agent. Jaw thrust forward, Regina eyeballs Klaatu, and having swapped the two vials, Helen approaches him, rolls up his sleeve, and jabs the hypodermic into his arm. The Defense Secretary watches dispassionately then turns away as Klaatu's dark eyes stare at Helen. Three military policemen surround Helen and escort her from the room as Klaatu glances down at his arm while the agent from the drugstore comes in, and they eyeball one another.",
    "522": "Holly stays under the awning as Mickey walks to the curb and looks angrily back at her. People pass by while Mickey walks back and forth from the curb to Holly, becoming angrier. A taxi pulls up, and Mickey and Holly walk to the rear door. Mickey holds the door open for Holly, who gets in and then slams the door. Mickey starts walking along the sidewalk as the taxi drives off, passing the hotel and several evening-lit store windows. Both a bus and a taxi drive down the street, blocking Mickey from view. In the reflection of a mirror over a dresser, Elliot and Lee can be seen dancing cheek to cheek; they dance into view. Elliot picks up a glass of champagne and hands it to Lee, who sips. Elliot sips from his glass and returns it to the dresser. They embrace tightly, continuing to dance. Elliot, Hannah, and the twins are sitting at the dining room table. Hannah shows her two adopted children how a small camera works while they observe, fascinated. Elliot looks listless and stares blankly at the table. One child takes the camera from Hannah and picks up another identical one. The adopted children leave with the twins. After they're gone, Hannah sips her coffee and looks at Elliot, then puts her cup down while still watching him. Hannah sighs, and Elliot angrily throws his napkin on the table, stands up, paces behind her, and sits back down beside her with a ketchup bottle in front of him. The camera moves in on Elliot's anguished face as he looks down. Hannah tenderly puts her hand on his shoulder, touches his hand, and Elliot embraces her. Elliot kisses Hannah and they embrace tightly while she touches his hair. A metal staircase next to a large white column appears on screen; Holly and Hannah's voices are heard as they walk up the stairs into view. A man carrying a shopping bag walks down the steps past them. Holly follows Hannah to a rack of blouses; Hannah takes a jacket off the rack, looks at it, and holds it to herself. Turning to Holly with surprise, she puts the jacket back on the rack, inhales, and stares at her sister, who watches with a frown. Hannah then looks at the rack of clothes on Holly's side and takes a blouse off to examine it.",
    "1355": "Joe kneels and picks something up as Cary calls out from behind, having climbed the angled sides of overturned train cars. They move up the mass of metal to reveal a vast view of the wreck, which seems to stretch on forever. Cary points to a pick-up truck thrown fifty yards from the main wreckage, sheared in half and lying in the overgrown grass. As the kids approach from the wreckage, the sight stuns them, and they stop. Inside the crushed truck is Dr. Woodward, 75, seat-belted, bloody, and unconscious. Alice, scared and sad, moves closer and nudges him, realizing he appears dead as his arm drops limp, revealing a paper that falls to the ground. Joe picks up the paper and unfolds it, revealing an old, off-white map. They hold it up and see marker writing on it, a black line from Nevada to Dayton, with numbers along the way. Suddenly, a trembling hand appears and rips the map away, causing them all to scream as Dr. Woodward is revealed, with bloody eyes open and in a daze. Speechless, they finally react but distant voices make Joe turn his head to see through the wreck. Their minds racing, the kids start moving away. Charles grabs his camera as Alice hurries past, searching for her keys while eyeing the approaching flashlight men. Joe grabs his make-up kit and runs to the car, followed by the boys as Alice slams the car into reverse, narrowly avoiding debris and driving away as the flashlight men—soldiers—arrive with adrenaline pumping. Colonel Nelec steps up to the camera, eyeing the vanishing car suspiciously, then looks down at a fresh, empty yellow Super 8 film box, picks it up, examines it, then back at the disappearing car. His burning eyes focus before the Buick speeds past with a roar, as Charles obsesses over his camera amidst the overlapping mayhem.",
    "306": "Freddy enters the frame from the same direction he exited in the previous scene, finishing his sentence, and in a wider shot, he is seen performing his monologue to Holdaway in a parking lot while pacing back and forth. Freddy, Joe, Nice Guy Eddie, and Mr. White sit around a table in a red-lit, smokey bar. Freddy is then standing in front of six Los Angeles County Sheriffs and one German Shepherd, with all eyes on him. Everyone is frozen, resulting in a freeze frame of Freddy in front of the sheriffs. A slow 360-degree shot is taken around Freddy in the men's room, followed by a 360-degree camera move around the men. The dog barks, and a sheriff yells at it to quiet down. A couple of sheriffs look at Freddy off-screen, but turn their attention to Sheriff #2 as he continues his story. The camera pans from the sheriffs to Freddy, who is up against the urinal, pretending to urinate, and then continues to pan with him. A sheriff is sitting on a sink, and Freddy finishes washing his hands, goes to dry them but there are only hand drying machines. He turns one on, and a close-up shows his hands being blown dry. Mr. Orange looks from left to right. The machine turns off, Freddy turns, and walks out of the room. Joe lights a cigar, and Freddy answers it, with the camera following the receiver up to his face. A close-up shows Nice Guy Eddie speaking into the car phone before placing the receiver back in its cradle. The camera follows Freddy as he hops around the apartment, getting everything he needs, puts on his jacket, and exits frame. Inside an unmarked car across the street, two cops see Freddy walk out of his building and up to Eddie's parked car. Freddy gets into the car driven by Nice Guy Eddie, with Mr. Pink in the passenger seat, and they pull into traffic as the car laughs, reacts horribly, and laughs again. The camera tracks across the men's faces, Joe points a finger, and everybody laughs. The camera leaves the team and focuses on a blackboard with a layout of the jewelry store. The outside of the jewelry store is shown, a car whips around the corner into the alley, the doors burst open, and Mr. White hops out.

    "439": "The scene begins with individuals wearing terry-cloth bathrobes over their pajamas and canvas slippers on their feet. Among the listless, burned-out group, Don moves with purpose and has canvas slippers on his feet. Around him, about thirty alcoholics are sitting and milling aimlessly. The space is L-shaped and about fourteen feet wide. Don moves around the bend of the ell towards a heavy wooden door with a grated peephole beside which stands a uniformed guard. He tries to open the door, but at that moment, another male nurse opens it, carrying a pile of clean sheets and pillowcases. Don attempts to take advantage of the open door to escape, but the guard pulls him back by the arm, while the entering nurse locks the door with his key. Don turns, and at the bend of the corridor, he sees Bim holding a tumbler of medicine. Don slowly approaches Bim, who eventually seats him on his bed. It is lighted by a faint blue light, with light from the anteroom coming through the glass doors. On his cot, Don lies with his eyes wide open. He pivots towards a sound and observes a man in the corner with a sensitive face and an addiction to beetles. The man is slapping wildly at his bed, moaning, then rises to slap the wall and scream. Don watches through the dimness as two male nurses with flashlights rush to the DT victim's cot, leading to a wild struggle as the patient fights them off. One nurse races back to the door to call for assistance. A third nurse arrives, throws a straitjacket to the first nurse, and hurries to another bed. Seen through the glass doors, a doctor runs down the anteroom, followed by another male nurse with a cart carrying hypodermic syringes. The doctor enters the ward and heads towards the beetle patient, tossing his dark blue overcoat onto the empty cot next to Don as he runs. Don looks after the doctor, who, along with the nurses, works over the beetle patient, administering a hypo and securing him in a straitjacket. As the doctor's gaze reaches Don's pajama trousers and canvas slippers, the scene captures the chaotic and tense environment in the ward.",
    "645": "The teacher sees Salim and Jamal. The boys fight over the book, and he grabs the book and whacks it over Jamal's head. In the present day, back in the police station, Srinivas inserts a VHS into a player. Jamal is slumped in a chair opposite the inspector's desk, and Srinivas slaps Jamal, who then stares at the ground. The inspector points the remote control at the TV. The five-year-old Jamal squats over a hole in a makeshift shanty toilet while Salim sits guard outside. A man rushes down towards the toilets as Prakash leans over painfully. Jamal pulls his pants up, and old clips of Amitabh's 70's action films play. A helicopter flies over Jamal's roofless loo. Salim jams his chair against the door, locking Jamal in. Through a hole in the wall, Jamal sees hundreds of men, women, and children flock to the runway. He kicks the door in vain and takes out of his pocket a creased photo of his hero, Amitabh Bachchan. He looks down through the hole in the floor to the cesspit beneath, looks from the cesspit to the photo and back, then pinches his nose and jumps, keeping one arm aloft to hold the photo clear of the effluent. Amitabh descends from his helicopter to cheering crowds. Jamal appears covered from head to toe in excrement, dashes towards Amitabh, making his way through the crowds of photographers and onlookers. Salim stands at the front of the crowd, hemmed in by security. In the distance, we see Jamal running, holding onto his photo of Amitabh. The crowd parts for stinking Jamal, who makes straight for Amitabh. Salim stares at his brother in disbelief as people hold their noses. Amitabh signs the photo and hands it back to Jamal. A hazy orange sun rises above the teeming streets, slums, and skyscrapers of Mumbai. Jamal's mother scrubs him with soap while Salim looks back at his brother mischievously and disappears. A man sits next to a film projector in a cinema as Salim enters the projectionist's booth and shows him Jamal's autographed photo of Amitabh. The man thrusts the photo into the light from the projector, hands Salim two coins, and Salim winks and salutes the man, then bumps into Jamal outside. Jamal is on the video, and the policemen stare at him. Jamal concentrates hard and smiles briefly. Trains speed through a slum as Jamal's mother washes brightly colored clothing in a pool while young Jamal and Salim frolic in the water. Their mother smiles at the two boys playing but suddenly turns to look at the trains, worried and scared. The train passes by, revealing a crowd of men wielding clubs, knives, and axes running towards them, and people drop what they are doing and flee.",

Valjean and Javert hurry out across the factory yard and down the muddy track beyond to discover a heavily laden cart has toppled onto the cart driver, Fauchelevent, the worker seen before taking a rest on a crate. The cart driver and the Foreman are trying to lift the cart off the crushed man, but it is too heavy, and the ground is too soft. Valjean, Javert, and Javert's assistant all hurry to help, but they cannot get a proper purchase in the spongy ground. Fauchelevent screams as the cart slowly sinks in the mud. He throws himself under the cart at this higher end and braces himself to lift it from beneath. At one end, the wheels of the cart have stopped sinking because the ground is harder here. Valjean goes to help Fauchelevent. Valjean holds Javert's gaze, challenging him to say more. Javert is not yet confident enough to continue. Fantine presses on down the steps, trying to ignore the sailors. They spot Fantine, mistaking her for a whore. The sailors then see whores start to appear from the shadows of warehouse doorways. The few men in the street choose their whores and disappear by the end of the chorus. A man selling dentures stands by his cart and we hear fragments of his sales pitch. Fantine walks down the steps with short hair, mocked by the voices of the whores on either side. Fantine heads to the tooth man. A pimp and the head whore watch her progress as the organ-grinder grinds out the music. Fantine looks towards the tooth man and the head whore. The pimp pushes her down. She grabs Fantine's cheeks and forces open her mouth to inspect her teeth. She opens her mouth, and the pincers go in as everyone gathers round to watch. Fantine screams as the first tooth is removed. The pimp is passing among the whores, checking that they are all fit for business. He moves in on Fantine. Fantine looks up, a trickle of blood in one corner of her mouth. The whores cluster around her, hands reaching out to draw her into their world. On the rotting warship, more whores appear out of the gaps of the hull to sing the chorus. Whore 3 bites her fingertip and applies her blood to rouge Fantine's cheeks. The whores perform for the benefit of Fantine on the orders of the head whore, as the head whore leads her towards the hulk. Whores sing from the warehouse doorways, from on top of the spars of the ships, writhing around figureheads and from the rotting ship. The pimp leads the captain down the middle of the whores to Fantine who wears a filthy white dress.",
    "787": "Marcus looks incredulously at Willie who drags on a fag. In a boxing setting, Marcus talks to the kid, who is his opponent, and Marcus looks him over. The kid steps forward and kicks Marcus in the crotch, doubling him up. He punches the kid low, whacks Willie in the balls too, and hits Marcus in the nuts, resulting in all three combatants lying, writhing in agony, on the canvas. Willie turns to the kid, and they kick at each other. That night, Grandma has collapsed in front of the TV in the lounge when Willie and Sue come in and see her. Granny lies back on the sofa, deathly still, with her mouth agape. They walk a little closer, and Willie goes over to her. Sue looks on anxiously as Willie bends over Granny, then he looks around at Sue, holds his hand in front of Grandma’s mouth, and checks for a heartbeat. Granny suddenly comes to. Later on, in a bedroom, a black rug is spread out on the floor, with odd discarded clothes lying on it. Nearby, Sue lies on her back in her bra and jeans, while a bare-chested Willie sits astride her, wearing his jeans and a Santa hat. He leans down and seductively licks from her navel up to her bra, then leans forward and kisses her. He kisses his way back down her body, grips her pants between his teeth, and pulls on them just as the kid comes in through the door. The kid hands Willie a roughly carved bit of wood with a ribbon around it. Mystified, Willie looks at it and holds up his injured hand, looking moved. Sue props herself up on her elbows. Willie stares at the pickle, and Sue smiles. Willie stares at her, looks at her, nods to himself, smiles, and shrugs. The next morning, Willie is back in his Santa gear and rooting around in the fridge in the kitchen when the kid runs in. Willie takes the report card, puts it down, and stops buttering toast. Thurman looks down sadly, and Willie angrily throws down his knife, struck dumb. Thurman picks up his report card and heads out of the kitchen. Willie watches him go, a thoughtful expression crossing his face. At night, Marcus and Lois sit in the van in the deserted mall car park watching the staff entrance and see Gin come out. Marcus and Lois watch as Gin gets in his big Chevrolet car and drives off. Gin drives down a deserted unlit road, where he sees a light swinging from side to side and the vans up the roadside.",
    "508": "At a Comic Book show during a book-signing, Holden sits at a table beside a large mock-up of a comic book cover featuring two stoner superheroes who resemble familiar drug dealers, and he hands the book back to a fan, offering a patronizingly kind half-smile in return. Across from a barely-standing fan, Banky signs the book of another collector and momentarily freezes up, but he composes himself and continues signing as a little kid steps up while the collector lingers. Holden accepts a comic from another fan and then looks to his left, freaking out as Banky is throttling the collector from across the table, with the collector attempting to fight him off. Security guards pull them apart and drag the collector away, while Holden grabs Banky. Hooper fills the frame, presenting himself as a typical pro-black/anti-white homeboy, and during his speech, Holden and Banky enter and sit up front. Hooper whips his head around, searching for the source of a comment, and then explodes, pulling a nine millimeter from his belt, drawing on Banky, and firing. Banky goes down, falling into the crowd as it screams and starts to scatter, while Hooper jumps over the table and raises his fists in the air. As the crowd disperses, Holden remains seated, laughing, and Hooper steps off the stage to pick Banky's head up off the floor, sounding different, almost gay, prompting Banky to smile. They turn to see a beautiful, blonde, ruffled-haired angel named Alyssa swinging her purse in a circle. Holden hits him, and Banky seethes, offering Holden a puzzled glance and then nodding to Hooper. Holden, Banky, Alyssa, and Hooper sit around a table drinking, talking, and smoking, until Banky and Hooper exit, leaving Alyssa and Holden alone at the table. Alyssa laughs as Holden smiles, and then a dart hits the board while another hits the wall beside it. Alyssa winds up with another dart as Holden watches and, through the window, sees a couple making out on the hood of a car. Alyssa exits to the night, and Holden stares after her. Two beats later, Hooper and Banky enter holding an 'Everything's Archie' comic between them, and Banky runs out as Holden shrugs at Hooper, who is tending bar in a club where people are mingling, a band is playing, and it's loud. The guy sips his drink, and Holden enters to see on the dance floor, amidst a thrall of people, Alyssa dancing like a cat and looking very sexy. Hooper, Holden, and Banky stare off camera as Holden smacks Banky and moves to exit, with Banky looking around.",
    "1350": "A soldier hurries off as Joe leads the group, and they pause to look back at the neighborhood under fire, with houses being destroyed as collateral damage. An explosion hits too close, causing the boys to scream and run between houses, tracked by explosions with varying proximity. They make it to a back door, enter a house, and take cover, silhouetted by explosion light from the windows. Out of breath, they find themselves in a strange kitchen when a loud explosion makes the light fixtures sway. Charles grabs a coke on the counter just as another loud blast occurs, accompanied by the sound of glass breaking and a creature roaring, visible in silhouette moving past the bay window, leading Joe to realize that the creature's presence coincides with the blasts. Joe runs, and the others follow, but as they reach the living room, a huge explosion blows out a wall, causing them all to fall, with Martin's leg ripped by concrete. Blood shows that Martin is in real pain, prompting Charles to use the tie from the curtains to fashion a tourniquet, which he wraps tightly around Martin's leg. Charles looks at Martin, cannot argue, and nods at Joe, who looks to Cary as Martin screams. Joe and Cary then run through the devastated neighborhood, past shattered houses and obliterated cars, the only figures in town. They stop at the graves, out of breath, and then run through the graveyard to a series of garage doors, trying the first with windows caked with dirt, then the second door, and finally a locked barn door. Together, they kick the door repeatedly until it opens, revealing a shed with a floor that drops forty feet down, with dirt piled along the sides. Catching their breath, Cary opens his backpack and takes out a Fourth of July sparkler.",
    "94": "Jerry stares at her and then explodes, getting angrily off his feet. He yanks his parka from a hook behind the opened door, grabs a pair of galoshes, and stamps out the door. Marge stares, and after a long moment, her stare breaks as she pulls a clipboard toward her that holds a form from the General Motors Finance Corporation. She glances idly around the office, noticing another picture of Jean. Marge looks at it, looks around, for some reason at the ceiling, and then idly around again. Her look abruptly locks as Jerry makes a left turn into traffic and she grabs the phone to punch in a number. Grimsrud says nothing as, disgusted, Carl pockets the gun and heads for the door. We pull Carl as he walks toward the car, and behind him, we see the cabin door opening. Carl turns, reacting to the sound, as Grimsrud bounds out wearing mittens and a red hunter's cap but no overcoat, holding an axe. Grimsrud swings overhand, burying the axe in Carl's neck. In her cruiser, on her two-way radio, we hear Lou's voice, heavily filtered. The approach slows as they near a short driveway leading down to a cabin with a brown Cutlass Ciera parked in front. Grimsrud stares, conscious of the noise, as she shows with a twist of her shoulder the armpatch insignia. With a quick twist, Grimsrud reaches back for the log, hurls it at Marge, and then starts running away. Marge twists her body sideways, shielding herself, as Grimsrud pants up the hill, moving slowly through the deep snow. Behind him, Grimsrud, with cheeks sunk and eyes hollow, looks sourly out at the road. She glances up in the rear-view mirror to see Grimsrud's head bobbing with bumps on the road, otherwise motionless and scowling as he gazes out. Marge, gazing forward, seems to be talking to herself and glances up in the rear-view mirror again at Grimsrud's hollow eyes staring out. Marge pulls over and leans back with a creak and jangle of utilities. Outside, it is snowing, with the sky, earth, and road all white. She stares forward, shakes her head as a squad car with gum-balls spinning punches through the white, approaches in slow motion, followed by an ambulance and another squad car. These vehicles stand next to a highway on a snowy, windswept plain, with one or two cars dotting the parking lot alongside an idling police cruiser. We look over the shoulders of two uniformed policemen standing on either side of the door, their hands resting lightly on their holstered sidearms. One of them raps at the door, and then upholsters his gun, nodding to someone whose back enters.",
    "415": "Mrs. Robinson is sitting there, and Mr. Robinson exits. Ben and Elaine are then shot in Ben's car, seen from the back, as Ben pushes the car recklessly in and out of traffic, leaning on the horn. The car ahead does not move, so Ben swerves around it, jamming his horn and giving the other driver an angry look as Elaine holds on to the dashboard to keep her balance. Ben and Elaine sit at a table, with Elaine having her back to the stage, folding her hands and looking down, while their chairs are angled so Ben can look at the stage without looking directly at her. The stripper is reflected in Ben's glasses, down to a tasseled bra and g-string, twirling the tassels. Elaine turns to look at the stripper and then turns back. Elaine leans against a building, pulling her arm away as Ben, facing her, moves from side to side, trying to get her attention while she looks away and starts to cry. Onlookers on the sidewalk watch, prompting Elaine to turn away from them, and Ben moves in front of her. She brings her hands to her face, and Ben looks at her in agony before pulling her wrists away, leading her to look up startled before he kisses her. She closes her eyes as he frees her hands, which then move to his wrists. After a while, she pulls away and turns slightly as he looks at her and she watches him carefully. A couple of teenagers drive up next to them with a radio loudly playing rock and roll. Ben leans across Elaine, speaks to the kid behind the wheel, who turns the radio up. Ben and Elaine roll their windows up and talk animatedly while eating, with Elaine watching as Ben tells her a story.",
    "477": "Salieri sits at his desk, which is littered with manuscripts. In the middle stands a billiard table, and the beautiful closing ensemble from Act IV of Figaro, \"Ah, Tutti contenti! Saremo cosi,\" plays in the background. Standing at the billiard table, Mozart dreamily hears the music while playing shots on the table. From time to time, he drifts over to a piece of manuscript paper and jots down notes. He is in his own world of composition, with the billiard balls aiding his creativity. Mozart comes out, and framed in the doorway from outside stands Lorl, the maid noticed in Salieri's house. From his bedroom, Leopold peeps out to watch. Mozart goes to the girl, then Constanze follows. The old man emerges from his bedroom, and Constanze looks furiously at him, then at Lorl. Lorl goes outside and closes the door. Constanze turns on Leopold, and a hand comes into frame offering a plate of sugared biscuits. On its finger is the gold signet ring belonging to Salieri, who hands her a pile of coins. She accepts them, delighted. To lively music, the door of the house bursts open, and a grand forte-piano augmented with a pedal is carried out by six men who run off with it down the street. Immediately, Wolfgang, Constanze, and Leopold, all dressed for an occasion, climb into a waiting carriage that drives off after the forte-piano. As soon as it goes, Lorl appears in the doorway, peering slyly around to see that they are out of sight, then she shuts the door and hurries off in the opposite direction. An outdoor concert is being given where Mozart is playing the final movement of his E-flat concerto with an orchestra. A sizable audience listens to him, including the Emperor, flanked by Strack and Von Swieten. The crowd is happy and appreciative in a delightful open-air scene. Leopold and Constanze listen to Mozart, who plays his work brilliantly. A carriage clops through the streets with Lorl sitting up on the box beside the driver. Inside the vehicle, the figure of Salieri is glimpsed. Mozart is conducting and playing in a reflective mood as Lorl opens the door, admitting Salieri. They go in, and the door shuts. The room is considerably tidier due to Lorl's ministrations. Salieri stands looking around with tremendous curiosity as she opens a drawer in a sideboard where we see a gold snuff box, the one presented to Mozart as a child in the Vatican. Salieri turns to look around as she points across the room to the workroom, where Salieri crosses alone.",
    "705": "Harry banks around and sees Peter swinging between the buildings. He zooms down after Peter, who swings into a narrow gap between the tall buildings, propelling himself along from thread to thread. Harry turns the Sky Stick side on so he can fly along the narrow gap, dodging fire escapes and air con units as he air boards after Peter. Harry pulls a glowing green sword from a scabbard on his back and slashes wildly at Peter, who swerves out of the way. Harry soars above Peter, then plummets down to stab him but misses. Harry hurls a small, golden pumpkin bomb at Peter. It opens up in mid-air into a kind of flying metallic bat. Harry throws more bombs at Peter. They slash at Peter who desperately tries to swing out of their way. He jumps off a pipe and swings back the way he came, just missing Harry. The winged bombs surge after Peter and Harry gets caught in the swarm. One of them embeds its wing in his shoulder. He yanks it out, zooms upwards into the air, and swoops on after Peter. Peter swings backwards, shooting webbing at the bombs and disabling them. One of them is caught in a thread, and Peter swings it back at Harry. Harry flies through the explosion, shielding his eyes. He hits the line of thread stretched out in front of him and bounces off a pipe and a wall, tumbling towards an alleyway below. Peter, his eyes widening with alarm, swings down towards him. Harry lies motionless on the ground. Peter hurries over to his unconscious old friend. He crouches down and holds his ear to Harry's mouth. He yanks open Harry's dark green jacket and starts pumping his chest. He listens again for signs of life. He carries his friend to an emergency room. Peter watches through a window as a crash team tries to revive Harry. A detective hands a file to tall, thin-faced Captain Stacy. A police dog handler blows a whistle and points. Flint sprints across waste ground with armed officers running behind him. As he reaches a wire mesh fence an Alsatian lunges at him. He wrestles the dog off and punches it away. Flint climbs. Flint runs on and suddenly falls into a huge pit. He tumbles down a concrete wall and lands heavily on a pile of sand in the bottom of the pit. Slowly, he hauls himself to his feet and looks desperately from side to side. He's caught in a dazzling beam of light. Above the pit, three glowing capacitors begin to rotate like a merry-go-round. Flint looks up nervously as the capacitors descend towards him and spin around him. They kick up a sandstorm with Flint trapped in the middle.",
    "208": "A young man examines an assortment of luggage, and as the camera draws closer, he turns, revealing George as a young man. Suddenly, as George stands with his arms outstretched, the picture freezes and becomes a still, and voices from Heaven are heard. The closeup of George resumes as he retrieves a large suitcase from under the counter. The setting, now filled with school kids having sodas, features a juke box and many little tables, with three kids working behind the counter. When George enters, Gower, now sober, shaven, and good-humored, sees him and his face lights up. George notices an old cigar lighter on the counter, closes his eyes, makes a wish, and as he snaps it, a flame appears. George crosses the street, observed by Uncle Billy, cousin Tilly, and cousin Eustace from a second-floor window of the Building and Loan offices. Bert opens the cab and places George's suitcase inside. As George is about to enter the cab, he pauses upon seeing Violet approach, who captures attention with her walk and figure. Violet gives George a sultry look, and as she passes by George and Bert, they raise their heads above the cab. Ernie sticks his head out from the driver's seat, and as Violet crosses the street, an elderly man, distracted by her, is nearly hit by a car with screeching brakes. Bert checks his watch, then glances at Violet's retreating figure. Pop Bailey sits at the dinner table, while sounds of banging and scuffling come from upstairs. Mrs. Bailey and Annie, the cook, look toward the vibrating ceiling, and Annie pounds on it with a broom. Pop smiles while poking his plate, and Mrs. Bailey calls up the stairs and then ascends them. A commotion follows as the boys mimic fanfare music and bring their mother down, carrying her high and gracefully setting her in Pop's lap. Pop kisses her, and she quickly hugs him before scolding the boys with wrath. Annie crosses the room with her broom, and Harry reaches for her, pushing her through the kitchen door and playfully slapping her bottom.",
    "323": "Within seconds, tons of rock seal the doorway, throwing the Fellowship into pitch blackness. A faint light rises from Gandalf's staff, casting a glow across the old wizard's face. The Fellowship crosses a precarious bridge above deep mine workings and continues up a steep stair, passing through a dwarf cemetery where the graves are despoiled, with dwarf skeletons strewn about and goblin graffiti scrawled on monuments in dried dwarf blood. The atmosphere is very sinister. The path splits into three passages, each disappearing into dark tunnels. Gandalf pauses, frowning, and the Fellowship nervously waits while Gandalf sits, staring intently at the three tunnel mouths in front of him. He appears to be in some kind of trance. There is a sudden glimpse of a creature darting in the darkness. Frodo, feeling nervous, approaches Gandalf, and an emaciated, leering creature blazes like a silent flash of lightning. Unnerved, Pippin backs away nervously and stumbles against the well, sending a precariously balanced armored skeleton tumbling in. Gandalf turns angrily on Pippin, and they fall silent. Sam's eyes glance at Frodo's belt, and Frodo looks down to see a cold blue glow emanating from Sting's scabbard. Frodo draws the sword and stares at its glowing blade. Aragorn and Boromir slam and wedge the doors. Boromir catches sight of something and turns to Aragorn with shock in his eyes. Gimli snatches up two rusty dwarf axes and leaps onto the tomb. Suddenly, the door bursts open in a shower of wood fragments, and 20 goblins charge into the tomb, followed by a huge cave troll. Gimli ducks a blow and immediately buries his axes in two goblin helmets. Aragorn and Boromir wade into the mass of goblins with their swords, while Legolas fires deadly arrows into goblin throats, desperately trying to shield the hobbits. Gandalf, clutching his sword, joins in the battle. The cave troll sweeps his club at Aragorn, who stumbles backwards. The huge club descends for the killing blow, but in a flash of steel, Boromir's long sword slices into the scaly arm of the troll, which rears back, spewing green blood. Sam backs up against a wall, a sword in one hand and a saucepan in the other. In desperation, he swings wildly at a goblin with the saucepan, and it keels over. Surprised, Sam wallops another goblin, and it too drops. The cave troll lunges forward, thrusting at Frodo's chest with his spear. Sam screams as Frodo is lifted off his feet by the spear tip and slammed against the wall, causing the hobbits to go crazy. Sam slashes at the cave troll's knee, bringing him down, while Merry and Pippin jump on him. Legolas fires an arrow, and the cave troll topples dead. Aragorn rushes to Frodo's side as he slumps to the floor, appearing to be dead.",
    "200": "George is seated at the bar, having had a great deal to drink, far more than he's accustomed to, and the camera moves closer to him as he mumbles. Nick, the bartender, watches him solicitously, while Martini comes over to his side. George shakes his head, and on the other side of him, a burly individual drinks a glass of beer before suddenly throwing a vicious punch at George, who goes down and out. Martini, Nick, and several others rush to pick George up. Mr. Welch reaches into his pocket for money, but Nick and Martini shove Welch out the door, then run back to help George to his feet. George's mouth is cut and bleeding as he starts for the door, and although Nick and Martini try to stop him, he shrugs them off, opens the door, and exits to the street. George's car comes along the empty street through the falling snow, swerves suddenly, and crashes into a tree near the sidewalk of a house. George gets out to look at the damage and savagely kicks at the open door of the car, trying to shut it. The noise brings the owner of the house running out, observing that the front lights are broken and the fender is ripped. George stands unsteadily by the car, shaken by the accident, and dully looks at the damage as the owner examines the damages. George then staggers off down the street, paying no attention to the man, and crosses the approach to the bridge as a truck swings around the corner and nearly hits him. The truck turns onto the bridge, and George takes a narrow catwalk at the railing, stopping at the center of the bridge as snow falls hard. He looks down at the water, dotted with floating ice, trying to make up his mind to act, and leans over, fascinated, glancing furtively around as though about to jump. Suddenly, from above, a body hurtles past George and lands in the water with a loud splash. Horrified, George quickly takes off his coat and dives over the railing into the water. George surfaces, sees the man flailing about, and swims toward him. The toll house keeper, hearing the cries for help, runs out on the bridge with a flashlight and shines it on the two figures struggling in the water below. George reaches the man, grabs hold of him, and starts swimming for shore.",
    "235": "Szpilman and the German Captain enter through another set of doors, and the German Captain's boots echo as they come into a spacious room with faint moonlight filtering through the large windows, amidst fallen masonry and broken glass. In the room, there are a couple of chairs and a grand piano in the corner. The German Captain points at the piano, and Szpilman hesitates before limping to it, putting down the tin, and opening the lid. He turns, drags over one of the chairs, and sits as the German Captain stands and watches. Szpilman glances surreptitiously at his hands, then plays Chopin while the German Captain listens, expressionless. The pale moonlight reveals the German Captain to be a handsome, elegant man. After Szpilman finishes playing, the German Captain stares at him, and a moment passes. Szpilman nods, just stares at him, then hesitates, takes the tin, and shuffles past the German Captain towards the door. The German Captain takes out a flashlight, sees a ladder leading up to the loft, and Szpilman climbs it, squeezes into the loft, and looks down at the German Captain, who shines his light on him. Szpilman shows him the tin before quickly going. Szpilman opens the package, finding bread and marmalade, and then finds a tin-opener. Snow falls as the Germans evacuate the villa; men carry out boxes, filing cabinets, desks, papers, and load them into trucks. Szpilman opens the trapdoor to see the German Captain in the attic, carrying a package, and Szpilman faces him as the Captain hands him the package, which Szpilman opens to find several loaves of bread inside. Szpilman shivers with cold, and the German Captain takes off his coat and gives it to him. In the freezing weather with empty streets, Szpilman, wearing the German Captain's coat and under the eiderdown, hears the strange sound of recorded music, recognizing the Polish national anthem as a car with a loudspeaker and Polish national flag comes into view. Astonished and puzzled, he comes to a decision and starts to leave, cautiously trotting down the staircase into the empty hall in his German military overcoat. He goes to the front door, opens it a crack, and cautiously goes out, looking around and hearing the car loudspeaker indistinctly. Hearing the commotion, a woman runs, yelling, towards the field kitchen, as does a man. Szpilman stands and stares, then sees one of the soldiers cock his rifle and fire at him. Szpilman runs while the firing continues, and he bolts into the doorway of a ruined building, peers out, and sees Polish soldiers beginning to surround the building, firing shots and lobbing a grenade or two. Two of the Polish officers stand near the entrance, hearing Szpilman's shouts.",
    "1293": "She illustrates by making a rounded gesture near her stomach, while in the background, Keith the teacher is talking to some science kids, sporting a Wild America beard. He lifts a cup of coffee to his lips and slurps lustily. Bleeker retrieves a book from his open locker as Juno marches up to him, belly leading the way, clearly affronted. A girl, obviously Katrina, strides past with a sour look aimed squarely at Juno. Juno starts to walk away, picking up her backpack dejectedly and sliding it over her shoulder, but she's about to walk away when she climbs ungracefully into the van. Mark is seated at the computer, surfing a horror movie website, with a blank expression of a bored obsessive. He breaks into a grin and opens the door as Juno stands there, looking radiantly knocked-up, holding a stack of CDs. He gestures for Juno to follow him into the house, where the Lorings' basement is dank, cluttered, unfinished, and unattractive, much like Paulie Bleeker's. Mark pulls a chain to illuminate a bare bulb as Juno examines the comic. There's a battered portable CD player in the corner. Juno mockingly places her hands on Mark's waist and moves back and forth stiffly, then they sway slowly to the music until Juno's belly bumps up against Mark. Juno rests her head on Mark's chest and they dance in silence for a few moments, then stop moving. Juno backs away, and Mark suddenly sees Juno for what she is—a teenage girl. Juno turns to leave and shoots one furious look back at Mark. She reaches the top of the stairs and scrambles toward the front door, only to be intercepted by Vanessa, who's returning home from work, carrying her briefcase and a freshly purchased nursing pillow. It's obvious from Juno's tears and flushed face that she's lying. She rushes toward the door, then halts, looking totally betrayed. Vanessa looks at Juno's expression and knows Mark is lying, and as Juno's face continues to fall, Vanessa notices, sighs, and looks defeated. Vanessa and Mark notice that Juno has escaped the conflict as Juno runs up to her car sobbing, and it's quiet after the storm. Juno buckles over the steering wheel, crying, unwinding for the first time since she became pregnant. Meanwhile, Bleeker is sitting next to his bed, noodling on the guitar, playing a theme that we will soon recognize. Juno lays on the hood of her Previa, contemplating her future. After a beat, she begins to gather herself, hops off the hood, and scurries into the Previa where she finds a crumpled-up Jiffy Lube receipt. She unfolds it and pulls out a pen, ready to write something.",
    "69": "VERONICA stands, letting DANTE'S head hit the floor, as a handsome young man named WILLAM is standing at the counter, prompting VERONICA to react to him. There's a moment of silence as DANTE'S chuckles fade to comprehension, after which DANTE waits on a customer in the interim. Meanwhile, VERONICA counts silently, using fingers as marks, then stops counting. DANTE chases VERONICA down and grabs her by the door, but she exits in a huff and violently lets go of him as she leaves. VERONICA went, and then DANTE swings the door open and yells out. Two men walking in the opposite direction outside double back and head in that direction, leaving DANTE standing in silence for a moment. A videocassette encased in the customary black box flips repeatedly, held by an impatient grasp, as it's twenty after and he should be here soon. The IMPATIENT CUSTOMER glares at DANTE, who studies a copy of Paradise Lost, trying not to notice the glare. The IMPATIENT CUSTOMER storms out, and DANTE lifts a ring of keys from the counter, which are half-swallowed by the trash can. A hapless RANDAL drifts by, stops, glances at the door, peers inside, and gives the door a tug before walking away. Another VIDEO-ANXIOUS CUSTOMER leans against the video store door, as the VERY ANXIOUS CUSTOMER stands like a sentry at post. The IMPATIENT CUSTOMER storms up and stops RANDAL, after which a pile of videocassettes is plopped onto the counter with a single key on top, and RANDAL marches off. RANDAL balances the pile of tapes on his head, as the IMPATIENT CUSTOMER stares after him. The VERY ANXIOUS CUSTOMER now sits on the ground next to the video store door, while RANDAL balances his burden and shoves the key into the lock. The VERY ANXIOUS CUSTOMER stares as RANDAL enters the store, and the door closes behind him, only to be held ajar in a gentlemanly fashion a few moments later. RANDAL smiles, indicating we've seen this same routine before. A coffee filter is shoved into the metal pan and someone heaps ground coffee on it, as DANTE crosses back to his post, and RANDAL enters, tossing the key into the air happily and catching it. He picks the cat up, walks by a row of snacks and grabs one without looking at it, holding a list in his hand. DANTE sits in his seat behind the register, while RANDAL grabs a paper and joins him behind the counter. The headline of the engagement announcement reads, BREE TO, as RANDAL dials the phone and a CUSTOMER comes to the counter and waits. He looks at the litter box, where a black cat suddenly jumps in and starts pawing around. The CUSTOMER watches as the cat takes a huge dump, leaning on its haunches to accommodate the stinky load.",
    "1292": "Mark leads Juno into the kitchen, where he pours two drinks, and gestures awkwardly to Juno's belly. Mark looks jolted, realizing for the first time that her baby might have a father, then swivels around slowly on his desk chair, surprised. He walks over to his music collections, starts pulling CDs, and mouths along with the lyrics. Juno spots a VHS tape on the coffee table, picks it up, and sees some particularly memorable footage from The Wizard of Gore before a door suddenly slams upstairs, causing her to jump up and rush out. Meanwhile, Vanessa is obviously entertaining some worst-case scenarios, holding the ultrasound up to show Vanessa and draping her arm around her as Juno glances at Mark and then at Vanessa. A beat passes as Bren absorbs this scene. Juno heads to the urn by the door and defiantly pours the remains of her blue slushie into it. Outside, Juno parks her Previa on the street and is greeted by Bleeker's mom, who answers the door visibly annoyed and lets her eyes drift down to Juno's middle. Bleeker also glances at Juno's midsection, embarrassed, but then smiles faintly as he nervously cracks open a container of orange Tic-Tacs and pours them into his mouth. Juno walks over to the bed and sits down next to Bleeker, and he is visibly relieved but still picks at the carpet, dejected. Meanwhile, the house is covered in fresh snow, and the walls are primed slate gray as Vanessa points to the nursery's largest wall, while Mark stares at the wall, looking lost. Later, Juno and Leah are walking through the mall looking bored, and Juno is wearing one of Mac's giant hockey jerseys in lieu of actual maternity wear while Leah gnaws on a giant cinnamon pretzel. Juno wrestles Leah for the pretzel as onlookers stare, appalled, when Leah puts Juno in a half-Nelson. They watch a group of well-heeled women and their children shopping en masse, among them Vanessa, looking vaguely detached. They continue to watch Vanessa for a few more moments as the other kids wander toward the play area while their mothers ignore them, and Vanessa continues to entertain the children. Juno tries her best to look enthused while Vanessa admires her belly and Juno grimaces, grabbing Vanessa's hand and planting it on her stomach. Vanessa moves her hand, wanting desperately to feel the baby, but looks like she's giving up hope, kneeling down next to the swell of Juno's belly. Mark drops his head, dejected, but then instantly smiles and continues to smile. In the school cafeteria, Juno's tray slides along, picking up an odd combo of pregnant food, and she and Leah walk their trays to a table. They sit inside an emptied awards case on the wall, eating their lunch as Juno notices the other kids in the cafeteria can't help but glance her way.",
    "1037": "A bright white light shines in front of a cloudy sky, held aloft by a statuesque woman wearing a long white robe with a blue sash draped around her. Silver metallic letters on a black background are seen, and framed within a V shape is a city skyline. A motorcade sweeps through the city streets, with motorcycles in the background. Men in suits climb stairs as the motorcade moves past a tall stone bell tower towards the flashing lights of a parked police car, with a GNN TV camera fixed on the vehicles. The convoy comes to a halt, cameras flash, and the President, a tall man with a receding hairline, emerges. He and his guards move away from the car, with one of the Secret Service agents, Barnes, a man in his 50s with a furrowed brow, glancing all around, scanning rooftops and the protesters as he walks ahead of the President. On a preview monitor, the GNN gallery crew watch footage of an assassination attempt on President Ashton, during which Barnes takes the bullets for the President, and the President is hustled to safety and recoils. A bomb goes off in the plaza, smoke erupts from the explosion and blanks out the TV cameras, covering the plaza in its dense blanket. The gallery is stunned, and as the smoke clears, the director catches sight of Angie lying on the ground with blood on her forehead and chest among the rubble. The picture constantly breaks up, and the director and her assistant fight back tears. Director Rex Brooks, in her 40s, gets to her feet and switches off the feed. Haggard and weary, she sits back down by her younger, weeping PA. The events rewind to pre-explosion, with Angie reporting and the President at the lectern, and the motorcade en route to the plaza. Agent Barnes, his torso bare, turns from his window, nods to his colleague Ken Taylor, then turns back to gaze out as he puts on a shirt, revealing a scar on his back. Barnes strolls across the room, sits down on his bed with a tie in his hand, fastens his shirt, and reaches for a pill bottle. Popping the lid, he tips the bottle, puts his hand to his grimacing face, seeing footage of the previous year's assassination attempt where he falls to the ground. In the hotel room, Barnes places the pill back in the bottle on the bedside cabinet, lifts his gun from the cabinet, and checks its magazine. In a hotel corridor, Barnes puts on his jacket while walking in front of a large window against which he is silhouetted.",
    "506": "Thelma hops in quickly as Louise careens back onto the road and slams on the brakes. Louise stops yelling for a moment, groping for self-control, while Thelma looks pitiful. The T-Bird flashes by on a road that looks a lot like Route as Louise passes a man who honks at them. They look up to see him pointing wildly to his lap, prompting Thelma to laugh wildly. Thelma transitions from laughing to crying, and they both get quiet. Thelma leans back, just watching Louise and studying her as if she's never really seen her before. Suddenly, a look of shocked realization comes over Thelma's face, and she jerks upright, startling Louise. Louise understands what Thelma is talking about and becomes immediately agitated, looking as if she wants to flee. Her eyes are wild, not seeing, while Thelma appears completely serene. The car is screaming down the road as they drive through a small group of buildings. A car speeds up to catch them, and red and blue lights pop on, revealing it as a New Mexico State Patrol car. Louise sees the lights in the rearview mirror, and Thelma jumps awake as they try not to panic. The patrol car is right behind them as Louise pulls off the road and the patrol car pulls up behind them, shining its lights brightly through the windows. A patrolman gets out and approaches their car, coming to the driver's side window where Louise smiles up at him. She fumbles in her purse for her wallet, opens it, and shows her license. They walk to the back of the car, and he notes the license plate number before getting into the driver’s side and picking up a clipboard to clip Louise's license to it. As he picks up the hand mike for the radio, Thelma appears with a gun at his head, and he drops it. Louise reaches over, takes his gun, and shoots the car radio, flinching at each shot. Louise fires two more shots into the police radio, destroying it, and then takes the keys and her license from the clipboard before getting out and trotting around to the back of the car. Thelma holds the gun on the patrolman, then suddenly fires twice into the trunk cover. Louise opens the trunk, and as the patrolman climbs in, Thelma explains to Louise. They find themselves in really beautiful country, while elsewhere, a cop walks into a kitchen and hands Hal a file labeled Louise Elizabeth Sawyer.",
    "1373": "Harry, Ron, and Hermione are seated on a train when suddenly they are fired on, and Arthur and others approach. The lady appears at their door, and Ron sees he hasn't enough money as Cho Chan walks up to the trolley. Harry and Cho look at each other and smile. Hermione sees Harry rubbing his head. Four flying horses pulling a carriage land at Hogwarts, and the crowds cheer. A large ship emerges from under the water and approaches too. A man runs up the aisle limping comically, whispers to Dumbledore, and leaves the same way. A group of girls dressed in blue dance up the aisle and release butterflies, bow, and everyone applauds. A series of older boys walk up the aisle, brandishing bo staffs with sparks, and breathe fire. They embrace. The man seated next to Hagrid yelps when Hagrid stabs a fork into his hand. A strange man stands in the doorway, casts magic upwards to seal the roof, and peace is restored. This character enters the room and begins walking, seeing Harry through his mechanical eye. He limps, breathing heavily as the crowd is unsettled and booing. Dumbledore casts magic over a box which melds into a goblet containing a blue flame. A suspicious character enters the room where the goblet burns and closes the door. He writes his name on the board as Mad-Eye throws the chalk in anger, pops open a jar with a spider, and uses his wand to send it around the class, unsettling them. Draco laughs, and Mad-Eye sends the spider onto Draco's face. Mad-Eye has the spider over a bucket of water, and it's wriggling as Neville Longbottom stands. Mad-Eye begins torturing the spider with magic, it squeals, and Mad-Eye stops. Neville is disturbed, and Mad-Eye picks up the spider, which is still making a noise. Hermione shakes her head as Mad-Eye casts a spell and the spider disintegrates. He approaches Harry's desk and takes a drink. They see a boy on the stairs facing the window, and Mad-Eye approaches Neville, patting him on the shoulder. Neville nods. Older students place their names into the flame, and others applaud, with Cedric among them. The twins come up cheering, jump inside the age line, do a high-five after putting their names into the flame, but are flung across the room when the flame fires up. When they get up, they have full heads of grey hair and beards.",
    "1385": "A glimmering puddle is omitted as a carriage wheel shatters the glassy surface, revealing a procession of horseless carriages carrying students toward the castle. The sweet sound of a choir rises as lightning flashes across the night sky, transitioning the scene to the Great Hall. The camera glides toward the windows, passing through the glass to reveal candlelit silhouettes. At the High Table sit Lupin, Severus Snape, Minerva McGonagall, Rubeus Hagrid, and Albus Dumbledore. The camera tracks along the choir, singing with a harpsichord, and lands on a quintet of toads, including Neville Longbottom's toad, Trevor. As the choir concludes, Dumbledore stands, beaming. Amid scattered applause, Harry, Ron, and Hermione clap, then applaud vigorously after exchanging stunned looks. Hagrid turns ruby red, rises, and nearly topples the staff table. At the Slytherin table, Draco Malfoy, flanked by Crabbe and Goyle, feigns a dead faint at Harry, who makes eye contact. Students exit the Great Hall and scale the Marble Staircase. Harry, Ron, and Hermione reach the seventh floor landing and approach the Fat Lady in the portrait. Ron spins and frowns at Hermione. Professor Trelawney takes the cup, peers inside, and grasps, causing everyone to turn and see Lavender bent over her textbook. Harry peers into his cup, watching the tea leaves shift. The trio emerges from the bridge and heads toward Hagrid's hut, where students have gathered. Draco, Crabbe, and Goyle stand with the Slytherins, and though there is no consensus, students stare in wary wonder as Hagrid coaxes a beast to the paddock's center. Ron stares uneasily as the class steps back, leaving Harry in front. Unsure, Harry nods, steps forward, and bows. Buckbeak studies Harry and ducks his beak, prompting a relieved sigh from Hagrid. Tentatively, Harry lays his hand on Buckbeak's beak, and the class claps as Harry smiles. Hagrid lifts Harry onto Buckbeak's back and slaps its hindquarters. Buckbeak's talons slash down, and Malfoy freezes, noticing blood on his robes and shrieks. Harry dashes forward, and Buckbeak, upon seeing Harry, lowers its talons and ducks its beak. Meanwhile, Harry, Ron, and Hermione watch from the Gryffindor table and turn to see Seamus and other Gryffindors huddled over a copy of The Daily Prophet.",
    "1171": "The professors rise to their feet as a Slytherin chaser tosses the Quaffle into the air and fixes it through the goal with his broomstick. Hovering high above the pitch, Harry follows the game anxiously. Suddenly, the Golden Snitch swoops past, and Harry speeds after it, dodging the Bludgers aimed for his head. His broomstick goes out of control, shaking him violently from side to side and spinning him over and over. Through her binoculars, Hermione spots Snape in the professors' grand stand with his lips moving, and she gives her binoculars to Ron. Harry clings desperately to the bucking broomstick, which spins him off, but he manages to grab the handle and hang underneath, holding on with only one hand as Malfoy and his cronies cheer. Snape is still muttering to himself as Harry grabs the broomstick with both hands, which swings him backward and forward, trying to shake him off. Ron watches through the binoculars as Hermione reaches the professors' grand stand and races up the stairs, where Snape continues muttering. She pulls out her wand and, crawling beneath the seats, gives it a flick, smiling as a flame appears and Snape's cloak starts to burn. The professors beat out the flames, knocking Quirrell off his feet, and Harry's broomstick suddenly calms down. Quirrell and Snape put out the fire and watch as Harry manages to regain control of the Nimbus 2000. He climbs onto the broomstick and zooms off to the Slytherin seeker, who is close behind the Snitch. They fly shoulder to shoulder as the crafty Slytherin barges Harry, trying to knock him out of the way, but Harry circles round and then comes back, with the Slytherin bully barging him again. The Snitch flips from tower to tower, suddenly changing its course and heading straight for the ground. The two seekers follow, but the cowardly Slytherin pulls out at the last moment as they plummet headfirst. The Snitch levels out, skimming low along the ground, and standing precariously on the broomstick, Harry stretches out his hand to catch the Snitch. He takes a step forward, and the broom tips up, sending him somersaulting over onto the grass. He scrambles up, clutching his stomach with both hands as his friends watch with concern. Hagrid peers through the binoculars as Harry spits out the Snitch. As Madam Hooch declares the winner, the Gryffindors leap for joy, with giant Hagrid punching the air victoriously and Hermione shrieking at the top of her voice. Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall applaud enthusiastically, while Snape remains in his seat, expressionless. Standing in the middle of the arena in his scarlet and gold cloak, Harry beams with pride and pleasure. As his teammates swoop around the arena on their broomsticks, celebrating their success, Harry holds the fluttering Golden Snitch triumphantly above his head and slowly turns, displaying his prize to his ecstatic supporters.",
    "142": "Nehru waits for Gandhi and rises when Gandhi enters. The guard signals Gandhi to a chair across a small wooden table from Nehru, and the guard closes the door but remains in the room. Nehru's face is a map of concern, but he manages a small smile of greeting. Gandhi, who also looks worn, raises his eyebrows whimsically at the use of that name, then sighs as their faces and minds go to more somber matters. Gandhi listens to it all with a growing sense of despair. The golden dome of the Temple fills the screen, shimmering, accompanied by the sound of a car and marching feet. The camera pulls back from the dome, revealing the rooftops, the trees, and then, suddenly, the face of General Dyer, blunt, cold, isolated in a cocoon of vengeful military righteousness. He is traveling slowly and steadily in an armored car at the head of fifty armed sepoys — Gurkhas and Baluchis — who are immaculate, precise, and awesome. Behind them, a staff car with Dyer's English ADC and a British police officer follows. It is a relentless, determined procession, filling the dusty street with a sense of menace and foreboding. In a large public garden, enclosed by a thick, old, crumbling wall, a large crowd is gathered around a speaker on a platform at one side of the park. The event is political, but the crowd is mixed with Muslims, Hindus, many Sikhs, old men, little children, and women with babes in arms. The camera closes in on the speaker, a Muslim, who clutches a copy of Gandhi's journal. General Dyer, with his armored car and sepoys, moves toward the gate. Dyer looks ahead calmly toward the Gate of the Bagh, a rickety double gate in the high crumbling wall. Nearer the gate, a few vendors, loiterers, and children turn in curiosity at the sound of the armored car and marching feet. The armored car grinds forward but can't go through the gates, with one fender scraping against the gate post. Dyer gives a quiet order, the car backs away, and he jumps down lightly, a man in splendid condition. He walks through the gate and stands quietly in the at-ease position, hands clasping his swagger stick behind his back, looking off at the speaker. In a medium shot, the sepoys and Dyer are seen. He issues commands in a quiet and unemotional voice, as though they were on maneuvers. A ripple of panic ensues, with everyone pressing back, though they cannot believe what they see. Only one or two have the presence of mind to push clear and seek shelter. In a close shot, Dyer remains calm, and in a flash shot along the line of sepoys, the rifles jerk and bang.",
    "1236": "Ben stirs and sits up as a doctor enters. Dr. Briar sits on Emily's bed, and Emily nods as Dr. Briar hands her the pager. Emily takes a deep breath and looks down while Dr. Briar strokes her hair, gives her a reassuring smile, and leaves. Tears roll down Emily's cheeks as she puts a hand to her mouth and takes Ben's hand. Ben looks on sorrowfully as Emily presses the back of his hand against her forehead and weeps. Ben walks Duke on a lead past the Travel Inn reception; Larry sees them and comes out after them. Ben enters his room, leaving long-haired Larry outside looking indignant. Inside, a small fish swims up into the tentacles of the box jellyfish in Ben's aquarium, becomes partially paralyzed, and is drawn toward the jellyfish's body. Ben sits on his motel bed, watching, and slowly reaches for his mobile beside him. Connie's face is bruised as Ben hands her an envelope, which Connie accepts, nodding. They sleep in the back of her car, and later, a calm Connie drives along the coast road with the children still asleep. She heads down the leafy drive to Ben's beach house, pulls up, and looks awestruck. Connie tentatively enters the house with the children, standing in the doorway for a moment before the girl sets off to look about, only to be pulled back by Connie. The kids run to a window to look out, and then Connie and the kids enter a bedroom, looking around in wonder before jumping up and down on the bed. Mother and children run along the deserted, sunny beach. Inside the house, curtains sway in the breeze while Connie sits reading a letter, considering it with her long, dark hair tied back. Looking overwhelmed, Connie puts her hands to her mouth, holds a pen, hovers it over a document, and then signs it before looking out over the ocean, silhouetted against hazy, golden light. Ben escorts Emily, as a nurse pushes her out of the hospital in a wheelchair, to his car where he opens the door for Emily, with Duke in the back, and fastens her seat belt. Emily grins while Ben stares ahead. She gazes at him and smiles, then lightly nibbles her nails. Ben pulls up and turns to her awkwardly, his eyes darting about as he thinks before eyeing her firmly. Emily stares at him puzzled, studying him through slightly narrowed eyes, before staring at him expectantly, opening her eyes wide, and furrowing her brows. Ben meets her gaze blankly as Emily looks down, considers, and then undoes her seat belt, shoots him a disdainful look, and gets out.",
    "366": "Suddenly, everything rushes, and the crowd becomes a blur, causing a young woman to be lost in its wake. Now it's Edward who's frozen, helpless in time, as he checks in windows while cars pull out, searching for his fated love. Colossus is thumbing for a ride, and the last pickup truck stops to let him climb in back. As the truck pulls away, it passes a dejected Edward who believes he'll never find the girl, the love of his life. Amos leans over so Karl can sign a contract on his back and spots Edward walking back into the tent. Amos hands off the contract to a clown, and as Amos starts to walk away, Edward hurries to catch up with him, pointing to the bleachers where no backpack is to be found. Getting in front of Amos, Edward stops him, and Amos smiles, amused. Amos takes a long look at Edward, and ultimately, there's no way he can say no, so he shrugs, and Edward shakes Amos's hand before he can retract the offer. We move into a montage, where Edward is shown smiling nervously, his head tilted to the side, with it held in a massive lion's open mouth, whose sharp teeth are just poking his skin. If the lion flinches, Edward's life is in danger. The crowd applauds, making the lion antsy, which makes Edward even antsier. With his eyes droopy from lack of sleep, Edward mans the whirling amusement park ride and nods off, falling backward into the path of the spinning arms. One of the Hydra cars hits him square in the gut, throwing him up and away, sailing 200 feet through the air. Amos is walking past, stops, looks at the young man, and then finally walks away. We push in on Edward, enraptured by the concept. Edward shovels manure in the nastiest stables, preoccupied with his thoughts. In quiet reverie, he ponders his latest bit of information. A sudden explosion occurs as Edward is shot out of a giant cannon. Under a full moon, Edward walks up to a battered camper and is about to knock when he notices it's rocking significantly. Yet, Edward knocks anyway, and the rocking and moaning suddenly stop. A beat later, the door handle begins to rattle, seeming stuck. Edward turns the knob, and the door bursts open, knocking him down with a massive black dog, the biggest anyone has ever seen, with green glowing eyes and a lick of fire for a tongue. Edward wrestles with the beast as its mouth snaps at his throat. Blocking with an arm, Edward tries to push himself free, but the creature’s hands—holding tight instead of paws—prevent him.",
    "180": "Laurie comes back downstairs, takes a key out of her purse, and steps to the window, then to the front door, putting the key to the Doyle house in her pocket. She locks the Doyle house and walks away into the street. The camera moves toward the Wallace house, which is dark and ominous. The wind whips her clothes and hair as she moves down the street, shivering in the chill wind. Bob's car sits on the street. She picks up her speed, moving up the sidewalk as the house looms closer. The camera moves to the front of the Wallace house as Laurie walks up to the front porch, knocks on the door, and rings the doorbell. She stands there, listening for any sound from inside, and waits a moment. Laurie thinks and looks to the street, then steps off the porch and walks to the side of the house, the camera tracking with her. She turns and walks through the breezeway between the house and garage to the back door, pulls it open, and steps into the house, standing there for a moment staring into the blackness of the dark kitchen. Laurie searches for the wall light and looks again into the darkness. A sound from upstairs, like dragging across the floor, stops abruptly. Laurie moves to the head of the staircase and slowly starts up, with the camera tracking her ascent. As she reaches the top and stops, she sees the bedroom door at the end of the hall with faint orange light around its edges. She moves toward the door, the camera tracking with her, and reaches it. The door swings open to reveal a Jack-O-Lantern casting an eerie glow around the room. Someone is lying on the bed, but Laurie can't see them from her position. She moves forward and sees Annie on the bed, with her face a chalky white and a huge red gash across her throat. Laurie stares and screams at the top of her lungs, jumping back to the door. Strung up to the light fixture on the ceiling is Bob, eyes open and staring, causing Laurie to shrink back into a dark corner. Suddenly, a door next to her slowly opens to reveal Lynda standing there, propped up by a chair, staring with glazed, dead eyes. Laurie backs out of the bedroom, her mouth open in speechless horror.",
    "592": "The figure is tall with a thin face and beard. He stops and smiles menacingly. Harry appears behind Ginny and raises his wand. Greyback deflects the spell. He flies up in a spiral of black smoke. Ginny and Harry turn in circles, but can see no sign of him. They take refuge on a small island of sand. Bellatrix spots them. Remus and Tonks are still searching. On their tiny island, Ginny and Harry fend off attacks with their wands. Tonks, Remus, and Mr. Weasley join them on the island. They form a circle, back-to-back, wands poised. Bellatrix watches them. Greyback glances at Bellatrix. They change form, and shoot into the sky, the cloud of black spell. They attack the Weasley house, which bursts into flames. Mr. Weasley sprints off. He finds his family safe, watching their house burn. He puts an arm around his wife. The others join them. And they all watch helplessly, as the Weasley house is engulfed in flames. Lavender puts a heart pendant round Ron's neck. Hermione watches Lavender simpering over Ron. She heads back the way they came. Harry nods to Ron, then walks along the corridor. Lavender leaps on Ron's back and he staggers away with her. Professor Dumbledore's cabinet of vials. Harry plunges his face into the pensive. Teenage Tom Riddle at a Slughorn tea party. Slughorn smiles uneasily. Tom taps the hourglass. The memory stops. Harry straightens up. Dumbledore dips his hand into the pensive. Harry stands solemnly in front of Dumbledore, and nods. The Potions class leave. Slughorn turns and sees Harry. Slughorn shifts uneasily. On his way out, Slughorn stops, spins round and stares at Harry, who doesn't flinch. He stomps out. Slughorn closes the spyhole and locks the door. Harry finds Ron in the boy's dormitory. He's sitting on the floor, gazing dreamily out of the window. Ron holds a gift box. Harry moves away, as Ron leans closer. Ron throws down the box, which has a heart on it. Harry stares at Ron, who smiles inanely, a far away look in his eyes. As Ron sits on the floor and gazes up at the moon, Harry reads the card which came with the chocolates. He grins and crosses to Ron. Little hearts float from it. Ron embraces Slughorn. Harry prises him off. Ron sits on the back of the sofa and falls off. Slughorn gives him a potion. Ron drinks. The inane, fixed smile fades. He looks quizzically up at Harry. He fills three glasses. Ron drinks and collapses, foaming at the mouth. Harry runs to Slughorn's potion cabinet, as Ron convulses on the floor. He puts one in Ron's mouth. He leans over Ron, who lies on his back, no longer breathing.",
    "36": "She can't go on. She lifts her face to his, and he kisses her gently. He looks into her eyes, then he does kiss her as though it were going to be the last time. Her hand falls to the table and knocks over a glass. It's raining very hard at the train station, and there is a hectic, fevered excitement, evident in the faces of the people that pass by. Rick appears in the crowd, stops, puts his suitcase down, and glances at his watch. He nervously checks his watch again, rain pouring over his head and shoulders, but he doesn't seem to notice. Suddenly Sam appears, pulls an envelope from his pocket, and Rick grabs it, opens it, and stares down at the letter, as raindrops pour down the letter, smudging the writing. Sam pulls a stunned, reluctant Rick to the train, which starts to move just as he boards. From the steps he looks off into the distance, then crumbles the letter and tosses it away as the steam from the engine clouds over him. A close-up of a glass on the table in the cafe is shown, and Rick's hand reaches for it and knocks it over. We now see Rick's face and he's very drunk. Sam walks over to the table to pick up the glass and a fallen chair. Just then the door opens and it's Ilsa. Rick stares at the doorway. Ilsa lingers a moment, then comes over to the table, her manner a little uncertain, a little tentative, but with a quiet determination beneath it. Rick reaches for the bottle, and pours himself another drink. She sits down in the chair before the empty glass, her eyes searching his face, but there is no expression on it except a cold and impassive one. He takes a drink. Ilsa gets up and leaves, and Rick's head slumps over the table. Strasser sits while Renault attends to some paperwork and looks at him. Laszlo and Ilsa make their way through the jam in the lobby of the Prefecture, as Jan and Annina talk to an officer. Laszlo and Ilsa enter Renault's office, and Renault bows to them both. Close-ups of Ilsa and then Laszlo reveal their disappointment, observed by Strasser. Renault rings a buzzer and the door is opened for them. As Ilsa and Laszlo leave, an officer comes in. Signor Ferrari turns around, pleased to see Rick, and they shake hands. He hails a waiter, eyes Rick closely, and Rick looks out of the window and sees Ilsa at the linen bazaar, then Laszlo walking toward the cafe. Rick isn't listening to him, looking through the open window in the direction of the linen bazaar. Rick gets up.",
    "1352": "Cary makes a long, insane pile of firecrackers and uses an open M-80 to lay a squiggly, long line of gunpowder away from the firecrackers and the entrance to the creature's contraption space. As the sparkler dies, light reveals Joe, who slows down and peers around the dirt tunnel bend, now on the other side of the space. He sees the creature and then looks across to the lifeless body of Alice. Cary finishes laying out the charges and pulls out his lighter, but the damn thing won't light. He keeps trying to light it as Joe watches the creature finish its meal and head out. Cary continues to try the lighter frantically. Meanwhile, a woman is catching her breath, nodding, and looking amazed at Joe. She grabs him and hugs him tightly, teary and grateful, but then breaks out of the hug and grabs his shirt, intense. Tina, a 24-year-old disoriented woman with curlers in her hair, wakes up. Joe and Alice have helped down a familiar face, Sheriff Pruitt, as their survival instinct kicks in despite being out of breath. They follow each other and run into a tunnel, continuing into the darkness. Sparkler lighting the way, Joe and Alice are followed by Pruitt and Tina, all sprinting in the opposite direction. After running hard, Tina is grabbed away into the darkness with screams continuing behind them. They run until they hit a dead end at a dirt wall, out of breath and hesitant to go back toward the horrifying blackness. The only sounds are the sparkler, their erratic breathing, and the silence. Joe and the creature look at each other, and after a long scary beat, the creature sets him down before turning fast and speeding away. Joe, hugged by his father, looks down and finds something moving in his pocket. He pulls out his mother's necklace, which pulls toward the water tower, wanting to go. Joe understands what this means, and in slow motion, holds the necklace up toward the tower with tears in his eyes, not wanting to let go but knowing he must.",

Nick leans in and kisses Kate full on the lips, and then Nick looks back briefly as he descends the stairs, while Kate grins to herself. In the amber half-light of a darkened room, Kate is fast asleep in bed when the door is ajar, and the hallway light comes on as Zoe slips past the open door clutching a video. Kate stares as she sees Zoe, and wearing pajamas, Kate wanders down the hallway towards a dull, flickering light emanating from the lounge. She pauses outside the open lounge door where Zoe sits on the floor watching a home movie of Christine frolicking on a dull, wind-swept beach. Christine flaps her arms as if pretending to fly as she runs down to the edge of a grey sea. Kate enters the lounge and joins Zoe on the floor; now, the TV screen fills with Christine and Zoe's ecstatically happy faces, and Christine kisses her smiling daughter on the cheek and beams back at the camera. Attractive, long blonde haired Christine throws back her hair and laughs joyously as tears well in Zoe's doleful eyes. Kate looks away from the TV and down at Zoe, putting an arm around her niece, and Zoe leans into Kate as the video plays with Christine running along the beach, waving back at the camera, her jacket and scarf flapping behind her until the grainy video comes to an end. In the morning, Kate and Zoe are in Zoe's bed, lying facing each other, Zoe with her arm on Kate's shoulder as daylight fills the room. Kate watches a sleeping Zoe, who stares, and a smile flickers across Zoe's lips before she closes her eyes again. Kate places an arm around Zoe, and she too closes her eyes. At the restaurant, Bernadette reads a letter. Later, Zoe runs out of her bedroom and down the corridor, chased by Kate, who ambushes her coming out of the lounge. Feathers fly as Kate and Zoe gleefully batter each other with their pillows until Kate pushes Zoe backwards onto the sofa. Exhausted, the pair collapse onto the hall floor, with feathers drifting down around them. At the restaurant, Nick commands a hectic kitchen, and the dining room is packed as Paula and her waiting staff move busily around the tables. Later, Paula and Nick relax with a brandy as Paula eyes Nick with a smile. Kate's fast asleep in bed when she flicks on her bedside lamp, rises, and wearing her dressing gown, answers the intercom. Nick and Kate sit across from each other at a desk in the lamp-lit lounge, where he spoon-feeds the blindfolded Kate some sauce from a container between them, and in the soft glow of the lamp, Nick observes Kate with a smile.",
    "609": "Sydney floors Sophie and springs up to his feet, then runs off as Elena is being restrained while bouncers approach. Sydney stomps Vincent's dark glasses underfoot, causing Vincent to shield his eyes from the light, and Sydney races out of the doorway. Clayton bursts out laughing, then sharply resumes a serious look as Sydney races outside, where his escape is blocked by fans and photographers amassed behind a red rope cordon. Sydney looks defeated until a young guy lifts the cordon, allowing the bespectacled mop-head guy to nod for Sydney to pass, and he does, racing off through the crowd. He approaches a pretty flame-haired flight desk attendant at LAX airport, glares at his mobile, then looks up to see himself on a TV mounted to a pillar nearby, onscreen showing Sophie diving on Sydney and pinning him to a table, with a close-up of them grappling on the floor. He smiles blankly at her, then obliges. Looking bedraggled in his ruffled mess of a suit, Sydney sits alone in the departure lounge, impatiently tapping his hand with his mobile phone, as a burly guy in a yellow baseball cap, grey jacket, and jeans pushes a floor buffer past behind him. Sidney looks at the gold ring in his palm, spiraling his hand around it and staring off, before a yellow taxi drives through the streets with Sydney seated in the back. He looks out through the window to see a La Dolce Vita open-air cinema screening, where people are seated in deck chairs and on blankets, staring up. Sidney searches for Alison in the crowd, and on the screen, a man rides on a woman's back. He staggers around, looking left and right, then stops to stare up a grassy incline, where his face lights up as he sees Alison reclining on a blanket beside a man and a woman. Alison leans in and talks to the man with an air of familiarity, causing Sidney's face to drop and his shoulders to sink, but as the other woman hugs the man and they cozy up together, Sidney's smile returns, and he hurries up the slope towards them. Alison squints up at him, smiles, and he looks around awkwardly as she picks up her notebook and hands it to him. She looks on as he leafs through it, they smile at each other, and he tosses the book down on the blanket and offers a hand. She takes it and rises to her feet, and they stand hand in hand, facing each other, just inches apart. She smiles, and they share a passionate kiss, then kiss again. He secretly takes the ring from his trouser pocket and puts it in the pocket of her floaty, pale blue floral dress, and they share a look before turning to face the screen.",
    "441": "Don's eyes turn slowly toward the door as Helen stands outside, ringing the bell. She bangs on the door, rattling the doorknob helplessly, but still there is no answer and she raps on the door again. Inside, Don sits staring at the door, holding his breath not to betray his presence, bathed in sweat, with tears of terror in his eyes. He continues staring at the door as Helen turns and runs down the stairs. Mrs. Deveridge stands in her door, peering up, and she hurries to the stairwell and calls down it. Don's eyes are still on the door, now focusing on the door chain. He realizes he's forgotten to put it up, but hopes it's not too late, and with a desperate effort, he flings himself to the floor and starts inching his way to the door. Don is almost at the door when, with his last strength, he raises himself against it, stretches out his hand to get the door chain, tries to slip it in its notch, but misses. Dave, the janitor, with a ring of labelled keys in his hand, leads Helen and Mrs. Deveridge up the stairs. Dave has opened the door and holds it open as far as he can. Don tries again, but by this time the door is open, and despite Don throwing all his weight against the door, it is no use. Helen slips into Dave's place in the doorway and stands waiting until Dave and Mrs. Deveridge start downstairs. Helen then enters and closes the door behind her. A shaft of light comes from the corridor, and Don crouches behind the door. She kneels down beside Don, and they are beside the light switch. Helen snaps it on and leads Don toward it. He stares at the smooth, unstained wall as she seats him on the bed and turns on the bed lamp. Don is panting hard, completely oblivious of the fact that Helen is in the room. On the armchair near the kitchen door lies Helen's leopard coat. Helen lies asleep on the couch, using the pillow and the comforter from Wick's bed. In the doorway to the bedroom stands Don, wearing the dark suit he wore to the opera, as his eyes shift from Helen to the coat while he is just tying his tie. Very cautiously, he begins to tiptoe toward the chair. He picks up the leopard coat and starts towards the entrance door. Just as he is slipping out, Don shuts the door behind him. Helen then flings open the door and runs out. In the next second, Helen hurries into the shot, wearing Wick's foulard dressing gown. She runs to the banister and looks down, barefooted, just wearing the foulard dressing gown.",

Next day, Joe is making Alice up as one of the un-dead. Alice gives Joe a questioning look, and she nods pensively. The lights in the room flickered, and Alice adopts a dead-eyed zombie persona, lurching slowly towards Joe. Waving her arms around jerkily, she draws closer and lunges at him, pretending to bite his neck. They regard each other, smiling, and then Alice goes. Charles had been watching them. Jack is at the wrecked gas station with the manager of the station, Eddie. The sheriff's car is missing from the scene, but fragments of its lights remain. On a used car lot, the engines have been stolen from all the cars. Jack watches suspiciously as a convoy of military lorries passes by on the road, and in the back of one, he notes some airmen operating some kind of radio listening device. As dusk approaches, Joe cycles beside a pylon in a field as he looks for his dog. He gets off his bike and looks around. Back in town, Joe cycles up beside a community bulletin board and sticks a flyer on it. As he looks at the board, something strikes him. He takes a step back and sees that the entire board is covered in flyers for lost dogs of all shapes and sizes. Joe returns home to find Jack at the dinner table with his other deputies, Tally, Mina, Rosko, Ross, and Jay. Joe drops a torch, and the cops look round as the lights flicker and Jack gets on his radio. A telecom engineer's truck drives along a dark road. Rooney is working on a power line outside a junkyard from the cherry picker on the back of his truck. A noise emanates from the junkyard, and he looks over at it for a moment, then gets back on with his job. Bits of scrap fly up into the air from the junkyard, and Rooney watches with mounting concern as a huge hunk of junk sails overhead and lands in the road—it's a cooker. Rooney operates the controls for his cherry picker and gets it to raise him higher so that he can get a better view of the junkyard. The activity in the yard appears to have stopped. As he peers into the gloom, Rooney notices the headlights of his truck and the streetlight nearby start to flicker. The cherry picker has stopped working. Something suddenly lunges out of the trees and grabs him, jolting his truck and breaking the windscreen. Jack is addressing a meeting of concerned locals as he glares at Louis, who is being led away by one of the other deputies.",
    "236": "Silence envelops everyone, each locked in their own thoughts. Father, wearing the Star of David armband, walks slowly along, carrying a string bag with potatoes and carrots, his eyes fixed on the pavement, lost in thought. He passes two German officers who stop, causing Father to turn fearfully and approach them. One German officer strikes Father hard across the face, hitting his ear. Father reels, collects himself, and shuffles on, stepping off the pavement to walk in the gutter. Father continues on. Meanwhile, Szpilman is composing at the piano, making adjustments to the manuscript with a pencil and playing again. Halina enters with a newspaper, handing it to him. He looks at it, and his expression darkens at the sight of a map of the proposed Jewish area: two distinct districts, one large, one smaller. Halina looks over his shoulder and reads as Henryk leans in the doorway, watching, seemingly amused. Szpilman gazes at the map, horrified, and laughs nervously. They're disturbed by the sound of crying from another room. Puzzled, they look at each other, and Halina opens a door to find Mother sitting on the bed, holding a purse, crying, while Father sleeps. Halina sits beside Mother, putting an arm around her as Mother opens the purse to reveal a crumpled note, weeping. Halina tries to comfort her while Szpilman and Henryk watch. Podgy, hairy hands with dirty nails play an octave on the piano, harshly and tonelessly, with straight fingers. The hands belong to Mr. Lipa, a dealer in his early fifties, who sits at the piano, examining the lacquer as Regina stands in the bow, watching him, and Henryk watches intently from the table. Szpilman sits apart, aloof, with his back to the piano and Mr. Lipa. Suddenly, Henryk lunges at Mr. Lipa, grabbing him, and a struggle ensues. During it, Mother and Father appear at their bedroom door, watching, appalled. Henryk subsides, glowering at Mr. Lipa. A great column of Jews of all ages makes its way toward the area that will become the ghetto. They travel on foot, bicycles, and horse-drawn platforms, some pushing prams loaded with belongings, forming a great moving mass of humanity watched by Poles on either side of the street. On a horse-drawn platform are the Szpilmans with their belongings, all wearing armbands. Szpilman, Halina, and Henryk walk beside the platform where Mother, Father, and Regina are seated. Szpilman catches sight of someone among the onlookers, smiles, and pushes through the crowd to Dorota, who is close to tears.",
    "1326": "Next to a faded diorama of the nativity scene, a man deftly rolls an engraved silver Zippo back and forth over his nicotine-stained fingers. Behind the counter, Percy Walker, a black man in his sixties, is cooking with spectacular one-handed dexterity. A stunning sixteen-year-old girl with dyed-black hair and a piercing or three leans seductively over the jukebox, swaying gently to the music. Her headband, doubling as a mini-skirt, reveals her knock-out figure, leaving little to the imagination. Watching from a booth across the diner is a conservatively dressed suburban couple, Sandra and Howard Anderson. The girl, Audrey Anderson, turns to Howard with a caustic smile and then returns to the jukebox, while Percy discreetly watches the exchange from behind the counter. Howard turns back to his wife with a rigid smile. Outside, the noontime sun bakes the highway slicing through the barren country as a black Cadillac Escalade blazes a path, heavy beats thundering from within. Kyle Williams, handsome and in his late twenties with a thug style, passes a weathered road sign and his expression suggests this is not good news. He grabs a cell phone from the passenger seat and spots a truck stop diner up ahead. The Escalade pulls off the highway to the old gas pumps. Kyle gets out, surveying the grease stains and rusty car parts littering the ground, and behind the place, the Silverstream trailer is visible where Jeep was earlier. Kyle grabs a crumpled hand-drawn map from the front seat and flattens it on the car roof. A woman lets out a long slow exhale, considers Kyle, then pulls out a cigarette, lights it off the end of hers, and hands it to him. Kyle takes a drag and pulls out his map again. Charlie quickly hides her cigarette behind her back as Jeep nods uncertainly, eyes Kyle, then shuffles away out of sight. Bob steps off a chair, turns to Kyle, about to respond when Howard approaches, unaware he's interrupting. Bob's expression darkens at the news, and Jeep walks toward the gas pumps, with Bob right alongside him, not giving up. Jeep stiffens, turns to his father, and Bob gives him a hard stare. Jeep looks at his father, his words hanging heavily in the air. Bob then walks back into the diner. Jeep is about to return to the garage when he notices ominous dark clouds on the southern horizon like a living wall.",
    "1030": "At home, he takes pristine white T-shirts off a shelf and lays them in his suitcase with the rest of his clothes, then he packs his tie pouch, straightens up, and sees the cardboard cut-out. He picks up the photo and holds it over his case length-wise and cross-wise. Wearing a sharp charcoal gray suit, Ryan walks through the airport, dragging the case, with Julie and Jim's smiling faces poking out of the top. Ryan stops and stares; outside, Natalie is embracing a big beefy guy. Ryan slides his swipe card through the slot on the self-service check-in machine, then collects his boarding pass and steps away with his case in tow. He wearily raises his eyebrows as he watches Natalie come in, and she stoops slightly as she drags a large unwieldy suitcase, with a large black bag slung over her shoulder and a coat over. Ryan looks at her and sighs, while she looks blank. At a luggage store, Ryan wheels a wheelie case back and forth, and Natalie kneels on the floor transferring her belongings from her hefty suitcase to the neater, smaller wheelie case. Ryan grabs a travel pillow and bins it, then bins a full-size pillow. At security, Ryan sees a group of businessmen and collects his things on the other side of the X-ray machine, while Natalie is being scanned and takes off a bracelet. On the plane, she and Ryan sit side-by-side with the aisle between them, and Natalie types on her laptop. Ryan looks across at her, she stares at him, then with a dismissive glance, she gets back to work, and Ryan smiles wryly. In St. Louis, as they walk through the terminal building, Ryan gets a call from Alex, and a smile spreads across Ryan's face. Ryan walks through an open-plan office with Natalie, who's clutching a pile of strategy packets, as office workers stare at them heading to a private office. Natalie silently seethes while an older balding man holds up a photo of two young girls. Sitting opposite him, Ryan glances down, with Natalie beside him, incredulous. Bob sits back resigned, shaking his head, as Natalie studies Ryan, and craggy-faced Bob stares at Ryan thoughtfully and glances down at the photos of his girls. Ryan nods to Natalie, who picks up one of the strategy packets and hands it to Bob, who looks at the packet and takes it. At the Hilton, Natalie follows Ryan into the lobby, as a woman stares at him while he walks past the queue and up to the desk, handing her a leaflet, which she snatches. In the dining room, Ryan sits with three plates of food, and Natalie sits, poking at her plate of food with her fork. Ryan throws out his hand and smiles.",
    "457": "Inigo struggles bravely under their combined weight, while the Brutes witness as the Giant bursts into flames. In the chapel, the Impressive Clergyman continues speaking as Fezzik removes the holocaust cloak and rushes forward to grab the quickly closing portcullis, swinging it upward with great effort. Yellin watches in fear. Buttercup smiles and shakes her head, knowing she is correct, while Yellin is pressed against the main gate as Westley, Inigo, and Fezzik close in. Westley whips a sword out and hands it to Fezzik. Buttercup stands there, dazed. Count Rugen and his four warriors race through the castle, stopping incredulously at a complex intersection of corridors, while Westley, Inigo, and Fezzik approach. Fezzik drags Westley, who is dragging Yellin's sword due to his weakness. As the confrontation starts, Rugen’s warriors attack, and Inigo goes wild, swiftly defeating them all before they even have a chance to fight back. Holding his sword, Rugen stands for a moment, then unexpectedly turns and runs away, with Inigo surprised but then pursuing him. Rugen runs through a half-open heavy wooden door, locking it just as Inigo throws himself against it in frustration. Fezzik, with Westley, who still cannot walk unaided, props Westley up against a large suit of armor and heads toward the intersection where Inigo's voice was heard. Fezzik gestures for Inigo to stop pounding on the heavy door and with one mighty swipe, he breaks it down. Inigo flies through as Fezzik returns to Westley. Meanwhile, the Queen is several paces ahead, and Buttercup gently stops the King to place a kiss on his forehead, surprising and pleasing him. As Inigo runs through the corridors, glancing back, he sees Inigo closely pursuing him like a streak. Fezzik, at the intersection with the large suit of armor, is puzzled by the absence of Westley, while Count Rugen continues to flee, dashing down a staircase and picking up his pace.",
    "324": "Gandalf, Aragorn, and the Hobbits look horrified as Frodo suddenly coughs and takes a huge breath, opening his shirt to reveal the Mithril Vest. Gandalf leads the fellowship into the huge Dwarrowdelf Chamber, and they hurry towards a distant door as Goblins start scuttling down the pillars behind them like cockroaches. Frodo looks with horror at the overwhelming Goblin army rushing toward them when suddenly a deafening roar fills the air, and a fiery light dances down the hallway. The group backs fearfully away from the approaching beast, melting into the darkness, with the pillars casting eerie shadows. The Goblins freeze as a huge shadow, surrounded by flame, falls across the hall, the ground shakes, and an unearthly sound rumbles. Aragorn hesitates and looks at Gandalf, who glowers at the young Hobbit. Aragorn then leads the fellowship to the top of a dizzying stairway, followed by Gandalf, who leans heavily on his staff. The fellowship races down the stairway, with Aragorn picking up Frodo and leaping across a gaping chasm. At a narrow bridge spanning a bottomless pit, Gandalf yells to the others as Aragorn makes to throw Gimli across the chasm. They race towards the slender bridge of stone, without kerb or rail, at the far end of the hall. The fellowship recklessly hurries over the dizzying bridge, but Gandalf, the last, pauses in the middle of the span and faces the Balrog with his staff in one hand and sword in the other, as Frodo looks back in horror. The Balrog, a massive creature, rises from a chasm as a great 40-foot man-beast with a mane of flames, holding a blade like a stabbing tongue of fire in one hand and a whip of many thongs in the other. Frodo watches as the Balrog puts one foot on the bridge and draws up to full height, wings spreading from wall to wall, while Gandalf is a tiny figure, balanced precariously on the narrow bridge. Gandalf lets go his grip and falls away, following the Balrog into the bottomless abyss as Frodo cries out, and Boromir scoops him up and carries him away. Frodo slowly turns with a look of numb shock on his devastated face as the fellowship marches on. Aragorn scours ahead of the company as they stumble on in the fading light, with the shimmer of a large forest, Lothlórien, seen in the distance. The fellowship runs across a forest floor strewn with yellow flowers, beneath a roof of golden leaves held up by silver pillars, and the trunks of huge, grey trees, as Gimli looks nervously around. The fellowship is suddenly surrounded by armed Elves with deadly arrows aimed at their heads when Haldir, the Elvish captain, steps forward and looks at Gimli with disdain before his eyes lock onto Frodo. Haldir leads the fellowship onto a hilltop where they look with wonderment at the vista spread before them; several miles to the south, a large hill rises out of the woods, upon which rise many mighty mallorn trees taller than any others, and nestled high in the crown of the mallorns is a beautiful city.",
    "650": "The male singer kneels and cradles the body of a woman as a thick mist wafts across the stage. An image suddenly appears of five-year-old Latika chasing a train, followed by an image of a very beautiful Latika in her 20s. Back on the game show, Jamal looks lost in thought, and in the director's edit suite, the video plays in the police station. Two ten-year-old brothers walk along a pipeline, and from an aerial view, they head toward the distant skyscrapers of Mumbai. The city sprawls with high-rise apartments and green parks, juxtaposed with vast slums and shanty towns. Jamal walks alone through slum streets strewn with rubbish and debris and approaches a group of men scavenging on a rubbish tip. He wanders the teeming streets of Mumbai by day and night and questions some young boys his age, who shake their heads. Walking through a crowded night market with stalls selling a thousand and one different things, he is later seen in uniform walking through a kitchen, where Salim, also in uniform, dozes on a kitchen worktop and then wakes up. Jamal descends into a subway where a blind Arvind sings and begs. Jamal stops and recognizes Arvind, digs into his pockets, finds a $100 bill, and gives it to him. Arvind feels his way from Jamal's hands up to his face and smiles. Jamal grips Arvind by the shoulders, looks happily surprised with the news, touches Arvind's face gently, and runs off along the subway as a worker starts to fumigate it. Jamal disappears running through the smoke and emerges with Salim through exhaust fumes on Pila Street at night, which is lined with brothels and where prostitutes sit on chairs on the pavement. Salim questions a woman, who shakes her head, prompting them to move on. Jamal asks another woman, who pats his cheek, while a girl in a silk costume and jewelry dances, whirling round and round. Salim and Jamal wind their way down Pila Street as women call down from balconies and open windows to men on the crowded street. Salim and Jamal question two women, who direct them to an entrance down the busy corridor. Inside, the dancing girl continues her steps under a watchful elderly male teacher who claps to maintain her tempo. Jamal and Salim walk through a brothel, pulling aside curtains covering alcoves where couples are having sex. Jamal approaches a girl, who points to a closed door. He peers through a crack in the door and sees the beautiful dancing girl, but Salim yanks Jamal away and peers through the hole himself, his eye widening in surprise.",
    "346": "Gorbag spies Frodo's body and peers curiously at Frodo as he leans down and pokes at Frodo's lifeless body. Sam, hidden in a rock crevice, experiences shock sweeping across his face as the Orcs grunt and lift Frodo, carrying him back towards the watch tower amidst Orc laughter. Frodo is carried up the steep stairs. From the shadows, Pippin watches aghast as Faramir is lain on a funeral pyre. Denethor kisses Faramir's sweating, fevered brow while bundles of dried firewood are being stacked around. Pippin rushes forward, desperately pulling, but Denethor grabs Pippin by the collar and roughly carries him towards the door, throwing Pippin outside and slamming the door shut. Pippin races down the steep streets, passing soldiers running back from the burning city as great balls of fire hurtle through the air. The city is in chaos amidst the fleeing soldiers, and Pippin desperately pushes against the tide of soldiers retreating from the fighting. Gothmog turns to his second lieutenant as Orcs run through the streets, and men, women, and children flee while the pitched battle continues. Suddenly, in the midst of the battle, Gandalf turns as Rohan has come. Gothmog turns at the sound of the distant horns as 6000 horsemen, led by Théoden and Éomer, step up to the skyline with Minas Tirith lying less than a mile away, down a gentle slope. Over 50,000 Orcs swarm around the base of the city, thick black smoke belches from within it as Merry blanches with fear and Éowyn puts a comforting hand on his shoulder. On the battlefield, Gothmog walks among his troops as the Orcs prepare for battle. Théoden gallops in front of his army, issuing urgent orders to his captains and riding to the front of his army. He rises in his stirrups tall and proud, yelling in a clear, loud voice. A ray of sunlight escapes through the black clouds, bathing the Rohirrim in golden light. Weapons and armor gleam as 6000 horsemen hold their spears aloft. Below, on Pelennor Field, the Orc kneel and raise their lances in readiness. Éowyn, her arm around Merry before her, as Merry looks on in shock. As Théoden rides past the ranks of soldiers he runs his lance along their spears, facing his enemy. Merry is swept up in the emotion and whips out his little sword. All the horns of the Rohirrim burst blast upon blast as the 6000 Rohirrim move off, a great wall of horses and spear points building up to a gallop like a rising tide as they charge towards the 50,000 Orcs. Merry, with wind blowing his hair and Éowyn's arm around his chest, yells at the top of his lungs. Gothmog is marshalling his troops.",

Rain streams down the diamond-shaped window panes. The rain turns to swirling snow, briefly forming the face of Voldemort. The sun rises over the snow-covered village of Hogsmeade. The three friends trudge towards the decrepit Hogshead Inn. They peer inside. A goat walks through the bar. Hermione addresses around 20 students. He glances at Cho. Students shift uncomfortably.

Umbridge watches from a high tower as they return to school. Filch leans close as she gives him instructions. Neville hurries away from the bullying Crabbe and Goyle. Walking along the corridor, an odd sound causes him to stop. He turns back, bewildered. An intricate carving appears in the stone wall in front of him, and then a large archway. As Neville watches, the carved stone becomes a pair of huge, wooden double doors. The doors swing open, revealing a long room lined with shadowy mirrors.",

The image of a face forces itself through the glowing embers. Harry looks nervously over his shoulder as he hears the sounds of a door. A shadow moves on the stairs. Ron appears in his pajamas. Ron turns and goes back up the stairs. Harry looks into the embers again, but the face has gone. The newspaper starts to burn. Harry reads the headline. Then the paper is consumed by the flames. Neville is collecting plants in the lake. Harry opens a book. He waves to Ginny, Ron, and Hermione. Harry gets up. Ron whispers to Hermione. She approaches Harry. Hermione looks exasperated.

    "1234": "He nods towards her ribs, and she hurries to the children and escorts them out to their room, then returns. Connie looks petrified as she slams the door on Ben and locks it. Ben pauses outside, facing the door dejectedly, and after a moment, he leaves the modest clapboard house. Ben cuts off his brother, then in his motel bathroom, he lies fully clothed in a bath that is too short for him, trying to wriggle down, but his head remains well above the level of the bath. Emily is at home working at her kitchen table, with documents stacked on the small table, making notes. She studies her pad thoughtfully, checks a document, then searches through more documents, scribbles a number out on her pad, and encircles another number. Looking down forlornly at the documents, Emily sighs and opens her Filofax, takes out Ben's business card, and studies it. A doctor in a white coat enters a hospital ward, approaches the ice hockey coach and Ben, goes to Ben, shakes his hand, and leaves. George returns Ben's kindly stare with a slight smile. In another hospital room, Ben makes a call on his mobile while Emily is drying up in her kitchen. Ben holds his mobile to his ear, stands looking distraught, then closes his mobile and sits in deep, gloomy thought. A nurse comes to get him, and she goes. Ben stares down gravely, then raises his eyes and stares ahead, his face etched with anguish as he remembers a man and a woman's hand in bright light, their fingers entwined as they caress each other's skin. Lying in bed, the beautiful dark-haired Sarah smiles up at Ben beside her as metal debris spins and scatters in slow motion, a woman is tossed about, and a van flips on a dark road. Ben comes to on his motel bed, lying on his stomach and looking woozy, while a hand comes from behind him and gently strokes his cheek. The figure of a dream-like Sarah gradually lies back down, leaving Ben alone in bed, his mouth hanging open loosely as his eyes blink sleepily. Meanwhile, Emily's neighbor is gardening when Emily walks up to her with Duke on a lead, then walks on slowly past her neighbor's profusion of colorful roses and begins to fight for breath. Emily looks faint as Duke bounds into her garden. Emily blinks and walks towards her steps, but she falls flat on her face on the path, motionless, with her eyes closed.

    "693": "In the movie, a black-suited Spider-Man looks on pitilessly as Flint crumbles to nothing and washes away. Later, Peter, no longer in the Spider-Man suit, walks through a dilapidated breeze block building and pauses to look at himself in a chipped mirror. He adjusts his floppy forelock and stares at his reflection with a frown and fierce eyes. Outside, his landlord is mopping the floor, and Peter glances at the landlord's daughter watching from a doorway. She joins her father, and inside his flat, Peter closes the French windows to the balcony and paces restlessly before examining his reflection again. He unbuttons his shirt to reveal the top of the black spider suit with its gray web and spider emblem and looks at it with uncertainty and fear before tossing it back into the trunk and backing away wearily. Later, he visits Aunt May, who looks into his eyes, making Peter blink uncertainly as his expression wavers, and he glances at her kindly face. Meanwhile, Mary Jane leaves a jazz restaurant with its blue and red neon sign still off, and with a glum expression, she wraps her coat collar around her neck and walks away down the street, looking wretched and alone in the crowded pavement before sitting on a bench and hesitating over calling Peter Parker or Harry Osborne on her mobile. Harry is seen painting a still life expertly as Peter picks up a payphone near his room, drops a coin, sighs, and hangs up. His landlord emerges peeling an orange, and when Peter looks at him searchingly, the landlord's eyes widen before he and his daughter retreat into their flat, with the daughter peeping out to wave. At the top of the Osborne luxury apartment building, Mary Jane exits the lift into the penthouse where Harry waits for her. She takes a deep unhappy breath, and as Harry busily cooks, he turns up the music and grins at Mary Jane, who grins back and starts dancing the twist. Harry smiles, and she encourages him to join in, pulling him from the stove. He joins her, crouching lower as the pan behind him starts to smoke.",

Later, Ron is asleep in bed, and across the room, Harry is also asleep but dreaming of Dumbledore and the Horcruxes. Cameras flash as he sees the locket, the diary, a staring eye, and a ring on Dumbledore's finger. Dreaming of Voldemort and the old wand maker, Harry stirs and wakes, lying ashen-faced on his back as he stares up at the ceiling. Harry snatches up his wand, and with his rucksack on his back, he secretly leaves the Weasley's house and starts to stride away. Ron comes out of the house, follows Harry, and Harry stops and turns round to stare at Ron, who looks back at the house. Ron steps closer to Harry, and the two friends' eyes are fixed on each other. Harry takes off his rucksack and drops it on the ground, turns away, and Ron picks it up and slings it over his shoulder. They head back towards the house. He reads a headline, and in a moving picture, Dumbledore closes the massive doors of Hogwarts School. The back of her beaded dress is unfastened, and he walks over and stands behind her, hesitating for a moment. She half-turns to him, he zips up her dress, and Ginny turns towards him, and they kiss. George tiptoes in cleaning his teeth with a bandage over his ear. He sticks his toothbrush in his ear, picks up a cup, and drinks. Ginny spots him and breaks away from Harry, and George smiles and winks. Harry gently strokes Ginny's arm as she slips away. Looking slightly embarrassed, Harry grins, and George gives him a knowing look. Mr. Weasley organizes the erection of a marquis outside the house, and the Weasley brothers and Hagrid use their wands to magically raise the huge tent. A tall figure strides towards the house, and Hermione and Harry face Rufus Scrimgeour in the living room, with Ron joining Hermione and Harry on the sofa. The Minister lays a flat pouch on the table, takes a document from his briefcase, and it floats in front of him opening as it does so. He unfastens the pouch and hands the Deluminator to Ron, who unwraps a small cylindrical metal object and presses a switch. The light from two lamps is absorbed by the Deluminator, and when he switches it off and on again, the light flies back to the lamps. Ron grins while the others look blank as he unwraps the Golden Ball, and the Minister holds it out in a cloth. Harry reaches out, tentatively takes the Snitch, and studies the Golden Ball while Scrimgeour and Hermione both look expectant, then disappointed, as Harry turns the Snitch over in his hand.",

She smiles warmly at Gandhi, who grins and glances at his dhoti, indicating he doesn't wear many clothes. Bourke-White becomes visibly appreciative, having quickly assessed and been impressed by him. Gandhi walks along with Bourke-White beside him, listening while searching for the right moment to capture. She frames Gandhi in the foreground with a soldier visible above and behind him on a wall. Although Gandhi shrugs, he endures the situation. From her perspective, Gandhi continues walking, with the soldier pacing in the background, and she takes the picture. Nearby, a spinning wheel works rapidly as Gandhi, smiling at Bourke-White, uses one wheel while she clumsily tries to imitate him on another. They are in a slightly overgrown garden with latticed fretwork casting sunlight on the grass and shrubs, maintaining a beautiful appearance. As she grins at her struggle and persists, it’s clear she is earnest in her efforts. Gandhi's smile widens, and they both laugh, observed wonderingly from a distance by a guard on the wall. Gandhi then moves beside Bourke-White and demonstrates the process to her, taking and guiding her hands. She watches him as well as the wheel, to which he gives a knowing smile, though not completely patient. Surprised, she looks at him, and he sighs tolerantly, which she accepts without question as she begins another line of inquiry. Ba pauses and smiles again, then shrugs, suggesting the matter was in the past. Looking at them seriously, they all suddenly burst into laughter like schoolgirls. Meanwhile, military personnel move quietly but urgently around the main entrance, with two military ambulances parked nearby. A British major descends the steps quickly, meeting a British army doctor coming up, whom he signals to one side for a discreet conversation. The major's expression becomes defeated and depressed by the news he receives. Ba lies on a mat with a pillow under her head, her eyes closed and her breathing labored, while Mirabehn sits next to her, gently rubbing Ba's arm. Gandhi is present a short distance away, staring aimlessly at the floor, with Pyarelal unobtrusively positioned behind him. Azad and Patel enter the doorway; Patel makes the pranam gesture and prays, while Azad bows his head, also clearly praying for her.",
    "243": "Their attention is caught by a boy who has a box of sweets on a string around his neck, and he's selling the sweets, pocketing money. Father calls to the Sweet Boy and beckons him over. They search their pockets and handbags, handing over to Father what change they can find, and he, in turn, hands the money to the Sweet Boy, who hands over one caramel and goes on his way. Then, Father carefully takes out his penknife and with great care divides the caramel into six parts and hands a part to each of the family. They all exchange a look, an acknowledgment of each other, almost like a toast, and then they chew, slowly, deliberately. The whistle of a locomotive and the sound of trucks rattling over the rails prompt a sound of great agitation from the Jews in the compound. The locomotive pulling cattle and goods trucks comes into sight, rolling slowly towards the boundary of the Umschlagplatz and coming to a halt, with a cordon of Jewish policemen and SS guards. Among the great throng of people, the Szpilmans trudge towards the train, Szpilman and Halina walking. A Jewish policeman grabs Szpilman by his collar and pulls him back out of the police cordon as the rest of the family reaches the next truck to be filled. A scuffle ensues as Szpilman tries to resist, another Jewish policeman shoves him, and Szpilman stumbles, falling to the ground in front of the closed ranks of the Jewish policemen's backs. He stands, runs at the cordon, seeing between their heads and shoulders Mother, Regina, Henryk, and Halina clambering into the trucks. Father is looking around, bewildered, and when he sees Szpilman, he takes a step towards him but stops, smiling helplessly. Father raises his hand and waves, then turns and goes towards the trucks. Again, Szpilman flings himself at the policemen's shoulders, and Heller turns on him. Szpilman stands for a moment, confused, terrified, then he turns and starts to run. Szpilman drops to walking pace, makes for the gates, where workers are pushing carts piled with the bloated corpses that lay against the wall. Szpilman falls in with them, and they pass through the gates. The doors of the trucks are closed as the train begins to move. Szpilman catches his breath by a building while an SS man and Jewish policeman emerge. The Jewish policeman is servile, crawling to the German, and he points to the train as they laugh and walk away. Szpilman turns and stumbles down the empty street, beginning to weep loud, agonized sobs as he staggers on, lost, empty, and aimless, trying to catch his breath in the aftermath of his tears. He wanders forlornly down the street, passing empty buildings with their doors open and windows smashed.",
    "1357": "Military trucks, tents, and soldiers are stationed while helicopters buzz in the distant sky. Joe moves over to Alice, who looks out at the train crash, haunted by the sight. As Joe stops reloading his gun and stares at the crash, Martin and Preston join them. Joe uses a camera to zoom in and pan from one car to another at the crash site, with Alice watching him intently. The kids, sitting at a table near the window across from the car lot, talk excitedly but quietly as a waitress delivers more food. Cary smiles at Alice, leaving an impact on Joe and the others. The massive train wreck stretches for a mile, with hundreds of military personnel working quickly to clean up the scene. A truck passes by Jack and Nelec, who walk together amid the debris, with Jack looking at Nelec with skepticism. Jack is with Sheriff Pruitt, who is distracted and picks up reports from his desk on his way out. As Pruitt walks off, Jack watches him go, feeling unsettled. Nearby, fingers tap restlessly on a counter next to a Walkman. The scene shifts to Breen, 23, listening to Blondie in a station store, alone, until Sheriff Pruitt, 60, enters and tosses a candy bar to him. Breen removes his headphones and exits the store. Elsewhere, Charles and Cary plan explosions together, while Alice looks at them knowingly and performs her best zombie impression, amusing Joe. Alice leans toward Joe, pretending to bite his neck, causing him to feel a shiver he's never experienced before. Afterward, she pulls back, smiling. Near the gas pumps, Jack, Edie, and Mr. Blakely appear, moving past small shattered pieces of red and blue plastic. Jack kneels by the Smith and Wesson Model 19, examines the broken plastic, and makes a call on his walkie. Meanwhile, Angry Izzy, 65, opens a new car hood, revealing a messy engine with pieces ripped away, as Jack follows him.",
    "701": "A screen shows a scan of a human body next to a high-tech hoverboard. The door of a glass chamber slides open, and green smoke pours out as Harry, wearing just a pair of shorts, steps out, takes a deep breath, and smirks. In a dark, peaceful forest, Peter and Mary Jane lie on a huge hammock-like web on their backs, watching for shooting stars. Mary Jane shuts her eyes tightly, smiles faintly, and then they kiss tenderly. A fiery meteor plummets from the sky and crashes into the forest, but Mary Jane and Peter remain oblivious while wrapped in each other's arms. The glowing orange meteor embedded in the ground cracks open, and black tendrils like living vines spring out and stretch across the ground. Peter, smiling happily, slides down a thread of webbing with Mary Jane, unaware of the tendrils crawling up a nearby ridge like a huge black spider. Peter wraps his moped, and with Mary Jane sitting on the pillion seat, it starts to move off. The strange black substance crawls speedily up behind and attaches itself to the rear number plate as the moped rides off down the woodland track. At night, a train rumbles across a bridge in the heart of Brooklyn, and close by, a burly fair-haired man in an orange jumpsuit runs down a dark street. A police car with a search lamp mounted by the passenger window turns onto the street behind him and drives down the road at a walking pace. The man, Flint Marko, hides in the shadows and watches nervously as the squad car cruises past. Flint grabs the bottom rungs of a metal ladder mounted on a wall, holds himself up, and climbs the ladder to a fire escape outside a bedroom window. He gently opens the window and climbs into the dark bedroom, where he looks down at a little girl of about 10 years old asleep in bed with a tube connected to her nose. Flint sits on the window sill, gazes at her intently, reaches into his jumpsuit, and takes out a handful of letters addressed to Penny Marko, which he gently slides underneath Penny's pillow. He pulls open a drawer, takes out a green-and-black-striped T-shirt, and in the dark kitchen, he breaks some bread in half. He turns sharply as the light comes on and looks at a blond woman in her 40s with her arms folded, wearing a disenchanted expression. They both turn to the door as Penny, who's overheard, comes in. Flint walks over to her, kneels down in front of her, and gently takes her arm.",
    "543": "Henry has clearly been concentrating entirely on the vase, and he is examining the broken end carefully. Henry throws the vase against the wall where it shatters. Indy steps to the door and stands, listening. Henry slides his umbrella through the straps of his bag, and Indy nods. Henry laughs genuinely, believing himself to be laughing at the expense of the S.S. Officer. He's so pissed off, he literally rips a machine gun from the hands of one of the startled soldiers. He turns and sprays the room with machine gun fire, cutting all three Nazis to ribbons and blowing them backwards across the room. Henry looks shocked and horrified. Indy grabs him and pushes him ahead, leading Henry down the hallway as he searches for Elsa. He opens a door and enters. Indy and Henry rush back into the room where Elsa had been left, only to find a Nazi Colonel holding Elsa hostage. He looks at Elsa, then back to his father. Everyone is yelling at once. Vogel jams the barrel of the Luger painfully into Elsa's neck, and Elsa screams. He drops the machine gun to the table and it slides across, shattering glass. Vogel releases his grip on Elsa and shoves her toward Indy. She is propelled directly into his arms, and he holds her tightly. Her hand slips into his coat pocket and removes the Grail Diary. She steps back next to Vogel, and Indy is stunned. A large baronial room is decorated with ancient tapestries and suits of armor. Indy and Henry are ushered in, hands tied behind their backs, accompanied by Vogel and Elsa and two Nazi guards. Elsa crosses the room toward a high-backed chair facing the fireplace. Indy and Henry do not have the advantage of seeing who is sitting in that chair. They only see a hand reach out. Indy looks at Henry with surprise. The man in the chair gets to his feet and turns, revealing himself to be Walter Donovan. Donovan smiles benignly and flips through the Grail Diary. Elsa rushes to Donovan's side and takes the Grail Diary from him. Elsa takes a look for herself, then glances up at Indy. Brody disembarks from the train along with the other passengers, a cross-section of Arabs and Tuskens. A man in the crowd holds out a cup of water to Brody, who continues through the crowd past various street vendors. A woman holds a chicken out to him, and then the woman walks away, leaving Brody alone in the crowd. Sallah shoulders his way through the mob toward Brody. They meet and hug, then begin to walk. Brody searches in his coat pocket for the map as a sinister man approaches, and Brody puts the map back in his pocket.",
    "405": "She turns toward him and undoes her hair, which falls around her shoulders. Fergus runs his hand down her throat, and she draws him behind a curtain toward the bed, pulling him down as they kiss passionately. She then walks into the bathroom, and Fergus lies there, looking at the picture and listening to the sound of running water. She comes out dressed in a silk kimono, looking extraordinarily beautiful, and he draws her toward him, beginning to kiss her face and neck. She murmurs no as his hands slip the wrap down from her shoulders, then stop. The kimono falls to the floor gently, with a whisper, and the camera travels with it, revealing in a close-up that she is a man. Fergus sits there, frozen, staring at her, saying nothing. She gives a strange little laugh and reaches out to touch him, but he smacks her hand away, gets up, and runs to the bathroom. She grabs his feet, but he kicks her away, runs into the bathroom, and vomits into the tub. She lights a cigarette as Fergus slams the door shut. She sits on the couch, the kimono round her once more, looking very much like a woman, with a trace of blood on her mouth. Fergus comes out of the bathroom, and she looks up, some hope in her face, as he makes to go. She grabs him to stop him, but he pulls away, and she falls to the floor. Fergus sits as Col turns to him, and he touches her arm, but she whips her arm away and walks into the crowd, toward the door. Fergus leaves and walks outside Dil's place, where the blinds in her room are down, and the light is on inside. We see her outline, pacing up and down behind the blinds, smoking a cigarette. A man removes a large number six from a huge scoreboard with a pole and replaces it with a number nine. Below the scoreboard, we see Dil walking across a lawn toward the building where Fergus is working. Fergus is fitting a new window into the finished wall, and on the pitch, we see cricketers distorted through the moving glass of the window. Across the pitch, Dil walks with a lunch basket in her hand, dressed in a very short skirt with high heels. As she approaches the site, a chorus of whistles breaks out. Fergus, hearing the whistling, stares out and sees Dil moving toward the site. He drops the window, and the glass shatters. As the whistles continue, we see Dil in the site's lift, which rises up. Meanwhile, we see Deveroux and Franknum climbing up a ladder toward Fergus, and through this conversation, Fergus can hear the chorus of wolf whistles increasing.",
    "793": "Willie lobs a bottle over his shoulder, smashing it on a Mercedes windscreen. Unconcerned, he ambles after Marcus towards a mall where a manager deals with an irritated Santa. Harrison sees Willie and Marcus. Willie gazes lustfully at someone through his cigarette smoke. Marcus winces and shoves Willie. In an office, Bob sits with a black guy who takes a gargantuan drag on a cigarette while the security chief eyes Bob and peels an orange. Down in front of the grotto, Marcus works a crowd of kids as Santa's chair remains conspicuously empty. Marcus turns to a gum-chewing female helper, rolls his eyes, shakes his head, and then turns to the kids. Marcus goes backstage and finds Santa comatose, waking him roughly. Santa swigs his grog as Marcus goes out front where kids are lined up inside the grotto. A fat kid with an ice cream takes a deep breath and sneezes over Santa. A small girl sits on snotty Santa's knee, followed by a boy with long hair, whom Santa shoos away before looking over at Marcus. A bus pulls up at a bus stop near some cool skater kids, and a fat boy with curly blonde hair steps off, catching the skaterats' attention. Fat Ass tries to look dignified as he walks on, but a skaterat throws a tin that bounces off his hand. Eyes front, Fat Ass waddles towards the mall, and inside, he's in the grotto where Santa impatiently munches nuts. Marcus leads Fat Ass over to surly Santa, and he sits on his knee, staring at him, with boogies dangling from his paunchy nose. He pulls Santa's beard. At the end of the day, Fat Ass is sitting in the car park outside the mall as Willie and Marcus come out, and Willie gives Marcus the finger as he walks away, with Fat Ass watching him go. Still in his Santa suit, Willie sits alone at the counter in a bar, lights a cigarette, chews some gum, and looks resentfully around at the festive social drinkers. He drags on his cigarette and notices a bald, goatee-bearded Indian guy giving him the evil eye across the bar, prompting Willie to stare back. The Indian guy keeps his malevolent gaze on Willie before looking away. The barmaid comes over, sniffs his empty glass, refills it, and gives him a sunny smile. Willie knocks back his drink as the barmaid frowns, then smiles, grins, laughs, and pours out a shot for herself as well as Willie’s.",
    "618": "Beneath a cloudy sky, a low-rise bungalow perched on a gentle slope looks out over an uneven lawn. A teenage girl with short brown hair tied back in a small ponytail swigs from a small plastic bottle as she contemplates an armchair standing on the lawn in front of her. In a flashback, she steps out of her knickers and walks slowly across the room toward a skinny boy sitting bare-chested in the same armchair. Wearing just a T-shirt, she straddles the boy's lap, giving a tentative smile as she brings her rosebud lips close to his face, stopping his mouth with a tender kiss. The shaggy blond dog does what he's told. The girl takes a swig of juice and wipes her mouth on the sleeve of her hoodie. She picks up a pregnancy kit, then reaches for the washroom key, which he hands to her. In the washroom, she unzips her jeans, sits down on the lavatory seat, opens the pregnancy detection kit, brings out a narrow paddle-shaped stick, and puts it into position. She pulls out the stick and gives it a cursory look, then hurries back through the store towards the counter where she slaps a pack of sweets onto it and gazes at the test. She shakes it, rolls her eyes at the clerk, and leaves the store, stick in hand, her expression suddenly forlorn. Juno slings a rope of candy onto the branch of a tree and makes a noose, bites into the liquorish rope, and wanders off home. Bedrooms have the light switch doubling as a doll's penis, and naked dolls are clustered on the mantelpiece. There's a photo of Bleeker playing his guitar. Juno dials a number on her hamburger-shaped phone, and a girl lying on her bed with a rabbit on her chest answers. They take up the armchair, shoving it into the back of a car. Bleeker hands Juno a note and she beams. Bleeker wears his brown and yellow sports kit. Juno sits in the armchair on his front lawn. A posse of runners in brown and yellow passes by on a rug. Juno lowers her eyes as Bleeker's eyes cross beneath his yellow sweatband, the color washing from his pale cheeks. Juno blinks happily as Bleeker swallows. A thin smile flashes across her heart-shaped face, and she cuts a pipe between her teeth. She gets on her bike and rides off, leaving Bleeker clutching his sandwich. Juno cycles up to Dancing Elk School, parks her bike, and secures it with a chain lock. She makes her way past the oncoming throng of students, most of them taller than her, reaching her locker.",
    "390": "The Dude is slumped disconsolately back in his easy chair, with two uniformed policemen, one middle-aged and the other a fresh-faced rookie, facing him on the couch. In his lap, a portable phone is chirping, and The Dude waits for the rings to end. The scene shifts to a loft where a huge unfinished canvas, lit by standing industrial lights, dominates one wall. The Dude stands in the middle of the loft, looking into the murky depths of the cavernous space, and turns as he hears running footsteps. Something huge and white hurtles towards his head, causing him to duck and spin as it roars overhead. A naked woman in a sling suspended from a ceiling track rumbles over a canvas on the floor, flicking paint down with a paint bucket and brush. Two young men in paint-spattered shorts, T-shirts, and sneakers haul the sling back for another push. The furnishings are spare, with The Dude's brilliant rug on the floor. The woman aims a remote at a projection TV, and the screen flickers to life, showing a sallow-faced man in blue coveralls, Dieter, the floater in Lebowski's pool. The Dude is at the bar, a bottle of Kahlua frozen halfway to his glass, sitting in the back holding a White Russian and listening to the chauffeur, a man of about the same age with a ponytail emerging from his livery cap. He takes a sip of his freshly-mixed White Russian, leaving milk on his mustache, and mentions feeling really shitty earlier, having lost a little money and being down in the dumps. The limo rolls to a stop, and The Dude gets out, still holding his drink. Watching the rearview mirror, Tony jerks a thumb over his shoulder, prompting The Dude to turn and scowl as he sees a Volkswagen bug halfway up the block, with a fat man's shape in the driver's seat. The Dude is then grabbed from behind and muscled away in a half-nelson by another uniformed chauffeur. As he is frog-marched towards another limo, The Dude holds his drink away from his chest and cups a hand underneath. The waiting limo's back door is flung open, and The Dude is shoved inside, awkwardly taking a seat facing the rear. Brandt sits catty-corner from The Dude, and directly across from him is the big Lebowski, a comforter across his knees.",
    "1228": "Ezra is woken by the ringing, and he presses a button on a digital clock beside his bed before picking up the phone. Tim hangs up. Ezra, now sitting on the side of his bed in shadowy light, lowers the phone slowly from his ear and swallows hard. In the motel, Tim pulls a large bag of ice from the freezer, slits it open, dumps it into the bathtub, and turns on the shower. He checks his watch, which is on the side of the bath, then makes a call. Tim covers his face with his hand and nods as he weeps and rocks back and forth. Meanwhile, Sarah admires her engagement ring. As Tim emails a response to the message he received, the Corvette wanders into the opposite lane, narrowly missing an oncoming car. The Corvette spins and collides with a van full of people, and the van flips several times, throwing its passengers about like rag dolls. The Corvette Tim was driving bounces and rolls down a steep embankment, coming to rest as a mangled heap among bushes. In his motel room, Tim steps gingerly into the bathtub of iced water, wearing the jeans and polo shirt. He slowly lowers himself into the tub and leaves a note on the floor beside it. Tim recalls a blissful-looking Emily lying in bed with him and stroking his face. He surfaces from the memory, reaches for a plastic bucket on the side of the bath, and pours the contents into the water. The box jellyfish glides through the water and up to Tim's hand, where it languidly wraps its tentacles around his forearm and stings him. Tim jolts as his body instantly goes into shock from the poison. As he spasms, he grabs hold of the shower curtain around the bath, his legs kicking. There's a flashback to the accident as Tim hurriedly staggers through undergrowth, tearing up the shower curtain and bringing it and the rail down on himself. Another flashback occurs as Tim lurches toward Sarah, who's been thrown from the car and lies on the dark road. He crouches beside her. Tim's spasms begin to subside. In a flashback, he reaches out to touch Sarah's inert, bloody hand and lies on the road, cuddling her and weeping. In the motel, Tim lies on his back in the tub, his chin sinking to his chest. In a hospital, medics try to resuscitate Tim while Dan is in deep conversation with an official. Emily's pager wakes her. Lying on her stomach, she reaches out for the pager, then raises herself a little to look at it. Suddenly noticing the empty space beside her in the bed, she sits up and scans about. In an operating room, Tim's body is lifted onto a table.",
    "338": "Pippin finishes his bittersweet song and looks up at Denethor, who continues as if he has not sent his son to his death. Pippin turns away, his sorrow etched on his young face. Gandalf sits quietly in a courtyard, alone and defeated. Great siege towers and catapults roll along the repaired bridge that spans both sides of Osgiliath, heading straight towards Minas Tirith. Aragorn, Théoden, Éomer, Merry, Legolas, and Gimli gallop into a vast camp beneath the cover of trees, teeming with men, horses, and tents. Théoden acknowledges Grimbold, a Marshal of Rohan, as he passes by a group of soldiers and smiles grimly as he rides on. Aragorn joins Théoden on a bluff overlooking the encampment. The camera cranes to reveal thousands of men and horses with smoke from many small campfires filling the valley. Aragorn turns to Théoden, who realizes that no matter the numbers, he must commit to war by the morning and nods. The horses whinny loudly in the distance as Théoden looks up at the mountain looming behind them. Horses rear in terror as Rohan soldiers try to quiet them. Legolas and Gimli move through the camp. Legolas looks at a group of Rohan soldiers who sit quiet and hunched, with no one speaking, and then looks toward Éomer, who is unsaddling his horse. Gimli's eyes travel to a row of ancient standing stones marking the entrance to a road leading away from the encampment and into the mountain. Aragorn stands before the road as though transfixed, before him a horse whinnies and pulls at his ropes nervously, and a ghostly figure seems to emerge from the gloom. Aragorn starts in fright as he stares down at the little dwarf, then casts another look back at the ancient standing stones before following Gimli. All is quiet in the encampment. Éowyn kneels before Merry, adjusting his helmet. Merry exhales, excited and terrified in equal measure. In his excitement, he draws his sword, and Éowyn steps back, laughing. As Éowyn and Merry leave the tent, Éomer and Gamling sit nearby, finishing a meal. Éowyn ushers Merry off, and Merry hurries away. Éomer watches the young hobbit leave as Gamling stifles a laugh. Éowyn turns on both of them. At the plateau edge, a guard looks down the steep precipice as a horse and rider move along the ridge. The hooded figure slowly rides up the narrow zigzag track leading up to the plateau. Aragorn tosses in his sleep, disturbed by images and voices. As Arwen lies dying, the Evenstar falls from her fingers. At that moment, Aragorn wakes, his sword quickly in his hand as a guard stands in the doorway. Aragorn hurries towards Théoden's tent, and Théoden looks up as Aragorn enters.",
    "159": "Patel reacts with surprise and apprehension as he turns and sees Gandhi standing slowly, and it almost stops him while he is moving toward the door. It stops them all as Gandhi turns and looks at him bleakly. Patel and Azad, along with Pyarelal and now the giant figure of Abdul Ghaffar Khan, are seen there for the first time among Gandhi’s intimate group. A police commissioner approaches Gandhi, demanding his attention. The camera pans to a poor quarter of artisan dwellings in narrow streets, where fires, the sounds of spasmodic gunfire, looting, screams, the roar of police vehicles, and occasional sirens create an atmosphere of chaos. Yet outside one house, a car, army jeep, policemen, a few soldiers, and a group of people form a little island of calm. On the roof of this house, a figure peers down at the rioting streets below. Azad, Tahib, a Muslim whose house it is, Mirabehn, and Pyarelal are also present with Abdul Ghaffar Khan. A surging gang of torch-bearing youths, far outnumbering the police and soldiers, shout up at the roof while wielding black flags, some stained with blood, and knives still wet with blood. Nehru lowers his head under the weight of these burdens, gripping his temples as he thinks solemnly, and nods in acknowledgment. Sounds of rioting and looting echo in the nearby streets as a mass of people gather, many of them youths with black flags, lining up along the building. Azad ushers Nehru and Patel under the canopy awning, where Gandhi lies curled on his side, writing while Pyarelal takes pages from him, both ignoring the chaos around them. Gandhi looks tired, occasionally tightening his jaw in pain as a doctor sits near the foot of the cot and Abdul Ghaffar Khan is beyond him. Near the other edge of the canopied area, Mirabehn sits with Bourke-White, whispering quietly, but stops on seeing Nehru and smiles a relieved greeting, knowing Gandhi’s feelings for him. Bourke-White stares at Nehru and Patel before slowly reaching for her camera.",
    "950": "A Jeep motors along a quiet dark road; Jack is driving, and Louis sits beside him with a troubled expression. Louis looks over at Jack, who keeps his eyes on the road, though deep emotions boil beneath the surface, and Jack gives him the briefest of glances. They stand at the edge of the pit, looking down as something falls about 30 feet before touching the bottom. At the cemetery, Joe and Cary climb down a rope into the tunnel that the alien has built. At the bottom, they light another sparkler and look around the gloomy tunnel, hurrying down the large bore tunnel. Up ahead is faint flickering light, and as Joe and Cary round a corner, they see a massive chamber cut into the subterranean rocks. They cautiously edge closer, finding it full of machinery and some kind of industrial scale construction taking place. As they creep closer, they come across the sheriff hanging upside down from the roof of the tunnel, either dead or unconscious. Joe claps his hand over Cary's mouth to stop him from screaming. They look around at more bodies hanging upside down from the ceiling, none of them moving. The alien appears in the chamber, doing something behind some machinery and holding what appears to be a severed human leg, then scuttles off. Joe spots Alice dangling upside down and hurries back up the tunnel, using a sparkler to light his way, while Cary empties out his bag of pyrotechnics. Joe arrives at a fork in the tunnel and chooses a path. Cary selects some noisy fireworks and watches as the alien works on whatever it is building. Alice is still dangling motionless, and the tunnel fork brings Joe close to her. He watches as the alien continues its work. Cary tries to get his lighter to spark up. The alien remains oblivious to Cary or Joe and stops its work to take Alice down from where she's hanging. Joe watches with mounting alarm as Cary finally sparks his Zippo into life, lights a firecracker, and leaves it beside other fireworks before running back down the tunnel. The alien puts Alice down and investigates the noise. Joe breaks cover, runs to Alice, who lies un-moving on the chamber floor, hesitates, then slaps her hard. She wakes, stares at him, and hugs him tightly.",
    "394": "He puts his arm around her and drags her on. He comes to a small canvas tent with a sign on it - TOILET. He holds her hand. Jody walks inside the canvas flap and vanishes from sight. We can still see his hand, holding Jude's. She leans against the canvas, looking bored. She stands there, listening to the sound of him urinate. Her eyes flick around the carnival. They settle on a tall dark-haired man in a dark jacket. He nods. He staggers out, buttoning up. He goes to kiss her. She turns her head away. She pulls him over toward the water. Jody follows her as she walks backward, drawing him on. He moves his hips to a song as Jude leads him over the beach, under a train trestle. He sinks down on his knees toward her. She wraps her arms around his neck and kisses him. Jody writhes on top of her, fumbling with his belt. Jude cocks one eye upward. A shadow falls across them. A gun is put to his head. He turns around, drunkenly. The gun whacks him across the cheek, and he falls sideways. Jude scrambles to her feet and darts like an animal through a field. Jody feels his cheek. He can see her blond head vanishing among the fields. He looks up and sees a group of men around him. The tallest of them, Fergus, cocks the gun. A mini, driving down a country road. Two men in the front, three in the back. On the floor of the car Jody lies, with three pairs of feet on top of him, a black bag over his head and the barrel of a gun dangling close to his face. Fergus holds the gun. He is smoking a cigarette. His movements are slow and somewhat innocent. Jody pulled through and tied to a chair. Maguire, a small lean man, talks to him through the hood. Jody is motionless under the black hood. All the men are drinking tea. The blond woman comes in with a plate and some food on it. Jody sits as still as a grave, saying nothing. Fergus is sitting by a chair, gun in his hand, watching the prisoner. Jude comes in, with a flashlight. She moves over to him. She prods him in the legs with her foot. Then she lifts the hood ever so slightly, to peer inside. Suddenly the man moves like lightning, jerking his head down so the hood comes off, throwing his body, tied to the chair, over Jude. He pins her to the ground, his body bent with the chair. He writhes on top of her in a grotesque parody of love.",
    "878": "Kate arrives home and looks around with a frown, making her way to the kitchen where a plate of cigarette ends sits on the table. She picks it up and empties the cigarette butts into the bin. Kate looks at a clock above the stove and then makes her way down the hall to Zoe's bedroom, where Zoe has made herself a den under the bed. Kate nods, then peers under the bed to see that Zoe has several stuffed toys with her. Zoe gives a brief nod and looks away from her aunt, and Kate's smile fades as she looks down sadly. Zoe turns back to Kate and gives a faint smile. Kate kisses her fingers and touches Zoe's forehead before pulling the valance sheet down, hiding Zoe from view. Kate stands up, walks slowly out of the bedroom, and makes to close the door behind her but has a change of heart and leaves it open. The next day, Kate and Zoe walk down the street towards the restaurant. Paula looks up as they enter the restaurant, and Kate leads Zoe towards the kitchen. Inside, a bored Zoe sits on a worktop, swinging her legs, while Kate chats to Leah, and Nick, who has overheard, searches on a shelf behind Zoe and brings out a bowl and bunch of basil. He places the bowl next to Zoe, sniffs the basil, and begins to pick the leaves, then holds the bunch out to Zoe, who smells it. Kate sees Nick talking to Zoe and watches as he gives her a handful of basil, and although the youngster hesitates, she begins to help him pick the leaves. Paula walks in and then goes back into the restaurant. Later, Nick empties a pan of spaghetti and tomato sauce into a large pasta bowl and walks over to where Zoe is sitting, joining her with the spaghetti. Zoe watches him a little shyly as Nick sprinkles some of the basil leaves over his meal, winds the spaghetti around his fork, and begins to eat. Zoe eyes the food hungrily, and when a waiter addresses the kitchen, Nick hands the bowl of spaghetti to Zoe and goes back to work, watching her as she looks down longingly at the pasta. Zoe looks over at Nick, then back down at the spaghetti and gingerly picks up the fork to take a mouthful. Nick continues to watch her as she tucks in hungrily to the spaghetti and grins at him. Walking back into the kitchen, Kate picks up her apron and ties it around her waist, gaping in surprise as she sees Zoe devouring the bowl of spaghetti.",
    "575": "He takes a seat on the couch, opens a folder, and suddenly flinches with a spasm of pain in his shoulder. It is sharp but brief; he notices it, but since it does not continue, he ignores it. Parrish resumes looking at the folder when suddenly the pain returns. Frozen with surprise, Parrish's eyes search the room for the source of the sound; it comes from no particular direction, yet surrounds him. Suddenly Parrish's symptoms sharply intensify; he is sinking to the floor but somehow grabs a corner of the desk, holding on with one hand while clutching his shoulder and arm with the other, as the pain violently seizes the upper part of his body. Parrish grips the edge of the desk, assaulted by pain on one hand, with the Voice coming at him from the outer; each aberration feeds on the other, and he is beside himself, consumed with pain and bewildered by what seems to be a hallucination but which he is certain is not. Parrish is possessed. Parrish gasps. He holds on tight to the corner of the desk, sweat dripping, his skin ashen. Susan at the door now pauses abruptly, her eyes on the Young Man. The Young Man holds the door for Susan as they step out onto the street. Susan is staring at him now; he smiles, all open and vulnerable. Parrish ignores her, his attention taken by the Voice. His eyelids flutter, nonplused, edgy, and fearful. Parrish is confounded. Blindly and disconcerted, he follows Allison and Drew and Quince. Parrish sits. Parrish is on the edge of his seat, struggling to hide his panic. The conversation swirls around Parrish, and he is deaf to it. Parrish is in shock, still striving to gain control of himself. As Coyle serves him, Parrish turns to Luisa. Parrish is stunned. Parrish, spinning with anxiety, tries to summon up his courage to go as Allison continues. Finally, Parrish rises from the table and starts out. Allison is about to press the point but then drifts into disappointed silence as Parrish leaves the room. Parrish moves deliberately down the hall, slowing as he nears the doorway to the library. The door is open. He hesitates before crossing the threshold, taking in as much as his eye can see; tentatively, he enters. A beautiful, classic room with areas of dim, warm light, club chairs, books reaching to the ceiling, a rolling library ladder, a weathered dictionary on a stand, and a model boat carved of bone set into the stacks, which are separated from the reading area by a seven-foot high partition of obscured glass. Parrish, poised in the doorway, looks around, nothing in sight. Parrish is startled; he shrinks backward for a moment, his eyes searching the room for the Voice, the timbre and pitch of which is exactly what he has heard before.",
    "673": "Peter watches as Aunt May lays flowers on Uncle Ben's grave and then helps a white-haired elderly woman to her feet as Aunt May's coat billows in the stiff breeze, which also blows falling leaves around the two of them. Clutching her bag to her and, with one hand on her hat, Aunt May strides away while Peter stands with his back to the departing figure. Later, Peter is sitting at the dining table when Aunt May comes through from the kitchen holding a tea pot. She strides up to the table, pours a cup of tea, sits down next to him, and as Peter, in a blue shirt, tie, and spectacles still on, lowers his eyes and then looks at his aunt who sips her tea, he nods his head. She looks at him quizzically, staring intently at her nephew, as tears well up in Peter's eyes. He stretches out his hand to place it on hers, but with her eyes fixed on Peter's face, Aunt May removes her hand from under his. As he gazes at her through tearful eyes and looks away, Aunt May gets to her feet, leans on the table for support, then about turns and runs up the stairs, leaving Peter sitting at the table. Meanwhile, in his lab, Octavius uses two of his limbs to push a curved base into a replica fusion chamber from which four curved pillars rise, easing the final girder securely into position. He steps back standing inside the fusion chamber which floats on the river below, looking up at the structure and the limb, and then suddenly spins around as the houseman enters while Harry drinks. Bernard turns and walks out as lightning flashes, casting Harry's features in a pallid white. Harry strides over to the open French windows which lead out onto a balcony, goes outside with his glass in hand, and stops when he hears a distant thud. He starts to look around the vast terrace-like balcony, where lights on the pillars and small trees and bushes remain dormant. The balcony judders as the thuds seem to move closer, prompting Harry, his face grim and curious, to step forward towards the balustrade. As he looks over the parapet, one of the mechanical limbs rears up and throws him off his feet, causing Harry's glass to fly in the air, only for a pincer to catch it and a limb to grab Harry by the ankle as Octavius smiles. The limb hauls Harry back onto the balcony, aided by another limb, and Harry is set down on the ground, staring at Octavius. Then, the four mighty limbs start to move away with Octavius carried in midair and, as he turns to Harry, scuttles like a spider out of Harry's sight. Lastly, Peter reads it at a newsstand.",
    "524": "Hannah, who'd been mashing some food in a bowl on a nearby counter, hesitates momentarily and then turns to Holly. Licking her fingers, Hannah walks past Holly to attend to some food on a different stove. Holly turns to face her, and only Holly is seen as she talks to the offscreen Hannah, with the camera moving in closer on her face. As Holly speaks, she distractedly nibbles an hors d'oeuvre, and then pops another into her mouth as the background singing gets louder and the film cuts to a child sprawled out under a blanket on a sofa, with some guests chattering quietly, while others drink and eat, listening. As they continue to sing, the film cuts back to the kitchen, where Lee, carrying some glasses, enters through the doorway and walks over to her sisters, putting the glasses down on a counter. Hannah is scooping seeds out of a cantaloupe, while Holly, leaning on the table, sips her drink. The music from the living room is softly heard as the three sisters chat comfortably and easily with each other, until Hannah shakes her head in disapproval while Holly angrily takes another sip of her drink. The film cuts briefly back to the living room, where Evan is still playing the piano and singing, and the camera moves past him and a few guests to Norma, who is enthusiastically singing along, looking at Evan and moving her hands. The table is beautifully set for Thanksgiving dinner, complete with candles, flowers, cut crystal, china, and silver. Hannah's children are playing in the room as Hannah enters, carrying a huge roast turkey, with Holly carrying a casserole behind her. The film cuts to April, standing in the doorway of the dining room and holding a drink. Holly groans, looking at her sister, while April sips her drink and nods. Hannah screams with laughter as she walks toward the end of the table, past a gleeful Holly, who points her finger at Hannah as she passes. Hannah, still laughing, playfully pushes the accusing finger away and walks over to a nearby china cabinet. As Holly continues to tease her sister, Hannah opens a drawer in the cabinet, takes out two apples decorated with paper turkey heads and tails, and hands them to April. While Holly is talking, Hannah hands her the last turkey apple, accidentally sticking her with one of the toothpicks that keeps the decorations in place. He walks out of the bathroom, moving down the hallway towards the camera. Elliot walks into the bedroom as Lee continues to talk offscreen, and the camera, leaving Elliot, moves across the room, past a wall of framed paintings, a headboard and bed, a night table and lamp, revealing Lee.",
    "65": "Evelyn steadies herself on the open car door and stares at Gittes for a long moment before he gently tugs the car door closed. Evelyn remains unperturbed as he drives off into the Wilshire traffic, leaving her looking after him. Gittes goes through the door to the Secretary, who looks up, recognizes him again, and is not happy to see him; she immediately gets up and goes into the inner office. Gittes turns and strolls around the office, stopping as he spots a photo of the man with the cane, whom he had seen photos of earlier, standing high in the mountains near a pass. Gittes pulls out a cigarette case, offers the Secretary one, but she refuses. He lights up and begins to hum 'The Way You Look Tonight,' while strolling along the wall looking at more photographs, where he spots several photos of a much younger Mulwray, along with Julian Cross. Still humming, Gittes turns to the Secretary, who gets up, annoyed, and goes into Yelburton's inner office. Gittes goes back to the photographs and hears a scratching sound, apparently coming from just outside the outer door. He moves quickly to it, hesitates, and swiftly opens the door to find workmen scraping away Mulwray's name on the outer door, looking up at him in some surprise. The Secretary returns and sees the workman on the floor as Gittes heads toward the door and nods graciously, heading into Yelburton's office, where there is a subtle but perceptible difference in Yelburton's attitude. Gittes nods and smiles, leaving an unsmiling Yelburton, enters, and drops his hat on Sophie's desk. Sophie tries to tell him something, but Gittes goes on into his office, where she looks up when he enters. Gittes moves to his desk, barely breaking stride at the sight of her, sits, and smokes. Gittes buzzes Sophie, Evelyn nods, she lights another cigarette, and signs it. Cross is visibly surprised and nods. Gittes glances down at the fish whose isinglass eye is glazed over with the heat of cooking, and he laughs and shrugs. Cross starts to reply, but there is the sound of a mariachi band as some men in formation clear a bluff about a hundred yards off, dressed like Spanish dons on horseback. Cross shakes his head, looks to Gittes in some real surprise, and then hatefully. Dark and quiet except for the whirring of fans, Gittes approaches one of the clerks at a desk, whose droopy eyes widen a little at a snotty remark. Gittes smiles, regards the clerk's back a moment, then goes to the stacks, where he sees the clerk turn to another and say something, prompting the second clerk to get on the phone.",
    "643": "She looks up to the walkway, sees Jamal, and smiles. Suddenly, Jamal notices Salim and two men sprinting on the platform towards Latika. He points behind her. She sees Salim and runs onto a waiting train. Salim finds her and pulls her off the train by her hair. He grimaces towards Jamal rushing down a flight of stairs. Then, with the other men, they manhandle the three through the crowd to the exit. Salim forces Latika into a waiting car. Jamal is still trying to weave his way through the crowds. Jamal arrives to see one thug holding a blade to Latika's face. Salim points threateningly at Jamal. The thug slices the blade across her face. He jeers at Jamal as he slams on the car window. Jamal looks on helplessly as the car speeds off into the traffic. Behind the scenes, the host walks into the toilets. Jamal sits in the cubicle. The host goes to the urinal. He leaves the toilets. Jamal exits the cubicle and approaches the sink to wash his hands. He looks at himself in the mirror and sighs. He notices at the bottom of the mirror the letter B has been written in the condensation. His jaw drops as he looks through the door. He looks puzzled as he returns to the studio floor. With a sly look, the host sees Jamal being led in by staff. Jamal sits back in his chair and stares at the host. Lights come on and illuminate the host's false smile. Jamal looks up from the screen to see a nasty grin on the host's face. Again, we see that written in the condensation. The host's face hardens suddenly. Jamal shakes his head. Again, Jamal shakes his head. The host tenses his jaw. The host looks disappointed. The host rubs his chin and shifts uncomfortably in his chair. He shakes his head. With eyebrows raised, he regards Jamal. The audience are on their feet. The director and his assistants all smile. The host gets up. He dances. He pats Jamal patronizingly on the back of his head. Then he glares at the director off-stage. The director gives him a happy thumbs up. The host maintains a grim serious expression. A smile appears fleetingly on Jamal's face as the host grins through gritted teeth. Backstage, the host waits for Jamal to leave. Jamal turns to follow the host down the corridor. He slaps him on the back then grips him by the shoulder. Two policemen stand outside the door. They cover Jamal's head in a blanket. The director approaches the host. The policemen bundle Jamal into a waiting vehicle. Srinivas is at the wheel. At the police station, the inspector and Jamal drink milky tea in glasses.",
    "737": "The waiter spoons a dollop of black caviar into Jack's dinner plate, and Rose smiles. Jack grins at Rose while Molly glares at Ruth. The waiter refills Jack's glass, and Jack tosses a box of matches to Cal. Rose raises her glass, and they all toast. Jack raises his glass to Rose, and Cal lifts his glass, frowns, and then sips. Later, a waiter pushes a cart laden with desserts as Jack hands a pen to Molly. Cal lobs the matches back to Jack, who slips them into his pocket and then approaches Rose. Rose smiles as Ruth stares at them. Jack kisses her hand and slips a note to Rose before turning and walking off, glancing back at her over his shoulder. As Ruth stares at her daughter, Rose gazes across the room toward the door. Beneath the skylight, Jack stands on the landing and faces the clock while Rose steps to the bottom of the staircase. Lifting her dress slightly, she ascends the stairs as Jack turns. Another play is a set of pipes where two men swing each other around on the platform as couples dance. Fabrizio dances with a blonde woman, Helga, placing his hand on her back while Jack, now with his tie removed and sleeves rolled up, dances with Cora, a little girl with dark hair. Some people clap their hands in time to the music as Rose sits at a table with blonde Bjorn, and Tommy sets down several glasses of beer, setting a beer in front of Rose. Rose claps her hands as she watches Jack. Nearby, a man falls to the floor, and two other men help him up while another hands the man his drink. Jack spins Cora as Fabrizio and Helga prance back and forth, and he waves Rose over. They stand on the dance floor as Jack pulls Rose close, with Cora standing and watching them. Cora smiles as Jack and Rose dance through the crowd, with Fabrizio and Helga climbing onto the platform to dance. Jack and Rose whirl around, and Jack pulls Rose by the arm to perform a special dance. Watching him, Rose pulls off her shoes, tosses them to a nearby woman, then holds up the hem of her dress. Jack smiles and claps his hands, and when he stops, Rose dances. They link arms and dance in a circle as other couples dance around them. Jack and Rose hold hands, face each other, and spin faster and faster. In the smoking room, a steward lights Cal's cigar while others talk or smoke cigars. Tommy and Bjorn arm wrestle as others cheer. Jack steps up to their table and, reaching over Bjorn, grabs two glasses of beer, handing one glass to Rose and then drinking from his own as Jack watches Rose gulp down most of her beer.",
    "403": "Fergus shrugs, and she looks at Fergus directly, sitting down next to him. Fergus says nothing and shrugs again. The burly man comes up to her and suddenly jerks her roughly off the stool, spilling her drink. He drags her through the crowd as the barman eyes him. Fergus suddenly stands and makes his way to the door. Fergus comes out, walks a few yards, and hears voices down an alley. He looks up it and sees Dil pushing Dave away. Dave grabs her, turns her roughly, but she beats his arms away and staggers away from him. They both bump into Fergus, who just stands there and doesn't move an inch. She smiles, and he holds it up to show her. Dave eyes Fergus, who in response grabs Dave's wrists and upends him on the ground. Fergus puts his foot on Dave's neck and presses down, looking to Dil, and then presses his foot again. She bends low to Dave, whose voice is softer. Fergus removes his foot, and Dil grabs his arm, drawing him away. They walk out of the alley, and Fergus looks back to see Dave is rising. Fergus and Dil climb slowly upstairs, noticing a movement lower down the staircase and seeing Dave holding his neck. Dil leans close to Fergus and tilts up her face, and Fergus kisses her tenderly. She goes in and closes the door, while Fergus stands and looks down at Dave, who turns to leave. Dil walks out of the salon smiling and walks toward Fergus, who takes a bunch of flowers from behind his back. She holds them with theatrical feeling, laughs, leans toward him, and kisses him in a classically old-fashioned way as the girls inside the salon pull back a curtain and clap. She takes his arm and walks off with him. Fergus and Dil are looking at their menus when a waiter places drinks on their table and then leaves. They are walking in an alleyway toward her house when suddenly a car drives very fast toward them with headlights on. Fergus pulls her into a doorway to avoid it. The car continues down the road, stops, and then screeches off. She looks down toward where the car has pulled away. A car pulls up behind Dil and Fergus, and she touches his cheek. Dil comes in in the darkness, and Fergus stands like a shadow in the doorway. The light comes on; she takes off her raincoat as Fergus enters slowly. He looks around the room, noticing an exaggerated femininity about everything in it. Fergus looks at the mantelpiece and sees a picture of Jody, and the camera tracks into the soldier's smiling face. His reverie is broken by the sound of a voice outside—Dave's. She opens the window door, and they see Dave on the street, in a neck brace.",
    "197": "Potter is now behind his desk. He spreads the newspaper out in front of him, muttering as he does so. He sees the envelope, looks inside at the money. Then, to his goon, indicating the office door. Potter opens the door just a little, and peers through into the bank. He starts thumping his pockets, with increasing panic, and looks in the waste paper basket on the floor. Uncle Billy looks around for the money envelope. He looks puzzled, thinks hard, then a look of concern creeps into his eyes. He finally rushes through the door and out into the street. The goon wheels him back to his desk. He is deep in thought, with a crafty expression on his face. Uncle Billy running across the street in the direction of the Building and Loan. George coming from room where he has just left the bank examiner. He sees Violet Bick standing there. He hears a noise, and sees Uncle Billy entering the office. Uncle Billy comes hurrying in. Uncle Billy picks up the phone and speaks distractedly, without knowing what he is saying. He hangs up agitatedly, muttering to himself as he goes into his own office. Cousin Tilly and Cousin Eustace look after him, dumbfounded. George has just finished writing something, and is slipping the paper into an envelope. She looks at him, then says a strange thing. She reaches up and kisses him on the cheek, leaving lipstick. George opens the door for her. As George and Violet come through the door, they are being watched by Cousin Tilly, Cousin Eustace and the bank examiner, who is still waiting to go to work on the books. Violet sees the lipstick on George's cheek, and dabs at it with her handkerchief. She exits. As George opens the door he sees Uncle Billy frantically looking for the missing envelope. The office is in a mess, drawers are opened, and papers scattered on the floor and on the desk. George stops short, suddenly aware of the tragic old eyes looking up at him. Uncle Billy gestures nervously for George to come in. He does so and closes the door. Cousin Tilly is at her switchboard, and Cousin Eustace standing beside her. Suddenly the door opens and George comes striding out. He goes directly to the safe and starts searching, but doesn't find the money. Then he goes to the cash drawer in the counter, and looks through it. Carter is still waiting in the doorway to his office. Cousin Eustace runs over to George. Uncle Billy and George are retracing the former's steps through the snow, looking everywhere for the missing money. They pause for a moment on the sidewalk.",
    "554": "Indy carefully walks forward, seeing each letter on the stones, followed by Donovan and Elsa in his footsteps. After a sigh of relief, Indy stands in a small opening leading to a 100-foot drop and a view of a stony cliff wall 100 feet across, with no obvious way to cross. He looks to the Grail Diary for guidance, then notices a lion's head inscribed in the rock above. Indy calls to his son, leaps into space, and hangs in midair. Realizing the ingenious First Crusaders have painted a pathway in forced perspective to blend with the rocks below, Indy throws dirt on the bridge and crosses it like the first Crusader in the painting over Henry's desk. Indy crawls through a small cliff opening and enters a temple with a vast array of chalices in many sizes, shapes, gold, and silver. He notices a man praying at the altar with his back turned, dressed as a Grail Knight, though the knight's face is unseen. The Grail Knight wearily prepares for combat, wielding a two-handed broadsword, but struggles with its weight. Indy dodges the clumsy swings until the exhausted knight collapses. Indy raises the knight's visor, revealing a very ancient man, who reaches for Indy's clothing and offers his sword. At that moment, Donovan and Elsa appear, and Donovan turns to the display of cups while Elsa and Indy exchange looks. Elsa selects a solid gold, emerald-encrusted goblet, which Donovan takes, fills with water, and drinks. Donovan's body then begins to convulse.",
    "729": "Air pressure blows water out of compartments, and the ocean roils around the ship as it sinks deeper. Dozens of passengers still dangle from poles or lie against railings and staircases. Jack keeps one arm wrapped around Rose as they descend toward the water. One man slips off a pole and spins as he bounces off a railing. Some people behind the ship try to swim as the massive propellers sink below the surface. Jack and Rose hold hands as they kneel beside one another. Rose nods as the bubbling water covers the tail rudder and surges up the whole deck. Waves swell around the name Titanic and across the ship. With deep gulps of air, the tail end of the ship sinks beneath the surface. Underwater, Jack and Rose hold hands as they tumble in the jostling current, and the ship sinks and vanishes. Jack grabs onto Rose's life vest but is swept away by the turbulence. Rose kicks to the surface and emerges amid other flailing survivors. For at least a quarter mile, the ocean churns with panicked swimmers. Out of their grasps, one man grabs onto Rose and shoves her underwater as he tries to climb on top of her. Jack punches the hysterical man in the face until he releases Rose. Jack pulls Rose by her life vest, and they swim out of the mass of survivors. Jack leads her to a flat piece of wood floating on the surface. Rose pulls herself onto the elaborately carved panel, and Jack tries to pull himself onto the panel as well, but it tips under their combined weight. Jack holds onto the panel as he floats in the water beside her, looks down, then blinks and nods to himself. Lying on her stomach on the panel, Rose moves toward Jack and leans her forehead against his face. Their breath is visible in the cold air. He takes her hand. Clinging to a nearby piece of debris, a crewman blows into a whistle. Rose's blue lips tremble as she smiles weakly. Sitting in a lifeboat beside Molly, Ruth closes her eyes. Furrowing her brow, Molly looks around at the other people in the boat who avert their gaze. A young woman sobs. Molly glares at the crewman then sits. Beside her, Ruth presses her hands over her own ears. Elsewhere, survivors in four lifeboats work to lash the vessels together. A dark-haired crewman supervising the operation glances back toward the site of the wreck. Still clinging to wreckage, the crewman with the whistle in his mouth floats motionless with his eyes closed. Swimming a few yards away, Jack stares at the man, then turns toward Rose. Rose's lips tremble as she stares at Jack.",
    "49": "She shrinks back, and then he throws it into her lap. As he continues to speak, he punctuates each phrase with another lit match. REGGIE is too busy beating them out to do anything else, frantically beating out the matches with her eyes on her work. She notices her hand is shaking and reaches back into her bag, removes a piece of candy, puts it into her mouth, and leans her head back against the wall, closing her eyes. Suddenly the door opens and REGGIE shrieks — but this time it is PETER. REGGIE and PETER enter the deserted lobby, and she goes to the desk, followed by PETER, where the NIGHT CLERK greets them sleepily. They go to the elevator where he opens the door for her, and as REGGIE and PETER enter the small cage, it is somewhat cramped, forcing them to stand close together. The elevator stops, and he reaches across her and opens the door. She stops as she sees something, and instead of a human hand, there is a twin-pronged metal one. SCOBIE sees where REGGIE is staring, looks down at it himself, then lunges at her, raising the hand to strike. The hand is starting to come down, but REGGIE, moving quickly, turns and flies out. As REGGIE runs out, slamming the door after her, the metal hand crashes against the wooden panel inside the door and splinters through it, visible on this side now. Petrified with fear, REGGIE can only stare dumbly at the protruding claw as PETER comes running up to her and sees the metal hand. Then, using all his weight, he slams the door open as far as it will go, making sure to hold it that way as he steps in. Inside, PETER pulls back the door and slugs the startled SCOBIE full on the jaw. His head bangs against the wall, but he manages to raise a foot and push PETER violently away, sending him sprawling back, toppling across the bed and over, head first, onto the floor on the other side, where he disappears. Hurrying, SCOBIE puts his foot against the door and pushes it away, ripping his metal hand free. He then rushes to the open window and climbs out. REGGIE waits anxiously, and when she hears nothing, she gingerly looks into the room. PETER, unsteady on his feet, goes to the window and looks out before turning back and climbing out. Outside the window to REGGIE's room is a small, false balcony with barely enough room between it and the building's facade for a man to stand. PETER appears and looks down over the railing, but shooting straight down, there is no one on the street and it is too far to jump.",
    "1138": "Harry slips inside Umbridge's office, where the walls are hung with China plates showing pictures of cats, and raises his wand. Umbridge's chair is upholstered in pink, and Harry notices two passive pink shoes placed neatly on the floor. He crosses to the desk, where there's a silver teapot and a China cup and saucer on lace doilies, and searches drawers. He finds files with photos attached, one of Mad-Eye Moody with a red cross through the photo and another of Professor Dumbledore crossed through in red. The Supervisor turns, and Harry emerges from Umbridge's office grim-faced, turns, and walks away, sopping wet. Harry and Ron leave the lift at courtroom level, where a man is hauled away by two guards. Harry tugs Ron's lapel, and they walk towards the courtroom where, from a high bench, Umbridge addresses a woman sitting below while wearing the locket around her neck. Mary sees Ron, and Harry pushes Ron forward into the courtroom, staying back himself, while Yaxley sits watching the proceedings. Ron stands beside Mary, Harry nods, and she holds it up as Dementors hover above. Harry's eyes are fixed on Umbridge as he spots the locket around her neck, and his wand drops into his hand. Umbridge sees it, Hermione trembles, and his face distorts as Ron zaps Yaxley. Hermione grabs the locket from Umbridge and tosses it to Harry, now back to himself, as Yaxley sees them race off. The hovering Dementors chase the group into the lift, but they're stopped by the closing gate as their arms and long-boned fingers reach through the metal grill, attempting to suck the souls out of the four in the lift. Harry raises his wand, forcing the Dementors back with a spell, and the lift zooms upwards. The atrium is busy, with people upon walkways and at ground level, as a lift arrives and the group looks around before stepping out into it. Hermione and Harry are both back to themselves, but Ron still looks like Reginald, and Mary clings to him, taking his face in her hands and kissing him on the lips. During the kiss, Ron shrinks and transforms back to himself, and Mary steps back as the real Reginald appears in his vest and boxers, seeing Ron, who turns. Uniformed guards chase Harry as Yaxley arrives in the lift, and Hermione and Ron race after Harry. Yaxley barges past people, hurling bursts of energy at the trio, narrowly missing them as Harry spins his wand at a pile of posters, causing the reward posters for Harry Undesirable Number One to swirl around the atrium, almost engulfing Yaxley, who brushes them aside. The trio reaches the corridor as Yaxley aims another burst, but the spell disarms Yaxley. Ron grimaces as he runs, glances back, and sees Yaxley gaining on him.",
    "1174": "He puts a huge black egg on the table. The huge egg shudders and twitches and suddenly bursts open. A strange little green-grey creature uncurls from the broken shell. Its long black leg slips on the surface of the table. It staggers and stretches spiky wings. The dragon shoots flame. Hagrid's beard catches fire. He puts it out with his over gloves. A face at the window. Back in school. Beside Professor McGonagall, Malfoy smirks. Malfoy scowls angrily. Carrying a lantern, Filch leads the four children out of the school. Hagrid comes out of his cottage. Hagrid picks up a crossbow. A shaft of moonlight shows the way, following Hagrid and his dog, Fang, along the edge of the forest. Even the huge giant is dwarfed by the tall trees, which rise up and disappear into the darkness above their heads. Hagrid's lamp throws a feeble beam, as he leads them amongst the trees, deeper and deeper into the dark forest. Twisted branches loom out of the darkness, throwing weird and frightening shadows. Hagrid suddenly stops. He bends down, and dips his fingers into a small pool of silvery liquid. The huge giant looks around wearily. They split up. Malfoy raises the lamp, and he and Harry continue along the path, looking around them cautiously. Fang keeps close beside them, then goes on ahead, his nose to the ground. Suddenly, the big dog stops and lifts his head. The boys catch up with him. A hooded figure is crouching over a large white animal lying on the ground. Harry clutches the scar on his forehead. The hooded figure lifts his head. Followed by Fang, Malfoy turns and runs, still carrying the lamp. In the shadowy moonlight, the hooded figure seems to rise up and hover above the dead unicorn. It spreads its arms wide and moves ominously towards Harry. Terrified, he backs away. The figure gets closer and closer. Harry trips over a twisted tree root and falls backwards. He lies helpless on the ground, as the hooded figure advances. Suddenly, something jumps over his head in a flurry of hooves. It attacks the dark figure, who turns and disappears into the mist. Harry scrambles to his feet and looks up at a dark-skinned centaur with a red beard, half man, half horse. Harry nods. As the centaur leaves them, they look sadly at the body of the dead unicorn. The common room. The boys look blank. Harry is not convinced. Crossing the courtyard. Harry sees Hagrid sitting outside his cottage playing a tune. Cloaks flying, they run towards the cottage. They look at each other. The children run back into the school and into Professor McGonagall's classroom.",
    "25": "The enormous length of time that transpires results in a seriously clean Melvin emerging from the bathroom through a cloud of steam. They exit as they enter. The car goes right across the street to a shopping mall. Melvin walks to the doorway and stops suddenly, as the camera reveals that the floor is intricately patterned so that passage for Melvin is impossible. Melvin watches her approach, and they arrive at the table. He holds out her chair for her, having no idea he has insulted her. Sandbagged in extreme, she gets up, actually ready to leave, but he waves her down. She thinks and then nods. The waiter is across the room. Amazingly, something in Melvin rises to the occasion, and he uncharacteristically looks at her directly. Carol never expected the kind of praise which would so slip under her guard. She stumbles a bit, flattered, momentarily moved, and his for the taking. Carol moves to the chair next to him, sits very close, and he tenses. Their faces are close; she looks at him, her face moving toward him as he is wide-eyed and afraid. She closes her eyes for the kiss, but now his head moves back and he receives her kiss. Carol smiles encouragement to him and herself, but she has already turned away and exits the restaurant. He finishes dialing, extremely tense, a lump in his throat as he tries not to let the anxiety immobilize him. He hangs up. His parents want no part of him, and he needs help as Carol enters with some energy. Simon struggles with his shirt, and she helps him, inadvertently venting some anger as she does so. Simon laughs as she crosses to the bathroom and begins to prepare a bath. We are on Simon settling in for sleep when instinct or sounds or the faint glow of hope turns him so that he faces the bathroom. Carol is sitting at the tub's edge, a towel around her, and the towel falls, a better-than-perfect breast exposed. As Simon looks at the bathing beauty, she adjusts her hair. He leaves the bed, takes the blotter from the desk set and a pen from his jacket pocket which hangs on the chair, and with vigor and faint pain moves to the other side of the bed where he turns on the light and stares at Carol. Simon's pen moves across the blotter. Carol sees him earnestly engrossed, a beat of indecision, and then shyly but deliberately, she lowers the towel. Melvin sits alone, nursing a drink. He's been talking to the bartender.",
    "949": "The boys pick themselves up and Joe tries to open the back door. In the main body of the bus, a technical sergeant has been knocked out cold. Nelec picks himself up as the alien rocks the bus, and Nelec gets on the radio. Joe attempts to open the holding cell door, but it is locked. Nelec comes to the door as a tentacle reaches in and crushes the driver. Joe pounds on a cracked window above them while Nelec loads an assault rifle. Joe breaks the window with his elbow and climbs out onto the side of the bus. At the front, the giant spider-like alien is busy trying to reach in to get Nelec. Joe helps Martin out of the broken window, followed by Charles and then Carrie. Nelec fires at the alien with the assault rifle as it forces its way into the bus. The boys clamor down from the vehicle and run off the road to cover. The alien closes in on Nelec, apparently undeterred by the automatic fire. Nelec runs out of ammunition, and the alien lunges at him with its needle-sharp teeth. Lying in a ditch, the boys watch as the alien leaps off the bus and disappears into the woods. Meanwhile, Air Force soldiers grab Louis in the evacuation center. Joe retrieves his locket from Overmyer's body and a car pulls up; he clocks the red bus. Joe drives Donnie's car back into town while Donnie has nodded off. A tank opens fire on them, and Joe swerves to avoid the incoming round as more tanks close in. The boys get out of the car and flee. A soldier into his radio as the boys run, hurrying through a back garden and shoving a washing line out of their way. They leap a fence, then race through a gate onto the street, where they see a tank being overturned. Soldiers flee from their own malfunctioning machines, which randomly spray shells, missiles, and bullets around them. The boys flee through a playground from an out-of-control tank. They hurry up a hill and take refuge in a house as the tank smashes up the playground. The boys hurry upstairs in the house, and Joe looks out of a window. A shell strikes the house, and the blast knocks the boys to the ground. They get back up, and Charles is about to strap up Martin's leg, which has been broken in the explosion. Joe and Cary run to the building in the cemetery where Joe saw earth being thrown about. They try all the doors, but they're firmly locked, so they break the doors open and step inside. A tunnel leads into the Earth, and Cary unzips his bag, spilling out a bunch of fireworks. Joe lights one of the sparklers and tosses it into the tunnel.",
    "961": "In a black star-sprinkled sky, a sliver of sunlight crests the Earth as rays of light shoot off the continents, and a golden word orbits into view. Letters rain down into two boxes, spelling out a logo. In a shadowy stone hallway, a lone figure stands under a vaulted ceiling, silhouetted against a wrought iron and plate glass door. Wearing a fine overcoat, he twiddles a wrapped cough drop in his fingers. Constituents wave signs, and later David greets suburbanites. David rides on a Coast Guard boat as it takes a high splash. In the country, David talks with a farmer, then appears with Mayor Bloomberg outside City Hall. In a bar and then before a huge crowd, he chats with Madeleine Albright, Wesley Clark, and Jesse Jackson. Outside Fordham University's Keating Hall, a young man in the crowd claps, his gaze sternly interested, wearing a newsboy cap, V-neck, and tie. David smiles at his many supporters. Indoors, an aide runs to David's campaign chairman, Charlie, who slaps the newspaper shut. Elsewhere, the young man with the newsboy cap studies a slim, hardcover book, folds it shut, and answers his cell phone, working his lips under his trim dusting of a mustache. In a conservative hotel suite, David steps into view, toting a satchel and duffel bag. He later removes a folder from the satchel and flips it open. Its contents lie untouched on a table as David stares out a window at the city, gloomily peers toward the sitting area, then picks up a TV remote and hits a button, watching from the couch. On a downtown rooftop, four gentlemanly figures cross to the guard rail, each in a fedora, overcoat, and necktie; one is the mustached young man. The eldest one speaks, and the older member briefly looks at his mustached peer. In the suite, Charlie joins David, aims the remote at the TV, tosses a tie at David, who eyes its blue and red stripes. Later, Charlie and David hang their heads as a woman hands off a slip of paper, David strides off, and Charlie catches up to him. David leaves the Elegant Function Room, and a newscast shows on a TV. David stands alone in a grand formal hallway, head bowed, holding his hands in his pockets. He later enters a stately Men's Room and studies note cards, with views over time showing him at varying spots on the polished marble floor. He washes his hands, straightens his New York-shaped lapel pin, and looks to the row of closed stall doors. One opens, and a lovely woman in a silk spaghetti-strap dress with a black lace bodice emerges bashfully.",
    "293": "Jeff and Stella turn toward the window, and Jeff grabs the long-focus lens and lifts it up to see Thorwald, who has his wife's new alligator handbag in his hand. Thorwald moves slowly across the bedroom, disappearing out of sight behind the door but reappears shortly to continue packing and puts the handbag into a nearly-filled suitcase. He resumes packing, and Jeff puts down the lens, turning toward the room where the two women watch expectantly. Stella fondly looks at her ring finger, while Jeff reacts with aghast. Lisa moves to pick up the phone book from the stand and hands it to Jeff, who looks for Thorwald's number in the directory while the women smile. He dials Chelsea 2-7099 as the women watch tensely. Lisa glances at Thorwald's apartment, followed by Stella and Jeff. In Thorwald's apartment, he emerges from the bedroom towards the phone, wearing a light summer coat and tie despite the heat. He holds the receiver slightly away from his ear while the buzzing is heard. Packing is complete with one open suitcase remaining. Thorwald hesitantly approaches the phone, uncertain about answering, but eventually picks it up. There's a pause as he searches for an answer, gazes at the receiver, and slowly hangs up before Thorwald can respond. Thorwald stands at the phone contemplating, then decisively heads for the door, ensuring it's locked after leaving. Jeff turns his wheelchair as Lisa and Stella quickly head toward the door, and they pause at Jeff's voice. Jeff calls after them, and the door slams, their footsteps fading down the corridor as Jeff picks up the lens and looks down the alleyway. Thorwald passes the alley opening, prompting Jeff to put down the lens and move swiftly to the wall cabinet, retrieving a box of flash bulbs and a reflector, placing them on his lap and returning to the window. He leans out to see Lisa in the courtyard below, who reaches the stairway and waves at Jeff as Stella joins her carrying a shovel. The two women hurry up the stairs toward the iron ladder to climb the wall between Jeff’s yard and Thorwald’s.",
    "92": "She slides the paper sack toward him, and he looks inside to find the bottom full of fat, crawling earthworms. Marge's prowler is parked in an otherwise empty lot, and she sits talking with two young women at one end of an elevated dance platform in the deserted club not yet open for business. With one last bang, we cut to an extreme close-up of an insect lugging a worm, and a pull back from the screen reveals that we are in Marge's house, where Marge and Norm are watching television in bed. After a long beat, with silence except for the TV, Marge murmurs while still looking at the set. Marge gropes in the dark, and he sits in and picks up his phone, while Jerry sits dumbly and angrily snatches it up, then goes back to his food. Gary hands her a flimsy, and Marge takes it with one hand and looks, her other hand frozen with a forkful of food. Norm, who has been eating steadily throughout, looks over at Marge with mild interest, stares for a beat as he finishes chewing, then swallows and speaks. Jerry, Wade, and Stan Grossman sit around the kitchen table, harshly toplit by a hanging fixture, with the remains of coffee and a cinnamon filbert ring present on the table. Marge is at the reception desk while the clerk types into a computer console, and she is on a public phone. The brown Ciera enters and drives lazy S-curves around the few snow-covered cars parked on the roof of the lot, stops by one car, and Carl emerges, quickly scans the lot, then kneels in the snow at the back of the parked car and starts unscrewing its license plate. Carl pulls up and hands the attendant his ticket, and the attendant frowns uncomprehendingly at the ticket, still puzzled, saying nothing as Carl glances back and starts digging for money, peeling off one dollar bills. Bewildered, he looks about, then asks a mechanic passing by, his voice raised over the din of the shop, and the mechanic points while Jerry looks, stares, and swallows. Marge and Shep face each other at the other end of the floor in a grimy and cluttered glassed-in cubicle, silently talk, while Shep says nothing and stares at her. Jerry is worriedly pacing behind his desk when Marge has stuck in the door, then Marge plops into the chair opposite him, and Jerry stares at her, his mouth open. As Marge rises, Jerry looks blankly down at the papers on the desk in front of him. Marge enters and looks around the bar, a rather characterless, lowlit meeting place for business people, and it is a bald, paunching man of about Marge's age, rising from a booth halfway back.",
    "131": "A man in a prison uniform with a bandage on his head turns and reacts to seeing Gandhi, taking his soup from Khan. Gandhi surveys the crowded yard, observing soiled bandages and determined faces, but is distracted by a group of guards, including an officer and four men, pushing through the prisoners. The prisoners reluctantly move back, their glances revealing Gandhi's identity. The prison officer's eyes meet Gandhi's, and Gandhi, now manacled, is marched down the pavement between two guards with the officer in front. A tall civil servant waits for them, and the officer removes Gandhi's manacles. The civil servant, showing distaste for his task, walks ahead of Gandhi, followed by a guard, toward a grand staircase. Office workers pause to stare at Gandhi as he passes, self-conscious of his prison attire. Tall white doors open, and the civil servant gestures for Gandhi to enter. Gandhi passes two secretaries, as the civil servant moves around him to knock on the inner doors, opening them and motioning Gandhi inside. Inside, Smuts stands behind a grand desk, having been seen previously with Walker. He nods to the civil servant, who bows and closes the door. Smuts crosses to a cabinet, observing Gandhi with surprise at his frigid tone, then smiles. Gandhi offers a wry smile and sits on the chair indicated by Smuts. Smuts assesses Gandhi, unsure of how to handle him, and takes Gandhi's irony at face value, challenging him, expecting a contest. Gandhi considers, then stands, uncertain about his sudden change in status. Smuts signs a document, misreading Gandhi's doubt. Daniels, the civil servant, enters, stares, then confusedly produces a shilling from his pocket and hands it to Gandhi, hinting at the ignominy of Gandhi's entrance. A prison guard appears, looking perplexed at Gandhi before seeking guidance from the office. Meanwhile, a British general descends a gangplank with his ADC.",
    "412": "The series of scenes begins with Ben sinking to the bottom of a pool, observed by people standing around it. Transitioning to a phone booth located in the entrance area of a hotel between the lobby and the driveway, Ben holds the receiver to his ear before hanging up slowly. He stands up, looks around, moves uncomfortably, removes his jacket, carries it folded across his arm, leaves the phone booth, and heads toward the main lobby. As he is about to enter, a group of very old people comes out, filling the doorway, muttering, and helping each other down the steps. Ben holds the door open politely for them and, as they pass, starts to move inside. At that moment, a dozen young people dressed for a high school dance push past him into the lobby. He holds the other door open for them, smiles politely, but they ignore him. He follows them into the lobby, approaching the front desk with them. A boy at the front of the group converses with the clerk, who points across the lobby and gives directions. Terror and disbelief appear in Ben's eyes as he looks helplessly at the clerk. Miss DeWitte takes Ben's hand for a handshake, followed by a twelve-year-old boy's, and then Mr. Singleman's hand, while Mrs. Singleman looks at a seating list. Ben backs out of the seating area, quickly rises as they sit down, attempts a smile, then looks out the window and at the table center. Noticing a passing waiter, Ben raises his hand, then looks apologetically at Mrs. Robinson. The waiter stops, turns, approaches their table, looks at Mrs. Robinson, and moves away, with Ben watching him go and shaking his head. Ben then exits the Veranda Room and walks into the lobby, proceeding to the front desk where he stands.",
    "1353": "Joe and Charles enter, and Charles grabs a roll. Joe nods as Jack forces a smile and closes the bathroom door, leaving Joe stunned and heartsick. Joe and his father, in civvies, sit beside each other at the counter. Jack pulls out a pamphlet and places it on the table, showing Joe a pamphlet for Hewitt Sports Camp, with images of happy, smiling, healthy athletic kids. Joe looks back at the pamphlet, his other hand coming up from under the table, and Jack sees that Joe is holding his mother's locket. Jack wants to cry again and throw the locket away but just turns away as Joe stares at the pamphlet. In Joe's room, he holds a paintbrush, working on a Quasimodo model at his desk. The room, recently devoid of a mother's oversight, is messy, with comic books and other plastic models built and painted by Joe, including cars, creatures, and a train. All the boys look on, and their faces brighten. Headlights appear, and the boys stand as a yellow Buick stops beside them, driven by 14-year-old Alice Dainard. She sees Joe, looking away, annoyed, as all the boys silently wait. She considers, shakes her head, and the boys excitedly scramble into the car. The Buick crosses the nighttime horizon through a rural landscape. Cary messes with the radio, Alice looks at him in the rearview, their eyes hold a beat, she takes the Twizzler he offers, and looks back to the road. Joe walks past Alice, who watches him, while Martin sits alone, reading and memorizing lines, and she looks at him as if searching for something. Joe stops stippling, the tension is almost too much, and he indicates the sponge for make-up, which she uses. Joe starts applying make-up to Alice's eyelids, feeling something provocative in being so close to her with her eyes closed. Alice is made up, wearing a coat with a purse, as Martin, in a tie, faces her, both looking over script pages while Charles adjusts the camera. Joe observes, holding the boom mike as Preston wears an overcoat. Suddenly, a pop! Everyone jumps as Cary, laughing, explodes a firecracker. Martin and Alice perform as Detective John Hathaway and Mrs. Rebecca Hathaway, with Preston acting in the background. Finally, we focus tightly on Joe, watching Alice.",
    "138": "Gandhi sits cross-legged, listening in a way that opens the heart, while behind him a mass of villagers waits stoically outside the dwelling for their case to be heard. Meha tries to speak unemotionally, but under Gandhi's sympathetic gaze, his despair breaks through. Near breakdown, Meha gestures around the empty house, unable to continue, and he nods. Gandhi looks around the crude dwelling where almost nothing remains. Two young men, perhaps seventeen and older, a girl about sixteen, and Meha's wife, sitting near Ba, are present. The two women listen together, but Meha's wife looks defeated, with unkempt hair and a dirty sari. Gandhi nods, speaking bleak words that offer no false hope, and glances at Meha's wife, who lowers her head as water comes to her eyes. Ba comforts her, and the woman breaks down into sobs. Later, Gandhi rides in an open howdah on an elephant, lost in sober reflection, with Shukla by his side, too intimidated to interrupt Gandhi's dark mood, which contains more anger than seen before except towards Ba. A ball is hit, revealing a lush, verdant pitch where white-garbed players and English onlookers watch under parasols, with Indian servants discreetly serving drinks. After a four is hit, a batsman notices a car hurrying near the clubhouse with an officer and streaming people, an Indian corporal driving, as a major stands on the back seat. The captain, wearing a clerical collar, determined, looks down at Gandhi and shakes his head. Gandhi is seen in full, in a white loincloth, shawl, and sandals, his attire for life. Charlie studies Gandhi, understands, and grins, prompting a small grin from Gandhi, who laughs, and laughs again. Charlie turns to the guard, who hesitantly unlocks the cell. Charlie enters, sits on a stool opposite Gandhi, his long legs awkwardly filling the space between them.",
    "269": "He indicates Ed with a nod of the head, clears his throat, and turns to the door. His tone is harder again as he snaps off the lights and disappears into the hall. Looking straight down at Hi, asleep in the trailer bedroom, we start to crane down over a beautiful dusk landscape. We are floating in over the field, abutting the prison, that Gale and Evelle popped out of. In the middle background of the extreme long shot, two men are walking across the field. Still floating forward but now much closer to the two walking men, we see that they are Gale and Evelle, both still dyed blue. They are approaching the hole in the ground, Evelle is starting to climb into the hole, and Evelle has disappeared and Gale starts climbing in. The front door has a holly wreath on it as five three-year-olds in their pajamas are opening presents around a tree as Nathan and Florence look on. We have been isolating in on one of the children peeling the wrappings off a package marked to Nathan Jr., inside of which is a shiny red plastic football. Pulled over on the state highway in the middle of the desert, a police motorcycle is parked behind it. Glen is leaning out the driver's window of the car talking to the state trooper who stands facing him. Glen is grinning and talking with his hands cupped in front of him, as when he told Hi about the Pollack who almost stepped in the pile of shit. The trooper, in crash helmet and dark sunglasses, is listening tight-lipped and stone-faced as Glen finishes his story and slaps his knee. The trooper is clicking open his ballpoint pen and reaching his citation book from his breast pocket. It sits on a tee in the middle of a football field, and a cleated foot boots the football out of frame. Looking up, arms out at his sides, waiting to receive the kicked ball, he catches the ball and starts running. He is skillfully eluding and stiff-arming tacklers, reaches the end zone, and triumphantly spikes the football. He whips off his helmet and we track in on the face of the rosy-cheeked high-school bruiser. Still craning down, now very close to the sleeping Hi, the man and woman are sitting on a sofa in the foreground with their backs to the camera. They are in the living room of Hi and Ed's trailer, which is suffused with a warm golden light. As they face the trailer's front door, all we see of the couple is the backs of their heads. They both have white hair, the woman's pulled into a bun, and the old man wears a cardigan, the woman a shawl.",
    "985": "A maid stands in Thomas's way, but he pushes her aside and leans into the cot to uncover the infant. Suddenly horrified, Thomas gags. Meanwhile, a priest sprinkles holy water on the dying mother. Thomas snatches the baby from its cot and runs, hurrying downstairs and bounding out of the house while cradling the baby wrapped in a blanket. He tears through the street, stumbling as he pushes past revelers, one of whom swigs from a bottle of booze, and stops at the edge of a darkened river. Panting, Thomas turns to see a policeman emerging from a nearby warehouse, holding a lantern. Thomas looks left along the river path, then breaks into a run as the policeman blows his whistle and gives chase. Thomas runs into the gloom behind the warehouses and comes out in a dimly lit road, weaving between slow-moving traffic and scurrying into the shadows. The policeman glances left and right, then gathers speed as Thomas darts through a gateway in a concrete wall. Holding the baby close, he hides in the shadows and glances back to see the policeman hurry past. Thomas heaves a sigh of relief and steps forward into a pool of light emanating from a nearby window. Trembling, he turns a corner and approaches the back steps of a clapboard building, stoops down, and puts the baby on the fourth step, then takes money from his jacket and slips it into the baby's blanket. He hides as a young black couple steps out onto the back porch. The bespectacled man watches as the woman dabs herself with a cloth, and she stifles a smile as Thomas leaves. The man, Tizzy, strikes a pose in his fine suit and bowler hat, with the baby lying just feet away on the steps. Queenie opens the blanket to reveal the baby, which has an old and very wrinkled face. She gasps, and Tizzy covers his mouth. Queenie steps closer to inspect it and carries the baby into the house, with Tizzy following. She heads for her room in the basement, closes her door on an old lady wearing a pearl necklace, then peels the blanket from over the baby's face. She opens the top drawer of a dresser, places the baby in it, and half-closes the drawer, then opens her room door to Mrs. Hollister. A doctor stands over an aged resident, while two white-haired old women laugh. Queenie quietly approaches Dr. Rose and whispers in his ear. He inspects the baby and turns to Queenie. They stare down at the naked baby, and she carries the baby into the retirement home lounge, adjusts the blanket, and stares down at him.",
    "969": "He slams down the receiver, then creeps to the hallway door. The other door opens, and the helmeted men grab David. As he struggles, they wrestle him to the floor and flip him on his back, holding him down. The mustached stranger crouches down and presses a cloth to David's face, causing David's view to fade to black. Through groggy eyes, he sees the helmeted men carrying him under a high ceiling with bright lights. Later, he finds himself in a stark warehouse with his wrists bound. The white-haired boss uses a phone and hangs up. They eye David, who sits in a chair, while he consults the book. The balding man meets his gaze, and the white-haired man smiles at David and steps over. David bolts and frees his wrists, but a point of a finger from Richardson telekinetically lifts a floor tile, tripping David. Two men in body suits grab him under his arms and drag him back to his chair, as the mustached stranger observes. David presses his hands to his face and rocks himself. Richardson aims the scold at his underling. As four men exit an SUV, Richardson sits facing David. David's jaw hangs slack as he shifts his eyes. Richardson stands, and a man removes his chair. Richardson stares down at David, who nods. Two men grab David and restrain his arms as Richardson's boyish partner finds the business card in David's wallet. Richardson lights it on fire, and the fire consumes the card while the boyish man returns David's wallet. Richardson drops the blazing card, points a finger at David, and waits. Two men escort David to a door, and Richardson watches as the men lift David off his feet and toss him through, head first. David lands in Charlie's office. As one door closes, Charlie enters from the other, and David stares. David opens the other door but finds only the small conference room. David scrutinizes his friend while Charlie hangs up his phone. With a puzzled look, David steps into the conference room where Charlie fixes a crooked picture on the wall. As David heads out, Charlie gapes at him, then follows. At the foot of some stairs, the receptionist, Susan, smiles, and David shoots an uneasy look at her. Later, in the conference room, sitting at the long table, David blinks his bemused eyes. As a handful of colleagues listen to a woman's analysis, Charlie paces thoughtfully and gives a faint shrug. David's eyes focus on Charlie, who smiles and then shifts his gaze to David, who stares at him with a confused expression. Blinking, David focuses, then shrugs his hands. Now David stares at a secretary on a phone as he and a friend pass her cubicle, and Charlie leads him inside. Leaning on his desk, Charlie folds his arms.",
    "509": "People clap as Holden looks at her, and the Singer on stage speaks into the microphone. The crowd applauds, and Alyssa shakes her head, smiling. Holden pokes her, but Alyssa shakes her head no. The crowd urges her, and Alyssa offers the Singer an embarrassed half-smile before Holden pushes her forward. Alyssa shakes her head and relents, heading through the crowd as the crowd thunders. Banky and Hooper stand at the bar while the crowd cheers and Alyssa laughs. She turns to the band, says something, and they nod before she turns back to the crowd. Holden smiles as Alyssa launches into a torchy tune. Banky joins him, and Holden glances at him. Banky offers a mocking mimic of his smile as Holden is smiling, being seduced, while Banky rolls his eyes. Beside Holden stands a pretty girl with a short haircut who's also riveted by Alyssa's performance. Alyssa makes big-time eye contact with somebody out there, and the song seems to be aimed at whoever she's looking at. At the end of the song, the crowd goes wild, but Alyssa is preoccupied. She points to someone in the crowd and curls her finger back in a `c'mere' fashion, urging whoever it is to join her before she jumps off the stage. Holden shakes his head sheepishly and looks downward, aw-shucks style, at that moment the girl beside him leaps forward. Alyssa and the girl race into each other's arms and fall into a way-too-passionate-to-mean-anything-else kiss. Holden looks up and is suddenly taken aback as Banky's eyes widen, and he allows a smile to creep across his face as the crowd applauds. Holden's eyes bug as Banky looks around, and for the first time, we get the distinct impression that this is a lesbian bar with a lot of chicks in this place. Holden continues to stare - mouth agape, while Banky looks at Holden and slaps him on the back. Alyssa and the girl continue to kiss as Banky, Holden, Alyssa, and the girl from the dance floor sit around a table. Alyssa and the girl continue to make out while Holden and Banky casually watch, wide-eyed. Banky stares a little harder, and Holden hits him. Alyssa and the girl break their kiss, and Kim exits. Alyssa looks at him, and Banky is smiling ear-to-ear as Banky and Alyssa laugh. Holden looks at a small scar on his arm and thinks better about mentioning it as then Kim re-enters and plants a big kiss on Alyssa's neck. Alyssa waves at him as he exits, and Banky slides out of the booth before Holden reaches in and pulls Banky out. Alyssa watches them go, then turns and kisses Kim. Holden looks preoccupied as the Receptionist stops typing and looks at Banky, shocked. Banky flips through magazines, biting off mini pieces of the gum he's chewing before John Sloss, the boy's lawyer, joins them.",
    "411": "Across the fence on the other side of the house, a quartet of adults, formally dressed as though for a cocktail party, are holding drinks and watching, with one of them holding a baby. The Braddocks, the Arnolds, and their children are dressed in California Contemporary Sport Style, with the adults in styles infinitely too young for them and the children in styles infinitely too old for them. Mr. Braddock stands alone at the end of the pool near the house, while the others are more or less grouped at the other end. Mr. Braddock is hamming it up, and he has moved over by one of the windows of the house, the window into the kitchen. He speaks quickly, in a fake sotto voce, towards the window, but he has already moved away from the window and is readdressing his audience. They laugh as Mrs. Arnold makes a face at Mr. Arnold, who grinningly acknowledges the response to his snappy comeback. Mr. Braddock darts back to the window and then moves to the screen door, pushing it open so it slams against the wall inside. At the back of the hall, inside the house, stands Ben, dressed in a full-length skin diver's wet suit, flippers on his feet, an oxygen tank strapped to his back, the mask pushed up his forehead, and the air hose dangling. He holds a spear gun in his hand, and the people in the backyard applaud. His father stands just outside the screen door as Ben's arms come into view and pull the mask down. We are now looking through the mask as we move forward down the hall, with everything slightly distorted through the glass. Ben's hand comes up again with the breathing apparatus in it, and we move out of the door and toward the pool. Mr. Braddock is running back and forth, clapping his hands and delivering his now soundless pitch. We move down the steps and into the shallow end of the pool, with Mr. Braddock moving along the side of the pool and motioning toward us to come down to the deep end. He joins Mr. Arnold at the far end of the pool, and they both begin to motion us toward them. We get to the deep end of the pool, where he has a big smile. We surface again and pan around for a last look at the figures, through the slightly distorted glass of the mask, of Mrs. Arnold and Mrs. Braddock watching and smiling, the neighbors on each side of the house looking over their fences and laughing and pointing, Mr. Arnold nodding encouragement and talking, and Mr. Braddock on his knees, smiling and trying to reach out far enough to push us under.",
    "1087": "Malbin shakes his head and looks behind him at Chaya, who is weeping. Tuvia crouches down, trembling, and Malbin looks to Shimon for an answer. Tuvia, appearing lost, checks the chamber of a revolver brought by someone before handing it back and cocking his own gun. Asael hands Layla over, as Tuvia looks into Lilka's eyes and then springs to his feet, handing Asael connected belts. Tuvia gazes into his fearless brother's face and kisses him gratefully on the cheek. The Bielski Otriad set off through foot-high water, using a rope of belts to stay connected, the water rising to their knees as they proceed. A woman slips but is helped up, while Asael at the back loses his footing but keeps his rifle above water. They trudge through waist-high water like a funeral cortege, with Asael and Tuvia leading. Shimon is supported by Rachel and Malbin as a plane roars overhead. The group trudges on, children on adults' shoulders through a reed bed, as Asael checks on Malbin's map. In a woodland area, Shimon stumbles and falls, attended by nurse Riva. Tuvia pulls Shimon onto his back, leaving books behind, and the group emerges into a stream of sunlight and water, resting on a grassy bank with relief. Shimon is brought on a stretcher, and Aaron alerts Tuvia to Malbin next to Shimon, who is dying. Tuvia crouches by Shimon’s side, and Malbin looks anxiously at Tuvia, who wipes his eyes as Shimon breathes his last. Suddenly, a tank appears on a hill, with cannonballs exploding among the fleeing Bielskis. Tuvia sprints low between them, as Lilka passes ammo to those with guns while German infantry advance.",
    "222": "He suddenly notices a herd of cattle grazing at the roadside and murmurs. He swings the tommy gun over with a whoop. One of the cows drops and the rest stampede toward the road. Energized, Nelson resumes bellowing. In bovine ignorance of the conventions of high-speed police pursuit, some of the cows have wandered up onto the road. The lead police car broadsides one. George Nelson, cackling wildly, fires into the air as his car recedes. The car is speeding into town, dodging and weaving through light traffic as George fires into the air - perhaps a means of clearing a path, perhaps an expression of high spirits. The car screeches to a halt and George hops out, and the three convicts emerge to follow him. Jowls shaking in a full run, George Nelson bursts through the door of the bank, followed by the three men. He fires into the ceiling and leaps up onto a table. He leaps down, fires into the air again, and sweeps a young woman standing in line into a full V-J dip, kissing her on the lips. Delmar nudges Everett. He whips open his suitcoat to reveal a half-dozen sticks of dynamite. He sends a burst into the ceiling, and heads for the door as customers murmur. George whirls. The customers stare mutely back. The customers shuffle their feet and glance uncomfortably about. Delmar lays a hand on George's shoulder and tries to steer him toward the door. George responds, barely audible and without brightening. Everett and Pete exchange significant looks. He digs into a pocket and tosses his car keys to a dumbfounded Delmar. George has turned woodenly and walks away, leaving the campfire's flickering circle of light. Delmar stares at Everett, who looks appraisingly at George's retreating back. Pete scrambles to pick up the loose money. A stakebed truck approaches along the road bordering the field. It is festooned with Stokes banners showing the candidate holding high a broom. Pickers perform in the bed of the truck, along with a dancer doing a two-step as he pushes a broom. A midget in overalls waves his arms, as if conducting the music. He switches off the microphone as the song, a duet of 'I'll Fly Away', scratchily issues from a monitor. He turns his attention back to a well-dressed man sitting nearby. The three men walk down a flat delta road, the sun shimmering off the rough pavement. The three men stand in the middle distance, waiting. In the foreground two little black boys are walking home, each carrying a block of ice. A spinning 78 on a green felt turntable. The crude black label identifies it as 'Man of Constant Sorrow' by the Soggy Bottom Boys.",
    "360": "MINAS TIRITH, with its seven walls of white stone, appears as if carved by giants from the bones of the earth. As the sun climbs over the eastern hills, a shaft of sunlight gleams against the face of the city. The Tower of Ecthelion stands high within the topmost walls. Gandalf, steering Shadowfax, navigates the steep streets of Minas Tirith, observed by the frightened stares of Gondorians as he and Pippin gallop through the winding streets. An aerial shot shows Shadowfax carrying Gandalf and Pippin up towards the seventh level. Minas Tirith is built on seven levels, each behind a circular defensive wall, rising to nearly 1000 feet on its topmost level. A towering bastion of natural rock, shaped like a ship's prow, bisects the city from the second level upward. Shadowfax arrives at a great citadel on the summit of the city, 1000 feet above the Pelennor Fields. Gandalf and Pippin dismount, leaving the guards of the citadel to tend to Shadowfax, and Gandalf hurries off. Pippin, taking in his surroundings, notices a dead tree in the middle of the court with four solemn citadel guards standing sentry around it. Gandalf leads Pippin across a flat court of white stones, surrounded by green lawns, towards a great hall beneath. Pippin, suitably chastened, nods. Inside a long solemn hall with rows of black marble pillars, silent figures of tall kings carved in cold stone stand between the pillars. Gandalf strides down the hall, with Pippin following obediently. At the far end, upon a dais of many steps, sits a large, empty throne. On the wall behind it is the image of a flowering white tree set in gems. At the foot of the dais, in a small stone chair, sits an old man, Denethor, the Lord Steward, gazing at his lap. Denethor slowly raises his cold eyes and holds up Boromir's broken horn, prompting Pippin to remember Boromir as Uruk-hai arrows thud into his body, causing him to fall to his knees. Pippin starts forward, unable to say anything. Denethor's eyes flicker with pain as Pippin drops to his knee, offering Denethor his sword. Denethor looks at Pippin blankly, overcome with grief, then turns his gaze slowly onto Gandalf. Denethor smiles at Gandalf, as if amused, while Gandalf looks shocked, and Denethor's eyes narrow, leaving Pippin horrified. Gandalf looks at Denethor closely for a moment before turning on his heel to leave, with Pippin following. Gandalf and Pippin stride from the tower hall as Denethor slumps back into his seat. Later, Pippin is carefully laying out a small uniform of the royal guard on a bed.",
    "578": "Everyone sits when Parrish does, but Joe, feeling right at home, spots a tray of refreshments with coffee and pastries and heads for them. There are immediate indications of surprise on the Board members' faces at Parrish bringing in an 'observer', while Drew's reaction is guarded but intense. Drew indicates to the Board's stenographer to arrange Joe's refreshments, and Joe interjects after a moment, causing Drew to regard him. The Board is provoked and mystified by Joe and even more by his presence, casting meaningful glances at Parrish, as Drew coolly grasps the irritation of the members, but Joe doesn't move. Joe stares at the money as Parrish shows him the door, and Joe goes. Meanwhile, Susan is busy giving instructions to a nurse, with a patient on an examining table beside them. As she finishes, she suddenly notices Joe down the corridor in the reception area, and she is startled for a moment, quickly making a last notation, handing a chart to the nurse, and heading down the corridor. Susan regards him, and visible now behind them are a Caribbean woman in her mid-thirties, Teena, with an arm around her mother, Easter, who is holding her stomach and rocking back and forth in great pain. Easter looks up and sees Joe, abruptly becoming still with eyes wide, as if in sudden recognition, but she just stares at Joe, fearful. Joe looks at Easter curiously, regards her for a long moment, and shakes his head, a firm no. But when he looks and speaks to Easter again, it is with concern and even regret, and Easter's pained grimace melts into a peaceful smile. He takes his hand away, and the orderly wheels Easter off, as Teena goes. Susan regards Joe, puzzled, and Joe shifts, leading to another awkward silence. Susan smiles gently, and after another moment, Joe, more abstracted than usual, stares at Parrish's food and takes another big bite, as silence falls, with Parrish getting lost in his memories. Joe is riveted on Parrish now, and Parrish, aware of him, pauses. A knock comes, the door opens, and Drew enters, looking at Parrish, then at Joe, and stands poised in the doorway. Drew takes a moment, then plunges in, appearing stunned before heading for the door, turning around. Allison and Susan are together by a piano, with Parrish, Quince, and a distracted Joe gathered near the terrace. Quince sees Parrish hesitate, drains his drink excitedly, and heads for Drew as Allison appears. There is an awkward pause before Allison elbows him, leading to silence as everyone waits for Parrish to proceed. He sits, then immediately stands up again, and Coyle heads for the kitchen. Meanwhile, Joe is locked on Susan as if nobody else is in the room, and Parrish regards Joe, then Susan, his face reflecting sudden concern with their relationship.",
    "58": "Escobar steps between the two, while Gittes takes a deep breath. The scene widens to include Escobar, Gittes, and two plainclothesmen, who are staring at the empty pipe as if expecting it to speak, as a trickle of water drops into the ocean. A third assistant runs down the side of the cliff over to Escobar. Escobar turns to Gittes and stares at him for a long moment with hatred. Gittes rings the doorbell and, scarcely waiting for an answer, tries the door, but it is locked. He reaches into his pocket, pulls out his cigarette case, takes a pick out of the side, and starts to manipulate the lock. The maid opens the door abruptly and stares in surprise at Gittes. Gittes, in Mulwray's Buick, whips into the driveway and pushes past. Evelyn, looking a little worn but glad to see him, hurries to the door, takes his arm, and stares at him, searching his face. Gittes looks around and sees clothes laid out for packing in a bedroom off the living room. He goes to the phone and dials, then takes the handkerchief out of his breast pocket, unfolding it on a coffee table to reveal the bifocal glasses, one lens still intact. Evelyn stares dumbly at them, trembling, and gets up as Gittes, charged with anger, shakes her. As his anger explodes, Gittes smiles and hits her full in the face. Evelyn stares back at him; the blow forces tears from her eyes, but she doesn't move or defend herself. Gittes slaps her repeatedly, finally knocking her into a cheap Chinese vase that shatters as she collapses on the sofa, sobbing. Kyo comes running down the stairs, momentarily stares at Gittes, then turns and goes back upstairs. Gittes picks up the glasses and, momentarily lost in them, stares at the lens. From the stairs, Evelyn, with her arm around Katherine, hurries the girl toward the bedroom while talking in Spanish. Evelyn re-emerges, and he nods slowly. Gittes hangs up and goes to the door, opens it, and finds Escobar and his minions appearing from either side of the doorway. A steep hill overlooks part of the harbor, where Escobar's unmarked car pulls up to a stop in front of a Spanish duplex perched on the steep hillside. Escobar shakes his head as Gittes gets out of the car, glances around, and goes up the stairs.",
    "365": "The Beast's journey takes it past a dangling fish hook baited with worms, past a tempting lure sparkling in the sun, and past a swiping bear claw. The Beast isn't worried. Will Bloom, age 3, listens wide-eyed as his father, Edward Bloom, in his 40s and handsome, tells the story. In every gesture, Edward is bigger than life, describing each detail with absolute conviction. A few years later, Will sits with the other Indian Guides as Edward continues telling the story to the tribe, pointing to his wedding band glinting in the firelight. While the other boys are rapt with attention, Will looks bored. Edward is chatting up Will's pretty date to the homecoming dance. She is enjoying the story and the force of Edward's charisma. He's hypnotizing. Will, now 17 with braces, is fuming and ready to leave. His mother Sandra, from whom he gets his good looks and practicality, stands with him at the door. She looks gorgeous and couldn't be any happier if it were her own wedding. Will can't take any more. Josephine tries to hold him back, but he gets up and leaves. As he leaves, Will mutters in perfect unison with his father. Will reaches the door, where his mother intercepts him. He focuses his words on Sandra. A laugh comes from the crowd. Edward motions for Sandra to join him. As she crosses, we can see that thirty years of marriage has not lessened their affection for each other. As they kiss, Edward tweaks her chin in a special little way. The crowd applauds. Edward toasts the happy couple. Josephine covers well for her absent husband, with a smile as warm as summer. We come into the middle of an argument on the sidewalk. Both men are a little drunk. A long beat, then. Will won't let him get the last word. Angle on Edward, who waves a hand, signaling enough of you, before he walks away. Angle on Will, still fuming with righteous anger. On a typically busy day, Will is on hold with the phone cradled under an ear, sorting through a bundle of mail dropped on his desk. Returning to the mail, he finds a hand-addressed envelope and rips it open. At the table, Sandra talks on the phone while Edward fixes a sandwich. Edward takes a seat and starts to eat his sandwich as Sandra stands by the window, watching. Edward swims laps in the family pool, born to the water. Edward stares intently into the water, like a lion in wait. We look down at the river, where Edward's reflection is caught in the dark water. As the water ripples past, something changes, and sure enough, as we look up again, it's a younger Edward Bloom, in his 20s, staring into the water.",
    "198": "They continue down the street on their search, while Potter peers through the slats of his Venetian blind, watching them. George and Uncle Billy continue their search in a shabby, old-fashioned, gas-lit room that has been turned almost inside out and upside down in an effort to locate the missing money. George grabs Uncle Billy by the lapels, jerking him to his feet and shaking him as Uncle Billy stands before him like a frisked criminal, with all his pockets hanging out, empty. George throws Uncle Billy down into his chair, still shouting at him in a manner that is almost maniacal. George then turns and heads for the door, kicking viciously at a waste basket on the floor as he goes, while Uncle Billy remains sobbing at the table, his head in his arms. George enters the hall where Mary turns and sees him with a slight powdering of snow on his head and shoulders, and then he sneezes violently. Mary stares at him, aware that something unusual has happened, as George slumps into an armchair and lifts Tommy onto his lap. Mary, who is helping Pete decorate the Christmas tree, realizes that something is seriously wrong and breaks off as Janie thumps away at the piano. Mary leads George, with Tommy hanging onto his coat-tails and pulling at him, toward the kitchen, and as they go, the camera pans with them. After they come through the door, Tommy leaves, and George paces about the kitchen, worried, before going toward the doorway. Mary looks after him, puzzled and concerned, then comes over to Pete. The knob on the banister comes off in George's hand, and he has an impulse to hurl it into the living room but instead replaces it before proceeding up the stairs, hearing the monotonous rhythm of Janie at the piano. He tiptoes in to see Zuzu, aged six, sitting up in her bed with the lamp burning beside her, holding her prize flower. Seeing she’s awake, he comes over and sits on the edge of her bed. She starts to get out of bed but shakes her head, pressing the flower to herself as a few petals fall off, which she picks up before handing the fallen petals and the flower to George.",
    "297": "She carries a copy of the Herald Tribune and still wears her hearing aid as she settles into a folding, canvas deck chair. She gets up, walks to the fence, and looks over, noticing him kneeling down, inspecting his flowers, and touching them affectionately and with some pride. His anger seems to have left him, replaced by the kind of peace that flowers bring many people. He notices her but doesn't speak, and she begins gesturing to him how to take care of his flowers. He listens for a moment, then looks directly at her, showing with the strong movements of his mouth that he objects vigorously to the annoyance of her comments. Started and a little shocked, she moves away from the fence. Jeff is seated in the foreground in a waist shot when the entrance door to his apartment opens behind him. Stella McGaffery comes in, pauses on the landing to watch Jeff. She is a husky, unhandsome, dark-haired woman dressed like a district nurse, with a dark coat, dark felt hat, and a white uniform showing underneath the coat. As she comes down the landing stairs, holding the wrought iron railing with one hand, she carries a small black bag, which she puts down on a table, then takes off her hat and coat and hangs them on a chair. Her attire is worn and looks as if it belongs more to a fighter than a nurse. Satisfied, she walks to Jeff, whose face shows he doesn't think much of it, and swings the wheelchair around abruptly to face her. She takes the thermometer out of its case, shakes it down, looks at it, and talks as she works. As she leaves him holding the thermometer, the camera pulls back as she crosses to a divan, takes a sheet from underneath, and covers the divan with it, talking all the time. He takes out the thermometer, having no answer, and, defeated, puts it back into his mouth as Stella goes on with her work. The camera pans her over to him as she takes out the thermometer, looks at it, and then gets down the thermometer. She helps him stand on one foot, then helps him off with his pajama top. He hops one step, then she lowers him, face down, on the divan. She gets a bottle of rubbing oil, and the camera is very low at one end of the divan where Jeff's head, half-buried in the sheet, is large in the foreground, while beyond him Stella looms large and powerful-looking.",
    "1132": "Harry sits in his room, holding a shard of broken mirror and stares pensively at his own reflection, then sees an eye that is not his own looking back at him. Hedwig is sitting patiently in her cage. Harry packs a rucksack, taking a notebook with the letters RAB written in it, a gold locket on a chain, and a newspaper with Dumbledore's obituary by Elphias Doge. Harry comes down the stairs, holding his rucksack and Hedwig's cage, to a bare living room. He opens the door of the cupboard under the stairs and peers inside, pulls a cord, and the light in the cupboard comes on. Harry steps inside what was once his bedroom and slowly shakes his head, spots a toy soldier wielding a sword, picks up the metal soldier, studies it solemnly, and puts it back. He opens the front door to see Hagrid, Ron, and Hermione; Mad-eye Moody, Mr. Weasley, and Kingsley Shacklebolt follow them inside. Hermione has plucked a hair from Harry's head and puts it in the flask Moody's holding. Fleur Delacour with Bill, the Weasley twins, Remus Lupin, and Nymphadora Tonks stand nearby as Moody glares at Fred. He sips, grimaces, passes the flask to George, and starts to shrink. George also pulls a face and shrinks. Mundungus drinks and grows a little. The flask is passed to Fleur, then Ron, and finally, Hermione, and they all change physically until each one looks like Harry. Moody retrieves the flask from Hermione, then joins the real Harry and they both survey the six Harry Potter lookalikes. He empties clothes onto the floor, and the real Harry steps out of the front door with Hedwig on his arm, the snowy owl spreading her wings and flying away into the night sky. Harry is in Hagrid's motorbike sidecar as some ride broomsticks and Bill Weasley rides a thestral, a winged, skeletal horse. Decoy Harrys on broomsticks sweep past Moody as Hagrid rides his motorbike up into the air, forcing Moody to duck. Two thestrals zoom over his head, and, in the sidecar, Harry grips the windscreen as Moody passes on a souped-up broomstick. Lightning flashes through the clouds as Harry clings to the windscreen when death eaters appear and zoom over the decoy Harrys. They race through the glowering clouds, and the decoys draw some death eaters away. Hagrid presses a button, and a burst of flame shoots out of the rear, propelling the bike forward as they land on the motorway with death eaters in pursuit. Harry aims his wand as a death eater crashes to the ground, a caravan veers out of control and tips over, and Hagrid swerves into oncoming traffic to avoid it, heading into a tunnel on the wrong carriageway.",
    "157": "An Indian regimental band strikes up martial music as a detachment of Indian Royal Air Force comes to attention at the shouted command of their NCO. An elaborately dressed military aide opens the door, and Lord Louis Mountbatten, resplendent in naval uniform, steps out onto the platform. He pauses and renders a salute. Nehru, Lady Mountbatten, and dignitaries look on as English and Indians watch Mountbatten approach a group of microphones identified as NBC, CBS, BBC, etc. He grins in his youthful, beguiling manner and makes the pranam to the cheering crowd, but it is cut off by the sound of a door being opened, close. Jinnah stands by one of the great pillars of the immense portico. It is a break in their Independence Conference, and as he lights a cigarette, a weary Gandhi approaches him with Azad. Jinnah's anger is clearly too deep to be left at the conference table. He slaps his lighter shut and addresses Gandhi in hushed but fiercely felt words. Nehru and Patel are approaching from the conference room, both of them looking worn and angry too. Jinnah raises his voice deliberately so Nehru will hear and sneers at the idea, though he cools a little. Gandhi is staring at Jinnah, trying to fathom the source of his anger and fear. He turns to see that Mountbatten has been standing in the open door to the conference room, as torn as Gandhi by the conflict, feeling it best controlled in formal discussion. Gandhi nods, and reluctantly the adversaries move back to the conference room with Gandhi the last through the door. Meanwhile, featuring Godse waving a black flag and shouting, a gathering of Hindu youths is near the entrance to the ashram. The youths and Kallenbach look back toward the ashram as Nehru steps out onto the porch and glares at the youths, his presence silencing them. Gandhi is rising from the floor, where his spinning wheel sits, and he stops halfway up, listening, then exhales a weary sigh. Mirabehn is spinning across the room and lifts her head as a signal to someone out of shot. Gandhi's two grandnieces, Manu and Abha, who help Mirabehn now that Ba is gone, rise quickly at Mirabehn's signal, with Manu helping with his shawl and Abha holding his sandals so that he can slip into them. It's cross—he's worried about other things, but Mirabehn just smiles at it. Gandhi looks down at Abha and taps her sharply on the top of the head. She nods obediently, a flicker of a smile around her mouth, youthful and irrepressible. The beauty of it almost saddens Gandhi. He taps her again—gently—and goes out.",
    "940": "In his mind, he sees the action about to unfold. The men eye their leader, who makes a cutthroat gesture to them. In his mind, Holmes sees a thug with a pocket watch take out a knuckleduster, a knife being thrust at Holmes, another attacker with a knuckleduster, and a third with a club. The gang's leader has a gun. Holmes opens his eyes and lives the action. A blond thug tosses an apple. Holmes thwarts the knife thrust and spins the thug, forcing the blade into another. He throws the man with the club and snatches the gun from the leader's hand. Holmes catches the apple as it falls and tosses it to the hapless leader. Holmes empties the gun and hands it back. He makes to attack the leader, who shrinks back. Holmes jogs off. On foot, Irene Adler enters the auctioneers, Cromwell and Griff. She hands the package to a mature man, who gives her a letter. The doctor starts to open the package. Irene rises. He holds her back. She sits. Holmes stops a sprung switch. Holmes kisses her and teases the letter from her. The doctor removes a banknote from the package, revealing dynamite. His pipe ignites a tapestry. The auction house clears. Irene heads out. She tries to retrieve the letter. Irene goes. Holmes takes the ticking package from the doctor. He runs to the sarcophagus. The bomb exploded in the closed sarcophagus. The doctor has gone. Outside, the scruffy Holmes draws glances from a well-dressed queue of people. A bearded man in a tweed suit watches him closely. Holmes turns, and the man looks away. Holmes, the back of his Oriental jacket covered in dust from the explosion, spots the doctor slumped against a wall. He feels for a pulse, then notices a tiny dart in the man's thigh. He examines the dart, then turns. The bearded man has disappeared. Holmes places the dart in his bag. The elaborately embossed ceiling of a grand restaurant. Irene Adler is led to a table in the center of the restaurant and sits by a curtain, shielding her from a nearby table. She turns to the waiter. From the table behind the curtain, her tea is poured. The bearded man in the tweed suit watches the speaker. The bearded man clinks a teaspoon against a glass, and all the clientele and staff, with the exception of him and the man behind the curtain, rise and leave the dining room. Irene stops sipping her tea and looks anxiously around as the place empties. The man behind the curtain draws it open. Irene closes her eyes, then glances down at her cup. The man has a rattled face and sports a beard.",
    "1308": "David gets startled, puts back the clippings, stuffs the new one inside with them, replaces it back on the top shelf, and leaves the closet. He opens the door to find Audrey standing in the darkened hall. Audrey nods, and David stares at his wife as she starts crying with tears rolling over her affected face. She tries to wipe them away, but there's too many. Audrey nods, walks down the stairs as she wipes her face, and David watches her disappear into the shadows. The cavernous stadium opens up into a picture-perfect blue sky, with a line of ticket holders snaking towards two turnstiles where the stadium crew is ripping tickets. David Dunne stands to one side with two other security guards, observing the fans clad in Eagles paraphernalia. A group of girls carries a homemade banner that David reads as he tilts his head sideways. He stares at a woman carrying a newborn infant in her arms, noticing the baby wearing an Eagles uniform. The walkie-talkie on David's hip bursts to life, and he pulls it off to listen. David bumps into a guy in line wearing an army jacket, then looks back at him and continues walking. David moves to a security guard near the turnstiles, walks to his post near the gate, and faces the crowd. Elijah moves next to him and observes as a security team pats down random males moving through the turnstiles. The green army-jacketed man moves forward in line with a blank face, watching the pat-down ahead of him. David eyes him as he is twenty people from the turnstile, then fifteen, then ten. The man coughs, steps out of line, and Elijah watches the green army jacket melt into the thick crowd, disappearing as it moves away from the stadium. In an unlit arched concrete passageway, sunlight from the stadium streams in causing long shadows. Elijah stands waiting in the ground tunnel by himself until David enters the tunnel and joins him, handing him a ticket. Elijah stares at David, who exhales slowly while staring back. David's walkie erupts with noise, and the two men stand very still in the tunnel. David turns, starts down the hall, and talks back over his shoulder as Elijah watches the silhouetted figure of David Dunne jog beyond down the darkness of the tunnel. Inside a customized car, the dashboard is covered in thin foam padding, as are the steering wheel and gear shift, with every corner and hard surface safeguarded. Elijah sits behind the wheel in the car parked in the stadium lot.",
    "573": "Jay hears a voice, but it's not the Vendor's; it's coming from a dog. Kay approaches, signaling Jay to keep quiet, and grabs the dog, Frank, who yelps like a dog. Passersby glare at Kay as if he's mistreating the dog, and Jay tries to explain. Kay shakes Frank the Pug, trying to get an answer, then shakes him again before letting go. Jay, lost in thought, suddenly notices Frank barking at a cat down the sidewalk. In the morgue, Laurel is at her desk when Rosenberg's cat jumps onto it, startling her. She pets the cat and notices something on its collar: a circular icon made of a strange, beautiful metal with a light green, translucent center. As Laurel peers into the jewel, her face shows amazement, as if she's transported to another universe, with a blank look as she imagines sailing through a starfield at light speed. Meanwhile, in the corridor, a bell rings. Tony quickly snaps a fly swatter at a buzzing fly as Edgar winces, flicking the swatter again to kill another fly, making Edgar grit his teeth. Tony looks down at Edgar's hands on the counter as cockroaches stream out from his sleeve. The scene shifts back to the morgue, where Laurel is slammed into a wall by Edgar, who is furious. He grabs Laurel and drags her toward the equipment, and as they approach, Orion the cat bolts from under it, leaping over cabinets and landing on a tall one. Edgar starts to turn when they hear the bell and a voice outside. Jay looks at Laurel, amazed by his apparent influence over her. Though she seems irritated with him, her tone doesn't match her words. Laurel rolls her eyes and looks down, pointing toward her waist.",

On Monday, video footage shows a long line of people standing outside Buckingham Palace, laying more flowers at the gates, where bunches of flowers pile up at the railings as a massive group of people is held back by metal barriers. One woman crouches by the gates, holding a hand to her face. Inside a large room, dignitaries and their advisers sit around a long table. Outside 10 Downing Street, a car stops, and Allister emerges from a backseat door, carrying some papers. After seeing the newspapers, Tony moves to leave. Two men, holding rifles, exit Balmoral followed by Charles, William, and Harry. Some Land Rovers are parked in the courtyard, and the Queen watches from a window above as she opens a newspaper. Robin enters holding a tray of items, and the Queen looks out of the window and clinches her jaw as Robin casts his eyes down. The Queen sits down in a nearby armchair, and Robin leaves a notepad on the table close by. Later, Tony sits at a desk with a female assistant beside him. A nervous Charles looks up at Steven, while, at the other end, a befuddled Tony puts down the phone. The Queen walks with two black Labradors, opens the door to an old Land Rover, and gets the dogs inside. Charles settles into the passenger seat, and the Queen and Charles drive along a country road. The Queen gets out, opens the back door, and the three black Labradors jump out. Charles moves round to the driver's side, drives away, leaving the Queen with the dogs. Figures can be glimpsed on the green hills nearby; one of them looks through some binoculars while three more stand still and another three lie on the ground. In the distance, over the next hill, a stag stands alone. Later, the Queen sits on a bed and watches footage from an interview with Diana on TV, with Philip standing in the doorway. The Queen stares thoughtfully at the TV, twists a silver pen in her hands, gazes at Prince Philip for a moment, then turns away. She sips drink from a glass, and a distracted Queen nods faintly. An image of Camilla on horseback appears on TV, and the Queen changes the channel. Various images appear, including Diana in a black evening dress, Diana next to a land mine danger sign, Diana cuddling children, Diana talking with pensioners, and Diana smiling. On Tuesday, Tony and Allister walk along, and Allister indicates a nearby room. The Queen strolls through some woods, carrying a lunch box and accompanied by some corgis, as some chairs, tables, and a barbecue have been set up in a clearing nearby.",

David and Jenny walk to the car park in their overcoats. David opens the boot and rummages inside. Her eyes wheel up as she looks at him. He tries to take her hand. Back at home, she sits studying. She slams down her book. She opens the bedroom window. Smoking, she looks out to the street lights. Her parents are downstairs in the kitchen. Jenny watches her parents doing the washing up.

    "868": "Calls Valjean to Marius as cannons are fired, splintering the barricade and throwing up clouds of smoke. The students keep shooting at the soldiers while wood splinters and flies through the air as more cannon balls hit the barricade. Some of the students are injured as soldiers advance on the barricade and start to climb up it. The students keep shooting, and a soldier is slashed with a sword while a student is bayoneted in the back. Students hammer on the door of a house but it's locked, and a shutter is pulled closed. They manage to get into a building and Marius is shot, falling to the ground with his head and arm bleeding. Valjean goes to him and drags him into the building as Enjolras hacks the wooden stairs away so the soldiers can't follow. The students climb up to the first floor of the building as soldiers burst into the building with guns blazing. Marius is over Valjean's shoulder as Valjean hides behind a door. Soldiers aim their muskets up at the ceiling where Enjolras and the students are huddled in the room above. The shots go up through the floor hitting most of the students, who fall. Valjean sees a low door, yanks it open, climbs down into a sewer, and drags Marius in with him. The soldiers are now upstairs and aim their weapons at Enjolras and a fellow student, the only ones left standing. Enjolras raises the red flag and soldiers open fire. Enjolras falls back through a window, hanging upside down from the ledge still clutching the red flag. Later on the cobble street below, Javert, now in uniform, walks through a puddle of blood on cobbles strewn with the corpses of soldiers. Javert walks into the building where the protesters took refuge and sees the dead students laid neatly side by side on the floor. His eyes stare out lifelessly from his young, pale face as Javert squats down at the end of the line beside the corpse of Gavroche. Moved by the scene, Javert removes from his jacket the star-shaped Legion of Honor medal with its red ribbon and pins it to Gavroche's coat. Javert frowns, his eyes darting about wildly as he gets up, looks around, and goes to a door, turns the handle, and pushes it open. In the sewer, Valjean is heaving the unconscious Marius along, while on ground level, Javert hears Valjean straining and tries to find the source of the noise. He goes to another door, listens, and peers down at a round entrance to the sewers. Valjean slips down a duct tunnel with Marius, and they plummet into the cavernous sewers, landing unconscious in dark sludge. On ground level, Javert frowns.",
    "683": "She moves her left hand to his head and her fingers caress his temple as her hand slides down his cheek. His eyelids flicker and almost close before MJ turns and walks slowly away. Peter lowers his head, swallows, and his head droops. With a smile on her face, she saunters away. Peter enters his apartment building, climbs a dark stairway, and reaches a landing where a door opens behind him and a man playing cards looks out at him. He snatches it and screws up his face as Mister Ditkovich's daughter, Ursula, drops a ladle and sets fire to the stove, and the door is shut in Peter's face. Peter lets himself into his apartment and switches on the light in his single room home. He rolls off the satchel strapped to his back and sits down on the bed, his face glum, with his back to the opened window. On the bedside cabinet are photos of Aunt May, Uncle Ben, and MJ. Beside them is a radio set, which he switches on. The morning sun lights up the skyline of New York as Mister Ditkovich barges past Peter and into the restroom, closes the door, then opens it, prompting Peter to lean forward and shut the door. Harry and Peter enter a lab, and Harry leaves Peter with Doctor Octavius as Peter looks around. They're having tea and the doctor nods. Later, Peter is in a laundromat, reading Longfellow, and lays the volume down on top of a pile of other poetry books before going to the washing machine and opening it. As he stretches in to remove the laundry, he looks across at the only other person in the laundromat, who is paying him no attention. Peter stuffs the Spider-Man costume in his bag, then checks his boxers, noticing the white fabric is stained with blue and red from the costume, along with his once white socks. Peter stands by the window of his apartment, lugs off his T-shirt, drops the shirt on the floor, and opens the curtain door of his wardrobe, revealing a Spider-Man outfit, and a suit, shirt, and tie. In front of the mirror, he fastens the tie and runs down the stairs in his boxers, while his daughter stares as he pulls up his trousers and walks into a room. Cabs pull up outside the theater, where MJ's face is displayed prominently at the entrance. As crowds walk into the foyer and tickets are checked and stubs torn off, MJ is suiting with a fellow actress in makeup. Half grinning, Peter picks up a bunch and hands over some money, and the florist taps him on the shoulder, takes the flowers, and hands him back a single stem with three flowers on it backstage. Finally, Peter glides serenely along a street on his moped.",
    "140": "The cheap glasses, the nut-brown head, the warm, eager eyes. He smiles and joins his hands together to exchange Godse's greeting. Godse moves his right hand rapidly from the stance of prayer to his jacket, in an instant — it holds a gun, and he fires point blank at Gandhi — loud, startling — once, twice, thrice. Gandhi's white shawl is stained with blood as he falls. Amid the screams and sounds of chaos we dissolve through to soldier's feet moving in the slow step, half-step, step of the requiem march. The huge funeral procession — crowds such as have never been seen on the screen massed along the route. People everywhere, clinging to monuments, lamp standards, trees — and as the camera pulls back from the funeral cortege it reveals more and more. We only hear a strange, rhythmic shuffling, pierced by an occasional wail of grief. We see the soldiers and sailors lining the route, their hands locked together in one seemingly endless chain. We see the two hundred men of the Army, Navy, and Air Force drawing the Army weapon-carrier that bears the body of Gandhi. And finally we see Gandhi lying on the weapon-carrier, surrounded by flowers, a tiny figure in this ocean of grief and reverence. Commentators from all over the world are covering the ceremony. We concentrate on one, let us say the most distinguished American broadcaster of the time, Edward R. As the cortege continues on its way, we get shots of the marching soldiers, of the faces of Sikhs, and Tamils, Anglo-Indians, Moslems from the north, Marathas from the south, blue-eyed Parsees, dark-skinned Keralans. We see the throng, following the weapon-carrier bier of Gandhi as it slowly inches its way along the Kings way. Mountbatten, tall, handsome, bemedalled, walks at the head of dignitaries from many lands, and behind them a broad mass of Indians. The camera picks out those who ride on the weapon-carrier with Gandhi's body: the stout, blunt, but now shattered Patel, Gandhi's son, Devadas, the strong, almost fierce face of Maulana Azad, now angry at the Gods themselves, and finally Pandit Nehru — a face with the strength of a hero, the sensitivity of a poet, and now wounded like the son of a loving father. The porter has glanced down the corridor, where from his point of view we can just glimpse the European talking with the conductor. He looks up suddenly then turns back quickly to his work. Gandhi glances at the door to see what has frightened him so. The European and the conductor push open the door and stride in. Gandhi is incredulous that he is being addressed in such a manner.",
    "774": "Jackson pulls up outside Kate's house in the early morning dew, climbs out of the limo, and opens the back door. Kate comes outside, and they hug. Jackson watches by the limo as Gordon comes outside, smiles, and waves to Lily as she goes inside. Kate turns, and he holds his phone up. Kate goes indoors while Jackson gets back into the limo and changes into a chauffeur's uniform. Tamara looks fondly at her little Pekingese dog, Caesar. Jackson pulls up on the driveway outside Yuri's palatial mansion in Bel Air, where curly-haired twin boys Alec and Oleg wait on the steps. They both check their watches as Jackson takes their luggage over to the boot. Jackson pulls up on the runway at Santa Monica Airport and jumps out as Yuri's pilot Sasha marches over. A case hits Alec's foot, and Oleg glares over a shoulder as he boards the waiting plane. Jackson gets in the limo and switches on the radio. Meanwhile, Gordon watches TV over breakfast when the whole house shakes violently, prompting Gordon, Kate, and the kids to climb under the table. On the TV, the press conference is similarly affected. Jackson pulls up outside and heads indoors as the house rocks unpredictably then collapses. They board the limo as the trees fall off ahead of them. Jackson reverses the limo, and the back door is knocked off. He bumps on a Porsche, and it falls into an earthquake, while Gordon is slightly pissed. Jackson sets off at high speed as the street falls to pieces, and the creeks off the road rear up savagely behind them, with Kate in the back seat holding Lily. The collapsing road rushes out to them, as two old ladies drive steadily ahead. Jackson powers through gardens, and the old lady powers into a rising section of the road. The limo soars over a gap as buildings have obliterated all around them, sewage throws on the windscreen, and a giant donut rolls across the road. The race freeway breaks in half, and a missed truck smashes into a petrol station and explodes. They drive alongside the collapsing bridge as cars fall from the freeway, smashing into the road around the limo. They approach a huge gap, and Jackson spins the limo into a type hole and accelerates over a pass beneath the freeway. Jackson drives the limo into a ramp and drives into the collapsing building's ground floor while a high-rise falls on the road, and the limo smashes out of the other side. In the corridor of the White House, in the airport, the pilot lies dead near the petrol station as Jackson's limo pulls up. Jackson grabs his case from the limo as a giant fissure hole causes havoc and destruction as it arrows towards the airport, and the runway starts to collapse.",
    "127": "Neff, in a blue suit and hat pulled down over his eyes, descends the stairs as some windows are lit. He cautiously approaches, looks around, and slides open the garage door before closing it again. Very faint light seeps in through a side window as he opens the rear door of a sedan, gets in, and closes the door behind him, disappearing into the dark interior. Phyllis drives without turning her head, staring straight ahead with clenched teeth. Sixty yards away, the station is visible with ten or twelve diagonally parked cars and no sign of crowding. Although the train hasn't arrived, there is activity around the station with passengers, their friends, redcaps, baggage men, and news vendors. The Dietrichson sedan drives into view, parks at the line's outer end, with both front doors open. Phyllis exits as crutches appear from the other side, followed by a man, presumably Dietrichson, awkwardly climbing out. As he steadies himself with the crutches, Phyllis retrieves Dietrichson's suitcase and overcoat, walks around the car, rolls up the right front window, and then closes and locks the car door. She checks the right rear door and gazes into the car's dim interior before she and the man head to the station platform's end and along it, with Phyllis several steps ahead. Observed by the CAMERA, Phyllis nods, and they proceed amid the sounds of the arriving train and its lights. As the train stops, passengers move towards the tracks, and Phyllis, with the suitcase and overcoat, and Neff slightly behind her, approach the CAMERA. A redcap sees them, takes the suitcase from Phyllis, who hands him the overcoat, and they follow him towards car number nine. Neff lags behind, head down, mimicking a man on crutches. As the pullman conductor checks tickets, the redcap leads Phyllis and Neff into view, prompting the conductor and porter to step forward to assist Neff on his crutches.",
    "779": "Outside, the crowd panics as the amazing edifice of Saint Peter's, with its huge dome, keels forward and crashes into the square. On Air Force One, Scotty studies a screen as the projective tsunami is spread across the oceans of the world. The boat is still upright on the turbulent ocean. Adrian's father Harry plays the piano and drinks. Kearney watches TV with others in the galley as Harry enters. Tony, dazed, gets to his feet and wanders aimlessly towards him. The trolley with the television on it and other filled trolleys start to roll as the ship vibrates. Harry moves towards a door and hangs onto a handle while Tony clings to a table. As the ship lists, the table is torn and personnel slide down the slope. Tony loses his grasp and slithers along the floor away from Harry, who still clings to the hammock. Harry pulls himself onto the deck as the ship lists, facing the black night sky. The ship keels over to the starboard side and completes a hundred and eighty-degree turn as waves wash off. In Washington, a white sheet flutters in the breeze, with a wheel turning and not much movement elsewhere. President Wilson looks up, hearing the noise of water as it swells up the tarmac from Chesapeake Bay, thundering towards the city. A wave brings a large aircraft carrier that buries the White House. On the Antinov, Jackson fiddles with a radio in the loading bay as Kate, in a parka, joins him. She opens the passenger door, settles beside him, and they exchange glances. She gazes out of the windscreen, takes her hand to her cheek while Jackson inclines his head and stares at the radio. On Air Force One, Anheuser walks over to the screen, they turn to Professor West. In the Antinov cockpit, Jackson and Yuri climb down the steps, leaving Gordon with Sasha. In the cargo hold, Jackson hands Yuri life jackets, leans on the steps, and looks at his sleeping family. Jackson wearily removes a life jacket as his son Noah wakes and looks over at him. Surprised, Jackson stares at Noah, lowers his gaze, nods, and they hug. Kate wakes as the Karpovs put on life jackets and the plane descends rapidly. The Curtis children also have their life jackets on.",
    "112": "The platoon walks through a rice paddy, waits deep in water, and then it begins to rain, pouring down on Forrest and Bubba as they sit in a foxhole. On another day, the platoon walks through the jungle with rain pouring down on them, and again, on another day, they shelter themselves while walking through the wind and rain. Forrest holds his hand up to protect his face. On yet another day, Forrest and other soldiers walk chest-deep through a river, as rain splatters back up, hitting the soldiers. The rain pours down on the men of the platoon as they sit in a camp, and Bubba sits down next to Forrest, leaning his back up against Forrest's back. On another night, some soldiers patrol the area, while Forrest lies in a pup tent and writes a letter as the rain pours down, using his flashlight to see. Meanwhile, Jenny steps out of the trailer with a backpack and a guitar, hugs a hippie guy, and jumps into the back of a Volkswagen bus with another guy. The Fourth Platoon makes their way through the jungle and rain, and Forrest looks up as the sun suddenly appears. Forrest's platoon is then attacked, a bullet kills the soldier standing next to Forrest, and bombs explode all around as the soldiers scramble to the ground. Forrest crawls over a berm with bullets flying overhead and exploding around him; he rolls over and pulls his pack off as Lt. Dan lies next to him. Two soldiers with a machine gun fire into the jungle, and Lt. Dan shouts into the radio. Forrest begins firing his weapon into the jungle as the machine gunner fires into the treeline, assisted by another soldier with ammunition, but the machine gun jams. A rocket explodes on the machine gunner and the other soldier, killing them, and Forrest looks down, covering his head as rockets explode all around him. The platoon gets up and runs toward the cover of the jungle, with rockets exploding all around the field. Forrest runs into the jungle, followed by soldiers running through it with bullets exploding around them. A soldier is blown up by a rocket as Forrest runs past him, and rockets explode as he runs out toward a clearing. Forrest turns around, runs back into the jungle, and rockets explode while he looks for Bubba. Forrest stops, aims his weapon, looks around scared, sees something move, turns, looks, and rushes over to find Tex lying on the ground, his face distorted with pain. Forrest carries Tex out of the jungle and into the clearing.",
    "50": "He now looks around. Reggie's is the last such balcony on one side, but there are two or three on the other. Peter climbs over the railing and, holding on to it with one hand, reaches for the railing on the next balcony. As he stretches for the railing, it is several inches short of touching it. As he straightens up and prepares to jump. From the ground, Peter, high above, jumps to the next balcony. As he climbs over the railing of the second balcony, he sees a light coming through the window and looks in. From the ground, as Peter jumps to the next balcony. As he climbs over the rail to the third balcony, there is a light coming from this window, too. Peter looks in. Inside the room are Gideon, Tex, and Scobie in the midst of a heated discussion. Scobie turns and storms out of the door, slamming it. There is a knock at the door. Reggie unlocks the door and opens it. Peter enters and she closes the door again. Peter is silent for a moment. She falls in his arms to be comforted. He takes out his handkerchief and dries her eyes. The phone rings. Reggie answers it. Scobie holds the receiver in his metal hand. Reggie's back is turned to Peter so he can't see her face. He watches her. She shakes her head. He hangs up. Slowly, Reggie lowers the phone from her ear and hangs it up. She hesitates a moment. As Peter (now called Dyle) leaves Reggie's room and closes the door, he pauses for a moment, listening, hears nothing, then bends down and starts pulling at a loose thread in one of his socks. As usual, the thread unravels -- and unravels -- and unravels some more until it seems that the entire sock has come unknit. Now, taking the long thread, he bends down near the door and, taking his tie-pin, attaches one end of the thread to the bottom of Reggie's door. He then runs the thread along the floor to his door (next door) and works it underneath. Reggie is on the phone. Bartholomew is on the phone. He is silent for a moment, his face troubled. Bartholomew looks at her for a moment, then glances around; his attention is drawn inside the doorway. Almost as far as the eye can see, row upon row of beef sides, hung on hooks. As Reggie looks at the hanging beef. Reggie and Bartholomew sit at the table. Bartholomew pulls out a package and she takes one, looks at it and rips off the filter tip. He winces. She puts the other end in her mouth, then picks up the matches and lights it.",
    "56": "She leaps out of bed, throwing on a robe. Evelyn starts quickly for the bathroom, then comes back and kneels by the side of the bed, taking Gittes' hand. Then he leaps out of bed, rummages around, and tosses on his trousers. He grabs his shoes, throws them on, and hurries out of the bedroom, running across the driveway to the garage. There are two cars there: Mulwray's Buick and Evelyn's Packard. Gittes moves over to the Buick, opens the passenger's door, and kicks at the right rear taillight of the car with the heel of his shoe, shattering the red lens. He gets up, carefully pulls the red lens off the taillight, exposing the white light beneath it, tosses the red lens into the shrubbery, and hurries back toward the house. Evelyn's car speeds along the curves on Sunset Boulevard, the red and white lights coming in and out of view, with Gittes behind the wheel of Mulwray's car, keeping a healthy distance from Evelyn in front of him. He pulls up before a small bungalow house and she hurries up the walkway to the front door, while he brings the car a few yards further down the street, parking it near Evelyn's, and idles the engine with the lights off. Gittes gets out of the car and goes up the walkway, where the curtains are drawn except for one of the small windows on the side of the house. He goes to it and looks, balancing on the edge of the porch, and sees Evelyn's Oriental servant rushing through the living room of the small house, where the windows have blinds. He moves to one where the blind is not completely drawn, finding an inch or so of space at the bottom. Evelyn is pacing back and forth in and out of his line of vision. After a moment, someone rises into sight, obviously from lying on a bed: Mulwray's girlfriend, just a few feet from Evelyn. Her tear-stained face comes into view as Evelyn kneels, and the girl looks up to Evelyn, speaking in Spanish. Gittes continues to watch as the servant re-emerges through the living room carrying a tray with a glass and pitcher on it. Evelyn insists that the girl swallow down some pills, which the girl reluctantly does, before emerging from the house, going to her car, and getting in. Evelyn sees Gittes sitting in her car, staring coldly at her. As Gittes starts to get out of the car, Evelyn grabs his arm, nearly screaming, with her intensity actually ripping Gittes' already partially torn jacket. He looks at it and her, which has a momentary calming effect on both of them, before Evelyn's head sinks onto the steering wheel, her hair covering her face.",
    "562": "She gasps once again, terrified, as Indy lifts her and carries Elsa forward. Kazim and his men step to the opening Indy made earlier and shine their flashlights through to the rat-infested water. More rat-infested water appears as Elsa, now walking again, follows Indy through another passageway lined with skulls and bones. Indy reaches for a wall to steady himself and inadvertently grabs a skeleton, causing a bone to come loose in his hand as rats scurry about and leap at him from all directions. He takes a moment to compose himself, then steps across the water to Elsa's side and helps her into the water. The chamber is flooded with black, briny water as they move toward the altar. Indy and Elsa begin to inspect the ornately carved coffins like the scholars of antiquity that they are, noting the big oak caskets held together by straps of etched brass. One coffin is elevated above the others, and together they begin to push on the lid, straining and groaning until it slides away and bangs against the stone platform, revealing the decomposed remains of a knight in armor. Indy and Elsa look in, and Indy unfolds a piece of paper and holds it over the shield, completing the missing portion of the rubbing. Indy laughs, lights a match, and drops the lighted match into the oil-slick water as Elsa holds the torch. Indy looks around and then sees the glow of firelight dancing across the Catacomb walls. Thousands of rats flee from around the corner of the narrow passageway, stampeding toward Elsa and Indy, shrieking and squealing as they approach. The rats wash over them like a rodent tidal wave in their efforts to escape. Elsa screams, and Indy braces his back against the altar, toppling the coffin with his feet. It crashes against the stone platform and splashes into the water. They jump into the water beside the bobbing, overturned coffin. Indy literally dunks her and pushes her underneath as Elsa surfaces into the air pocket created by the coffin, sputtering and spitting. Indy then pops up into the air pocket and looks at Elsa; they are both soaking wet. Indy disappears under the water and swims out from under the coffin, looking for an escape route, while the rats begin to force their way inside, swimming through the water and climbing on Elsa, who squirms and screams in terror. Indy pops back up through the water, and Elsa groans. They take a deep breath and both dive under the water. The perfect picture postcard of St. Mark's Square and the Grand Canal beyond comes into view.",
    "1379": "The tent blooms softly with light, briefly illuminating a bedside photograph of James and Lily Potter, then goes dark. The blankets bloom again when, down the hall, a toilet flushes. Instantly, the shadow stiffens, the blankets dim, and the tent flattens just as the bedroom door opens, revealing Uncle Vernon. He peers inside, eyes flashing suspiciously, then withdraws. The tent rises, and as the blankets blaze, we cut inside to find a skinny boy with a crow's nest of black hair, thick glasses sitting crookedly atop his nose: Harry Potter. Open before him is Violeta Stitch's Extreme Incantations. Once again, he speaks. A blinding blast of light flashes from the second story window of Number Four. The light in the hallway snaps on, Harry's tent droops once more, and seconds later, Harry's door eases open. Uncle Vernon peers in and switches on the light. Slowly, he closes the door and eyes the parchment in Harry's hand suspiciously. Just then, Dudley, sitting comatose before the TV, emits a hollow, brain-dead chuckle. Marge flashes a thick fan of pound notes. Dudley blinks, waddles forward, and extends his plump palm obediently. Harry looks on, then sees Ripper snuffling about his ankle. As Harry clears the dishes, Uncle Vernon brings out a bottle of brandy. Hearing this, Harry frowns and glances at Uncle Vernon, who glares darkly at him. Aunt Marge pauses on her wine, eyes narrowing on Harry. POP! The glass in Aunt Marge's hand explodes. Harry stares at the shattered glass in surprise. Aunt Marge starts to reply when a button on her dress sails into the air with a zing. Thread snaps. Aunt Marge's eyes widen. Her cheeks billow. Her whole body billows, and she begins to inflate like a monstrous balloon. To his horror, Uncle Vernon himself begins to rise. Aunt Marge looks fearfully into his eyes, and he lets go, falls to his knees, and watches Aunt Marge float away. Harry crashes inside, takes his trunk, then puts his heel to a loose floorboard and removes his wand from its hiding place. Turning, he grabs the photograph of his parents. BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! Harry tows the trunk down the stairs and finds Uncle Vernon waiting for him. Uncle Vernon eyes Harry's wand nervously, then grins with knowing cruelty. As Harry storms out with his trunk, we dolly to the street with him. High in the sky, a plump dot rises. Harry walks and walks and walks, then stops, glancing about. An empty playground, swings creaking gently on rusted chains, and a tiny carousel, kissed gently by the wind, turning slowly. Harry drops the trunk, sits, still as a statue. In the trees above, leaves tremble. Harry turns and studies the swaying swings, the carousel.",
    "652": "Latika appears and gently pushes Salim's gun down as Jamal looks incredulous, with Salim pulling her back into the room, while Jamal remains rooted to the spot. Back in the police station, the inspector and Srinivas stare at the sweating Jamal, and Srinivas grins as Jamal leans over toward the inspector. Two other uniformed policemen rush into the room and eventually subdue a raging Jamal. The inspector wipes the sweat from his hands and face. Jamal carries a tray of tea at the call center, rushing around and delivering tea to the call center workers, who all sit at computers wearing headsets. Dave rushes off to a nearby TV showing the game show and signals to everyone to start dialing the number on their mobile phones. The readout indicates it has found over 26,000 Latikas as the name scrolls across the screen, and Jamal gulps and puts on his headset, while across the room, call center managers walk around, monitoring staff calls. Back on the game show, the host shakes his head, and the director hands him a check. Jamal is ascending in a lift on the construction site of a skyscraper, where hundreds of meters above, Salim waits. Jamal arrives at the open top floor with no walls, offering panoramic views of Mumbai, and sees a guy dressed in an expensive shirt, wearing jewelry and dark glasses. Salim smiles and removes his glasses as Jamal lunges for Salim, and they both fall off the building. Jamal blinks awake from his vision and punches Salim instead. Jamal and Salim sit on the edge of the building with the vast cityscape spread out before them, and Salim is phoned, then shakes his head as he watches his brother go. At night, in Salim's apartment, both are asleep until Salim gets up. Jamal opens his eyes but lies still, then sneaks to the landing to spy on Salim downstairs as he loads a gun and watches him kneel on a mat to pray. Salim touches his forehead to the ground, then leaves his apartment block and heads for his car. As Salim drives off, Jamal appears in a tuk-tuk, following closely behind. Salim's car pulls up to a sprawling palatial house situated on the hillside surrounded by construction sites, drives through the electronic gates, and Jamal's tuk-tuk then arrives outside the gates. Jamal jumps out and watches Salim approach a beautiful woman in dark glasses standing on a balcony. Salim collects a small package from her, then drives past the gates where Jamal is hiding. The young woman notices Jamal lurking at the entrance as a guard closes the gates, and the guard goes to the gatehouse while the woman removes her glasses for a better look at Jamal.",
    "187": "Brackett bends down to the object, then he steps closer to it. He slowly walks toward it and stands back up, looking at Loomis. Both men look down off screen at the animal, and Brackett gets a disgusted expression and steps away, looking back at the dead animal. They glance at each other and Brackett just looks at Loomis a moment before turning and walking out of the bedroom. Loomis walks over to the spot where the sister was sitting, turns, and glances at the window. He stops by the window, stares at the rain gutter in the broken window, and the camera slowly tracks in toward the window. Brackett draws his gun, and the two men step inside. Laurie sits with Tommy Doyle on the couch reading him a story, while Tommy, in his Halloween costume, has a big bag of candy on the floor. Tommy pulls out a stack of comic books from underneath the couch and Laurie glances through the stack. Laurie goes to answer it, picks up the receiver in the den, and Tommy rushes out of the den. Tommy dashes up to the front window and looks out as we see the man pass under a streetlight. Tommy runs to the window in the den and points, and Laurie walks over with the phone and looks. The shape moves to see inside a window of the Wallaces' house where Annie stands by the kitchen stove making popcorn. The shape stands close to the camera watching Annie make popcorn as she starts to pour the butter over the popcorn but instead pours it on herself. Annie hangs up, quickly takes off her blouse and blue jeans, and stands in the kitchen with only her panties on. She pulls a box of cornstarch out of the closet and sprinkles it out on the stains of butter. The shape moves closer to the kitchen window and knocks over a potted plant, which crashes noisily against the side of the house. Annie is startled by the crash, looks outside the window, and a hanging plant swings in the wind. The shape leans up close to the kitchen window, looking inside. From the darkness of the backyard, Lester, a large, ferocious-looking German shepherd, springs forward into the camera, snarling and barking viciously. The shape darts away from the kitchen window, the dog snapping right after him.",

She settles down on a large tree stump. Lizzy folds up the letter and walks off. Mariah follows her inside and up the stairs. But, Lizzie hurries to her room and shuts the door behind her. Inside, she sits down near a window and opens up the letter again. Lizzie cringes as she remembers her family's improper behavior. Then she looks down at the letter once more. Darcy watches from above as Jane heads out dressed in a grey cloak and bonnet. Lizzie is now walking with Mr. Collins. Mr. Collins goes to bid his farewells to Lizzie. He looks over at his wife and gives her a little wave. She and Lizzie exchange a knowing smile. The horse-drawn carriage pulls away from the parsemage, gathering speed along the country road. Lizzie and Mariah are sitting inside. Mariah has a notebook open. Lizzie leans forward in her seat, looking thoughtful. As she stares out of the window, memories of Darcy pass through her mind. Platter of horses' hooves snaps at the rubbery. Finally, the carriage pulls up outside a busy inn. Lydia opens one of the upper windows excitedly. Lizzie waves up at her and Kitty. Lydia indicates that she'll come down and meet them then closes the window. She embraces her sister warmly then sits back on the bed. He leaves the room.

    "5": "The Colonel, deeply troubled, enters silently through the door and starts going through Ricky's bureau. He opens a drawer where Ricky keeps his marijuana but doesn't discover its false bottom. The Colonel stands and looks around, noticing the Digicam and a stack of cassettes on a shelf. Meanwhile, Barbara Fitts sits at the kitchen table, staring off into space. The Colonel takes the cassette out of the Digicam and inserts another, his face tightening as he views the TV screen. He sinks slowly onto Ricky's bed, mesmerized. Later, naked except for his black socks, the Colonel grabs dumbbells and starts lifting them, watching his reflection in the window. The camera remains connected to the TV. Lester, wearing a Mr. Smiley's uniform, happily flips burgers on a grill. He suddenly looks up when he hears something, his face darkening, but then he smiles and puts his spatula down. Carolyn drives a Mercedes to the drive-thru window, with Buddy sitting beside her, too involved to notice Lester watching them. Lester leans out of the window, grinning at Carolyn with bags of fast food, while the Counter Girl stands next to him staring blankly. Carolyn almost jumps out of her skin but struggles to appear nonchalant. The sky fills with ominous gray clouds, and wind whips garbage across the parking lot as her Mercedes pulls in next to Buddy's Jaguar. Gripping the wheel tightly, Carolyn stares straight ahead while Buddy looks at her unhappily, then gets out of the car and shuts the door. She starts to cry as Buddy's Jaguar speeds off, leaving her alone in the parking lot. Carolyn closes her eyes tightly, tries to stop the tears, and suddenly screams as loud as she can, the sound still muffled. The Colonel puts down the weights and looks at his reflection in the window, seeing his pumped arms, before reaching under the bench to grab a cigar box. He smiles, opens it, and digs through marijuana paraphernalia, only to find an empty Ziploc bag. Ricky and the Colonel sit at the table, eating in silence, when Ricky pulls his beeper off his belt and checks it, then heads into the hall, leaving the Colonel uneasy. It's raining outside, and Angela drives, squinting through the windshield as the wipers move back and forth. The Colonel sees something outside that catches his eye, craning his neck for a better look. Through a window over the sink, blurred by the rain, Lester is visible in the Burnham's garage, his upper body pumped and glistening in sweat as he counts out a wad of bills.",
    "111": "Forrest watches Jenny in the pickup as it drives away. Forrest, dressed in his uniform, sits on a log and looks out at a river. Mrs. Gump walks toward Forrest and sits down next to him on the log. Forrest leans down, placing his head on his mother's shoulder. The shadow of a helicopter is over the rice field below as a soldier mans a gun from inside the helicopter. The soldier looks left as Forrest and Bubba ride in the helicopter, which circles overhead and lands at the firebase. Bubba and Forrest jump out with their gear and walk, looking around oddly. A soldier places a case of beer on a large stack of cases, takes two beers out, and walks away, while in the background soldiers are barbecuing steaks and drinking beer. Lieutenant Dan Taylor steps out of a tent, shirtless, holding a roll of toilet paper in his hand, and looks at Bubba. Forrest and Bubba look at each other oddly, not getting the joke, as Lt. Dan starts to walk. Bubba and Forrest grab their gear and follow him. Lt. Dan stops and looks at the boys, then steps over to a large black soldier named Sergeant. A distant relative of Lt. Dan, wearing a revolutionary war uniform, falls dead in the snow. Another relative, in a civil war uniform, resembling Lt. Dan, falls dead, and another, in a World War II uniform, falls dead on the beach at Normandy. Lt. Dan steps back to Bubba and Forrest, walks along the walkway with them following, and steps inside the latrine, still holding the toilet paper. He sits down out of sight, stands up looking at the boys, then sits back down out of sight. Bubba and Forrest look at each other. Forrest, Bubba, and other soldiers in the Fourth Platoon walk across the rice field as Vietnamese rice farmers work nearby. Forrest's unit walks along a dirt road when suddenly Lt. Dan holds up his fist, signaling them to stop. He motions for them to get down, and Forrest complies, looking around. Lt. Dan motions for the lead soldier to get down, crouches, looks at the soldiers, and points to his eyes before lying down on the dirt road and crawling. Tex holds up his hand, motioning that he doesn't know. Forrest stands up and begins to walk with the platoon. Lt. Dan walks away as Forrest rushes over, aims two pistols in the hole, and then climbs inside.",
    "389": "As the picture fades in, the bowling noises continue, but filtered and faint. We are close on the Dude, upside down. As the Dude opens his eyes, we spiral slowly upward to put him right side around. His head is now resting against a hardwood floor, not a rug. The rug is gone. We push Brandt down the familiar marble hallway. We pan off the Dude, driving, to his point of view through the front windshield. The headlights play over Walter standing waiting in front of the storefront of SOBCHAK SECURITY. Though he is wearing khaki shorts and a shirt, the fact that he holds a battered brown briefcase makes him look oddly like a commuter. He also holds an irregular shape bundled in brown wrapping paper. The car stops in front of him, and he opens the Dude's door and hands in the briefcase. The Dude takes the briefcase and slides over. He raises himself onto his elbows and massages the red lump on his jaw. The Dude unclips the phone from the battery pack. The Dude glares at Walter. Walter stares dumbly for a beat. The Dude is twisting around to pull the money briefcase from the back seat. Walter reaches one arm across the Dude's body to grab the laundry. There is the bump and new steady of the car on the bridge. He flings it out the window. Walter points across the seat at the paper-wrapped bundle. Walter has flung open his door and is leaning halfway out over the road. Walter rolls out with his parcel, giving a loud grunt as he hits the pavement. The car swerves and lurches, and the Dude, cursing, takes the wheel. Walter tumbles onto the shoulder and--RAT-TAT-TAT-TAT!--muzzle flashes tear open the wrapping paper. The car rocks, and the Dude wrestles with the wheel. The car clunks and screams around in a skid. The Dude is thrown forward as the car hits something. As the Dude struggles out holding the satchel of money, the Dude runs up the road toward the bridge, frantically waving the satchel in the air. WALTER is just rising from the ground, massaging an injured knee. The Dude and Walter stand in the middle of the road, watching the three red tail lights fishtail away. He turns from the lane to where the Dude sits in the nook of molded plastic chairs. The Dude listlessly holds the portable phone in his lap. Donny is trotting excitedly up. The Dude gets to his feet with the portable phone. He waves both arms as if conducting a symphony orchestra. The three bowlers, stopped at the edge of the lot, stare out at an empty parking space. The Dude walks away across the lot.",
    "591": "Lightning flashes behind a skull-shaped cloud as it moves forward over the City of London, casting stormy reflections on a tall office building, where staff watch in alarm as the menacing clouds approach. The clouds produce three dark trails of smoke that swoop toward the Thames and Trafalgar Square, then swiftly move past Leicester Square tube station, down narrow alleys and through walls into Diagon Alley, igniting a shop and injuring people, as Death Eaters leave holding a man with a bag over his head. Two wear metal masks, while the third has a long face and beard. They zoom away and weave over the Millennium Bridge, which tilts, sways, and ultimately crashes into the Thames, flinging people and leaving only trails of smoke rising from the river. At Surbiton Railway Station, a pretty waitress smiles at Harry Potter, whose bloodied face appears as he puts down a paper, sniffs his breath, pops a mint into his mouth, and watches a train pass. Wiping condensation from the glass, his eyes fix on the opposite platform where he sees Professor Dumbledore standing in front of a Divine Magic Perfume billboard. Harry smiles, crosses over, and holds Dumbledore's left arm, noticing his blackened hand and rings as they spin away to a street. Dumbledore, with his left arm around Harry, leads him through a crowd of photographers flashing their cameras, and as they walk past a market cross, they continue down a dark street, stopping outside a detached house.",
    "105": "Mrs. Gump looks into a sitting room and informs the boarders about dinner. She looks into Forrest's room, hears singing coming from another room, and walks over to a closed door. Mrs. Gump opens the door, revealing a young man with long sideburns playing the guitar and singing. Meanwhile, Forrest holds onto a broom and dances oddly, his legs rocking back and forth to the guitar. The young man is Elvis Presley. Mrs. Gump leaves and closes the door as Elvis sits back down, and Forrest begins to dance again as Elvis plays and sings. Forrest stands left, looks at himself in a mirror, and continues dancing while watching himself. Mrs. Gump and Forrest walk along a sidewalk and later watch television, where Elvis thrusts his hips and sings. Elvis dances in the same manner Forrest did, while a woman in the audience screams and applauds. Mrs. Gump walks away, pulling Forrest with her, and he stops to take one last look as Elvis continues performing on television. Forrest is still sitting on the bus bench, and a black nurse looks at him. Mrs. Gump and Forrest wait for the school bus, which pulls up as Mrs. Gump prepares Forrest for his first day of school. The bus driver opens the door, looks down, and smokes a cigarette, smiling as Forrest steps up into the bus. Mrs. Gump waves to Forrest as the bus drives away. Forrest begins to walk down the aisle, where two young boys look up from their seat. Forrest looks around while a larger girl slides over so he can't sit next to her, shaking her head. He looks to the other side where a boy sits alone on a larger seat, glaring up at Forrest. Forrest continues talking as he sits on the bus bench. Young Forrest is still standing in the aisle on the bus and looks back at Jenny Curran, a young girl about his age. Forrest sits down next to Jenny, who puts her hand out toward him. Forrest reaches over and shakes her hand. Young Jenny and Forrest run toward a large oak tree. Jenny sits on a large branch and calls down to Forrest, who dangles from the branch. Jenny and Forrest sit on a tree branch and read together. Forrest hangs upside down from a branch and swings back and forth, with his braces wedged in the tree. The silhouette of the oak tree shows Jenny and Forrest as they sit on a branch.",
    "149": "Walker is too entranced by the ceremony and the depth of layered emotions in Gandhi and Ba's voices and eyes to take notes as Ba and Gandhi come near to meeting. Ba takes the last step so that they are face to face, and for a moment, their eyes hold the many dreams, hopes, pain, and love of many years, while Walker watches with his face taut with emotion. Gandhi slowly lifts his hand, and both Walker and Collins, especially the overtly cynical American, are touched. Gandhi turns to them, and then a tiny, beautiful city rises steeply out of the Arabian Sea with buildings whose white walls are tinted amber and gold by the sun. Gandhi sits on a promontory watching the sunrise in solemn meditation and becomes aware of footsteps. He turns to see Walker approaching, a little knapsack over his shoulder, and Gandhi smiles. Walker joins him, looking out over the bay and city, truly impressed, and looks down at Gandhi, who scowls up in the early light. They both watch the waves on the shore a moment, with the changing hues of the sunrise on the city's whites. Gandhi looks out to sea, intercut with images of Walker, the sea, and the town itself in the sun. Walker studies him as Gandhi reaches a profound insight, staring out to sea in reflection. Suddenly, Gandhi's head lifts, his eyes become alert, he feels excitement, and stands, his manner full of optimism. Walker stares at him and then at what Gandhi seems to be looking at, the waves below them. Walker turns back to Gandhi, puzzled, but cannot mistake the glow in Gandhi's face. Gandhi looks at him with a teasing smile, and his grin broadens as he starts briskly down the promontory, with Walker scrambling after him. Gulls fly over them in the growing light, and Gandhi turns from the sea to Walker, his eyes confident and elated, before continuing down the promontory. Still baffled, Walker glances at the sea and follows Gandhi. The waves run against the shore as he looks in astonishment at his principal secretary. His ADC, a general, a brigadier, and a senior police officer are with him, a new team holding the same offices. Irwin looks at him, trying to understand the act's significance, and the senior police officer helps.",
    "893": "Words appear. Wearing 50 black and white striped uniforms, prisoners march in lockstep single file across the dirt, each man holding the shoulders of the man in front. A prison guard in a dark blue overcoat squints at them as they pass, while nearby, one prisoner lies motionless at another guard's feet. The line of prisoners continues away from a wall 30 feet high, with guards on either side of them, as they march toward a stark building, where a smoke stack reaches into the sky. On a dirt road populated by a few rundown establishments, a Nash sedan stops. The driver's door opens and a tall man with bony features steps out wearing a badge. He opens the back door and helps a raven-haired man in handcuffs step out. Both wearing long overcoats, they walk across the street toward the prison. At the middle of a long high wall, a metal entry gate sits under a lookout tower. As they're near the entrance, the officer gives the convict a little shove. The metal gate opens. Just inside, an older guard opens a steel door. As the metal gate closes behind them, the two men pass the guard with no more than a nod from the arriving officer. Inside the prison, an inmate's central room is filled with work benches, each with its own sewing machine. A prisoner with graying temples lifts a box labeled Mayer Thread Company from a stack. As he carries it across the room, he glances at a presiding guard. With slight length, the inmate brings the box past another guard to a work bench. Reaching the bench, he joins a sandy-haired prisoner and sets the box down. They tear off the outer tape. Sitting across from them, a younger inmate glances up. The two men dig through large spools of white thread. They each pull out a gun, and using the spools to conceal them, pass them to the young inmate and a man sitting next to him. They stealthily tuck the weapons in their pants. From the same box, the older inmate and the sandy-haired man retrieve guns of their own. Crossing between two rows of work benches, the sandy-haired man drops a load of shirts concealing his weapon and grabs one of the guards. The younger inmate punches another guard in the face and holds his gun to his throat. A stocky prisoner repeatedly strikes a guard with a pipe as the older inmate follows closely behind. Each of the escaping prisoners leads their hostage to the door. The rest of the befuddled inmates stand at their benches. The younger inmate jabs his captive in the gut. Now the newly arrived convict stands behind his presiding officer and another guard at a door.",

He is holding a ballpoint over the back of a hotel desk blotter. His style cramped by his cast. He struggles with the cast, and then decides to struggle no more. Summoning remarkable strength, he rips a piece from the cast, freeing his hand. He roars ironically, a lion's roar of liberation. He is back at his center. The door opens. Simon enters. Melvin is having a room service breakfast. Carol follows him out. Her arms are filled with the hotel soaps, shampoos, etc. Melvin reacts. Carol looks at Melvin. Simon finishes dialing the phone. He hangs up, totally satisfied with himself and rips over to Carol and Melvin. Carol, a load has been lifted. Melvin stalks out. The car parked near a phone booth. Carol walks up to Simon in the car. She hands him a baseball cap. Melvin hangs up the phone. She shakes her head and walks off. The door opens, revealing them. Simon notices some of his paintings. Simon looking at Melvin with some sympathy. Melvin's two digital clocks are two minutes apart. He sits in a chair still fully dressed. A beat then we hear Simon's whispered voice. As Carol unpacks, she gives gifts to her mother and Spencer. But clearly something gnaws at her psyche. As he speeds him out. She's just broken up with him but she's being nicer than ever. We enter the room carrying Verdell who strains to be allowed closer to Melvin. Simon releases him. He moves for the door. stops suddenly, jolted. walks reluctantly into the apartment house. As Melvin looks at Carol's doorbell with great uncertainty. The windows open, reading one of Melvin's books. hesitates. looks at his watch. Carol in a cotton wrap-around dress/bathrobe.

He bolts for the door and enters. She opens the door. He reaches her side. He half turns to leave. that Beverly, standing near her door down the hallway, has heard at least this last part. Carol has not ever heard anything like that before. Melvin, of course, cannot leave well enough alone. She disappears into her room. She looks at him then. Melvin glances at the cracked pattern of Carol's kitchen linoleum and stalls at the door. They walk quietly. Melvin still walking with his usual attention to where he steps. Melvin walking and though we can see an improvement it is still decidedly strange as he conspicuously avoids stepping on the lines.",
    "1233": "Emily smiles and looks down shyly as Ben shuffles. She gives a little wave as Ben steps outside, and he shoots Emily a last look before shutting the door behind him. Ben goes to his car while Emily watches him through the window. Ben stands, looking out from his patio with breakers crashing on the beach where Sarah waves up to him, and tears roll down Ben's cheeks as he stands looking out to sea. Ben sits on rocks, then opens shutters in his beach house, fingers a rope of pearls, and studies a photo of himself and Sarah. He cleans his beach house, then sits glumly among a stack of packed boxes. Ben drives his car sedately along the wide and winding coast road, bathed in sunshine. At a motel, the receptionist, Larry, helps Ben carry gear to his room, where Ben uses a small hose to fill up a large cylindrical fish tank that Larry was carrying. Light from the tank illuminates Ben's face as he stands in the darkness, seemingly lost in thought. Ben, as a boy, gazes in awe into a tank of jellyfish with spindly, long tentacles; the jellyfish move hypnotically, with the glowing specter-like creatures drifting through the water, as he watches spellbound with his palms pressed against the tank. In the present, Michelle's husband, Dan, watches a box jellyfish in adult Ben's tank as Ben writes, signs a document, throws a notebook at Dan, and taps his own temple. Dan's expression darkens, and he edgily wipes his mouth, then his eyes. He glares at Ben and falters before he starts to speak and paces the motel room tearfully. Ben enters a crowded waiting room full of women and children, standing and staring across at a bespectacled middle-aged woman sitting in a glass-fronted office. Her mouth drops open when she sees him, and Ben waves to her and smiles. The woman hurries out to him, and Holly hugs him tightly before stepping back. Holly keeps a photo of herself and Ben on her desk in the open-plan office. Ben sits with her as Holly's eyes glisten with tears while she stares at him; he eyes her steadily and smiles faintly. She considers and looks at him reassuringly. In a dilapidated area, Ben sits in his car watching a house. Connie cleans a window of the house, and Ben approaches the window and smiles at Connie, who opens the front door but not the wrought iron screen door before letting him in. A little boy of about eight and a slightly older girl are in the living room, playing cards and listening as Ben sits down, and the children listen as they play.",
    "972": "David walks on, and they accompany him. David eyes the boyish officer who promptly closes his map book, and under David’s unwavering gaze, Richardson frowns a little. David crosses the street to a bistro, while the boyish aide checks his book. The Adjustment officers watch David stride briskly outside. Now, David stands by the curb and hails an approaching cab, but its roof light switches to off duty as it drives by. David tries again, but a mini-van taxi ignores him. David jogs out into the opposite lane, waving high for another cab that passes him up. Richardson and his aide stand casually by as David jogs away, and they swap a thoughtful look. In his dress shoes, David sprints after a cab, and as the cabbie waves and slows, a sedan crashes into his passenger side. David runs over to the damaged cars, glances to the sedan driver who checks the bloody-faced cabbie, and then checks on the other driver. David makes a call and goes to another cop, but the rebuffed cop looks to Richardson, then walks away. They both look aside, but find no one. David strides off, leaving an ambulance and a squad car behind. He checks his watch, takes a few more brisk steps, then breaks into a run. A taxi stops, and as they near a traffic light, it changes from green to red, and the surrounding cars stop. A man and a woman in the crosswalk scurry out of their way. David sees Richardson and his aide emerge from a door, and the taxi leaves the Adjustment Bureau servants behind. In a pub, the officers detour through a side door which ports them to a street, and the hostess hurries after them, but finds only a coat closet. The Bureau officers try a residential door, but find Central Park on the other side. They race up the steps of a townhouse, and as David's cab cruises through another intersection, the Bureau officers run through an art gallery, bumping a bystander. Heading outside, they see David exit the cab and enter a building. Richardson's hat blows off, and as Richardson enters, David opens a door and sees Elise executing a graceful sidestep. Richardson catches his breath and makes eye contact with David as the boyish aide hands him a cellphone. As Richardson walks off, David's gaze returns to Elise, who partners with a man holding her waist in one hand. Elise balances on one foot, bends over, and briefly flutters her other foot high behind her. As the male dancer dips in a far stepping lunge, Elise rolls fluidly over his back. David enters the studio, and outside, Richardson walks beside a marble facade, pulls open a brass lobby door, and disappears into a midcentury high-rise, its windows' numbers in the hundreds ascending into the sky, story after story after story.",
    "152": "A little band of drummers and flute players suddenly begins to play as the crowd starts to jump up to see, and the flower petals begin to float in the sky. Gandhi and the procession of marchers and ashramites stride down the dusty road toward them, accompanied by a newsreel truck and crew riding along about two-thirds of the way back, followed by a car of cameramen and reporters at the end. Gandhi looks at Walker, walking a few paces behind him at the side of the procession, wiping sweat from his face. Gandhi smiles, turns back, shakes his head, and grins as he passes by the policemen and into the cheers of the crowd. As the procession trails into the village, several villagers with knapsacks or bundles strung over their shoulders run around the police and join the end of the procession. Gandhi stands in the center of the wildly cheering crowd as the camera pulls back and back, and the shot becomes black and white while we hear the music of Movietone News. With that, we see the Movietone Music tag, and as the film fades, the lights go up on a couple of civil servants moving about to raise the window shades while Lord Irwin stares at the blank screen set up in his office, surrounded by the general, the brigadier, the senior police officer, Irwin's ADC, and the principal secretary. The two men who ran the projector quietly dismantle it. Finally, Irwin turns to the senior police officer, who fidgets but answers the implied questions, as Irwin sighs and nods. For the first time, Irwin is truly angry, and his face falls. Meanwhile, men, women, and children are making little paper packets of salt from piles heaped along long tables. A group of policemen barge into the room, knocking tables, salt, and paper in every direction with their lathis, and seize some of the volunteers for arrest. In the chaos, an old man calmly picks up a piece of paper from the floor, a handful of salt, and folds another packet. Nehru is on the back of a big open truck that is stationary in the street, loaded with boxes containing salt packets, and he and eight or nine others are selling them to the people who flock about the truck. The sound of horses is heard, and Nehru lifts his head as mounted Indian police come down either side of the street, a wave of foot police running forward down the center. Some of the people run, while others deliberately stand fast as the mounted police converge on the truck. Nehru is grabbed and hurled so that he half falls, half leaps to the street, and one of the men with him is knocked along the ground by a policeman.",
    "453": "As he says that, a R.O.U.S comes flying at him from off-screen. The thing's teeth sink deep into his arm. Westley drives a fist into the beast's face, rolling it off. He reaches for his sword just a few feet away, but the R.O.U.S is back atop him. It's a fierce battle, and just when we think Westley can't possibly win, he flips the ugly rodent clear. Westley scrambles for his sword. The R.O.U.S. stampedes on, changing its target, heading right for Buttercup, and she's scared to death. And from somewhere they summon strength, pick up their pace, and as they reach the edge of the Fire Swamp, something we hadn't expected: Humperdinck on his horse, Rugen beside him. Three warriors, armed and ready, are mounted in formation behind. They stop. Buttercup looks beyond exhaustion. Westley looks worse. Behind Humperdinck are the waters of the bay. Westley and Buttercup are staring out at the others. Buttercup, looking from one to the other; then something else catches her eye, and we see an armed warrior, in shadow, with a loaded crossbow aimed at Westley's heart. Buttercup looks the other way. Another warrior has a crossbow aimed at Westley. Buttercup frantically stares around, and now a third warrior, crossbow stretched and ready to shoot, is hidden in a tree blocking any escape Westley might try. Humperdinck whirls to face her. Westley also whirls to face her. Buttercup talks to them both. Buttercup and Westley stare deep into each other's eyes. Westley is dazed. Buttercup tries to speak again, can't, and is swooped off her feet onto Humperdinck's horse, and off they go. Westley stares after her. Rugen watches as his warriors bring Westley to him. The Count has a heavy sword and holds it in his hand. Westley looks at him. Count Rugen clubs Westley hard across the skull. Westley starts to fall—the screen goes black. Dank and chill, underground and windowless, lit by flickering torches. Frightening. Westley lies in the center of the cage, chained and helpless. Dead pale, he silently enters the pit, carrying a tray of food and medication. He puts it down and begins tending Westley's wounds. Westley winces. From the Albino: a nod. From the Albino: a shake of the head. He studies Westley, whose face is almost sad. Buttercup's face is also sad. Pallid, perhaps ill, she wanders down a corridor in Florin Castle. As she moves unseeing past an intersecting corridor, Prince Humperdinck and Count Rugen watch her as they move on. The camera holds on it while we hear the Grandfather's voice reading. And if we thought it was packed before, we didn't know how many more could fit in this courtyard. Humperdinck, Rugen, and the Queen stand high on the balcony.",
    "1150": "The scene starts with a spider that lands on a desk and then on a boy's head before crawling up a girl's arm. Moody flicks his wand, making the spider hover over Ron, and then it drops into Ron's hair. The spider clamps itself on Draco's face and hits the glass. Controlled by Moody's wand, the spider hovers helplessly over a bucket of water before Moody directs it to the palm of his hand. Neville puts up his hand and steps towards the table as the spider writhes in agony. Neville looks distraught, with his face twisted in anger. Hermione cries out, and Moody lowers his wand, withdrawing the curse. Neville's eyes are tight shut, and his face is clammy. Moody places the spider in front of Hermione, who shakes her head. A flash of green light occurs, and the spider dies. Moody's mad eye swivels to stare at Harry, who looks up warily. Moody nervously licks his lips and takes a swig from his hip flask, while Harry regards him thoughtfully. Leaving the classroom, Ron follows Hermione and Harry down a circular stone staircase, and Moody appears as they spot a sad figure. Neville reluctantly follows Moody back up the stairs. Rain runs like tears down the face of a woman in a stained-glass window, and students splash across the courtyard with cloaks over their heads to protect themselves from the rain. The goblet of fire stands in the great hall, and eligible students cross the circle of light around it, placing their names into the blue flame. Cedric Diggory's supporters push him forward, and he steps through the circle to put his name into the goblet, while Ron gives him an encouraging wave. Fred and George run into the hall in triumph, swallow the contents of a test tube, and jump inside the circle to put their names into the goblet but are engulfed in blue flames and flung out of the circle with white hair and long, white beards. They grapple with each other, rolling over on the stone floor. Hermione shakes her head, sits on the stone steps, and opens a book. Accompanied by a Durmstrang student and their teacher, Karkaroff, Viktor Krum approaches the circle confidently, with a serious look, and puts his name into the goblet, catching Hermione's eye as he turns away. She gives him a faint, admiring smile. The students assemble excitedly in the great hall as Dumbledore raises his hand, causing the flames of the burning torches around the hall to gradually die down one by one, and everyone looks expectant. Dumbledore approaches the goblet of fire with his arm outstretched as the blue flame turns red, and a piece of charred parchment flutters down into his hand.",
    "283": "Jeff's eyes are staring intently at the backyard over the coffee cup, then stray upward as he puts it down. Stella turns and walks into the kitchen, and Jeff's eyes move down again. Abstractedly, his hand reaches for a piece of bacon, but he pushes the food away and picks up the coffee cup instead. Miss Torso, in a ballet outfit, is hanging up a small wash consisting mostly of lingerie on a clothesline while doing her inevitable leg practice. Jeff appears to be getting a bit listless or bored from constantly watching Thorwald's apartment, so his eyes wander around the neighborhood and end up looking toward the newlywed's apartment. He smiles affectionately and starts to turn away, but something startles him, and he looks quickly back as the shade goes up in the newlywed's apartment. The young husband, wearing only pajama bottoms because of the heat, leans on the windowsill, looking out with satisfaction, revealing he is a well-muscled, attractive young man. Jeff's head snaps toward the center of his window as Stella appears behind his wheelchair. Two men in tan coveralls stand outside Thorwald's door, one of them carrying a clipboard. Thorwald's hair is disheveled, and he is unshaved. He opens the door, admits the two men after a short exchange, and leaves it open behind them. Stella and Jeff watch intently as Jeff feels alongside his wheelchair for his binoculars. A close view shows the men carrying a trunk across Thorwald's living room toward the corridor. Jeff lowers the binoculars quickly, turns over his shoulder to watch Stella as she moves toward the door. She calls back to him while already going up the steps. The salesman speaks to the operator, while Jeff lowers the binoculars and takes a normal view of the alleyway, momentarily blocked by a freight truck. After the trucks part, only the back half of the freight truck is visible before it pulls out of sight. The hood and cab of the truck are seen as another truck moves across from the left. Jeff quickly raises the binoculars, holding them just in time to see a puffing and blowing Stella arrive at the opening of the alleyway. Another truck crosses from the left by the time the binoculars are up.",
    "722": "Snoop Dog glides into a room where the remains of a wooden bed lie collapsed on the floor. Another eel swims past a porcelain bathtub as Snoop Dog pivots toward a broken door lying in the silt. The bearded man grasps the two joysticks as Snoop Dog extends a pair of mechanical claws to move the door aside, uncovering a square object. The brown-haired man squints as he studies a video monitor, and the silt settles to reveal an unopened safe. On the ocean surface, a research vessel outfitted with cranes plucks the submersibles out of the water, and men cheer as a winch raises a net holding the safe to the surface. Lewis uncorks a bottle of champagne and sprays everyone while a crewman opens the safe with a cutting wheel. A man pulls off the door, unleashing a flood of muddy water. As a cameraman films him, Brock kneels and pulls out wads of sodden papers, removes a muddy ledger, and tosses it aside before emptying the safe, scowling as he stands. Later, Brock takes a phone call while nearby lab techs clean the muddy papers, revealing a sketch of a woman reclining on a settee, wearing a large pendant around her neck. Brock studies a photograph of a pendant necklace with a heart-shaped gem, the same necklace the woman in the drawing is wearing. Elsewhere, in a home, a young, long-haired woman walks past a small dog as she carries teacups to a table, and in an adjoining sunroom, a white-haired woman uses a pottery wheel. Leaning on a cane, the older woman steps toward a small television set in a nearby kitchen. Brock stands on the research area using a satellite phone. Holding the small white dog on her lap, Rose and the young woman ride inside a helicopter as it flies out to the research ship, where Brock and Lewis move to a railing as the helicopter approaches. They move towards the landing pad as the helicopter touches down, and a crewman unloads several suitcases and a large trunk. Rose shakes Brock's hand, and the long-haired woman smiles and pushes Rose away in a wheelchair. A man aboard the helicopter hands a fishbowl to Brock. Later, Rose sets framed photographs beside the fishbowl. In the lab, Rose peers down at the clean sketch resting in a container of clear liquid, then closes her eyes. A blonde man with a few stray locks over his eyes sketches the drawing. Rose smiles as she picks up the silver hand mirror, turns the mirror in her hands, catching her own reflection in the cracked glass, sets down the mirror, and examines other objects. She picks up a silver and glass hair comb adorned with an ornamental insect with outstretched wings.",
    "587": "A cassette labeled Soul Funk number two plays on the stereo as Whip lies back with a pack of ice on his knee. He picks up a glass of whiskey as Nicole, fresh from taking a shower, exits the bathroom. She picks up a cushion and, carrying the pillow, walks to Whip, kneels down beside him, and removes the ice pack from his knee. She lifts his leg and places the cushion under it and massages his knee. Whip is laid back in the armchair watching as Nicole's hands move up to cover his hand. He raises the glass as if to take a drink but stops midway. Nicole hesitates, her gaze steady on him; then she takes the glass from his hand and sets it carefully on the nearby table. She pushes herself towards him and they kiss. They look into each other's eyes and their lips meet again. The next morning Whip watches Nicole as she briefly stirs in her sleep; then Whip looks up and rises off the bed. Outside, Hugh gets out of a car. Whip steps onto the veranda holding his cane and a gun. Hugh partially raises his hands. Hugh and Whip climb a platform near the church where a small congregation listens to a sermon in a cordoned off area. Hugh takes a pair of binoculars and watches a woman step out of a black SUV. Whip watches as reporters and officials wander around the wreckage and then clenches his jaw. Carr stands at the far end of the large conference table opposite Charlie, then pushes through the double glass doors and walks towards Whip, who stands. Whip forces a smile and drinks straight from a whiskey bottle. He watches a home video of his father and son playing football. Nicole walks in the door and watches him. He increases the volume on the TV. Nicole has not moved since she walked in and watches Whip try to stand, and then, fall. He lies prone on the carpet; Nicole covers her mouth with her hand as Whip has passed out. Nicole removes the cigarette from his fingers and adjusts his head so he can breathe easily. Nicole covers Whip with a blanket, then turns off the video and switches off the light. Nicole sits in a chair on the veranda taking pictures as Whip steps out in a bathrobe and ambles toward her. He sits in a rocking chair, smiles at her, places a cigarette in his mouth and picks up her camera. He picks up a book from the coffee table between them, points to some open land, and Nicole puffs on her cigarette and nods. Whip points the camera at her. At a church, a large framed picture of Katerina stands surrounded by flowers as a coffin is carried out.",
    "862": "In a series of events, a man drops a tray and quickly picks it up as he runs from a church. Valjean is then brought back to the church, where the bishop, noticing this, hands him two candlesticks and places his hand on Valjean's head. A tomb with carvings of two Christified figures is nearby as Valjean kneels at the altar with papers in his hand, and blood stains his temple where he was hit. Having walked away from the altar, he returns to it, sinking to his knees before striding out of the church, ripping his papers to shreds as he goes to the far corner of the churchyard, throwing the pieces into the air. The church, located in a walled village on a hill, witnesses a piece of paper flying high into the air towards the sun. Meanwhile, Javert, in uniform, rides in the rain ahead of four other horsemen as they enter the city. In a dark cobbled slum, a woman takes the wrapped body of a child from a weeping mother, while in a factory, a worker snatches a note from Fantine, who tries to retrieve it. Valjean, now clean-shaven with dark neatly trimmed hair and smartly dressed to look like a gentleman, glances up to see Javert gazing down at the factory floor, which unnerves Valjean, causing him to walk away from the women. The foreman throws Fantine onto the street, flinging coins at her. In a courtyard, Valjean sees another uniformed horseman accompanying Javert, who paces inside an office. Valjean slowly makes his way up the stairs, and the two men bow to one another. Javert removes his hat and hands a paper to Valjean, who in turn gives Javert a rosary, prompting Javert to lower his gaze. They rush out onto the cobbled street where a man is trapped under a cart, and Valjean crouches beside him as Javert watches. Valjean grimaces but manages to lift the cart off the trapped man, which makes Javert's eyes narrow. After dropping the shaft, Javert hesitates, then bows his head and turns away. Later, Fantine walks quickly along the streets, passing people standing in the darkness, while tightly wrapping a shawl around her. She stops and stares forlornly before passing a man smoking a long pipe and seated women, then approaches a scruffy man. Fantine's sleek, long dark hair is cut, and she is held down as a tooth extractor is pushed into her mouth. A silver-haired man appears, and Fantine drinks from a small bottle, placing her hand in a man's who is wearing a captain's hat. The captain then pushes her down, turns her over, and slowly raises the hem of her dress.",
    "308": "Lenny is strapped onto a metal bed, his arms and legs in tight leather restraints. Evan sighs and gives up. Evan is ignored by several Theta Chi pledges as he plops himself by a tree and hunts through his journal to find the entry from when he was seven and visited Jason at Sunnyvale. Seven-year-old Evan comes to during the time he first met his father, Jason. Jason launches himself across the table, shackles and all, and grabs hold of Evan's throat. Evan's hands instinctively reach for his throat, then he realizes his surroundings. Evan eats in the same diner where Kayleigh used to work. As he eats, his arm sits in front of his plate, protectively guarding his food. Evan slowly walks up the driveway, which is now a dilapidated mess. Garbage litters the front lawn and paint chips rot off the sides of the house. In a blur, Evan grabs Mr. Miller's shirt and violently shoves him through the house and into a wall. Mr. Miller goes slack, his eyes wide with horror. Evan walks past some junkies and enters, stepping over some passed out bodies that litter the hallway of an incredibly seedy motel. He knocks on a door, and Kayleigh, now a haggard, strung-out junkie, opens the door and immediately the contempt for Evan grows in her eyes. She looks around, waves him in. The room is dirty and sparse, excepting charred-bottom spoons, yellowed cotton balls, and brown-spotted squares of tin foil. His eyes begin to water. Kayleigh eyes the wallet, opens Evan's wallet, and leaves a twenty on the table. She gets up, puts on her coat, tosses his wallet over her shoulder at him, and leaves. Evan enters his familiar looking dorm and hears the familiar sounds of Thumper having sex with another naked gothic co-ed on Evan's bed. Evan's temper flares, and he picks up a chair and smashes it against a wall above Thumper's head. Thumper and the co-ed quickly cover themselves in the blankets and leave. Mrs. Halpern, startled, stares at the young kid skeptically as she absently continues toward the mailbox. Lenny comes running across the street to Evan's aid, and Tommy shrugs and follows after him. Tommy takes a running dive at Mrs. Halpern, perhaps a bit too hard, and sends her and the baby to the pavement, hurt, but with no major injuries. Seeing things are safe, Evan backs away from the mail. The blast is deafening, and Evan's body is hurled backwards dramatically. Evan comes to back in his dorm, the same posters are on the wall, the sheets are the same. Evan yawns, bringing his hand to his mouth, but there's no hand. We see countless and brief image flashes of Evan growing up from the age of thirteen with no arms.",
    "883": "Mary prepares to play, and the men quickly take their places opposite their partners; as the music starts, the ladies curtsy and the men bow, while a group of onlookers gather. Mrs. Bennet turns to glare at her husband as the men stand in one line with the ladies opposite them, briefly touching hands as they move around the other dancers. Mrs. Gardiner crosses the room and sees Charlotte and Jane sitting down; Charlotte is busy chatting with someone, but Jane looks quietly upset. Later, the girl with red hair is standing with Wickham as Charlotte and Lizzie look on. Wickham smiles at Lizzie as he takes the girl's hand and leads her down through the column of dancers; Lizzie smiles back at him, then turns to look at Charlotte, who has a serious expression on her face. Lizzie turns her attention back to the dance floor where the red-haired girl is eyeing Wickham coyly. Charlotte grabs Lizzie's arm as Mary King continues to dance with Wickham, smiling contentedly. Winter has arrived, and the ground outside Longbourn is crisp with a white layer of frost, while Lizzie reads a letter; Jane walks out, then is sitting looking out of her window. A carriage pulls up, and Caroline gets out, then climbs back into her carriage, which sets off down the street as Jane stares dolefully out of her window. Back at Longbourn, Lizzie lowers her sister's letter with a pained expression. It's a mild, sunny day, and Lizzie is taking a walk in a field near Longbourn. She wanders past post and rail fencing surrounding an old oak tree, idly toying with a leafy twig, and as she reaches the grounds of Longbourn, she tosses the twig away and wanders up the graveled driveway to the house, with a pensive, yet carefree air, her face framed by the straw brim of her gold-colored bonnet. Lydia comes running out to meet her in the garden, and they continue on past the gardener, who's busily pruning a bush; Lizzie casually reaches out to a branch above her head and pulls off a leaf. Indoors, Mr. Bennet is reading. Hearing a noise from the hall, he looks up from his book to see trunks being moved and Lizzie standing in her coat and bonnet. She comes in to see him, goes over to him, and he takes her hand and kisses it. He watches her leave with an endearing smile, then goes back to his book. Lizzie is sharing her carriage with Maria and Sir William Lucas as the horse-drawn carriage continues on past the green canopy of trees. Eventually, it pulls through the gates and into the drive of a sizable, ivy-clad house, where Mr. Collins and Charlotte hurry out to meet them as Lizzie, Maria, and Sir William emerge from the cab.",
    "287": "Thorwald completes his call and returns to the bedroom with a handbag, which he slides under a pile of coats on the bed. Footsteps approach Jeff's apartment, and as he lowers his camera lens, Lisa stands silhouetted in the doorway, black-lighted by the corridor lights. Jeff, with his back more toward the neighborhood, is initially turned toward her but abruptly turns back to the window as Lisa dashes behind him. The lights are out in Thorwald's bedroom, and he pours himself a drink in the living room, looking down into the garden nonchalantly before stopping quickly. Jeff turns back to the window, and Thorwald puts down his unfinished drink, goes to the door, turns off the light in the living room, and exits. He walks briskly down the corridor while Jeff picks up the long-focus lens and trains it on the street intersection as Lisa moves toward him. As Lisa turns on the lights in the apartment, it's revealed she is wearing an extravagantly beautiful dress. Jeff turns to face the room, talking as Lisa animatedly moves, and Jeff watches her pace with an oversized handbag prominently on the table. The camera closes in as Lisa stops and faces Jeff, then eases back as she comes over to him with sparkling eyes and tense concentration. Jeff pulls her into his lap, and she puts her arms around him, appearing very happy as she kisses his cheek. Jeff moves back to look her in the eye, there's a pause, and she cuts him off with a series of kisses. Lisa then gets up, laughs, goes to the handbag on the table, and returns to sit in Jeff's lap, displaying the bag's contents. It is a Mark Cross ladies 'attache' case, opened to reveal a compact set of pajamas, slippers, toothbrush, toothpaste, and other necessities for a comfortable overnight stay.",
    "416": "The car coasts silently to a stop in front of the Robinson house. They sit there for a long time without saying anything, Ben's hand touching her shoulder. There is a squeal of tires as Ben almost drives off the road. Ben and Elaine enter the lobby and stand just inside the door. They start in a few steps. One of the car parkers passes them on his way out. The camera begins to pull up and away. A bellboy passes them. The room clerk smiles at them. Ben and Elaine stop a few feet into the center of the lobby. The camera pulls back to a high overhead shot revealing many people moving back and forth in the lobby, passing Ben and Elaine. Ben brings Elaine through the door to the porch. Ben and Elaine are in his car. He takes his hand off the ignition, jams on the accelerator, and drives the car speedily for twenty-one feet and jams on the brakes. He turns off the ignition and the lights. He puts his head down on the steering wheel. He lifts his head. She nods. He turns the key in the ignition and starts the car. He freezes with his hand still on the key. He turns off the engine. He starts the car and drives out. It is raining. On the seat beside Ben is a package. From the way it is wrapped, we can tell it is a gift. Ben's right hand is on it as he drives past Ben and through the windshield as the Robinson house comes closer and closer. The front door of the Robinson house opens and Mrs. Robinson comes out, dressed in a housecoat, and, in four or five fast steps, reaches the car, opens the door on the passenger side, and climbs in. Ben starts the car forward down the driveway as they drive. Ben stops the car in front of a house halfway down the block. There is a pause while Ben looks at her expression. Then he grabs the keys out of the ignition, opens the door on his side, and jumps out of the car, carrying the package. Track with Ben as he runs up the street and up the driveway toward the Robinson house. Ben gets to the front door. Ben runs up the stairs. He still carries the package. Ben gets to the top just as Elaine comes out of the door to her bedroom. She is wearing a skirt and slip and carrying one shoe. Ben pushes her back into her room. Ben turns and looks. Mrs. Robinson is just entering the house. He holds her against the wall in the corner. Back in the corner.",
    "913": "Two other women sit at a table, with one writing and the other looking out the window, while a large man in suspenders peers through the blinds, then turns away and hurries out of the room. Outside, Dillinger and his men step out of their car, greeted by a young blonde woman, whom Dillinger grins at and kisses before they head inside. Later, in a garage, Dillinger sits across from a gunsmith who is disassembling a Tommy gun, removing the trigger handle and pulling out a coil. Outside the window behind the gunsmith, two cars arrive as Red steps out of the safe house. Dillinger glances at the door where the blonde nods to him, prompting him to get up and leave the garage. As Dillinger crosses to the house, he tosses a set of keys to Pete, who joins Red to inspect the new cars. Inside, Dillinger enters the kitchen where a man leans against the refrigerator and a woman smokes at the table. Dillinger washes his hands, hands the man a stuffed envelope, goes around the table, and kisses the woman's cheek before leaving the kitchen. Three men in fedoras and overcoats ascend a wide staircase with two center railings separating them. At the top, Dillinger stops to scan a huge bank with angular walls lined with pillars, then his two cohorts split off. Pete approaches a guard, bashes his face, and knees him in the gut. With Tommy gun in hand, Dillinger gracefully hurtles a counter and grabs a middle-aged man, rips the back of his collar, and parades the bank president around the counter and across the floor, passing a trembling customer. Dillinger pushes the president forward to a metal gate as one of his men collects cash from a teller. The president sorts keys, but Dillinger smacks him in the head with his pistol and points it in his face, prompting the president to return to the door. A robber elbows open a teller cage while the teller frantically gathers cash. Pete hops up on the counter, aiming his machine gun. Outside, Homer discreetly holds a rifle at his side, sees an arriving police car, and backs into a recess by a set of double doors, knocking with the butt of his rifle. Inside the bank, Dillinger waits as the president fills a sack with money from the safe. In a getaway car, Red checks the time on a pocket watch, then drives away. As policemen run across the street toward the bank, Red's car approaches, and Homer casually glances over. Inside, Dillinger pushes the president forward, notices a few dollars in change on the counter, and faces the customer it belongs to.",
    "1019": "A shower with steamy glass doors obscures the view of a couple having sex. As the woman gets out, her partner follows. A title appears with an arrow pointing at the woman's face. The man then opens the door and finds an adolescent girl with a massive golden-brown curl sleeping face-down in bed. In a t-shirt and boxers, he lumbers over to the bed and lightly touches her arm. As she lies unresponsive, he barrages her with lazy slaps, and she reaches a hand out. He kisses her cheek. Later, he lies close to a little blonde girl and kisses her cheek, then carries her down the hall. The older girl makes bacon and scrambled eggs as her father brings in big, colorful balloons. He sneaks some bacon, drinks OJ from the plastic jug, and eats a cupcake. His youngest sets off a confetti shooter. In another room, the wife and mother sits at a window with a towel over her hair and smokes a cigarette with a latex-gloved hand. Meanwhile, her family hangs streamers, sets out presents, and puts candles shaped like the number 38 on a cake. Putting the cigarette out, she uncovers her hair, removes the glove, pops gum in her mouth, pats her face and hands with a wipe, and sprays herself with perfume. She then leans into the kitchen, and the youngest shoots confetti. She blows out her birthday candles. Later, the girls sit on a couch a few yards from the kitchen island where their parents relax. Sayid stabs his older companion. Their father takes a cup of berries to the sink and faces his wife, running water over the cupcake. Now in the room, the younger daughter plays a larger keyboard, while her sister throws clothes at a closet. Wearing biking gear, he kisses her goodbye then sneaks over to the kitchen sink, extracting the cupcake from a soggy bed of scrambled eggs, and unwraps the tainted treat. He glances toward the open front door, then takes a bite. A lanky man leads the woman and a plump brunette up an outdoor flight of stairs at a brisk jog, with the brunette lagging behind. A goateed man bicycles with the father, and a car darts out and nearly hits them. His wife does crunches as the plump woman bounces on a stability ball. Barb's features pinch up, and he affects a lonely, pitiful gaze in a coffeehouse where Pete gives an earnest nod. In an SUV, he sings to his wife. Her sister grabs at the tablet. In a shopping district, as Debbie approaches Jodi, Pete smiles at stunning Desi, who works on a ladder, while Jodi nods behind her large, round glasses.",
    "930": "Mathis hands him an envelope. Tousle-headed Bond puts down his champagne glass and heads back to the bedroom. He kisses her naked back. She smiles and turns her face towards him. He pulls her back down onto a bed. DJ plays under a full moon. Trays are being served and cocktails sipped. A Range Rover pulls up at the entrance. Bond gets out, accompanied by Fields in a glamorous black and gold dress. He moves through the press of glamorous party-goers. He shakes another hand. CIA agent Felix watches from a sofa. They look down from a stone balustrade. She kisses him and he shoves her hard against the crumbling stonework. The thin German arrives. Fields passes. The CIA men are sitting together. He belts up as he goes around to the driver's side of the Range Rover. Motorcyclists follow them. He parks the car. The two motorcycle cops pull up behind. Bond hands over his license to the cop who is wearing dark glasses at night. As he opens it, the cop draws. Mathis is lying in the trunk. Bond pulls the unconscious man out. With his colleague’s gun, throws the other down, calmly shoots him and empties the gun and tosses it aside. Bond cradles him in his arms. Camille watches them. His head slumps against Bond's shoulder. Expressionlessly, Bond feels for a pulse. Camille shifts uneasily. He drops the body in a dumpster, removes Mathis’ wallet from his jacket, takes out the cash, and tosses the wallet aside. They walk off, leaving the body slumped amid the rubbish bags in the dumpster. The Range Rover heads down a desert highway. M stares coldly. The Range Rover drives through the dusty, barren. It arrives at a small airstrip. The man, in a leather jacket and brimmed hat, is. He turns as Bond his jacket to cover a bloodstain on his shirt. Bond looks at an old propeller transport plane as Camille gets out of the car. The ageing DC-3 Dakota lumbers down the runway, raising a cloud of dust in it. The man in a hat is already on the phone as the old plane takes to the air. A fighter streaks past them and banks for another pass. Bond puts the plane into the dive, working the controls furiously as the fighter loops to get behind them. The fighter streaks in. Bond flies down into a valley. Camille looks alarmed, and Bond concentrates hard as they skim the valley floor. He lowers the undercarriage. They hit the ground hard. He pulls the throttle back open. The fighter hurtles down the valley after them, perilously close to a rocky outcrop. Fields gets out of her seat and moves down the plane's fuselage.",
    "1194": "Barely visible, a Golden Snitch flutters past. Lightning sets the broomstick of a Gryffindor player on fire. Wearing goggles as protection from the rain, Harry swoops past the stand where the professors follow the action. He keeps close behind the Hufflepuff seeker as they both spot the Golden Snitch. As Diggory reaches out to grab it, lightning catapults him backwards on his broomstick. Harry peers into the hazy clouds. Looming above him, they form the menacing shape of a huge, black dog. He hovers for a moment until the Golden Snitch appears in front of him. He makes a grab for it but it zooms sharply away. Harry swerves back to follow it. As he reaches out, thick ice begins to form on the handle of his broomstick. He shakes his head as his goggles freeze over. An ominous black shape flaps past, a lost umbrella tossed by the ferocious wind. Ghastly figures swirl towards him out of the lowering storm clouds. Harry finds himself surrounded by hooded Dementors. He twists and turns to avoid them. He is catapulted backwards. A Dementor looms over Harry and opens its great mouth as if to suck his energy. Harry loses his grip on the broomstick and falls, helplessly, down through the clouds. Spectators watch in horror as he hurtles towards the ground. Dumbledore uses a spell to break his fall. The hospital wing. Harry opens his eyes. Harry's snowy owl, Hedwig, flies along the valley. The bird approaches the school in a heavy snowstorm and sails past the clock tower. Behind the clock face, Harry looks down as his friends set off without him to visit Hogsmeade. Footprints appear in the snow. The Weasley twins, Fred and George, grab Harry under his invisibility cloak. He taps the blank parchment with his wand. Harry opens the map. The images disappear. A heavy fleck stone slowly rises. Harry finds himself in the cellar at Honeydukes. Wearing his invisibility cloak, he climbs a wooden staircase. Honeydukes' busy sweet shop is full of Hogwarts students choosing confectionary. Neville's red lollipop is snatched from his hand and flips out into the street. Ron and Hermione are close to a shabby house. A snowball hits Malfoy. Another snowball flies out of the forest. Malfoy and his cronies look around for their invisible attacker. One loses his trousers. Another is swung round by his scarf. Malfoy is dragged by his feet towards the Shrieking Shack. Malfoy scrambles to his feet and runs away, followed by his cronies. Harry becomes visible. Ron and Hermione follow his footprints to the pub, but are not allowed inside. Harry looks shocked. He leaves the pub. Hermione sees his footprints. A group of elves are knocked aside.",
    "84": "The scene opens with the bottom of the stairs visible as John gasps, peering upward. Preacher looks at John, who sinks onto the edge of a chair as Preacher sits opposite. A bar of light from the door falls across Preacher's face, and John reacts with a questioning helplessness. John remains still, realizes his own folly, covers his mouth with his hand, and looks up at Preacher, then stiffens, relaxes, and chuckles softly. John starts for the stairs, which vibrate and move out of shot with the sound of a receding engine, disclosing Icey's skirts in the background. They appear spic-and-span, even wearing shoes, and wave bewilderedly after the car. She hustles out of the shot as his hand clamps over her mouth. She struggles and whimpers. His hand rises as she puts out her own, expecting a loving hand-clasp, but Preacher points to the window. Startled, then tender, she moves to adjust the shade, always looking toward the bed, smiling maternally. As the shot pulls back and pans into a full shot of the bed, she approaches, sits on the edge, and slips off her mules while Preacher turns, his back to her, with a sounding of bedsprings. His voice is quiet and cold as Willa puts her face down on the pillow and moans. Preacher snaps on a harsh bare bulb in the center of the room; she obeys. Willa hesitates, walks to the mirror, meets her image, her head dropping. In a head close-up, Willa is seen with the bulb hanging at the center, and Preacher, in his nightshirt, stands beyond it. Her mouth trembles, unable to speak, merely opening her mouth. He watches her for a moment, then snaps off the light and gets into bed. Willa, in darkness, remains motionless, folds her hands in prayer, and lifts her eyes. It lies face-down on the arbor bricks, back wide open, money spilling out as a little breeze toys with it, alongside the sound of snipping heard off-screen. The camera tilts upward to a view where she, at the end of the grape-arbor, finishes cutting a skirted paper doll out of a hundred-dollar bill and lays it beside a male hundred-dollar paper doll, which she pats. Pearl starts guiltily, looks toward him, scrambling the money together as John's footsteps are heard off-screen. As he stoops toward her, dumb with horror, she continues gathering the money. He stands at the far end of the arbor, where Preacher's watch-chain gleams. The shot slowly closes down on it until stillness as the paper dolls blow past him. John starts to laugh uncontrollably, experiencing a helpless reaction, and he holds his hands out to her. She comes to his lap, dropping her doll at his feet.",
    "141": "Sir George is staring out of the window, vexed, bristling but defensive as he picks up one of the papers irritatedly, the London Daily Chronicle; he looks at Sir Edward and sighs heavily. Sir Edward stares back, then drops the paper back on his desk, and Sir George looks from him to Sir Edward, then at the document on the secretary's desk. The secretary turns it slowly so it is facing him, and Sir George looks at it like a snake. The secretary picks up a pen and offers it; after a second, Sir George takes the pen and signs angrily. Meanwhile, Sir Edward is at the liquor cabinet and turns, offering Sir George a whiskey in a finely cut glass of crystal. Gandhi grins, dismissing the formality and again grins at the extravagance, followed by a polite little laugh. Jinnah introduces him, and Gandhi makes the pranam, studying him with interest after that comment, while Azad gives a gentle salaam. Gandhi turns, and he stands, awaiting Gandhi's attention, noting that all the others have been dressed in European clothes, but the handsome Europeanized Nehru now wears an Indian tunic much like the one that Gandhi once wore. For a moment Gandhi studies the costume, then a broad smile; he looks at Gandhi. Again the temper of it produces a little silence. He moves to a servant who stands, holding a large tray with a silver service of tea. Of them all, Nehru's manner is the most naturally patrician, and Jinnah watches him with a somewhat envious awareness of it. His stand has produced a little shock of surprise, and holding his tea, he turns to Gandhi with a little smile, as they all look at him with some surprise. As he speaks, he rises and walks to the servant; they all stare at him, startled by his words and the fervor with which he speaks to them. He holds their gaze, then turns to the immobile servant and with a little smile, takes the tray from him and places it on the table next to him. As it sinks in, Gandhi pours some tea then looks up at them with a pleading warmth -- first to Jinnah, and it impresses each one of them, but for all his impact, they still take the measure of him with caution. Patel is the first to recognize the implications, and the idea has caught hold as Lord Chelmsford turns expectantly. His firmness doesn't restore Kinnoch's normal aplomb, and he holds the telegrams forward, glancing at the general. That takes the wind out of all of them as grimly, Lord Chelmsford looks out across the palace's ordered lawns and gardens. A prison door opens, and Gandhi, in prison clothes, is led along a small corridor to a room where the door is held open by a prison guard.",

Heavily pregnant, Jenny stirs in bed. Marley pricks up his ears, trots to the bedside, and watches as she sits up suddenly, clutching her stomach. Marley jumps on the bed and watches as Jenny hurriedly packs some clothes. John lifts the car seat box down from the top of a cupboard, which Marley munches open. John leaves Marley playing happily with a big chewy bone and hurries out of the house, while Marley remains busy with the bone as the sun comes up and through the day, until he falls asleep on the floor. John arrives home alone, and they walk out of the back door onto their wooden decking. John sits wearily on the steps as Marley sniffs around nearby. Jenny is indoors with the baby in a carry seat. Marley jumps up at the table with the baby on it, and John gets Marley to sit as Jenny lifts the baby out of the carrier. Marley offers up a welcoming paw. On the pavement, the Grogans' bin is surrounded by chewed empty boxes of baby equipment, and John, accompanied by Marley, comes out of the house with another bin bag as the bin men arrive. They jump to save Marley from the attentions of toddler Patrick. On the beach, John sits with Marley under a palm tree. The big dog sits calmly and watches as a young couple kiss and cuddle on the sand, while John notices the dog watching them and wistfully chews a toothpick as Marley lies down on the sand. In the evening, John and Marley drive up to the house with the headlights on. Marley's looking out of the rear passenger window. From the driver's seat, John looks up and sees Jenny through a window, cuddling Patrick and singing to him. She notices the car, shows Patrick, and waves to her husband, who waves back with a smile. Marley is splayed out on the sofa, watching them. Later, Marley bounds out of the house with John holding his leash. John stops and looks around the nighttime street, noticing a slim teenage girl standing by her car in her driveway and clutching her side. She nods tearfully. They drive through a plush neighborhood, where John lets Patrick out of his car seat. Marley power slides through the house and into the pool. Jenny is staring into the bathroom mirror and leads John into the bathroom, where there are four positive pregnancy tests in the sink. John half smiles and nods hesitantly. The neighborhood features golf courses with sand bunkers, and most of the houses have pools at the rear.",

Ferris looks to the boys again, and Yousef nods in approval of the next dish, which Aisha notices. Cala looks at the boys and points, causing Aisha to look at Cala, worried. She waves a white napkin, and he smiles and raises his eyebrows at Aisha as they walk out to the street. He holds out his hand, and Aisha smiles and looks up to a window where Cala is looking down at them. Ferris waves to her, and without shaking hands, Ferris goes. Aisha wrings her hands as she looks up at people leaning out of windows, watching her. Hani gives Ferris photographs of Al-Masri and Sadiki with young women in a club, and Hani lights a cigar. Ferris frowns earnestly as Hani looks at a grandfather clock, while Ferris's eyes dart. He smiles and holds up the file of photographs. Garland works on a computer and stretches his arms above his head. At the military airbase, a chopper lands in front of a hangar, where pale light glows in the windows and casts a sheen across the tarmac. A troop carrier drives up, and soldiers lift bodies in body bags from the chopper and load them onto the troop carrier. Ferris walks along past an airport terminal building, talking on his phone, and Skip's by an SUV in arrivals. A soldier detonates a bomb, and Al-Saleem watches a news report with one of his men. Ferris, Hani, and Garland are also watching as Garland sends the message in Arabic. Ferris pulls out his earpiece while Al-Saleem sits on a balcony. His lieutenant walks over with a laptop, and Al-Saleem sits and opens it, which displays a picture of Sadiki. Al-Saleem looks at the picture, studies the photo, and narrows his eyes. In his office, Sadiki shows a model to three men when a colleague calls over. Sadiki goes to a computer and opens his mail, where emails flood across the screen. He frowns as he starts to read the messages, and below the message is a photograph of someone wearing a balaclava. The next has a picture of someone holding up the Koran. Sadiki looks at a TV that plays news footage of the bombing and, increasingly alarmed, takes off his glasses. Carrying a case and laptop, Sadiki rushes out of the building, walks out onto the street, and stops to look around anxiously. Then he walks over to his Mercedes, deactivating the alarm as he goes, walks round to the driver's door, unlocks it, opens it, and gets in. He frantically turns the key in the ignition, switches on the headlights as a group of men wander past watching, and drives away in his cream Mercedes.",
    "1351": "A lighter is used to ignite something that is dropped, illuminating a tunnel at the bottom of a nearly-dug hole, indicating it is too far to jump. A jeep roars past with Jack driving and Louis sitting beside him. Their interaction is awkward but not angry, revealing moments of vulnerability, fear, and sadness. Jack offers a small nod of forgiveness and gratitude, which Louis silently accepts. Joe begins climbing down a rope into the dark hole, followed by Cary, with the barn roof overhead. Cry soon joins them at the bottom, where they face three possible ways to go. As they walk into the tall oval dirt tunnel, distant sparkly light is visible. They reach an area resembling a living room, beneath another hole dug through a house. Continuing, they encounter an intersection with a new tunnel, hearing mechanical rumbling grow louder. Joe and Cary cautiously advance, confronted by something off-camera that invokes fear and amazement. They cross to the other side, where Cary bumps into a hanging Sheriff Pruitt. Joe stops Cary from screaming and leads him away, noticing tunnels illuminated by makeshift hanging bulbs. Stunned by their surroundings, Joe spots something alarming, and Cary sees a human leg among metal and machinery. They suppress the urge to scream, Joe whispering in panic. Moving for a better view, Joe discovers three hanging human bodies in a rock-wall inset, including Alice, causing his heart to pound and his resolve to strengthen, which Cary sees too. Cary opens his backpack, preparing explosives and ensuring he’s unseen by the creature. Joe, with a lit sparkler for light, races to find another entrance into the creature’s space, reaching an intersection and vanishing down the tunnel.",
    "294": "Lisa has climbed over the wall and is helping Stella down into Thorwald's yard. Jeff picks up the phone and quickly dials. The buzzer sounds on filter, then the phone is lifted. A woman's voice is heard and Jeff seems a little puzzled at the sound of it. He squints out the window. Jeff's conversation continues over the action of the two women. Apparently no sight of Thorwald. He looks quickly toward the intersection and then right back to Lisa. The shovel is lying on the ground beside Lisa. Stella has abandoned the shovel and left the flowers and dirt strewn over the walk. Jeff, tense and wide-eyed, watches Lisa climb the fire escape. While Lisa starts up the fire escape, we see Stella running toward the wall in the foreground to climb over it. Lisa climbs the fire escape to the second floor and the outside of Thorwald's apartment. She tries, unsuccessfully, to get through the window which opens into the kitchen from the fire escape. And then, with some difficulty, stretches and succeeds in getting in through the living room window, which is open. She goes directly to the bedroom and we see her bending over one of the suitcases. Jeff quickly picks up the long-focus lens and trains it on the salesman's apartment. Lisa turns from the suitcase with the alligator handbag in her hand. There is an expression of triumph on her face. She opens it and her expression changes to dismay. She looks toward Jeff's apartment and, to communicate her dismay, she turns the handbag upside down. Empty. He lowers the long-focus lens and he is sweating with anxiety. He mutters, almost to himself. His eyes turn quickly to the alleyway and back again to Lisa. She moves quickly to the dresser and begins opening the drawers to check them. Lisa has dropped the bag on the bed and is now looking around the bedroom, looking for some place to start searching for the jewelry. She finds nothing. As Jeff watches tensely, the door bursts open behind him and Stella hurries into the apartment. Jeff swings toward Stella. He reaches for the phone. As he picks up the receiver, Stella pushes his hand down again. Stella looks out the window and her face registers shock. Jeff turns quickly to the window again, forgetting the phone for the moment. Jeff and Stella turn for a quick glimpse of the songwriter's apartment. At this moment, from the songwriter's apartment which has been quiet for a while, comes a new burst of melody. A quick flash of the songwriter's apartment, and his musical group gathered around the piano. Miss Lonely Hearts lifts her head to listen, and slowly lowers the pills and glass of water into her lap, her whole purpose arrested by the beauty of what she hears.",
    "1168": "Luna's silvery Patronus disappears as the room grows dark, causing the students to look around nervously. A huge mirror cracks and shatters, and Nigel peers through a hole in the stone wall behind it, seeing Umbridge and her squad, as she aims her wand. Harry pulls Nigel away just before the wall implodes, sending chunks of stones flying into the room in a cloud of dust, while Umbridge beams with satisfaction. Harry notices Draco holding a tearful and distressed Cho. Dumbledore winks at Harry as Fawkes the phoenix swoops down, and man and bird disappear in a burst of flame. Meanwhile, Filch climbs a high, tottering ladder to read the latest decree, removing a painting of six men in Elizabethan dress inspecting a skeleton to make more space on the wall. The men in the painting look up in alarm as Filch tips it to one side, and they all slide out of sight. The intricate locking mechanism on the school's main doors slides into place. In the great hall, the members of Dumbledore's army take their punishment, writing without ink using Umbridge's curled brown quills as she sits on the stage facing them, perched on Dumbledore's chair, dressed in a long pink robe, and drinking a cup of tea. As the students wince with pain, she smiles to herself with obvious pleasure, while Fred and George, gritting their teeth, glare at her. Outside the hall, Cho is standing as the students come out, clutching their sore and painful hands. Hesitantly, Cho approaches the last person to leave, but he cuts her dead and walks past, leaving her tearful and forlorn as she gazes after him. Elsewhere, Hagrid peers through an archway into the Forbidden Forest, where a herd of creatures, half-man, half-horse, gallops past, and a young giant looms out of the shadows, ten times bigger than Hagrid. The giant flattens a bird between his huge hands as Gwarp lumbers towards them, knocking Hagrid aside. Though they back away, Gwarp is restrained by a rope tethered to a tree, towering over them. Gwarp grabs Hermione, while Ron thwacks Gwarp and is knocked over. Hermione, looking like a tiny doll in the giant's fist, wags her finger sternly in his face, and Gwarp places her gently on the ground. Ron looks at her anxiously as Gwarp searches through a pile of scrap metal, choosing a gift for Hermione—a pair of bicycle handlebars in his colossal fist—which he offers to her. Hermione takes the handlebars, and Gwarp looks at her expectantly, with Hagrid nodding encouragement. Hermione rings the rusty bell, and Gwarp sits playing with it, smiling innocently. Meanwhile, Harry sees his parents in a mirror, with a reflection of his younger self between them as Snape points his wand, causing a confusion of happy and terrifying memories to flash through Harry's mind.",
    "307": "Fatigue overwhelms him, but he continues writing. In the driveway, 7-year-old Evan plays with CRICKETT, a frisky cocker spaniel puppy. Andrea, wearing a mechanic's jumpsuit, works impatiently on the carburetor of a Toyota Celica as Evan pets the dog and watches his mother work. Evan impatiently watches Andrea turn the bolt, but the carburetor will not set properly. Evan blows Andrea a kiss goodbye and runs into the school. As Andrea pulls away, MRS. BOSWELL, 35, taps the car window. The classroom is filled with screaming, running children when Mrs. Boswell enters with Andrea and immediately calls out to TOMMY, a tough seven-year-old kid who swings a whiffle bat at LENNY, now seven, a sniffling, chubby kid. Evan is surprised to see his mother enter with Mrs. Boswell but continues playing with Kayleigh, now seven, a quiet, sweet-looking girl. Mrs. Boswell leads Andrea over to the teacher's desk, opens the bottom drawer, and pulls out a drawing. Andrea turns to stone when she sees it; the drawing shows a child holding a bloody knife while standing on a heap of dead bodies, and some of the corpses have been cut open with surprisingly anatomically correct insides. Andrea sees Evan playing with Lenny, harmless as a bunny, and struggles to control her concern, visibly shaken now. Andrea leads Evan into Dr. Redfield's office where Evan busily writes in his new black-marble mead comp book. Meanwhile, Andrea speaks into the phone as she pours Lucky Charms into a cereal bowl for Evan, hangs up, walks into the next room, grabs the pocketbook off the coffee table, and heads back into the kitchen, dropping her purse in shock when she sees Evan, in the doorway, expressionless and holding a large BUTCHER KNIFE by his side. Evan sees her but remains expressionless, seems stunned to find himself holding the knife, and drops it. Andrea, still shaken, drops Evan off at the house of GEORGE MILLER, 35, a handsome athletic man with an infectious smile, who approaches the car and opens the door for Evan. Andrea writes nervously on a piece of paper as Evan gets out, and Evan nods and sticks his arms straight up in the air. The rec-room/basement. Miller's camera lens and finally to Kayleigh, whose ashen face trembles slightly. Panic spreads across Evan's face. Dr. Redfield leads Evan inside, where Evan takes a seat at a long rectangular table, his eyes fixated on the door on the other side of the room. Finally, a dark figure can be seen through the opaque glass; JASON, thirty and haggard-looking, enters the room as Evan's eyes fixate on the leg-restraints and handcuffs that hinder Jason's movement.",
    "912": "Gathering himself, he sniffs, flaring his nostrils, and stares forward with a steely gaze. Red peers out the smeared windshield with a solemn expression. Dillinger stands below an overcast sky. Strands of his greasy black hair hang over his forehead. His gaze drifts to a road, which cuts through a desolate field toward the flat horizon. In a farmhouse, gang members change clothes while eating. A woman wraps food in newspapers and brings it over to their table. Pete buttons up next to another escapee. Red puts out a cigarette. All of the men leave. Outside, Dillinger walks alone. Without his overcoat, he wears a black vest and a leather gun holster. The woman stops him. They hold eye contact and she lets go. As Dillinger turns and walks away from the farmhouse, the woman continues to gaze after him. A little boy in overalls comes up and takes her hand. Together, they wander a few steps without taking their eyes off of him. In the car, as Red drives, Dillinger looks back at Pete. He faces forward and glances at Red. A man in a blue suit hurries through lush green woods with a Tommy gun. He trips, then climbs to his feet and runs on. A clean-cut man wearing suspenders swiftly moves after him, toting a rifle. A group of armed lawmen follow behind, charging up a hill. The outlaw races downhill into an apple orchard. At the hill's crest, the clean-cut lawman stops and watches the outlaw run between two rows of trees. He aims his rifle. Floyd runs backwards, firing wildly. The lawman's shot misses. Floyd runs on. Calmly taking a knee, the lawman aims again, rubbing his finger on the trigger. Floyd sprints through the trees, almost out of his pursuer's sight. The lawman's finger engages a secondary trigger, then wraps around the main trigger. The shot blasts through Floyd's belly and he flops on the grass. The shooter gazes up from his sights, then stands and approaches the outlaw with the rest of the men following behind. As the men arrive, Floyd takes out a pistol which the lawman kicks out of his hand. He aims his rifle at the wounded outlaw, who lies on his back. Purvis' piercing stare remains fixed on the dying man. Blood gushes from Floyd's belly wound, saturating his white dress shirt. His head falls back on the grass and his convulsing throat muscles come to rest. The lawmen lower their weapons. Purvis studies the dead outlaw then nods at his men. Purvis slings his rifle strap over his shoulder. His eyes and purses his lips. The Nash sedan comes to a stop. In a clean, white kitchen, a woman standing near the sink folds a newspaper.",
    "242": "Szpilman retreats into the room with his nose bleeding, while the women watch from behind blankets and Mother hurries to him to wipe his nose. It is still quite dark as the Szpilmans and about twenty others stand lined up under lights from German vehicles. An NCO makes a selection, using his pistol to prod people, and when he reaches the Szpilmans, he selects Henryk and Halina. He then turns to shoot a young woman in the head, who falls to the ground bleeding. The partition is pulled aside, and people, including the Szpilmans, are either dressing or packing their belongings. Shots, screams, and a piercing whistle are heard on a hot summer's day. Jews, including Szpilman, Mother, Regina, and Father, clutch their belongings and walk towards wooden gates, where Jewish policemen order them into line. They shuffle through the opened gates, pausing to take in their surroundings. People walk up and down; a young man whispers to a woman who continues crying. Trucks arrive, unloading more Jews who are marched through the gates. Mothers, children, and old people, most holding papers, plead as the sun blazes. Szpilman wanders around, greeting people, while the area becomes crowded, and old people lie exhausted. Women with dehydrated children move group to group; one approaches Szpilman, who shakes his head sadly, and she wanders off. Ehrlich and Grun engage Father in conversation until Mother cries out and Regina and Szpilman call and wave to Henryk and Halina, who struggle through the crowd. Halina falls into Mother’s arms and is comforted by her while Father smiles sadly and Szpilman stares at Halina. The place becomes packed, with people calling names and women wailing. The Szpilmans sit in the same place, Henryk apart, reading a small book. Grun leans towards Halina, who looks at him in disbelief as Szpilman takes Henryk’s book to read the title. The Szpilmans remain seated on the curb.",
    "891": "Jane and Bingley stand out amongst the dancers as they move with each other easily, sharing smiles. The dancers move in intricate and formal patterns, circling their partners, then crossing to form lines. The women hold out their arms gracefully, forming delicate arcs before gliding back into their starting positions. Jane and Bingley separate, then come back together. Darcy looks at her defiantly, and whilst his back is turned, Lizzie smiles to herself and raises her eyebrows. They are interrupted by Sir William, and a look of growing concern crosses Darcy's face as once again, the dance forces them apart. Lizzie's brow furrows into a frown as she and Darcy stand opposite each other. Darcy begins to look a little agitated as he circles another dancer, while Lizzie looks a little pleased with herself as the dance draws to a close. The gentlemen and ladies bow and curtsy to each other before Darcy takes Lizzie's hand and leads her from the floor. He bows curtly and leaves, and Lizzie watches after him, frustratedly. Now, the guests are gathered in a different room. Mr. Bennet joins Mrs. Bennet at the dining table, where she's eating with relish. Jane and Lizzie stand with a happy group, including Bingley, and Lizzie smiles and leaves them, meeting Miss Bingley, who swans off, leaving Lizzie furious. Lizzie strides to a punch bowl and serves herself a cup, and a concerned Jane follows her. Mary leaps up from her chair and scurries to the piano, and Jane and Lizzie look mortified at Mary's clumsy playing. A furious Miss Bingley signals for her sister to follow her, and they brush past Lizzie and Jane, starting to maliciously whisper to each other. Darcy and Bingley look at Mary, and Mr. Bennet looks embarrassed, while only Mrs. Bennet seems to be really enjoying it. Mr. Darcy stands, towering over Mr. Collins, and then walks away, passing Lizzie and joining the Bingley sisters. Outside, dogs are reacting to Mary's singing, and inside, the Bingley sisters look at Mary with barely disguised contempt. Lizzie gives her father a desperate look, and he jumps up from his seat and joins Mary at the piano. Mary peels off her glasses and leaves the piano, head bowed, as Louisa Hurst briskly crosses the room and sits at the piano. Mr. Collins stands awkwardly at the piano, silenced by the playing, and he tries to cover up by waving his hands to the music. Lydia comes skipping and swirling into the room, holding an officer's sword above her head, and collapses in a chair while Lizzie looks mortified. Mrs. Hurst smiles smugly, and Mrs. Bennet closes the door on them, then leans in to eavesdrop before she scurries away. He holds up a hand to stop her, and she takes a seat. He looks shocked and then rises from bended knee as she hurries out.",
    "579": "Parrish is at a loss, and Susan's directness catches him by surprise, causing Joe to blink and silently feel extremely anxious about Susan's inquiries. Susan approaches Joe, who tries to respond but can't, his stammer interrupted by her. They are inches apart, surrounded by each other's scent, a heaviness in the moment, and Joe turns to head up the stairs. He excuses himself with an ineffable gesture and climbs the stairs, as Susan watches him disappear. Susan is left alone with Parrish, who is making a drink at a sidebar, and she kisses him before leaving. Elsewhere, the Board of Parrish Communications is gathered, with Parrish and Quince absent. Drew quietly speaks to Felicia and she leaves the room, only to return with Quince, who enters surprised but smiling, realizing what Drew has on his mind. Quince nods confidently to Drew, then turns importantly to the Board. She bursts into tears again as a sense of foreboding falls over Joe's face, fearing he is passing through a point of no return, but his apprehensive expression fades away. Parrish and Joe enter, with the entire Board assembled, including Drew, Quince, and Sloane. Drew receives a message while Joe checks all attendees, his eyes resting on Drew. Parrish looks around, extending the moment, appearing as if he may never answer, and remains expressionless. Joe's eyes remain fixed on Drew as he follows Parrish out of the room. Sloane pursues Parrish and Joe, but when the elevator door opens, Parrish and Joe step inside, leaving Sloane behind. The Board meeting breaks up, with members lingering in clusters, exchanging post-mortems. An enraged Quince corners Drew out of earshot, falls silent, and is struck dumb. Her head nestles under his arm, feeling his comfort without his awareness, and she laughs at his earnestness. Joe drifts away, lying with her but for the first time feeling separate, sensing him gone to a distant land, while she smiles. Joe and Susan are at the front door, where he helps her with her coat, they kiss, the kiss lingering. Susan breaks away, reaches for the door, looks back longingly at Joe, and leaves, Joe softly closing the door after her. He turns back into the foyer, looking up at Parrish on the balcony, who has observed Joe and Susan.",
    "327": "Frodo peers out from the seat as the world seems to shrink, with views of far-off lands telescoping towards him through the mist. Startled, he leaps off the seat and tumbles down the stairs while the eye sweeps Amon Hen seeking its ring, and with a huge effort, Frodo wrenches the ring off his finger and lies gasping on the summit below the ancient ruins of the seeing seat. Frodo looks up as Aragorn towers over him, then backs away, shocking Aragorn. Frodo uncurls his fist, revealing the ring, which glints gold and beautiful in the afternoon sun, drawing Aragorn’s eyes to it. Aragorn freezes and draws his sword as Frodo hesitates and backs away into the trees. Suddenly, 200 Uruk-hai swarm onto Amon Hen behind Aragorn, who attacks them like a madman, bringing two down with his sword and leaping into the ruins as others close in on him. Sam looks around for Frodo while Aragorn battles the Uruk-hai amongst the pillars and blocks of Amon Hen. Lurtz orders his forces as Frodo scrambles down the hillside, away from the fight, darting down the steep hillside with heavy feet thundering behind him. Elven arrows smash into the Uruk-hai as Legolas races out of the woods firing his bow and Gimli leaps into battle wielding his mighty axe. Frodo stumbles and falls, quickly crawling behind a tree while the sound of Uruk-hai crashing through the forest rings out. He turns to see Merry and Pippin hidden in a hollow nearby, looking at his friends with a great sadness in his eyes as Merry's eyes meet his with understanding. Pippin stands and makes a move toward Frodo, but Merry grabs his arm. Meanwhile, Aragorn desperately slashes his way towards Boromir, felling Uruk-hai in his path while Legolas and Gimli fight a rear guard action. Many Uruk-hai fall to Boromir's sword as he tries to protect Merry and Pippin, but Lurtz takes aim and a black arrow thuds into Boromir's chest. Amazingly, Boromir continues fighting, but another arrow and then another bring him to his knees as Merry and Pippin are scooped off their feet by Uruk-hai. Boromir holds Aragorn's gaze, and Aragorn places Boromir's sword in his hand, his fingers tightening around the hilt. Frodo looks to the far side of the river as the camera moves in on the ring, tears falling down his face, and with renewed determination, he tucks the ring inside his vest pocket and pushes the Elvish boat into the water. Sam bursts through the trees and runs toward the lake where Frodo is already paddling away. Sam starts to go under, spluttering and coughing, while Frodo drops his paddle and scrambles backwards in the boat.",
    "214": "The hobos stare as Everett gives an ingratiating smile while the second convict begins to haul himself into the boxcar and the third convict keeps pace outside. The convict running outside stumbles and disappears, and the middle convict is yanked out immediately after. Everett, just finishing his speech, flips forward, smashes his chin onto the floor, and is sucked out the open doorway, his fingernails leaving grooves on the boxcar floorboards. The hobos impassively watch as the three men tumble down the track embankment, clanking. They come to a rest in swampland at the bottom, then shake their heads clear, rise to their feet in the muck, and watch the train recede, leaving only the baying of hounds. Everett looks desperately about, and the two other men look interrogatively to Delmar, who looks from Pete to Everett and nods agreeably. Everett makes a sudden hushing gesture, and all listen. The men turn in unison to look up the track at a small, distant form moving toward them, which resolves into a human-propelled flatcar as it draws closer. An ancient black man rhythmically pumps its long seesaw handle. The three convicts watch the swampland, which begins to show movement as men and dogs trample the grass. The flatcar draws even and slows, and the three men clamber aboard as the old man resumes pumping. The three convicts, faces upturned, listen raptly to the blind prophet while the cloudy eyes of the old man stare sightlessly down the track with the seesaw handle rising and falling. The old man pumps rhythmically, and all contemplate his words. Suddenly, a rifle shot kicks up dust in front of the men. The front of the farmhouse shows a harshly shaded porch and a dark screen door, which swings open as a child holding a gun emerges and steps into the sunlight; the child is about eight years old with grimy face and tattered overalls. He pokes his rifle at the three men, who raise their hands. Wash Hogwallop, a sour-looking bald man, sits near a rusted bathtub amidst a yard of ancient car parts and farm implements overgrown with weeds, artlessly whittling a stick. He glances up as the three convicts clank around the corner, then returns to his whittling. The four men and the little boy sit around the kitchen table eating stew, with a Sears Roebuck catalogue on the boy's chair bringing him to table height. Wash glances at the little boy as the three men slurp their stew, while he sniffs dubiously at his spoon.",
    "395": "As they pass Jude, she smiles, and outside the restaurant, Fergus marches Dil away. They pass out of shot, and in the background, Jude rises. Dil and Fergus make their way to their seats at the bar, where a figure is sitting down. She leaves, and Dil watches her go. She looks at Col, and there are tears in her eyes. She stands and staggers out of the pub. Fergus sits there, with an expression in Col's eyes making Fergus feel very small. Fergus rises and walks out, looking toward where Jude is waiting. Jude grabs his arm and draws him down an alley where the same car is waiting, and they get inside. Dil, sitting inside a taxi, watches Fergus and Jude getting in the car. Jude is driving, with Maguire next to her, and Fergus sits in the back. Maguire stubs his cigarette out on Fergus's hand and hits him on the teeth with his fist. Jude drives, and the car halts in a sedate square. Several doors down is an entrance to what looks like a sedate conservative club. In the car, Maguire turns off the engine, nodding toward the building and a Daimler parked away. Fergus looks from the window to the car, and Jude turns to look at him. Jude and Fergus get out of the car and walk down the street to a cafe-bar with tables outside, across from the brothel-cum-club. Fergus and Jude cross the street and take their seats by the tables, with the brothel visible down the way. She checks her watch, and Fergus is sweating. Down by the brothel, the door swings open, and Fergus walks down toward it. An old, portly gent in a suit emerges, and the car by the pavement activates and its door opens. Fergus quickens his pace, with Jude watching from the cafe. Fergus reaches the car before the gent does and passes between him and the open door, brushing the gent's stomach with his elbow. Fergus walks on as the old man is eased inside the Daimler, which then pulls off. After it passes Fergus, he turns around and walks back. Jude smiles and leaps up as he approaches, then begins to walk away, as Fergus turns to see Dil in front of the cafe.",
    "951": "Joe looks taken aback, but pleasantly so, as a girl, Tina, sits up nearby. They carefully lower the sheriff, who is up on his feet, and Joe, Alice, and Tina follow him through the alien's maze of equipment. The sheriff shines his flashlight ahead, and Cary rounds the corner while being pursued by an alien in a dark tunnel. The alien suddenly stops in its tracks and grabs the sheriff. The others flee, but Tina, bringing up the rear, is snatched by the creature and pulled back into the darkness. The alien comes after Joe and the others, who run down a dark tunnel until they reach a dead end and are forced to stop. The alien emerges from the shadows, and while Alice and Cary cower back, Joe stands his ground as it draws closer. The alien draws itself up to its full height of about 25 feet, and Joe steps towards it. The alien cocks its head and picks Joe up, holding him close to its face to get a look at him. It has a skull-like face with huge mandibles, and its breath ruffles Joe's hair as it breathes on him. The alien leans in close, retracts some protective membranes from over its eyes, and its expression softens. It looks away momentarily upon hearing the machinery, then turns back to Joe. Alice watches warily as the alien puts Joe back on the ground and turns to run away up the tunnel on its many legs, leaving Joe to stare after it, catching his breath. Back on the surface, Joe, Alice, and Cary join troops on a street in town, where a strange magnetic force pulls metal items up off the ground towards the water tower. A bin, oil barrels, a table lamp, a bicycle, and other objects are drawn irresistibly to the tower and stick to its side. A shop window bursts open and television sets are sucked into the air, and a soldier is lifted about 20 feet into the air by his rifle before letting go. A car rises out of the used car lot, and a military container lorry bursts open to release white cubes that flood out. Joe, Alice, and Cary dive to the ground as cubes pass overhead, and these cubes, along with cars and other items, begin to fuse together, forming a gigantic structure on top of the tower.",
    "363": "Gandalf watches as the beacons burst into flames, his eyes flashing briefly with triumph before he hurries off. The beacon glows brightly on the slopes of Mount Mindolluin, high above Minas Tirith. Pulling back, Gandalf hurries to the battlement, looking further west along the White Mountains. Denethor stares at the beacon from the citadel window with a look of black fury on his face. Gandalf has a strange smile playing on his face. In an aerial shot, moving over the White Mountains, the trail of great fires winds slowly from peak to peak. On a rocky peak high above Edoras, a great beacon fire is ignited. A bell tolls urgently, and Aragorn looks tensely out across the mountains. Pulling back, Aragorn runs towards the Golden Hall and bursts in. Theoden looks up, startled, as Eowyn and Eomer turn to look at their uncle. Tension builds as Theoden lowers his head and then slowly raises it to look Aragorn in the eye. At the Edoras lookout, a soldier rings the great bell in alarm as below, in the courtyard, soldiers mount their steeds amid great activity. Theoden strides purposefully outside, flanked by Eomer and his soldiers, moving onto the parapets to watch as the soldiers prepare. Eowyn hurriedly pulls on riding gloves and prepares to mount her horse, turning to run smack into Aragorn. Aragorn smiles, reaching past her to lift a cover revealing a sword strapped to the side of her saddle. Eowyn deftly pulls the cover back down and looks at Aragorn. Pulling back, Theoden stares around at the streets and people of Edoras, as if he knows he will not see this place again. Eomer, astride his horse, calls to the assembled. Theoden, astride Snowmane, rides out with Eomer, Aragorn, Merry, Legolas, Gimli, and a great column of Rohirrim, thundering towards Dunharrow in the mountains. Meanwhile, Faramir and his men are fighting a losing battle against the Mordor invasion. Ominous sounds of wind rising fill the air, followed by a sudden terrifying shriek. Soldiers retreat through the ruins of the city as the Nazgul swoop down high in the sky. Madril is cut down by an Orc, his breathing quick and shallow. Gothmog, with hideously deformed features, stands over the prone figure of the injured ranger. He grabs a spear from a nearby underling and drives the shaft into Madril's chest, then surveys the carnage with satisfaction. Faramir and a few survivors flee West Osgiliath, desperately riding toward Minas Tirith as dark shapes pursue them in the sky. Suddenly, from on high, the Nazgul strike, tilting down as they swoop out of low-lying murky clouds, tossing men in the air like limp ragdolls. At that moment, across the plain, a figure clothed in white rides towards them. From the battlements of Minas Tirith, a call is made.",
    "1231": "Ben gets out of his car and admires a shiny BMW convertible parked beside him, then walks past elderly ladies, one using a Zimmer frame, who shuffle down a corridor. Ben strides towards the reception window, shows IRS ID, and passes a suited man sitting on the edge of Inez's bed. Inez reaches for a pad, but the man grabs her wrist, then notices Ben, causing her to shun his touch and ignore him. The man approaches Ben, looking awkward and leaning forward, while Ben stares impassively. Ben nods, cocks his head as he continues staring, straightens up, smiles faintly, picks up his briefcase, and disdainfully shakes the man's hand. Ben enters Inez's room where she lies frail and white-haired in bed, ignoring him with a sigh. Ben gives a kindly smile, but Inez stares ahead, stony-faced. Ben places his briefcase on the floor, gingerly moves a chair towards her bed, and sits at her bedside. Despite Inez's vacant stare, Ben gently smiles as she turns her head to look at him. With heavily lined features, Inez stares pensively at Ben, turns stiffly, and reaches out a bony hand to pick up her writing pad and pen. Inez studies Ben again, then writes something down, pauses, writes more, and looks at Ben wearily with her lip quivering. She weeps, looks tearful at Ben's encouraging smile, and writes again. As Ben reads, his brow furrows and he looks dismayed while Inez's face crumples, and she weeps. Feeling deeply moved, Ben raises his clasped hands to his mouth, hurriedly carries Inez out, puts her in a wheelchair, and wheels her past reception. Confronting Goodman, Ben pushes his head against a window and marches out. On a sunny golf course, a woman in a short skirt and T-shirt, and a guy in chinos and a polo shirt, get out of a golf buggy and walk to a ball. Ben approaches them, hugs them, but then Michelle moves away, and Ben looks the man in the eye and shakes his head. A network of freeway flyovers appears in the sunshine as Ben drives his saloon. In a hospital canteen, an elderly patient with a drip stand walks while most tables, decorated with vases of yellow flowers, are occupied. Sitting at a table, Ben reads, then looks up from his book to watch a woman with two young boys drawing at a nearby table.",
    "1223": "A bright white light shines out from the center of a black screen. The screen lightens to reveal clouds and a blue sky. The light is held aloft by a statuesque woman wearing a long, white robe with a blue sash draped around her. She stands on a raised plinth before the cloudy sky. An orange disc surrounded by black revolves like a record on a turntable. Shafts of light gradually form the shape of a running man. The figure becomes smaller and is frozen in the iris of an intensely blue eye. The image fades to black. A handsome black guy holds a receiver to his ear. He covers his eyes with his hand. He rocks back and forth. He removes his hand from his face. The silhouette of the man swims the crawl on the surface. Sun glints on the surface of the water. The man swims to shore and strides onto the beach. The man, tall, lean and in his 30s, walks up steps from the beach which cut through a garden, abundant with colorful flowers and bushes. A long low beach house with white flowers trailing from part of its roof looks out over a patio, the garden and the ocean. In the house, the man studies himself solemnly in a mirror as he fastens his tie. The man sits pensively on his sofa. Before him on a coffee table is a list of names with a typed note attached to it. The name Ezra Turner has been encircled on the list. In a call center cubicle, a man wearing a headset sits at a computer. Ezra types on a braille keyboard. Ezra disconnects the call. Ben slams the phone down. Looking disturbed by his own actions, Ben claps his hands to his mouth and stares down. He blinks, composes himself, and lowers his hands. Pacing, Ben stabs the air with a finger each time he calls out a name. Ben smashes a chair against a coffee table. A list of names scrolls. A rapid montage of items -- a newspaper article, a coast road, snapshots of Ben, Sarah Jenson's funeral card. A deserted open plan office in shadowy light. A cleaner polishes a floor in a brightly lit corridor. Ben sits in a cubicle, typing on a keyboard. He stares at his computer monitor gravely. The name, Emily Posa, has been encircled on his list beside him. Above it, the name Yvonne Bastidos has been crossed out. Ben stares pensively at the details, which include a photo of attractive, dark-haired Emily. He prints out her details. Traffic glides along a sunny freeway. Ben stares ahead gravely as he drives. On the seat beside him is a file with Emily Posa's details attached to it.",
    "1001": "A secret door opens, and they walk through the sliding door which has the barber's price list on it. Wolfsheim leads Gatsby and Nick into a busy speakeasy with arched ceilings, where girls in tasseled bikinis and feather headdresses dance on a stage and a line of barmen flamboyantly makes cocktails. A cop throws a man out, as Gatsby walks through, shaking hands with people. Wolfsheim, Nick, and Gatsby sit at a table facing the dancers, with Gatsby and Wolfsheim studying Nick, who sits between them, looking slightly bewildered but smiling politely. Gatsby and Wolfsheim exchange pointed looks, and Gatsby goes, leaning closer, as Wolfsheim's tie pin is a jeweled tooth. They look up at Gatsby as Wolfsheim swaggers away. Unnerved, Gatsby paints on a smile while Nick looks around, seeing the city aglow with neon lights. Nick then goes to meet Jordan at a rooftop restaurant, where he frowns, recalling in a flashback Jordan practicing golf on Daisy's lawn and Gatsby leading a charge in battle. Nick and Jordan walk arm-in-arm along a busy city street, get a cab, and ride in it while a bright moon hangs in the night sky and the cab drives along the tree-lined lane. Gatsby stands amongst the trees near Nick's cottage, looking up the lane, and Nick sees Gatsby and frowns as the cab rolls up. Nick gets out, the cab drives off, and Gatsby stands bathed in light. Nick looks over at Gatsby and gestures towards the mansion, and they both smile slightly awkwardly and look down. Gatsby gives a sharp nod and turns to go, then turns back, looking around edgily as Nick smiles openly. Gatsby nods, looks slightly at a loss, then turns and walks away while Nick looks curious. The next scene is set on a bright sunny morning when a stone birdbath is cleaned up and surrounded with pretty flowers. Nick comes out of his cottage in his dressing gown to find Gatsby's gardeners at work sprucing up the garden. A path of paving slabs is laid, hedges are trimmed, and flowers are arranged in beds as Nick looks up at a man trimming a rose arch and steps under it, reaching out his hand. It's pouring with rain when Gatsby, wearing a white suit, walks up with a line of staff all holding up umbrellas. Now dressed, Nick watches from a window as staff members carry flower arrangements, including one very fancy four-tiered pink cake. Nick has a tray of little cupcakes, as Gatsby steps up and the staff go into the cottage, with the flowers carried in behind them. Gatsby looks tense, frowns, and goes inside, leaving Nick holding his tray of little cakes. Inside, a clock on the mantelpiece reads a few minutes to four as Nick sits, dwarfed by extravagant flower arrangements, with a cake stand full of cakes and a big pile of brightly colored macaroons nearby.",
    "690": "A burst of light reveals a woman dressed in a white classical robe with a blue still draped over her arm standing on top of a shallow pyramid of steps holding a blazing torch high in her right hand, followed by pages from a superhero comic book flickering rapidly down the screen. A spinning war vortex of blue light becomes a silver blue spider's web which scatters the words of the opening credits, as more splintered images reveal earlier moments in the story, including a spider biting Peter Parker, Peter's look of disbelief at his changing physique in a mirror watched by Uncle Ben and Aunt May, and Peter having fun with red-headed Mary Jane and crawling up a wall like a spider. Uncle Ben's wise, kindly face appears, and Spider-Man in his skintight red and blue webbed suit swings lively from thread to thread like a trapeze artist. More credits appear and blow away as if made of sand, while a tangle of sinister black, sticky tendrils crawl across everything in their path. On a street, Peter Parker rips open his shirt to reveal the Spider-Man suit beneath, and Mary Jane in a long white dress looks reproachfully at Peter in the final fractured image. The broken mirror pieces slot together, becoming the blue sky above New York City, as Spider-Man swings through the air, high above the city streets. Peter rides his small moped, while a student aims a peashooter at Peter's neck and another shines a light in Peter's face. Peter steps up to the ticket window and makes his way to his seat. As he sits down in the center of the front row, a couple of large men sit on either side of him. The lights go down, and the curtains open, revealing a starry backdrop as Mary Jane descends a staircase wearing a glamorous, long, white dress. Peter grins proudly and mouths the lyrics, while in a balcony seat to the side of the auditorium, dark-haired Harry Osborne is watching Mary Jane through opera glasses. He lowers the glasses, then his gaze settles on Peter sitting below him in the stalls. Peter, lost in Mary Jane's performance, is totally unaware of Harry's malevolent stare. Following a couple of young women out of the theater, Peter grins with pleasure as he spots someone up ahead. Harry slowly turns to face him, then gets into the back of his chauffeur-driven limo and is driven away, leaving Peter standing helplessly on the pavement. The scene shifts to Mary Jane's dressing room, where Mary Jane smiles warmly and Peter beams happily. In the Goblin Lair at the Osborne mansion, several incarnations of the demonic Green Goblin mask are displayed on stands along with a number of high-tech weapons and futuristic flying equipment.",
    "305": "Joe is behind his desk and looks at Vic, who swallows some Remy. Joe walks back around to his desk and sits in his chair. Vic gets out of his seat and hugs Eddie, who bobs his head up and down, while Mr. Blonde calmly sits down. Nice Guy Eddie is driving to the rendezvous, talking on his portable car phone. Mr. White, Mr. Pink, and Mr. Blonde surround a cop and proceed to beat him. The three men are disheveled, hair a mess, and shirttails out, as they have the cop tied to a chair and continue wailing on him. Eddie steps inside the warehouse, and when Nice Guy Eddie walks in, everybody jumps. Nice Guy sees Mr. Orange, and Mr. White crosses to Mr. Blonde. Eddie, Mr. White, and Mr. Pink walk out of the warehouse, talking amongst themselves. Mr. Blonde then slowly turns his head towards the cop, walks toward him, and slaps his face. He puts a piece of tape over the cop's mouth as the cop moves around wildly. Freddy finishes pretending to be unconscious, walks past the sheriffs to the sink, and looks down to watch Freddy washing his hands. Mr. Blonde walks away from the cop, opens a razor, turns on the radio, and sings along with Stealer's Wheel. He stares into the cop’s face, holding the razor and singing along, before lashing out like a cobra with a slash across the face, then cuts off the cop’s ear and holds it up for him to see. Mr. Blonde walks out of the warehouse, opens the trunk, and pulls out a large can of gasoline. He returns inside, pours gasoline all over the cop, who begs him not to, and lights a match. Mr. Orange, who was shot, looks at the kid's gashed face and the hole where his ear used to be, as Marvin starts to weep. We see Mr. Orange, known as Freddy Newendyke, wearing a high school letterman jacket, enter a coffee shop, spot Holdaway, and head his way, sliding into the booth with him. Holdaway listens to Freddy, looks at him for a moment, then smiles. Freddy paces back and forth, rehearsing an anecdote, reading from the page and sometimes stumbling over his words.",
    "598": "Dumbledore glances down and catches Harry's eye. Snape looks eyes with Dumbledore, Bellatrix glares. Dumbledore's eyes flicker. Harry watches in horror as Dumbledore is flung backwards over the balustrade. The white-haired professor seems to float gently downwards. Snape grabs the distraught Draco. Bellatrix is jubilant. The shape of a skull appears in the dark clouds. Snape rushes Draco down the tower's spiral staircase. Harry follows, as Snape leads the death eaters and the ashen-faced Draco through the school corridors. Bellatrix creates havoc as she strides along a tabletop in the Great Hall. An Auror is thrown aside. Bellatrix aims her wand at the huge windows. They explode and the candles are snuffed out. Draco, Snape, and the Death Eaters stride through the forest towards Hagrid's cottage. Harry follows. Bellatrix sets fire to the cottage. Harry aims his wand. Harry falls. Bellatrix licks her lips then saunters away. Illuminated by the flames from the burning cottage, Snape stands alone. Harry lies on his back on the hillside. Snape turns away as Harry gets to his feet. Harry staggers forward. Snape deflects the spell. Harry crashes to the ground. Snape walks over to him. Trembling, Harry looks up at Snape, who kicks Harry's wand from his hand. Harry lies motionless on the grassy hillside. Snape hurries away past the burning cottage below him. Harry looks up at the glowering clouds forming the shape of a skull. Harry strides through the school courtyard followed by Hagrid. He pushes past students and teachers. Professor McGonagall, Hermione, Ginny, and Ron stand at the front of the crowd. Harry kneels beside Dumbledore's body. He leans forward and gently touches Dumbledore's cheek. The Horcrux. Harry gently places his hand on Dumbledore's heart. Ginny walks forward and kneels down beside Harry. He rests his head on her shoulder. A tear rolls down Hermione's cheek. Professor McGonagall raises her wand high above her head. The tip of it glows as it points up towards the skull-shaped cloud. Pomfrey raises her wand then Luna. One after another, everyone does the same. Wand after wand points upwards, the tip of each one glowing like a star. Grief-stricken, the staff and students stand in solemn silence. Dumbledore lies before them, his face serene and peaceful. As the wands glow more brightly, light bursts through the clouds and the skull disappears. Harry takes his hand from Dumbledore's heart. His head on Ginny's shoulder, Harry weeps. Sunlight streams in through the damaged window of the Great Hall. The long tables are bare, the seats and benches are empty. The door of Dumbledore's study opens and Harry steps inside. It, too, is bathed in sunlight. Harry walks towards Dumbledore's desk. A pair of half-moon spectacles lies on an open book.",
    "1005": "Gatsby stops and turns back, and Nick smiles. Gatsby walks between stone pillars off into the dark grounds and amongst the dark trees dotted with fireflies, finding Daisy standing by a tree near Nick's cottage. In a dark dinner suit and bow tie, Gatsby slowly approaches her, and they gaze into each other's eyes. He cups his hand against her cheek, leans closer, and kisses her passionately on the lips. He wraps his arm around her waist, pulls her close, and kisses her neck. Her eyes closed, Daisy tilts her head back, enraptured. Drink in hand, Nick stands on the terrace looking out into the darkness. Looking slightly disheveled, Tom walks up behind him, causing Nick to turn to Tom and frown. Tom smooths his hair back and turns to the barman. Gatsby continues to cover Daisy in kisses and pauses, lifting his head with a slight smile, meeting Daisy's gaze. Nick points his cottage out to Tom, who looks towards the cottage. Gatsby touches Daisy's face and steps away from her. Slagle and his associates are fighting with the staff. Tom puts down his glass, and Nick lifts his. Daisy turns to see Nick walk through the trees as Gatsby goes to Herzog. Daisy watches pensively as Gatsby goes with Herzog. The party winds down, and Wolfsheim paces in front of Gatsby in his study. Tom and Daisy are driven away from the mansion, and Gatsby watches from a window as they are driven away. Standing at the window, Gatsby looks thoughtful as four of his men march Slagle out through the gates, with one of them laying into Slagle with heavy punches to the face. Inside, the staff clear up as Gatsby stands on the terrace looking out across the bay while his staff busy themselves clearing up the mess. The green light on the dock at Tom Buchanan's mansion gently pulses. Nick comes down some steps, tossing a bottle in the pool. Gatsby grabs his suit jacket, clenches his eyes shut, and pinches the bridge of his nose. In the flashback, Gatsby follows Daisy to an upstairs room where they stand close to each other about to kiss, then Gatsby moves back. A shooting star flies across the night sky as they stand transfixed by each other. Gatsby leans closer, kisses Daisy, and they sink into a passionate embrace, lying together. He kisses her soft white skin, and they lie in each other's arms. Daisy's grand house stands alone lit up at night until the light fades. He points up as a star shoots by and tosses something into the illuminated pool. They both smile wistfully. Gatsby looks across the dark bay, smiles confidently, and steps over to Nick, who looks down, frowning.",
    "572": "The Orkin van is parked in an alleyway somewhere downtown, and from inside, throaty wails of frustration can be heard. Inside the van, the ornate rosewood box is now battered and scarred, its various locks holding tight against Edgar's repeated attempts to claw his way into it. He bellows in rage and hurls the box against the side of the van, where it finally cracks a hinge. Inside, there are dozens of precious, glittering diamonds, which he promptly tosses aside as worthless, but the rest of the box is empty. He points up at the screen with a laser pencil, indicating the three stars that make up the belt. Elizabeth looks up, as if she knows she's being watched, but she's just looking at the sky, wondering how many stars will be out tonight. It's more than Kay can bear, so he reaches out and flicks a switch, clicking off the picture of her. The monitor goes blank, except for a data screen. Jay drags a chair and sits down, and together Jay and Kay cross back toward the LAD (Landed Alien Display), where each of the thousand or so aliens who live on Earth are represented by a flickering light. Some lights are starting to go out. Kay looks to his partner, then to the screen, before Kay and Jay walk away. Edgar reaches into the front seat of the van and pulls out his twelve-gauge shotgun, pointing it at the tow truck driver. The tow truck driver looks at him with disdain, and pulling back his shirt reveals a mean-looking gun. There are several photos of a cat on the wall and a pile of bejeweled cat collars. Jay's attention is broken by something through the window, where outside, lumbering straight for the store, is Edgar. Jay fires, shattering the storefront window and blowing up a car on the street. The blast hurls him up and back a good ten feet, slamming him into the wall with tremendous force. Edgar turns and rushes away down the street as Jay picks himself up, leaping through the broken storefront window and after Edgar. Kay gestures to a group of onlookers, drawn by the curious blasts from the store, with smoking rubble everywhere. After gesturing to the back of the Orkin van, where Edgar's spaceship is neatly stowed, Kay pulls out his cell phone. Zed is in his office, looking down to the vast floor below where he sees the four worm guys with suitcases walking across the floor, then looks up at the screen. Edgar gets out and walks away fast, cursing under his breath, ranting and livid, thinking hard. As he passes a newsstand, he grabs the news vendor by the collar.",
    "1181": "Harry looks on in amazement as the boy lines up his trolley and disappears through the wall followed by his identical twin brother. The little girl smiles at him while Harry looks at the solid brick wall. He aims his trolley, takes a deep breath, runs straight at the wall, and finds himself safely on the other side, where he pushes his trolley on to Platform 9 and three-quarters. Harry smiles with delight beside the platform, where a handsome steam engine stands. The train steams through the countryside, and Harry has a carriage to himself. He sits by the window looking out at the passing scenery. A red-haired boy has a smudge of dirt on his nose, and Ron's eyes widen. Harry pushes back his hair as Ron holds up a bag of squashed sandwiches. Harry pulls out a handful of gold coins, and the boys share the sweets. Harry pulls a face as he takes a bean out of his mouth then opens a box marked chocolate frog. The frog jumps and leaps through the open window. Harry sees a hologram on the card and looks again. A rat appears, and Ron takes out a wand. A girl at the door pulls a wand out of her cloak and points it at Harry, mending his broken spectacles. Harry glances at Ron as Hermione looks disapprovingly at Ron on her way out, and he rubs his nose. The train draws into a small country station where Hagrid is waiting on the platform, holding a powerful lamp. Wearing black cloaks over their school uniforms, the pupils are dwarfed by the giant Hagrid, and Ron gazes up at him in amazement. Hagrid leads the way to the shores of a mysterious pitch-black lake, where four at a time, the children crawl into small, wooden boats, each softly lit by lamps suspended by a pole. The boats start to move, and half hidden by clouds, the moon casts a faint blue light. Mist rises from the water as the tiny wooden boats drift silently across the lake. In the distance, the children see the turrets and towers of a vast castle perched high on the other side. Light sparkles from hundreds of windows, and the children gaze in wonder at the huge imposing building. It towers above them as the fleet of little boats glides closer to the cliff on which it stands. Safely disembarked, the crowd of new students follow each other into the castle and up a wide marble staircase. On the upper landing, long, thin fingers tap the stone balustrade patiently. Standing in front of huge oak doors, the tall figure of Professor McGonagall faces the first-years as they reach the top of the stairs. Neville Longbottom picks up his lost brown toad and looks up at Professor McGonagall nervously.",
    "193": "Uncle Billy picks it up. Potter is seated behind his desk, with his goon alongside him. Standing in front of the desk is a distinguished-looking man, obviously the president of the bank, mopping his brow with his handkerchief. George bangs the receiver down and turns to meet Uncle Billy's anxious look. He realizes George has hung up and clicks the phone furiously. An ominous sound of angry voices comes from the other room. George and Uncle Billy exit from George's office, and more people have crowded around the counter. Their muttering stops, and they stand silent and grim, with panic on their faces. As George speaks, sirens are heard passing in the street below. The crowd turns to the windows, then back to George. Mary and Ernie have come into the room during this scene, with Mary watching silently. A man named Randall comes in and makes his way up to Tom. Randall starts out, and a few other people start for the door. The camera pans with George as he vaults over the counter quickly, speaking to the people. The people are still trying to get out, but some of them have stood still, listening to him. George has begun to make an impression on them. During this scene, Mary has come up behind the counter. Suddenly, as the people once more start moving toward the door, she holds up a roll of bills and calls out. George jumps over the counter and takes the money from Mary. Mary turns and slips out through the crowd, followed by Ernie. George hands the two hundred and forty-two dollars to Tom and speaks to Ed, the next in line. Uncle Billy takes out his wallet and takes out all the cash he's got. George, Uncle Billy, and Cousin Tilly are behind the counter, watching the minute hand of a clock on the wall as George counts off the seconds. Cousin Eustace is ready to close the door. Cousin Eustace slams and locks the door and scurries around the counter to join the others. Uncle Billy is taking a drink out of his bottle. The four of them parade through the office; George puts the two dollars in the safe. George rushes into his office to look out the window. George hurries into the scene. An old-fashioned, run-down house, unpainted and warped by the weather, once had class but has not been lived in for years. This is the house that George and Mary will live in from now on. The rain is pouring down, and a faint glow of light shines out from the bottom windows. He stops to make sure it is the right number before going up the steps. Bert and a man are working in the rain, sorting through travel posters.",
    "340": "The ominously muffled thud of their horses' hooves on the dank fir needles sets the scene as they arrive at the root of the mountain, where a sheer wall of rock towers before them. Within this wall, a creepy dark door gapes like a mouth of night, with signs and figures carved above its wide arch. At that moment, a chill wind rushes out of the doorway. Aragorn stares into the blackness, his hair blowing wildly, as the horses rear and buck in terror, turning until the three horses disappear. Aragorn turns resolutely towards the doorway and walks into the blackness, quickly followed by Legolas. Gimli is left alone, hesitating and struggling with his fear, before he plunges into the tunnel behind the others. Meanwhile, there is much activity as the entire camp is on the move; fires are doused, tents are pulled down, and horses are saddled. Theoden strides through the camp, Eomer at his side, preparing a little pony with a saddle and supplies. He wears an oversized helmet and Rohirrim clothing, appearing both nervous and excited. King Theoden breaks away from a column and rides up to Merry before wheeling his horse away, leaving Merry bitterly disappointed. Merry stands, head down, as a tiny dejected figure among the mighty Rohirrim on their large horses. Suddenly, Merry is plucked off the ground by a soldier who has snatched him by the collar. Merry twists around to see the soldier, and beneath a helmet and mail hood is Eowyn, disguised as a man. Merry's face is visible under the cape, looking on as the valley floor fills with thousands of horsemen who ride out after their king. Great siege towers and catapults roll across the Pelennor Fields, with thousands of flaming torches lighting the snarling, slathering Morgul Orcs marching in ragged torrents past cave trolls, who beat the drums of war. In the distance, Minas Tirith lies ahead. Aragorn leads Legolas and Gimli into a wide cavern, waving his torch through the darkness and illuminating a huge cavern. A ghastly cracking noise, like stone being sundered, cuts through the silence as a ghostly figure steps from the rock walls. Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli look on in horror as a mummified spectre looms before them, eyeless sockets gazing out—it's the King of the Dead. Fog swirls around as the ghost snarls at Aragorn, who moves forward. The fog suddenly rolls back, forming a retreating wall of grey vapour, and reveals rank upon rank of spectral warriors with ghoulish faces. The fog unveils a dead army of many thousands assembled around the cavern. Aragorn stares grimly at the King of the Dead, holding his gaze as the King of the Dead moves relentlessly towards him. Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli are now surrounded by an army of the dead.",
    "663": "He folds them up and lays them down. He does a double take on seeing his physique in the mirror and flexes his muscles. He turns away from admiring his new body in the mirror and reaches for his shirt. Glancing through the window, he catches sight of Mary Jane, MJ, in her room in the house next door. He smiles as she primps her hair and walks back to his mirror, grinning. Coming downstairs, he places one hand on the molding, walks on the wall around the corner, and then leaps to the ground. Peter heads out and stands, staring after having witnessed the altercation between MJ and her father. He sets off down the street after the pretty young redhead who is wearing Calfland's boots, a short skirt, and a zipped cardigan. MJ marches down the sidewalk, arms folded, reaches the school bus stop, and grinds the sole of her left boot on the ground. Peter is a bit behind. MJ climbs into her friend's Ford Mustang Convertible. The school bus beats past, now chased by Peter. He makes a grab for the bus and catches hold of a poster stuck to its side. It comes away in his hand and rips its full length. The bus zooms on, leaving Peter in the middle of the street with a large portion of the poster sticking to his fingers. He looks at his hand and ponders. The imposing Osborne home is shown as Harry rushes into the study where his father is lying face down on the floor. He helps his father to a seat, leading to a flashback where Norman stares in shock. Later, Peter is having lunch at school. He looks up from his French fries and sees MJ walking towards him with a tray of food. He smiles at her, but her smile is for the people behind him. As she passes, she slips on a spilled drink. Peter leaps to his feet, catches her, then the tray, and then the food, grinning inanely. Raising her eyebrows, MJ tries to coax an answer from him, but then she walks off. Peter gawps at her retreating figure, sits back down at the table, and lets out a big sigh. He raises his right hand, a fork is sticking to his palm, and he can't shake it off, so he pulls the fork. It's attached to web-like threads coming from his wrist, and it snaps. But another web shoots across to the next table and snares a tray. Peter holds it towards him, ducks as it flies over his head, and lands on the back of Flash Thompson, who is with MJ. Covered in mush, Flash turns around as Peter makes a quick exit, tracking the tray behind him.",
    "73": "JAY deals with a customer as SILENT BOB looks on, and the two exit. DANTE, alone, studies his summons and rubs his forehead, then spins angrily before his expression softens. DANTE hops behind the counter as a customer pays for something while he continues to talk. Another customer and then yet another approach the counter. JAY and SILENT BOB lean against the wall as a woman kisses DANTE's forehead and walks away, heading toward the back. DANTE watches her leave, then looks ahead dreamily, half-spinning in his chair before exploding in jubilance. RANDAL enters carrying videos, and DANTE hands him the summons, which RANDAL reads. The cooler door is heard opening as DANTE and RANDAL regard a woman curiously; she looks very satisfied. CAITLIN walks lazily down the convenience store aisle, and DANTE is bewildered as she joins them, latching onto DANTE's arm lovingly. RANDAL and DANTE stare at CAITLIN, confused, and everyone is silent. The same OLD MAN who took a porn mag to the bathroom is now serene, almost happy, as he lies on a stretcher. The body bag zipper is pulled closed as DANTE, the CORONER, and RANDAL stand around the stretcher-bound body bag. Midway down the body bag, something protrudes, pushing it up, indicating an erection. The CORONER takes notes while RANDAL stares at it. Ambulance attendants join them, and the stretcher is wheeled out. The CORONER stares at DANTE, while RANDAL and the CORONER stare in disbelief. RANDAL looks down, anonymously, and DANTE and RANDAL stare at the floor, both saying nothing. RANDAL hops off the freezer case and exits, later returning as DANTE crosses out of the scene. DANTE repairs ripped dollar bills by taping them back together. JAY enters with SILENT BOB and claps his hands, then exits, leaving SILENT BOB standing there until he also leaves. DANTE shuts his eyes tightly and rubs the bridge of his nose with his thumb and forefinger in deep concentration, then suddenly snaps his eyes open. RANDAL has a heart-to-heart with VERONICA, who stares dumbfounded before exiting. DANTE lies alone on the floor as RANDAL exits and locks the door behind him. Close-up on RANDAL's face as he steps inside, hands clasp around his throat, and DANTE yanks him out of the frame, throttling RANDAL and choking him to the ground. RANDAL throws his fists into DANTE's midriff, sending him back into the magazine rack. RANDAL jumps to his feet as DANTE comes at him again, causing RANDAL to tumble into cakes as Entenmann's products scatter around him. He grabs a pound cake and hits DANTE in the head with it, using the opportunity to scurry down the middle aisle. RANDAL grabs Italian bread and smacks it into DANTE's face as DANTE rushes him blindly.",
    "1164": "Harry kicks his trunk, leaving Ron taken aback before Ron departs, leaving Harry alone. Harry sits on his bed, staring into space and twisting and flexing his neck. He lies in a black tiled corridor with a blue door at the end, tossing and turning in his sleep as veins twist under his skin. The image of the black corridor and the blue door reappears, followed by a glass sphere and a bony hand. Harry wakes drenched with sweat, noticing Ron watching him with concern. In a classroom, a girl launches a white paper airplane that transforms into an intricate paper bird that flutters its wings. Seamus attempts to swipe at it, but the bird flies out of reach, soaring around the classroom as Crabbe aims his catapult. The bird hovers before bursting into flames as Professor Umbridge lowers her wand, points it, and causes books to distribute themselves on the students' desks with a sickly smile. Students nervously lower their eyes, and Umbridge searches for words while glancing around the classroom and slowly walking towards Harry. Inside her pink office, Umbridge puts three spoonfuls of pale pink sugar into a china cup decorated with pink roses while cats move on the china plates on the wall and she stirs her tea. Umbridge puts down the cup, touches a pen on her desk, and places a curled brown quill in front of Harry as he enters, noticing the plates on the wall and a white cat staring at him. She looks out the window and smiles with secret anticipation as Harry writes with the quill in his right hand, surprised to see the words appear on the paper in red. Umbridge smiles as Harry winces in pain as angry red arcs appear on the back of his left hand and words are cut into his skin. Harry looks at the quill in disbelief while Umbridge stands in front of him, smiling sweetly with raised eyebrows. Harry boldly meets her gaze, blinks, as she leans over him with satisfaction. Meanwhile, Fred and George try out their inventions as Ron and Hermione sit beside Harry, who turns a page of his book, shows his right hand, and Hermione looks at the scars. Harry walks off, leaving Hermione and Ron looking bewildered as his owl, Hedwig, flies away from Hogwarts. Harry stands outside Hagrid's deserted cottage, spots a large winged creature swooping into the Forbidden Forest, and wanders alone until he sees a group of horse-like creatures pulling a carriage with huge bat-like wings. A girl is stroking the nose of one of them.",
    "520": "He takes a bite of his sandwich and a sip of coffee. Lee sets her glass on the kitchen counter and walks towards the bedroom area. She starts to take off her wet clothes by the bed. Frederick takes off his glasses. He turns and looks at Lee in surprise. He pulls Lee down next to him on the bed. She sighs. Lee runs into the kitchen, her hands tight around her chest. Lee, fraught with emotion, briefly puts her outstretched hands on the refrigerator door, then turns around and leans against it, hugging herself, her blouse still unbuttoned, her hair still wet and bedraggled. Frederick enters the kitchen area and leans against the counter. Frederick cringes, reacting. He puts his hand to his forehead; he sighs. Lee turns and faces Frederick in the bathroom doorway. Frederick furiously shakes Lee away. He pounds his fist against a cupboard. Lee, gasping, moves away. He puts his hand on his forehead, then turns to the offscreen Lee. He walks over to Lee in another area of the kitchen. Frederick turns away from Lee. He begins to pace near the counter. He loudly pounds his fist on the counter in despair and frustration, then covers his eyes with his hands in sorrow. Hannah, wearing a plaid shirt, sits up in bed, a book propped up on her knees. She turns the page as Elliot, in pajamas and silk bathrobe, enters. She continues to read her book as he sits down at the edge of the bed and muses. Elliot frantically stands up and leaves the room. Elliot walks quickly into the darkened hallway. Elliot switches on the light. He paces back and forth in front of the piano and an accompanying music stand. Elliot stops pacing and checks his wristwatch. Elliot jumps. The movie cuts to Lee, standing in the dark in Frederick's loft. She talks softly into the telephone. Lee hangs up the phone and the movie cuts back to Elliot, standing in his living room. Stunned, he slowly lowers the phone receiver. Jazz is heard as the movie cuts to the outside of a university library, the camera focused on a huge replica of Rodin's Thinker before moving to the front entrance. Mickey can be seen emerging from its depths. He ponders the scene as he walks past the statue and a small front garden and down the sidewalk. Passersby, some holding books, are seen. A male jogger, seen through some tree branches, runs by. Several joggers pass Mickey; he continues to ruminate. Mickey goes over to the chain-link fence encircling the reservoir. He stops walking and looks out over the water. Mickey continues to look through the fence at the water and the distant skyline.",

A car's headlights appear in the distance, and Zus and the others pick up the body, carry it to the side of the road, and toss it down into the wood. They take up their positions and watch the car draw nearer. The driver gets out of the open-topped car to investigate the obstacle in the road, peers to the side of the road near where Zus and the others are hiding. The two Germans in the car and their female companion light up. The driver opens his fly and takes a leak all over Zus, who tries to protect his face with his hands. The driver spots him, and Zus stabs him. The other Germans are ambushed from behind as the sergeant shoots blindly into the darkness. Asael and others chase after a private while Zus unleashes machine gun fire. Asael chases after the fleeing private and brings him down. Zus finishes up the Germans in the car as Asael shoots his prey point blank. The group examines the weapons they have collected, but more headlights appear in the distance, shining their beams straight at them. The brothers line up and open fire into the dazzling light. Peretz is hit, and Asael recoups more guns and runs into a field while Tuvia helps Peretz to his feet and pulls him away from the line of fire. He picks up another rifle and dashes into the bushes as an armored vehicle drives up. Soldiers jump off the back and run after Asael, who's haring across a field. Tuvia and Peretz stop by and watch the truck slowing down while a searchlight on its route picks out Asael running across the field. Armed Germans go after Asael, but their bullets whiz past him. The heavy searchlight is on the ground and picks out Tuvia, who fires straight at it, destroying the bulb. Asael is pursued like an animal, but he and Zus gather up their armory of guns and run. The next morning at their camp, sandy-haired Tuvia looks across at Zus with fury in his pale blue eyes. Laila is scraping the bottom of a cooking pot with a ladle. Shimon, in his hat, coat, and woolen scarf, watches her grimly, and others in the camp look pale and gaunt. Aron, chewing on a piece of bread, hands it to Rachel, the teenage girl, and she devours it. Tuvia turns to Malbin, who's sitting with Peretz, whose eyes are open but lifeless. Malbin shakes his head.",
    "246": "Jules, Vincent, and Jimmie Dimmick, a young man in a bathrobe, are involved in a perplexing situation as Marsellus Wallace sits at his dining table in a robe, eating breakfast and talking on the phone. Jules paces in Jimmie's bedroom on another call, while the camera captures a glimpse into a hotel suite's main area where a crap game is played by gamblers and well-dressed ladies. The Wolf takes notes in a small notepad, then hangs up. A silver Porsche speeds toward Jimmie's house, and Jimmie answers the door to a tuxedo-clad man. This man, The Wolf, examines a car while Jules, Vincent, and Jimmie stand by. Jimmie exits, returns with coffee, and The Wolf outlines a plan of action. The Wolf heads to the bedroom with Jimmie, leaving Jules and Vincent in the kitchen. He pauses, steps toward someone, and makes a call before Jimmie brings a handful of linen. Jules and Vincent clean up the car's interior, Vincent washing windows, and Jules picking up pieces of skull and brain, becoming more bloodied than before. They line the car with bedspreads and quilts as The Wolf inspects it, and the two men, proud of their effort, stand aside in bloody clothes. Jimmie holds a trash bag, The Wolf a garden hose, and both follow The Wolf's instructions, receive soap, and scrub themselves under the hose's spray. Afterward, Jimmie hands them towels, and they dry off, now dressed in tee-shirts and swim trunks, contrasting their former appearance. Laughing, The Wolf and Jimmie watch as the garbage bag is placed in the car trunk, and The Wolf slams it closed.",
    "466": "Vizzini munches on an apple while holding a knife pointed at Buttercup's throat, and she is blindfolded. A picnic spread is laid out with a tablecloth, two goblets, a small leather wine container, some cheese, and a couple of apples on a lovely spot high on the edge of a mountain path with a view to the sea. The Man In Black comes running around the path, sees Vizzini, and slows. The two men study each other, and the Man In Black nods and comes nearer while Vizzini pushes his knife harder against Buttercup's throat. Buttercup gasps against the pain as the Man In Black stops fast and nods again. Vizzini fills the goblets with wine as the Man In Black pulls a small packet from his clothing and hands it to Vizzini. As Vizzini's pleasure grows, the Man In Black's decreases, and Vizzini suddenly points behind the Man In Black, who turns to look. Vizzini switches the goblets while the Man In Black's head is turned, and Vizzini starts to laugh as they both pick up their goblets. Vizzini hesitates, then drinks after the Man In Black, and he sits silently, watching the Man In Black, until he falls over dead. The Man In Black steps past Vizzini's corpse, removes Buttercup's blindfold and bindings, and she notices Vizzini lying dead. The Man In Black pulls her to her feet and leads her off the mountain path into untraveled terrain, where Fezzik fought the Man In Black. The camera pulls back to reveal the Prince kneeling and inspecting the sand, with the others waiting behind him. He leaps onto his horse, and they charge off. The Man In Black drags Buttercup, who sometimes stumbles until she is close to exhaustion, and then he lets go of her and cocks back a fist. Buttercup flinches but does not retreat. The picnic is spread as before, and the camera pulls back to reveal the Prince kneeling by Vizzini's body as the others ride up.",
    "1186": "Behind the shield, a faint light flashes on and off from the bedroom window of a suburban house. The light is flashing from beneath a bed sheet. Harry Potter suddenly emerges from under the sheet and pretends to be asleep. Uncle Vernon, wearing a dressing gown, puts on the light and glares around the room. He switches off the light and goes out. Harry pulls the sheet back over his head. He waves the wand over a spell book. The wand glows brightly. It glows even more brightly. The light flashes again under the sheet. Uncle Vernon looks in again, but Harry pretends to be asleep. Harry snuggles down in bed. Daylight. Aunt Marge thrusts a wet umbrella at Harry. She bustles into the sitting room with her bulldog with her. She greets her nephew, Dudley. Harry clears the table. Ripper licks her plate. She gives Ripper brandy and glares at Harry. Uncle Vernon gives Harry a warning look. Her glass shatters. She clicks her fingers at Harry. Harry shakes with rage. Lights start to flash and plates rattle. As Aunt Marge wags her finger at Harry, the tip begins to swell. Her cheeks bulge. Her bottom swells to fill the chair. Ladders appear in her stockings as her legs grow to twice their normal size. The seams on her tweed jacket burst apart. Her neck inflates. The top button of her blouse pings across the room and hits the clock. Vernon and Petunia watch with horror. Dudley goes on eating. Ripper bites Vernon's leg. Aunt Marge rises into the air. The beads of her necklace scatter. She bursts out of the chair. A flying button hits Dudley. A second button knocks him sideways. Marge grabs the tablecloth. She floats even higher and hits the ceiling. Aunt Marge turns upside down showing her bloomers and floats into the conservatory. She bumps against the glass roof. She sails out into the garden. Vernon struggles after her with Ripper clinging to his leg. He grasps her hands. Ripper's still attached. All three are lifted off the ground. Vernon lets go and falls onto the grass. Aunt Marge floats away like a huge balloon. Helplessly, Vernon and Petunia gaze after her. Dudley is still eating and watching television. Harry quickly runs upstairs, angrily kicking the cupboard. He sits on his bed. He looks at the photograph on the bedside table of his parents dancing happily together. He drags his trunk down the stairs. He points his wand at Vernon. Harry leaves the house dragging his trunk on a small set of wheels. In the distance, Aunt Marge is a faint speck in the darkening sky. Harry walks quickly, breathing hard as he pulls the heavy trunk along the deserted streets.",
    "482": "Mary opens the door and looks in to see Cassidy drinking from a large tumbler; he winks at her without pausing in his drinking. She remains on the threshold for a moment, then crosses to the desk, talking as she goes. Mary then slams down on the brake, trying to pull herself together, as the Patrolman raps again, less gently. Reluctantly, she rolls down the window, and the Patrolman studies her for a moment. Mary pulls her handbag up from the floor, where she had placed it when she stretched out for sleep, and puts her hand in it, rummaging for her wallet but cannot find it. The Patrolman is staring at her, and she glances at him nervously, pokes in her bag a bit more, sighs, and realizes she'll have to remove some of its contents. Nervously, trying to control her fear, she takes out the money-filled envelope, then the important papers envelope, and a couple of other items, placing them on the seat, finally finding her wallet, opening it, and handing it to him. He looks at the wallet, then at the car, and walks around to the front of the car to check the license plate before returning. The Patrolman peers in, checks the car registration on the steering wheel, and returns Mary's wallet, and she takes it, looking at him for a flicker of a moment before starting ahead fast. As she drives, she glances into her rear-view mirror to see the Patrolman following in his automobile at a matched speed. She glances out at her surroundings and sees the freeway ahead before suddenly turning off the highway and checking her mirror to see that the Patrolman is no longer following and has not turned off after her. Breathing a sigh of relief, she thinks for a moment and makes a quick decision as she gets out of the car, glances toward the lot office, and turns her attention to the line of cars, noticing the California license plates on all of them. The car dealer calls out from his office, and Mary nods, starting to walk along the line of cars as if making a selection. Her eye is caught by the iron newspaper stand on the corner, just outside the lot, and she stares at the papers, turns away as if what she is fearing would have to be impossible, then, having to satisfy herself, goes to the stand, drops a dime in the iron slot, picks up a Los Angeles newspaper, and starts back into the car lot, glancing worriedly at the front page. As she goes, the same Patrolman is seen coming up the street toward the lot, and he sees Mary, slows, swerves over to the opposite side of the street, and stops by the curb. Mary, engrossed in the newspaper and walking back through the lot, does not see the Patrolman.",
    "612": "Steam leaks off the window as doe-eyed Sidney stares open-mouthed at the passing illuminations, while the glowing peaks of skyscrapers gleam in the night sky. White flowers float on the surface of the rooftop swimming pool as immaculately dressed glitterati mingle and sip champagne. Sidney saunters over to Alison carrying a plate piled high with finger foods, as three beautiful women slink by, and Lawrence walks off into the crowd. Party guests whip out their mobile phones in response to the ring tone, and a glamorous woman in her fifties approaches heavy-featured, debonair Lawrence. Lawrence drifts off with goateed Vincent, as Sidney approaches Rachel, who stands by herself looking out over the city. She looks at him suspiciously, but then, beaming, she puts down her champagne. Sidney hands her a napkin and a pen, and she hands him her autograph, making Sidney grin as he rejoins the others. Eleanor gestures to a besuited young man on the opposite side of the pool, who dutifully taps Sophie on the shoulder, and she turns to face Eleanor. Sophie is resplendent in a backless white halter-neck dress, causing Sidney's jaw to drop, while Eleanor waits for her to join them. Pulling up to the poolside, Sophie looks around for an appropriate route but is hemmed in by guests absorbed in conversation. Smiling, she scratches her head, then kicks off her glittering high heels before stepping fully clothed into the pool. Photographers take pictures as she lifts her sleek, jet-black hair over her head and wades gracefully towards Eleanor, clutching her long hair in a bun and smiling flirtatiously for the camera. She pulls herself up out of the water, her wet dress clinging to the sinuous curves of her lean, shapely body, as Eleanor speaks on her cell phone as they leave. Sophie and Eleanor lead the way outside, where a bustling crowd of press photographers ask for Sophie's attention, and Sidney shields his eyes from the glare of the flashing cameras and puts a coat over Sophie's shoulders as they head towards a waiting car. Sidney tries to squeeze into the car beside Sophie and her Chihuahua, and they walk together. Sidney stops with a frown as Alison strides off and later sits at his computer. Lawrence throws him a newspaper, and a woman delivers a basket of flowers to Lawrence, who reads the gift tag. Gray-haired Lawrence gives Sidney a prickly look, then walks away, while Alison looks at a tight-lipped Sidney and shrugs as he turns back to his computer. Sidney zips up his fly as he rounds a corner into a white-walled corridor, where he sees Elizabeth Maddox approaching and stops anxiously in his tracks as she stumbles and falls down in a heap in front of him, while Alison watches with bated breath from the end of the corridor. Slack-jawed, Sidney gawks at her, and she raises her eyebrows.",
    "942": "Mycroft winces as Watson enjoys himself at the gaming tables and Mycroft chats to some other men. Holmes goes upstairs to investigate where he saw a bearded man carrying a nosegay appear from behind the curtains earlier. Holmes parts the curtains and sees nosegays lying on a table. A woman stands with her back to him, and he puts coins in a shell-shaped bowl. The high cheekboned brunette turns around, and Holmes sits. Madam Sim lights a match from a candle and picks up a pack of tarot cards. Holmes stares intently at the pack and places a finger on his forehead, takes the pack from her, and flicks through them. He lays the Devil card down on the table, reaches inside his jacket, takes out the letter, and drops it on the table. Sim looks amazed and picks it up, finding inside a sketch of a man with a goatee beard, and says, \"That is the price I must pay to change the course of history.\" She looks up from the letter as he gives her a look and gets up. She reaches for a gun, while he picks up an umbrella and plans his attack on the Corsac in his mind. He swings the brolly, and the Corsac drops down. He knocks a knife from the man's hand and, in slow motion, karate-chops the Corsac about the face, followed by a kick in the groin and bludgeoning the man with the brolly. The Corsac lunges with a knife, but Holmes dodges the attack and hooks the umbrella handle around the man's throat, throws the man over his shoulder, and whacks him in the face. Now, for real, Holmes pulls the Corsac down from the rafters with the umbrella and disarms him. Sim kills the Corsac by throwing a knife into his chest. Holmes goes over to her, and as they leave, a man and two couples come in. The Corsac comes round, leaps to his feet, takes off his heavy coat in which Sim's knife is embedded, and brandishing another blade, goes after Holmes and Sim. He runs along the edge of a balcony within the building, somersaults off it down to a lower level, and heads off Holmes and Sim. Holmes throws the Corsac, who back-flips off a wall and comes at him again. Meanwhile, on the ground floor, Watson is still playing cards, at least he's winning. Sim whacks the Corsac over the head with a bottle. Holmes twists his arm and throws him onto a sofa. They struggle, and the Corsac's blade scrapes Holmes' cheek. Holmes recoils as the Corsac goes after Sim. Holmes gives chase and tackles him to the floor, but the Corsac springs up and grabs Sim by the hair.",
    "1371": "Oliver gets up, and Charlotte, Sadie, and Desi run off, followed by Oliver. Desi gracefully swims underwater, looking gorgeous, and she sees Jason and Ronnie underwater, appearing grotesque, red-faced, and awkward. As they reach for each other and surface, Desi swims away. Larry talks to Oliver, who smiles, amused, while Jason and Ronnie are talking to Desi. Debbie, Pete, Larry, Oliver, Barb, and Barry are eating as Ronnie, Jason, and Desi talk. Oliver gets up to leave, walks out, and the party becomes tense. Debbie notices that Oliver never actually left; he stands at the back, looking uncomfortable and quietly singing, which shocks Debbie. She smokes a cigarette at the side of the house when Sadie appears, and Debbie, caught, turns and walks towards the house, with Sadie following. Sadie storms through the front door after Debbie, who continues down the hall, still followed by Sadie. Barb is in the kitchen with Pete and Charlotte as Debbie turns the corner and finds Pete stress eating in front of the fridge. Debbie storms off towards the foyer, where Larry stops her, and Claire and the triplets are right behind him. Pete throws his cupcake against the wall as Larry and Claire walk away and Pete storms in. Oliver passes Pete and turns to Debbie as Pete walks away, stunning Debbie, who follows him out to the front porch, closing the door behind them and looking at him for a moment. Larry opens the door and peeks out to reveal everyone at the party except Pete still in the foyer. From the side of the house, Pete is seen riding his bike in his street clothes and helmet, exiting home, very angry and riding with great emotion to release frustration. Pete rides his bike onto San Vicente Boulevard and down the street; a car passes, and a teenager yells to scare him, causing Pete to almost fall. Debbie and Barb clean up and see Oliver picking up glasses, Sadie walking in with Joseph. Sadie walks off, followed by Joseph. The traffic clogs up and a car honks, almost causing Pete to ride into it as it makes a right turn; he pulls up alongside Jason's van, where Desi is riding with Jason, and they speed off. Oliver plays with the kids and an iPhone, Debbie walks outside, and exits.",
    "547": "Henry turns and grips the mounted machine gun with a perplexed expression and then pulls out his watch. Indy uses his arm to demonstrate that he's referring to a direction and not a time. Henry does as indicated, and the exploding gun nearly shakes him out of his seat as he has one of the Messerschmidts in his sight. He pulls back on the trigger, causing the machine gun to fire repeatedly as the Messerschmidt banks to the left, but Henry keeps it in his gun sight. Henry inadvertently swings the gun around, while Indy looks back at the missing tail section, then at his father. The plane begins to go down, and Indy struggles to control its descent until the wheels touch down. Out of control, the plane skids and crashes first into a corral of goats and then into the farmhouse beyond, sending a cloud of dust into the air. Indy pulls himself from the cockpit as guns blaze and bullets explode around them; Indy and Henry jump over a stone barricade. Henry, frightened, grabs at Indy as an old man kneels at his car repairing a rear tire. The man turns to the wheel, the hubcap in his hands, and suddenly the wheel moves forward, startling him. Indy has the throttle down, both hands tightly gripping the steering wheel, while Henry is a very nervous passenger. Indy sees a low-flying Messerschmidt coming up behind him in the side mirror, and as it roars by overhead, bullets explode around them, narrowly missing the car. The car races toward a tunnel that cuts through a steep, and the Messerschmidt bears down on Indy's car with machine guns firing, but the car enters the tunnel. The Messerschmidt cannot pull up in time and slams into the mouth of the tunnel, shearing off its wings. The flaming fuselage continues to rocket through the tunnel like a bullet down the muzzle of a gun, with sparks flying as its belly scrapes against the pavement and the sides of the tunnel. Indy and Henry look over their shoulders to see the wingless ball of fire gaining on them, about to overtake them. The car exits the tunnel at top speed and veers off the road as the flaming Messerschmidt fuselage shoots past and explodes in the middle of the road. As the car emerges safely from the flames, Henry wipes the sweat from his brow and looks out the windshield to see a second Messerschmidt screaming out of the sky toward them. The Messerschmidt drops its single under-fuselage bomb, which explodes in the road directly ahead of the car, missing it by only several feet. The car falls into the hole made by the bomb, and Indy climbs out, still in the bomb crater, and turns back to Henry.",
    "194": "A sharp whistle is heard as Ernie leans from the window, and Bert and the man put up travel posters to cover up the broken windows. Ernie looks out through the curtain covering the broken glass of the front door, then opens the door, revealing himself as a homemade butler, having accomplished this by rolling up his pants and putting on an old coachman's hat. George enters, and they rush into each other's arms and hold each other in ecstasy, remaining embraced. They finish their song, and Ernie kisses Bert on the forehead before Bert slams Ernie's hat on his head. Meanwhile, the Martini family is moving, with Martini and George, assisted by three of the Martini children, carrying out the last of the furniture. The family consists of Martini, his wife, and four kids of various ages, from two to ten. George and Mary help the Martinis move, surrounded by about a dozen neighbors. Mary gets in the front seat of the car with the baby in her arms, while the family goat gets in the back seat with the three kids. Outside one of the miserable shacks that line the street are two vehicles: George Bailey's rickety car and an even more rickety truck piled high with household goods. The rickety caravan starts off down the street to the cheers of the neighbors. The kids enter with screams of delight, amidst new lawns here and there and young trees, which promise to transform the area into a pleasant little middle-class section. George and Mary stand on the porch of the new house with the Martinis lined up before them while Sam Wainwright stands in front of his big black town car, epitomizing a successful, up-and-coming businessman. His wife, an attractive and sophisticated lady, is inside the car, dripping with furs and jewels. Sam watches George across the street, while Mrs. Martini and the Martinis cross themselves, shaking hands all around. Meanwhile, Potter is seated in his wheelchair at his desk with his goon beside him, as his rent collector, Reineman, talks and points to maps spread out on the desk. A buzzer is heard, and Potter snaps on the dictaphone on his desk before Reineman exits. He flips the switch on the dictaphone. Elsewhere, George and Mary talk to Sam Wainwright in front of his car, with Sam's wife, Jane, now out of the car. There is handshaking all around as Sam and Jane get into their car, and the big black limousine glides away, leaving George standing with his arm around Mary, gazing broodingly after it. They slowly walk over to George's old car and look at it silently.",
    "70": "DANTE hangs up and looks at the paper ruefully, shaking his head. He then sniffs the air as JAY, SILENT BOB, and OLAF lean against the wall. OLAF looks quizzically at SILENT BOB and then looks the girls up and down, makes a metal face, laughs, shakes his head, and busts a crimson metal sneer, cackling deeply as the theme to Star Wars plays. Meanwhile, RANDAL leans back in his chair, stares up at the TV, stands, points the remote, clicks the TV off, and ponders before locking the door and walking away, while OLAF sings for the small crowd. The can pops off, and DANTE staggers back a few steps as the man rubs his hand and exits as RANDAL enters. DANTE throws the canister away, and RANDAL follows him as he cleans up around the store. DANTE steps behind the counter with the BLUE-COLLAR MAN joining them. The BLUE-COLLAR MAN exits, and DANTE and RANDAL remain respectfully quiet for a moment while RANDAL hardly stirs and continues to read his paper. The INDECISIVE CUSTOMER wears a face of utter disbelief at this lackadaisical video clerk, feeling flabbergasted but not put off. She smirks smugly at RANDAL and his paper, half turns to see if her comment was heard, and tries again with a different approach, but RANDAL continues to read on, even as she tries harder, louder, and more direct, holding up her rental choices. RANDAL reads on, as the INDECISIVE CUSTOMER shakes her head in disgust and throws the movies back onto the wall. An angry WOMAN opens the door, storms out, and RANDAL hops over the counter, whipping the door open. Offended, he closes the door, stands momentarily appalled by her exiting remark, shakes his head, reaches behind the counter, grabs a ring of keys, exits, locks the door from the outside, ensures its security, and storms off opposite the woman. DANTE stares, open-mouthed, at something off-camera as RANDAL hurls the door open and launches into his tirade. An ODD MAN sits on the floor, surrounded by open cartons of eggs, holds an egg up to the light, studies it, grabs a carton from the cooler, pops it open, examines each egg, spins an egg on the floor, as RANDAL snickers at his friend, and both RANDAL and DANTE study the off-camera oddity.",
    "1218": "Sarah lingers and turns to Rambo, her blonde hair tied back in a bunch. On the riverside, Michael pauses and watches them, carrying a small bundle, while Rambo wears a concerned frown. Sarah stares at him sadly, smiles faintly, and places a small crucifix on a necklace into his enormous hand, which closes over the gift. She stares at him, then turns away and gets off the boat. On the bank, Michael hoists a bulky black rucksack onto his shoulders as Sarah walks up the gangplank and joins Michael. The party marches away with the peasant porters, heading inland over the head of a waterfall, with two bearers carrying a pole between them, from which a large carton hangs. Rambo's boat wends its way back down the river as Michael's party crosses a static body of water bordered by rocks and boulders, led by a man using a camcorder at the front of the party. Rambo's boat rounds a headland and comes upon the pirates' motorboat, floating near a bank. Rambo stares warily at it as they pass, noticing a single corpse lying on the deck near the abandoned machine gun. He grips the tiller firmly and guides his boat towards the pirate boat. The volunteers and bearers traipse over the brow of a hill, overlooking a settlement in the valley below, near a paddy field. Sarah looks about as Rambo pilots the pirate boat further up the river, his own boat following behind, piloted by one of his men. On the pirate boat, one of the pirate corpses has turned a mottled purple as the boat moves into a riverbank. Rambo locks off the motor and brings the pirate boat to a halt, grabs petrol cans and rope, and makes his way through the pirate corpses. Meanwhile, the volunteers approach the village, greeted by small children and adults alike. The village huts are built in the local style with wood and high foundations. Rambo flips the top of one of the cans, holds it above his head, and drenches the machine gun and pirate corpses with petrol. The villagers make Michael's party welcome as Rambo opens up another can, drowns the deck in more petrol, and the liquid washes pools of blood over the side of the boat. He throws an empty can into the hold of the boat, flips open, and lights a cigarette lighter. From his own boat, he tosses the lighter into the pirate boat, which bursts into flame. Stalks of rice plants stand upright in a paddy field below the village, where outside a hut, Sarah hands a book to a puzzled child. One of the volunteers gives an oral examination to a woman, and an old man plays a stringed instrument.",
    "317": "Evan looks up to see Carlos staring at him with reverence, and Carlos, awestruck, hands over a box of cigarettes. Evan nervously approaches as Karl and Rick wait expectantly for him to enter, and they continue to stare. Rick stands, and Evan nods reluctantly, dropping to his knees, but before anything happens, Carlos bulldozes past the Aryans into the room, slamming Karl into the wall and jamming a shank into Karl's crotch. Rick charges Carlos but trips on his pants, and Evan, anticipating Rick's fall, stomps Rick's face and snatches his journals from Karl's shelf. Evan frantically flips through them while other white supremacists charge the cell. Carlos drops Karl's writhing body and presses against the cell door. Evan finds an entry and focuses on the words as the supremacists force the door open, and the words begin to shimmer. Reverberant sounds of barking break the sound barrier, and images of Aryans storming the cell become a frenetic blur as Evan, now thirteen again, finds himself in the woods. Kayleigh and Lenny do a double take, and Evan roots through the trash to find a razor-sharp piece of metal, which he gives to Lenny. Evan places the metal shard in Lenny's hand and bolts away, with Lenny slowly following. Soon, Evan groans on the ground, writhing, as his words strike a chord with Tommy, whose anger dissipates. Tommy begins to untie the sack when Lenny suddenly appears, jamming the metal shard through Tommy's throat. Tommy gags on blood, and Evan surveys the scene in shock as Lenny drops to the floor, and Kayleigh wakes up screaming upon seeing the blood. Lenny is silhouetted against the sky, vibrating violently. In Evan's original college dorm, Dr. Redfield and Andrea exchange looks as Dr. Redfield points to the CAT-scan slides, indicating the outer lining of Evan's brain, while Andrea stares blankly. Dr. Redfield is awed by Evan's effortless interpretation. Evan discreetly checks his surroundings before using a security card to open a door, searching each room of the wing until he finds what moves him.",
    "581": "He heads towards her, and they are somehow situated as if they were alone in this crowd. Susan is in pain now; she can't summon an answer. They regard each other, and after a long pause, they have reached an understanding. He takes her in his arms, and they dance away. On a distant fringe of the party, on a grass terrace that still commands a view of the dance floor, is Joe. His eyes are on Parrish and Susan; he watches them admiringly yet ruefully. A Waiter passes, catches sight of Joe, and stops. Joe regards the Waiter for a moment. The Waiter hesitates, then moves off. Joe's attention returns to Parrish and Susan; the dance number ends with a BOOM. On the dance floor, Parrish looks up and sees Joe up on the terrace, waiting. Suddenly, he hugs her, holding her very close. She looks at him; he smiles, nods, but doesn't release her until she smiles back. Now she heads out with the crowd for the fireworks. When Parrish senses she is on her way, he turns and heads up towards Joe. Joe rises to meet Parrish as he approaches. They watch the guests gathering to view the fireworks. Joe waits and regards Parrish, waiting until he has a sense that Parrish has accepted what Joe has said, then Joe continues. Parrish waits, smiles faintly, takes a deep breath, and strides out again, Joe right with him. In tandem, they continue on and disappear over the crest of the hill. A barrage of fireworks lights up the sky. Down below, Susan, in a pained reflex, again turns and looks up towards the hill. She hesitates, then glides away from the party, her step quickening as she walks up towards the hill. Susan halts, and in the distance, a figure is approaching from over the crest of the hill where Joe and Parrish disappeared. He is heading straight for her; she tries to make him out, seems to recognize him, and starts to walk towards him as if pulled by a magnet. Now she stops again. It is a man who keeps coming, and now that he is close, she recognizes him. Something about him makes Susan slightly tentative. Joe shrugs, scratches his head endearingly, uncertain of time and place. Some realization is dawning on Susan, rendering her lightheaded. Susan regards Joe intently, searching his face for an answer. Susan holds herself very still. She searches the Young Man's eyes; his face is open, completely vulnerable, waiting for her response. After a long silence, the words come out haltingly. Susan sighs, the Young Man smiles gently, and they are completely intent on each other. Susan smiles as the fireworks finale goes off, the MUSIC comes up from below, and the night fills with light.",
    "582": "A plane takes off from Orlando International Airport amid heavy clouds. In a room, a digital clock on a bedside table reads 7:13 and then turns to 7:14. A naked dark-haired woman, with her hair falling around her shoulders, sits up on a bed and then gets off the bed. A naked man sleeping on his stomach wakes up as the woman takes a purse and walks out of the room; the man picks up a cell phone, sits up in bed, drinks from an almost empty beer bottle, and watches the shapely woman reenter the room. The woman picks out some clothes, slips on a thong, and the man lights a cigarette while the woman lights a joint. The man lies on his back, the woman climbs on the bed and straddles the man, puts the joint to his lips, then gets off the bed. The man smokes a cigarette, sits up, and snorts a line of cocaine. He walks out of the room dressed in a black suit, sporting dark glasses under a pilot's cap, with an airplane pin on his lapel. As rain lashes the airport and lightning flashes in the distance, people run across the tarmac. The man, now in a raincoat, walks under a parked South Jet airplane, pauses near one of the wheels, opens his mouth, sprays some mouth freshener, trots to the mobile stairway leading to the passenger walkway, and slips on the first step. He joins the passengers through a side door and sits next to his co-pilot, Whitaker. Whip inhales oxygen and fidgets on his side of the cockpit as Ken watches him brush his hair. Meanwhile, a woman steps out of her room at Hotel Atlanta, carrying a folded-up massage table, wearing a dress, and showing a small tattoo on her shoulder. She pulls some bills from a bundle of cash, walks to a car, and places the massage table in the trunk. She smokes as she makes a call from the driver's seat, leans on the steering wheel, and lowers the phone to the passenger seat. A man snorts coke and looks Nicole over, while Brad drops his towel and holds a small square. Elsewhere, Margaret sits facing Trina. Back in the plane, Whip pushes the side-stick forward, the cockpit shakes, and Whip takes the yoke and pulls back as they ascend. The plane shakes, and items fall from the overhead bins. Ken casts an uneasy sideways glance at Whip, who, with eyes on the horizon, steers the plane through the rough air. He moves the side-stick forward, the altimeter slides quickly to the right as the plane rises, and they reach a clearing through clouds and bright sunlight as Whip levels out.",
    "13": "Jane picks up the address book, frowning, and we're across from her window, looking in as she speaks into the phone, though we can't hear her. Meanwhile, Barbara Fitts stands at the stove, flipping bacon strips mechanically with her eyes focused elsewhere. She is at least ten years younger than her husband and is pretty in a June Cleaver-ish way. Ricky enters and startles Barbara, who turns to him as she attempts to serve him bacon. Ricky serves himself scrambled eggs from another pan, then joins his father at the table. The Colonel sits at a dinette reading The Wall Street Journal, and then he and Barbara look at each other, alarmed. The Colonel heads toward the living room, a little puffed up, and opens the front door to reveal the two Jims. Jim #1 holds out a basket filled with flowers, vegetables, and a small white cardboard box tied with raffia, as the Colonel stares at them, suspicious. The Jims look at each other, then back at the Colonel, who looks at them confused, but then it dawns on him. The Colonel drives, staring darkly at the road ahead, with Ricky in the passenger seat using a calculator and jotting numbers down in a notebook. The Colonel looks at Ricky sharply, and his eyes flash angrily. After a beat, as Ricky continues his calculations, he realizes a response is expected from him, so he sighs and then looks at his father. The Colonel is taken aback but quickly covers, and Ricky goes back to his calculations, totaling two columns of numbers. Jane and Angela are standing with two other teenage girls, who then move away from them. The Colonel's Ford Explorer pulls up, and Ricky gets out. Angela stares at Jane, then her mouth widens into a smile as Jane suddenly finds Ricky standing in front of her, looking at her intently with his eyes searching hers. Jane is unnerved and has to look away, so Ricky smiles and walks off while Angela shoots a wide-eyed look at Jane, who ignores it. The Colonel and Barbara are seated on a couch, watching television, and while the Colonel is smiling, enjoying the show, Barbara just stares. The Colonel chuckles at a joke and startles her, as the three of them stare at the TV like strangers in an airport. We follow them as they pass a sign, and inside the ballroom, well-dressed real estate professionals stand in clumps, chatting, while catering waiters serve hors d'oeuvres. Carolyn's jaw tightens, then she drags Lester toward a silver-haired man and his much younger wife, whom we recognize as Buddy Kane, the Real Estate King. Carolyn quickly joins in a little too loudly, smiling her most winning smile at him.",
    "165": "He turns and waves to the parlor window, where the three boys are — all bigger — and Ba holds a new addition; they all wave. Gandhi turns back and starts down the long, hilly street, gesturing Charlie on and starting to walk. Charlie nods uncertainly, looks back at the cab in confusion, signals the driver to follow, and hurries on to match strides with Gandhi's brisk pace. They come to a turning, nearer to town, where the area is poorer and run-down. Ahead of them, three youths in working clothes, carrying lunch boxes, lean indolently against a building directly in their path. They react to the sight of Gandhi — fun — and stride the pavement menacingly. One of them tosses aside his cigarette, and Gandhi restrains him and shakes his head. Gandhi starts to move forward. Charlie hesitates, then follows nervously, more nervous for Gandhi than himself. They are getting closer, with the youths laughing and whispering. One youth has flicked his cigarette hard, and it lands at Gandhi's feet. Gandhi pauses, looking at the youth, then starts forward again, almost on the youths, clearly frightened but determined. As he reaches forth to haul Gandhi from the pavement, a woman leans out of an upstairs window, looking down at the fracas disconcertedly. It is the first youth's mother, and her presence reduces the pitch of his hostility considerably. A snickering response comes from the other youths, who are embarrassed by the questioning disapproval of the mother's attitude. Gandhi steps back on the pavement, addressing the first youth, and steps around him, Charlie trailing, as the first youth stares at them sullenly. As they stride on, Charlie glances back, and Gandhi laughs as they turn the corner. They enter a busy street in the center of the town. Gandhi and Charlie come around the corner into it, and he pauses before an office where a young girl, Sonja, has come out to speak to him about something of urgency, but she hovers, not interrupting. He turns to Sonja, whose tone is loaded with foreboding, and Gandhi absorbs the news stiffly. Meanwhile, a strong masculine hand scrawls a signature across a document. Beneath the signature is the boldly printed identification: Jan Christian Smuts. A cameraman records the moment with a flash photo. General Smuts, whose presence matches his office, addresses someone out of shot as a male secretary removes the document. The reporter standing opposite him is Walker, much younger, almost boyish compared to the way we saw him at the funeral. Smuts has risen, knowing how to concede with grace. The gaze is firm, strong, and cynical, as the sides are half up, but it is dusty and hot.",
    "1144": "On his way out, Moody gives Harry a long look. The tadpole-like licorice snaps attract Harry's attention. He takes a handful. They nip his fingers with their sharp, little teeth. He drops them onto the floor and stomps on them. Behind him, the doors of a cabinet swing open. A blue light glows from a large, stone vase in front of a flicking mirror. Harry slowly walks towards it. Reflected in the mirror, he gazes down into the shining blue bowl. The cloudy surface swirls. Harry sees a glow at the bottom of a deep shaft. He finds himself falling down into a crowded courtroom. He lands in a chair, sitting next to someone he recognizes. The man next to him shakes hand with Professor Dumbledore right through Harry. A disheveled man appears in a cage in front of the judge, Mr. Crouch. Rita Skeeter gasps. Moody aims his wand at a young man hurrying from his seat. Barty is dragged to the bench. His tongue flickers like a snake. Mr. Crouch is transfixed, horrified. Harry falls from the bowl to the floor in Professor Dumbledore's room. He puts his wand to his temple and drops a thread of memory into the pensieve. Leaving Dumbledore's room, Harry hears voices from the open door of Snape's storeroom. Harry sees the dark mark on Karkaroff's arm. Karkaroff leaves quickly. He shows Harry a small bottle. Tiny Professor Flitwick conducts the school band. The stands are crowded with flag-waving supporters. An enthusiastic, Mr. Diggory runs in, encouraging the crowd to cheer as an embarrassed Cedric enters the arena. Fleur follows. Her classmates perform a cheerleader routine. Draco and his crony support Viktor Krum, who appears with Karkaroff. A concerned Dumbledore accompanies Harry who looks around nervously. Standing in front of a tall hedge, Dumbledore addresses the crowd. They gather around Dumbledore. Harry stands before a narrow opening in the hedge. Mr. Diggory hugs Cedric tearfully. Harry gives Cedric a friendly nod. Once again, Filch lights the cannon too soon. Moody pats Harry encouragingly on the shoulder as he tentatively enters the maze. Dumbledore watches him go. Harry looks back towards the entrance and sees Moody pointing surreptitiously to the left. He stares uncertainly down the narrow, misty path. Suddenly, the hedges close together behind him, blocking the way out. Harry swallows hard and follows the direction Moody has indicated. Each long path looks exactly the same. The thick, hewn hedges rise 25 feet on either side. Above his head, he can only see a narrow strip of sky. The intricate maze extends far around him stretching away into the distance of the mist-covered valley. Harry moves slowly and cautiously between the hedges. He turns and looks behind him fearfully.",
    "7": "The Colonel looks coldly down at us from Ricky's bedroom window, then pulls the drapes shut. Cars zoom past in the rain while Carolyn sits behind the wheel, listening to a motivational tape on the stereo. Carolyn leans over, opens the glove compartment, and takes out her Glock. Jane stands across the room, and Angela is sprawled across the bed as there is a knock on the door. Jane jumps up, opens the door, and lets him in. Angela stares at him, stunned, then starts toward the door and exits, slamming the door behind her. Jane turns to Ricky, and he takes her in his arms. Angela sits on the stairs, shaken and crying. We move slowly toward the Burnham's garage window through the rain. Through the window, we see Lester, wearing only his sweatpants, performing bench presses, and the Colonel standing outside, watching. We zoom slowly in on the Colonel as he watches, transfixed. Lester finishes his last rep, racks the weights, sits up sweaty and out of breath, and then glances at us, aware he's being watched. Lester and the Colonel stare at each other through the window as we're directly outside the garage door, slowly revealing Lester smiling at us. The rain comes down in sheets with a sharp clap of thunder. The Colonel moves stiffly, seems preoccupied and slightly disoriented, and just stands there looking at Lester before moving closer and grinning. Lester grins as well and places his hand on the Colonel's shoulder. The Colonel closes his eyes and then kisses him. Lester is momentarily stunned and then pushes the Colonel away. The Colonel's face crumples in shame as he stares at the floor, blinking, then turns and runs out the open garage door into the rainy night. Carolyn is still listening to the same motivational tape, holding the Glock in her hand, before she switches the tape off and puts the gun in her purse. The Mercedes pulls away from the shoulder. Lester enters, opens the refrigerator, grabs a beer, opens it, and starts toward the family room. Lester leans against the wall and takes a swig of his beer. As we move slowly around a corner, Angela comes into view, standing at the stereo, holding a CD case. She's been crying; her face is puffy, and her hair is mussed. She regards us apprehensively, then puts on a slightly defiant smile. Angela smiles as Lester holds the bottle up to her mouth and she drinks clumsily. He gently wipes her chin with the back of his hand.",
    "971": "Turning the corner, David runs down another street and catches up to Elise as she makes another turn on foot. She stops, grins, squirms, takes a breath, and eyes him. Meanwhile, a man runs down a corridor; it's the boyish officer. He opens a door marked Mr. Richardson and finds the veteran officer at his desk. The messenger shows a map book, and the officer grabs his brown fedora. In the hall, he passes Harry, who doffs his hat, and the boyish officer, now sporting his own hat, follows Richardson through a door. They arrive in a cafe co-room and see David and Elise. The boyish officer checks his map book, and a host seats them. His book shows pulsing red dots. Outside, David glances aside, and at their outdoor table, Elise smiles to herself and peeks at David. The officers share a table as David glances around while a server fills his water glass. Richardson and his aide follow a walkway to a spot overlooking the outdoor dining area, where the aide checks his map book, and a red inflection point pulses larger. Charlie and a third officer arrive, and Charlie pays the check. Elise grins at David, while Richardson and his aide look on. As David and Elise go to kiss, Richardson triggers a text to Charlie, whose interjection prevents the kiss. David nods amiably and gives Elise a long kiss on the cheek, and a relieved Richardson bows his head as she nods, smiling radiantly. Later, by the Brooklyn Bridge, David exits a Town Car and shakes many hands, then takes the podium before a crowd of hundreds. The gathering overlooks the East River, and Richardson's aide gets a text that the rehearsal has been moved back to Cedar Lake. David peers across the river to Pier 17. In a quaint eclectic apartment, Elise puts on a hoodie and picks up her cell, reading a text message that rehearsal is back at Cedar Lake, not Pier 17. David's senate race gathering wraps up, and he spies Richardson in a window. Both Adjustment officers duck out of sight, and David frowns at the Pier 17 structures across the river while Richardson pouts. David stares at the now empty window. A large water taxi crosses the river, and David rides aboard it as the skipper pilots it to the pier. David hurries onto the platform and up some stairs, following a covered walkway alongside a commercially refurbished warehouse. Finding a studio door chain-locked, he makes a call on his cell, but his phone reads disconnected, call failed, searching for signal. With a determined gaze, David jogs off the pier as Richardson and his aide observe. The officers follow David in the map book, and David rounds a corner, coming face to face with the two officers.",
    "1047": "McCullough proffers the phone as Ashton stares at them soberly, and a bomb explodes on the ground floor of the hotel. Ashton goes to the window and peers down at strewn bodies and flaming debris while McCullough holds out the phone and shoots Ashton a solemn look. A blast blows the door open and throws them to the floor, and a man in a balaclava enters holding a pistol. He dispatches Heinkin, McCullough, and Cavic then trains the pistol on the President, who cowers in a corner. A bright, white flash occurs, and events run in reverse order. Gunshots are fired, and black smoke rises from the bomb blast as the President's double is shot. Ashton sits safely in his limousine while Anna receives an ice cream cone and nods, and seated, Sam smiles at Anna. Veronica talks with a handsome, heavy-featured man, Javier, and she holds up a bracelet. Javier glares at her and flexes his jaw as raven-haired Veronica produces a cell phone and plays him a video of a bound and gagged man in his 20s. He grabs her wrist, takes the bracelet, grabs her head, and glowers, inches from her face, before letting go and striding off. Javier's eyes meet with Enrique's as they pass each other, and Javier walks past curly-haired Marie and pony-tailed Anna. Seated at his table in the cafe, Sam toggles through screens on his PDA phone, uses a touch screen wand to initiate a phone call, and glances at the television. A bellboy answers a phone in the hotel reception, and Felipe the bellboy hangs up the phone as the motorcade enters the underground parking lot. Javier answers his mobile and takes the phone from his ear, then gasps as he approaches the hotel. Sam punches buttons on his phone and talks into the mic of his hands-free kit. On TV, Ashton's double approaches the podium and pushes a button. A police constable scans Javier with a metal detector outside the Hotel Vesta, points at Javier's pocket, and Javier takes out a cell phone. Felipe opens the door for a woman entering the hotel. Javier approaches, shakes a man’s hand, placing a small envelope into it, and enters the lobby, which is filled with Secret Service agents. Javier talks into his cell phone as he passes the suited agents, lowers his phone, and calls an elevator. He turns the credit card-sized envelope in his hands. Sam steps out of the cafe onto the sunny street, the wire from his hands-free kit trailing down his white T-shirt to the phone in his hand, as the huge enclosed square of the plaza is surrounded by terra cotta colored buildings. Inside, Sam, holding a small Spanish flag, strolls to the back of the crowd.",
    "146": "The scene begins with another angle where some of the marchers turn at a shout, while a few of the tail-enders are watching, some running clear of the police, and some being beaten. Two police officers have a man on the ground, and one policeman looks up. Patel leans with one arm on a table, feeling as devastated as Gandhi, while looking at an Indian paper on the table by his hand. It is a New York Times, and a picture of a severed head lying in smoldering ashes is glimpsed. Nehru and Azad are in the background with Desai, and Jinnah, dressed in a finely cut European suit, is among others who are dressed in tunics of homespun. They turn to Jinnah with a sense of surprise but do not really believe he means his statement. Patel looks up hopelessly at Jinnah, while Azad senses and fears what is going to happen, keeping his eyes fixed on Gandhi. Patel looks at him with mounting annoyance as Gandhi listens, withdrawn into himself. Jinnah turns away in anger, Patel sighs, and Nehru feels helpless but continues to try. Gandhi stares into nothing, mulling things over, while Nehru is surprised. Nehru ignores the thought and, like Azad, focuses on the real danger. Gandhi looks up at him with resigned fatalism. Mirabehn walks across the grounds toward Gandhi’s bungalow, carrying a small tray with a pitcher and a glass. In the background, a few people work while a mass of people camp near the entrance, all waiting. The steps of Gandhi's bungalow are shown, where a doctor in a white tunic sits on the porch, reading, with a stethoscope and blood pressure equipment on a small table beside him. He looks up at Mirabehn as she mounts the steps and nods. Mirabehn reaches the doorway and is stopped. In the shadows, Ba sits by Gandhi's mat bed, holding him as he experiences a spasm of dry retching, his face to the wall. When he finishes, he lies almost limp in her arms, and she gently lowers him to the mat, stroking his head. Mirabehn stiffens herself, not yet a devotee and nurse, removes her sandals, and walks across the room. She strokes Gandhi's sweating head again, touches his shoulder, and then gets up. For a moment, the two women hold each other's gaze. Ba smiles weakly, leaning her head into the taller Mirabehn's shoulder, then straightens and leaves without looking back. Mirabehn bends and sits by Gandhi's side.",
    "443": "Helen and Wick watch Don, and Don's face relaxes into an innocent grin as his eyes meet Helen's, while hers are infinitely distressed. Wick has twisted the string off the bottle and, with the bottle in his hand, moves through the living room toward the kitchenette. Don looks after him and then follows him, a stubborn smile on his lips. Wick steps to the sink, opens the bottle, turns it upside down, and lets the whiskey run out. Helen trails after them, acutely embarrassed. Don and Helen reach the doorway from the living room and stand watching. Don feels as though he is watching the execution of a very good friend, but with Helen's eyes on him, he maintains his nonchalant expression. Once the bottle is emptied, Wick puts it in the sink, shrugs, and goes to the hall for his hat. Helen kisses him on the mouth, a woman hopelessly in love. She turns to go, but Don holds her back; then, to prevent him from seeing her moist eyes, she turns and hurries into the entrance hall. Wick turns toward Don, who has followed Helen to the entrance hall. Helen comes quickly out, takes a handkerchief from her bag, and hurries past Wick into the hall. Wick stands, hat in hand, holding the door open, then goes out, shutting the door behind him. Don rushes to the door, pressing his ear against it to hear what Wick and Helen are saying outside. The passage is narrow and simple, with a light bracket always burning every so often down the stair. A skylight, somewhat obscured by dirt and dust, lights the fourth floor back. They descend a few steps, and Wick quickly takes Helen's arm as they continue down the stairs. Don stands at the door, panic on his face, wondering if his brother has discovered the other two bottles. He puts the chain on the door to ensure his privacy, then dashes into the bathroom. Don rushes in, takes a nail file, kneels beside the grille of a register in the side wall, pries it open with the file, looks inside, puts his hand in, looks at the hole wide-eyed, pushes the grille back, and runs out. He then runs in, goes to the couch, pulls it away from the wall, throws himself on his belly on the couch, and reaches under the side of it towards the wall. His hand explores among the springs. He sits up with a face covered in sweat, takes out his handkerchief, and wipes his face. Just then, from the direction of the entrance door, there is the noise of a key being turned in the lock. The door opens as far as the chain will allow, stopping with a sharp bite of metal on wood.",
    "176": "Ray Bones steps on Harry's neck with his shoe, pinning him to the floor, and Harry can't speak because his jaw is broken. Harry looks sad lying there, pinned beneath Ray Bones' shoe, wondering how it all went so wrong. As a crumpled heap, Harry looks up and we see his bloody, pummeled face as Ray Bones quickly crosses the room, pulls a 9mm from his coat pocket, and aims it at Harry's face. Ray Bones looks over when Ronnie Wingate strolls into the office, and Harry looks glad to see him. Ronnie opens his jacket so Ray Bones can see the .357 tucked into his belt. Bones looks at the gun, looks up at Ronnie standing there, hands on his hips, jacket open, then raises his own gun. Harry looks pleadingly at Ray Bones, then rolls over onto his side. Meanwhile, Chili is sitting in a chaise longue by the pool with a beer in hand, and Karen watches him from the doorway. He looks over, and she comes over and sits down. Chili looks at Karen for a moment, and as she feels him staring, she keeps her eyes on the sunset and tries to change the subject. Chili looks at her, puts his drink down, leans over, and kisses her. Later, Karen and Chili lie in bed together, and she looks at him before leaning over to kiss him. They both jerk upright as Doris leads them towards the triage area, where they exchange a look and follow her in. Doris smiles as two uniformed cops walk past Harry, who lies in bed in a pain-killer stupor, with his face swollen and purple and both eyes black. They all look over as a Resident walks over, trailed by several, and they step back as the Resident pulls the curtain shut, blocking their view of Harry. Meanwhile, standing beside a giant mutant maggot or something, Bo Catlett looks at the Bear and smiles at Farrah. Bear watches uncomfortably as Farrah sits down with Bo, who looks up at the Bear and winks at Farrah, then keeps his mouth close to her ear and opens the door for her. Chili's minivan is parked out front, and as the valet drives off with it, a cab pulls up and Harry, with his hands bandaged and neck in a massive brace, gets out. Harry waves them off, points to himself, and mumbles through his wired jaw, then pushes past them and limps up the steps while all eyes are on him as they're led to a table.",
    "129": "In contrast to those around him, there is tension in Godse's face, an air of danger in his movements. He glances at two policemen who are talking casually, absorbed in their own gossip, then looks back at another Tonga that pulls up just behind his. Two young men, Apte and Karkare, meet Godse's gaze, and again there is a sense of imminent danger. They descend and pay their driver absently, their eyes watching the crowd. Sitting alone in the shadows of a stationary Tonga a little distance down the street, an elderly man named Prakash with a short, close-cropped beard and the taut, sunken flesh of a cadaver is watching. Apte and Karkare look back at him. There is just the slightest acknowledgment, and then Prakash lifts his eyes to the gate, as though to tell them to be about their business. Godse hesitates before approaching the two gardeners who nonchalantly flank the entrance. He stiffens himself, cautiously touches something under his khaki jacket, then glances back at the stoic face of Prakash. Prakash's gaze is as firm and unrelenting as a death's head. Godse turns back, wetting his lips nervously, then moves into the middle of a group going through the gate. A fairly numerous crowd is gathering here, informally filling the area on one side of a walk that leads to a little pavilion -- some devout, some curious, some just eager to be near the great man. Apte and Karkare move to different sides of Godse, staying a little behind, their movements sly and wary, aware of people watching. He is seen distantly through the crowd. He is not seen clearly until the very last moment, only glimpses of him as he smiles and exchanges little jokes with some of the crowd and the two young women who support him, occasionally joining his hands together in greeting to someone in particular, then once more proceeding with a hand on the shoulder of each of the girls. The camera keeps moving closer, and the point of view is always Godse's, but Gandhi is always in profile or half obscured by the heads and shoulders of those in front. Godse slides through to the very front rank. His breathing is short, and there is perspiration around the sides of his temples. Now, for an instant, Gandhi is seen close from his point of view. He is only a few steps away, but turned to speak to someone on the other side, and Manu half obscures him. Godse swallows dryly, tension lining his face, then moves boldly out into Gandhi's path, bumping Manu and knocking a vessel for incense from her hands. Ignoring her, his nerves even more taut, Godse joins his hands together and bows in greeting to the Mahatma.",
    "600": "Bellatrix sets down the ornament and glares at Snape. Narcissa glances at her sister then looks anxiously back to Snape, stands, and they both stare at Bellatrix. Bellatrix steps towards Snape, moves behind him, but then walks away while staring, open-mouthed. Narcissa and Snape grasp each other's right wrist, and Bellatrix waves her wand, causing a glowing cord to bind their wrists together. Narcissa stares unwaveringly at Snape as Bellatrix stands close to him. The cord binding their wrists fades and disappears, Narcissa releases her grip, and flexes her wrist. At a shop called Pieces of Modern Magic, outside, a mechanical man makes the rabbit on his head disappear under a big top hat. The Weasley twins are present, a boy looks sick, and Ron watches a mechanical toy of Dolores Umbridge balancing on a tightrope. A boy walks up a wall. Harry spots a strange substance, and the twins give him some. A handsome youth, Cormac, smiles at Hermione who puts down a love potion. Ron turns to Hermione and Harry, and they pass Lavender, a girl with curly hair, who watches him go. Outside, a little dragon breathes flames, roasting chestnuts, which a boy buys before sliding down a chute into a bag. They're in Diagon Alley and enter the empty and burned-out shop the Death Eaters attacked, with Harry leading, followed by Ron and then Hermione. Ron stops by a window and looks out. Narcissa and Draco look around furtively before entering a narrow alley. The trio leave Ollivander's and peek around the corner where there's a wanted poster for Fenrir Greyback, the bearded Death Eater who attacked the shop. They follow the Malfoys down the gloomy alleyway as the Malfoys descend steps to a shop with a sign above its door, Borgin and Burke. Narcissa strides in, and Draco follows, while the three friends look up as a light comes on in an arched window in the rear of the shop. They climb onto an adjoining roof and watch as the Malfoys are led across a courtyard below into a high room that reaches from the ground floor to the roof. They see Draco running his hands over a tall, triangular, embossed wooden cabinet, and several figures approach Draco as Harry hauls himself up to get a better view. Narcissa kisses her son's cheek, and someone appears at a window. Harry, Hermione, and Ron duck down as a thin-faced man with a beard looks out and lowers the blind. Harry looks up and breathes a sigh of relief. The Hogwarts Express chugs through barren moorland, where Luna holds magazines and Ginny has a Pygmy Puff. Ginny reads the cover, and Luna saunters along the corridor with her magazines. Further back on the train, Hermione, Harry, and Ron have a compartment to themselves.",
    "339": "Theoden bows slightly to the hooded figure and leaves, shooting Aragorn a strange look as he goes. The figure stands and pulls back the hood to reveal Elrond. Elrond's face is etched with pain. Aragorn receives this news, ashen-faced. Elrond's eyes fall to the Evenstar, which hangs around Aragorn's neck. Aragorn looks at Elrond in shock. A fleet of black sails moves along a silver ribbon of water. Elrond hesitates a beat. A sudden wind rushes through the tent, lifting hangings, scattering maps, knocking over goblets. As Aragorn looks at Elrond, an image flashes in his mind's eye of the ghostly figure on the Dimholt Road. Aragorn looks at Elrond in shock. Aragorn's eyes fall to a plain black scabbard, which Elrond draws from beneath his robes. Elrond's long white fingers draw the hilt of a sword from the scabbard to reveal an Elven sword glinting in the firelight. Aragorn takes the sword, staring at it in wonder. Aragorn draws the long blade from its sheath. Elrond stares hard at Aragorn. A heavy silence hangs in the room. Aragorn re-sheathes the sword. As Aragorn readies Brego for leaving, Eowyn approaches, her temper barely held in check. Aragorn looks over his shoulder at her and then rounds on her. Aragorn looks at her sadly, not wanting to hurt her. Eowyn steps back as though struck; she watches stricken as Aragorn leaves. Aragorn leads his horse through the tents towards the Dimholt Road. A light flares ahead of him, and a short figure steps out of the shadows, pipe in hand. Aragorn looks at Gimli, grateful for his courage but determined to go alone. Aragorn looks at Legolas as he appears, leading his horse, already saddled. Gimli steps closer to Aragorn. Aragorn shakes his head, smiling his acceptance. Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli slowly ride towards the back of the plateau, past the ancient standing stones that lead to the narrow pass. Theoden and Gamling watch the retreating figures of Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli. Rohan soldiers emerge from their tents, crestfallen to see Aragorn leave. Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli disappear into the shadows of the mountains. Theoden moves forward and looks at Eowyn, who stands as if turned to stone, looking up at a lightening sky, the quiet before the men depart for war. Eowyn turns to the king, her face a blank. Theoden moves towards her, taking up her hand. Eowyn slowly lifts her head. Theoden lifts Eowyn's face to look into her eyes. Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli make their way up a gloomy canyon, shadowed by black fir trees. The shadowed ridges of the Dwimorberg Mountain rise before them. It is a spooky place. Silence surrounds them; there are no birds, no wind.",
    "463": "The Man In Black sits to rest on the boulder that once held the rope and tugs off his leather boots, amazed to see several large rocks tumble out. He wears gloves, and Inigo stares at them, baffled by the question that arises as he glances up. He hands his sword to the Man In Black, and even now, this still brings pain. The Man In Black looks up at Inigo, and on that word, what begins is one of the two greatest sword fights in modern movies. Right from the beginning, it looks different as the Six-Fingered Sword feints here and there. The two men, after teasing, begin to duel in earnest, their swords crossing repeatedly with sound coming so fast it's almost continual. Inigo presses on, forcing the Man In Black to retreat up a rocky incline, shifting his style as he perches at the edge of an elevated castle ruin. Inigo stares down at him and, with the grace of an Olympian, flies off the perch, somersaulting over the Man In Black's head to land facing him. The two men almost fly across the rocky terrain, maintaining balance and finesse, with the advantage shifting back and forth. Meanwhile, the deadly edge of the Cliffs of Insanity draws closer behind them. Inigo fights with skill, but the Man In Black gradually gains the advantage, forcing Inigo back towards the deathly brink. Inches from defeat, Inigo remains all smiles and switches the six-fingered sword to his right hand, turning the tide of battle. The Man In Black, stunned, does everything he can to keep Inigo by the cliff edge, but to no avail. Slowly at first, then faster, Inigo gains control, and the Man In Black retreats desperately. The six-fingered sword becomes almost invisible with Inigo's ferocious attack as he switches styles again. Facing a rocky staircase leading to a turret-shaped plateau, the Man In Black retreats madly up the steps, unable to stop Inigo, who is unstoppable as the Man In Black, in a frenzy, makes every feint and thrust, letting go with all he has left.",
    "232": "Szpilman is in a messy room and goes into the kitchen, where he takes a small, flat greaseproof paper parcel from a bread tin and unwraps it. As he continues attempting to cut the bread, there's a loud hammering on the front door, causing him to stiffen. The hammering persists as Szpilman stumbles into the room, looking around in confusion. Female voices are heard indistinctly from the other side of the door, prompting Szpilman into action. He hurriedly puts on a crumpled jacket, grabs his tattered coat and scarf, collects some of his belongings, and stuffs them into a paper bag. When the hammering stops, Szpilman cautiously approaches the door, listens, and then opens it quietly to slip out. He exits the flat, descends the stairs, and stops abruptly upon encountering Kitty, a young and fierce woman, blocking his way. Hesitating as she shouts louder, Szpilman musters all his strength to dash past her, clattering down the stairs to the ground-floor landing. Another woman attempts to stop him, but he pushes past her and exits the house into heavy snow. Szpilman stumbles into the street, runs, and darts down a side street, entering a narrow passage. He stops, nearly collapsing, but maintains control, leaning against a wall. Removing a shoe, he retrieves a scrap of paper from Gebczynski and reads it before dragging himself through the snow and slush to a villa. He rings the doorbell, which is answered by Dorota, who is pregnant. They stare at each other momentarily before Szpilman follows Dorota into the living room and sits down slowly. An awkward silence ensues as he gazes at her while she looks away. After a brief silence, Michal Dzikiewicz enters the room, sees Szpilman, and shakes his hand. Dizzy, Szpilman leans on the table for support as he and Dorota watch him. Later, Szpilman is asleep on the sofa, awakened by the sound of a cello. He opens his eyes, listens, swings his legs off the sofa, stands, and quietly opens a door to see another room. He sees Dorota, partially turned away, playing Bach on the cello, and listens intently. Hearing a padlock being unlocked, followed by a key turning in a Yale lock, the door opens for Michal and Szpilman to enter a flat with a large, sparsely furnished room containing an upright piano and a bed.",
    "952": "Joe, Alice, and Cary pick themselves up and watch as a steady stream of metallic bits and pieces stream up towards the water tower and meld into the ever-growing structure on top of it. Alice smiles as the vast structure begins to take shape. A Jeep drives up, and Joe sees his dad and Louis get out of it. Jack looks up at the water tower, then spots Joe. Joe nudges Alice, who looks around and sees her dad with Jack. The dads walk towards them, and Joe and Alice go to meet them. Jack cups Joe's face in his hands, then hugs him tightly; their faces are tense with a mixture of emotion and relief. Eyes closed, they hold each other tight. Alice looks over at her father as he steps up to her. They regard each other for a moment, then hug. Joe looks over Jack's shoulder at the water tower and sees the alien climbing up it. The creature steps into the now fully formed spaceship it's created on top of the water tower, and the door closes behind it. The spaceship powers up, and several arms on it rotate. Many bright lights on the arms shine out. Joe separates from his father and is just in time to grab his mother's locket, which is being drawn towards the tower. It hangs in the air, pulled by an invisible force. The locket clicks open, revealing the picture inside, which is of Joe's mother holding him as a baby. Joe lets go of the locket's chain, and it floats up towards the water tower. Joe and the others watch as the locket sticks to the side of the tower. Suddenly, the tower explodes in a shower of water, deluging the street below. The spaceship, which resembles the canopy of a palm tree, lifts into the air. The water tower collapses and crashes down into the street, scattering soldiers standing there and crushing their vehicles. Joe, Alice, Louis, and Jack watch as the spacecraft gains altitude in a blaze of bright lights. Hobbling through town, Charles and Martin sit sailing up into the night sky. Still stoned in his car, Donny slumbers on as the spaceship flies by, its lights reflected in his windshield. As they watch it recede into the distance, Joe and Alice hold hands. Smiles spread across their faces. The spacecraft becomes a dot of light high up in the sky. Gradually, it becomes a pinpoint and then dies away altogether. A chalk outline of a body is drawn on the floor. Martin arrives as the detective and talks to a witness at Romero Chemicals. Martin gets up and puts his hat on. Preston, as the President, makes a call.",
    "1381": "As Ron and Harry exchange a curious glance, the bell continues to chime. At this point, the time reversal ends, and the room is empty except for Harry and Hermione. As Hermione unloops the necklace, Harry glances around in confusion while Hermione ignores the question and eyes the clock on the wall. Hermione grabs Harry's arm and slams through the door as they come to a mad, huffing halt. She holds up a hand, silencing him. Annoyed, Harry follows her gaze and blinks in disbelief as he sees himself, along with Hermione and Ron, about to confront Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle near the monoliths. Dumbfounded, Harry turns as Hermione holds up the hourglass. A soft smack is heard, and they turn to see Malfoy land on the seat of his pants in the Sundial Garden, rubbing his kisser. Hermione pulls Harry under the bridge, and seconds later, footsteps clamor over their heads. Seconds later, Harry emerges and marvels at the sight of himself, Hermione, and Ron heading down the slope to Hagrid's hut. His eyes shift to the pumpkin patch, and Harry nods, then looks toward the hut where Hagrid is handing Scabbers to Ron. As he starts to rise, Hermione grabs him and speaks fiercely, then watches Fudge and the others drawing closer. She frowns and glances into the hut. Just then, on the ground beside her, Hermione notices a jagged star-shaped stone and instantly grabs it, rises, and hurls it through the open window. Smash! The sound of a glass jar shattering is heard within the hut. Hermione ignores him and swiftly whistles a second stone through the window, hitting the back of Harry's head. Crows begin to drop atop the roof as Fudge's party arrives and raps on the door. Harry and Hermione watch themselves start up the slope, and with the coast clear, they slip out of the trees. As Harry vaults into the patch, the crows stir, cawing at his ankles and pecking at his feet. Buckbeak refuses to move. Harry and Hermione shoo Buckbeak along and disappear into the forest just as Dumbledore concludes his reverie. Harry and Hermione, their view unobstructed by the low stand of trees this time, watch the Executioner approach the pumpkin patch. Quickly, the confusion in his masked eyes turns to anger as the Executioner lifts his blade and, with a brutal fury, plunges it into the flesh of a pumpkin with a sickening chop. The crows scatter to the skies as Harry and Hermione race through the trees with Buckbeak loping easily behind. In a subjective point of view, they glide through a thicket of trees to the forest's edge where the trees thin, revealing the Whomping Willow thrashing. Hermione disappears down the hole, then a figure approaches the tree: Lupin.",
    "1105": "Thao meets Walt near the house, and Walt grabs his arm. Thao starts to walk away, stops and looks back, then goes. Walt wanders off, frowning. Spider and one of his sidekicks come out of a house and walk over to a Honda parked by the curb. They get in, watched from across the road by Walt, parked in his pickup truck, who grim-facedly watches the Honda drive off. Walt picks up his Colt .45 automatic and cocks it, then talks to Daisy. He gets out of the pickup truck. As Smokie comes out of the house, Walt grabs him, throws him onto the lawn, and kicks him repeatedly in the face, following up with a few punches. A cat scampers past, and Walt draws his gun. In the evening, it's raining as Walt drives his pickup truck back to his house. He parks on his drive, gets out with Daisy, walks up the steps onto the porch, and Daisy crosses his path. He bends down, picks up a key from under an ornament, winces as he straightens up, and unlocks the door. He and Daisy go inside. Walt cooks a barbeque for Sue, Thao, their mother, and Youa. Youa and Thao grin and nod. Walt points at the Gran Torino. Walt sits in his living room with Daisy, sipping a beer and watching a ball game on TV. Spider's car cruises down the street outside, and as it passes Thao's house, gang members discharge a couple of MAC-10 machine guns into the building. Hearing the noise, Walt leaps up and takes his Colt out of a drawer as bullets rip through Thao's house. Walt runs out onto his porch as the Honda speeds away, watches it go, then runs down off the porch and dashes into Thao's house. He runs into the living room where Thao is picking himself up, having a minor neck injury. She comes downstairs, and Thao makes a call, turns to a grim-faced Walt, and shakes his head, then begins to sob. Walt sits with Thao and his mother in their kitchen, sipping a rice liquor. Grandma sees a car go by outside and hurries to the door as everyone follows. Sue comes in with her face a bleeding mass of contusions. Watching, Walt drops his glass. Sue is helped to a chair by her mother and Grandma, blood running down her face and legs. Thao clings to his mother and sobs. Appalled, Walt stares at Sue, his mouth hanging open. He walks away from Thao's house, pushing the Colt into his belt, and walks into his kitchen, leaning against a worktop.",
    "756": "David reaches for it, loses it, sees it again, and at the third attempt, grasps it. Above the pole, bright lights shine into the pool. David struggles to the surface, clinging to the pole, lets go of it to claw his fingers over the pool edge. The pole slides away, and David hangs on grimly for a moment before hauling himself out of the water and crawling painfully slowly away from it. The two children are standing a few paces away, drenched by the rain, watching him. The pole is lying on the ground between them. David stands and looks at them. Liquid splashes onto the woman's bruised and bloody wrists, bound tightly by twists of wire. Looming over her, beer bottle in hand, the huge maintenance man spits a stream of liquid at her bruised face. David closes on him from behind, throws his left arm around the man's neck, and clamps his wrists with his other hand. The man tears at the choking arm, and slams David back into the bedroom wall. David's back leaves a dent in the plaster wall. The man tries to throw him off, but David squeezes his throat relentlessly. The man jabs him viciously in the ribs with his elbow, lifts him again, but can't escape the arm across his throat. He staggers across the room, lifting and twisting David, still trying to throw him off. They reel across the room and he smashes David into the wall again. He thrashes about, pulling desperately at the arm locked around his neck, and makes another backward rush into the wall before falling forward onto his knees. He rises off balance and David drags him back down. He sinks to the floor and David tightens his grip yanking against the man's neck. David throws off the inert form and the maintenance man falls face down, motionless. David crosses to the woman and quickly untwists the wire from her wrists. When they are free, her arms flop down. David steps back and the woman slumps sideways onto the floor, limp and unreacting. He stands over her, still in his cape, gazing down at her. David gently opens a closet door. Audrey's sleeping body in a white night dress is carried from the shadowy light of her room to the foot of the stairs. She opens her eyes in the brighter light of the hall, and lifts her head as David carries her up the staircase. She watches him, smiling very faintly, her long, fair hair falling back from her white forehead, and the light making a silver line of her profile, emphasizing her aquiline features, as she stares steadily up at him. He carries her along the landing and into the bedroom, where he lays her softly on the bed.",
    "606": "He closes the cabinet again. He opens the door a third time. The apple has returned. A large bite has been taken out. At the party, Harry has his photograph taken with Slughorn. Harry turns, and wearing a waiter's jacket, Neville walks away. Harry spots Hermione slipping into a curtain and pulls back the silk drapes to join her. She scuttles away as Cormac comes through the drapes. Snape opens the curtains, and Cormac throws up at his feet. Snape glares at him and walks away. Filch manhandles Draco into the room, and Draco glares at Snape. In a dark corridor, Snape has Draco pinned against a wall, and Harry overhears them from an adjoining corridor. The Hogwarts Express plows through snow-covered countryside. She breathes on the glass then draws, with her finger, the shape of a heart with an arrow through it. She looks lovingly at Ron, whose expression glazes over. She breathes on her love heart, then whispers through the closed door. Ron looks up as Hermione comes to the door. She sees the love heart, and Ron looks confused. They both look up at the fading love heart. Christmas at the Weasleys'. Nymphadora Tonks indicates to Harry to remain quiet. Tonks walks away, and Remus Lupin follows her, leaving Harry with Mr. Weasley. Ginny sits beside Harry with a plate of dainty mince pies. Mr. Weasley goes. She holds out a pie, and he takes a bite from the pie she's holding. Ron plunks down between them with a plate of bigger mince pies. Looking awkward, he turns to Harry and holds out the plate. Ron takes one and bites into it. Harry's with Mr. Weasley in his shed, and Harry looks at him thoughtfully. Later, the front door of the house opens, and Remus walks out, followed by Tonks. Remus looks out into the night, and Tonks steps forward with a concerned expression. Wearing a pink dressing gown, Ginny finds Harry sitting on the stairs. He stands up. She bends down and fastens the lace on his trainer. Ginny rises, and they stand close to each other. They lean closer. A ball of fire hurtles to the ground, creating a flaming circle around the house. In a swirl of black, Bellatrix appears. Harry races out of the house. She laughs and sprints away. Harry dashes through a gap in the flames, which closes, preventing Remus from giving chase. Tonks tries to control the flames with her wand. Ginny runs out and leaps through the flames. Harry chases Bellatrix through the tall reeds, with Ginny following. Harry stands still, surrounded by the swaying reeds. Hearing something, he starts to run again. Ginny is a little way behind. She ploughs through the undergrowth, ending up ankle-deep in water. She hears movement and steps back as a figure emerges from the reeds.",
    "758": "David's eyes open, and outside, the greenery is becoming a blur as the train is moving faster and shaking more than it did. He watches through the window and glances across the aisle at a man reading a book, who closes it and, like the woman beside him, begins to stare out of the window as the train shakes more violently. David looks up ahead and sees another passenger's hand reaching down to grab hold of an armrest. A car is driving down a quiet urban street, and in a living room, a boy lies over a sofa, his feet over the back, his head hanging down to the floor, flicking through TV channels with the remote, upside down. David slowly swings his legs over the side of a hospital trolley and sits up, and in front of him, a white bandaged figure is lying on another trolley. Dressed only in his shirt and trousers, David looks around uncertainly as a white-coated man carrying a clipboard, who has been standing by the other figure, walks towards David and is replaced by other medical staff. The man holds up a torch and examines David's eyes. David stares at the other trolley, and they both look at the person on the other trolley, whose chest is heaving unevenly. Still staring at the other figure, David slowly shakes his head and shakes his head again, watching a crimson stain slowly seeping through the bandages of the other passenger. David nods abstractedly as the crimson stain quickly spreads, and the other body heaves as blood forms a pool on top of the bandages. David walks stiffly down a hospital corridor lined with silent people standing, sitting, leaning against walls, many of them watching him and smiling. His son sees him, jumps up from the bench, and runs to him. David hugs his son to his chest, gives him a slight smile, and looks over his head at the slim fair-haired woman who has followed the boy. They stare at each other, and she moves forward and puts her head on his shoulder, his cheek against her hair. He puts his arm around her, gazing past her. She steps back, looks at David, then at the boy, her head on one side. The boy's lips move, and the three of them stand silently for a moment. Then the boy takes the woman's hand and puts it in his father's before setting off down the corridor. As his parents follow, they let go of each other's hands. A gaggle of reporters and photographers, one holding a long boom microphone, are standing inside the big double doors at the end of the corridor, and flashlights go off as David's family steps out into the open air.",
    "998": "The doctor walks over to him as he lays down the open book, and Nick stares at the silver pencil resting on the blank page. In his room, Nick starts to write while men stand on hills of coal waste, hacking away with pickaxes in a filthy industrial area. Nick is on a packed train with Tom when the train stops, and they jump from the train and run off. Tom leads Nick to a garage where she eyes Tom and smiles as Tom slips her some money, pointing at Nick. Myrtle eyes Nick, making him look nervous. Nick sits in Myrtle's apartment in town, watching her little dog eat leftovers off a plate in the extremely gaudy living room with red walls and furnishings and chintzy flower prints everywhere. Nick sits on the edge of the couch, glancing at the ceiling, frowning at the sound of Tom and Myrtle upstairs, and tentatively walks to the door. He puts on his straw boater and opens the door to find a sexy, young woman wearing lots of dark eye shadow and a green dress leaning on the door frame as Myrtle appears, weakening Nick, who smiles. Tom picks him up, while Catherine drapes herself around Nick in a chair, pops a pill in her mouth, and plants a kiss on Nick, transferring the pill into his mouth. In a clinch with Myrtle, Tom watches as Catherine guides Nick's glass to his lips and cocks an eyebrow at him. Tom dances with Myrtle, and Nick dances with Catherine as Chester takes pictures. Tom opens champagne and whacks Nick with a pillow, causing feathers to go everywhere, while a guy plays trumpet on a fire escape, and Tom picks Nick up and twirls him around. Catherine kisses Nick and pulls his shirt off as the girls strip down to their underwear and everyone's dancing. Nick sits watching woozily with Catherine slumped against him, and Myrtle wiggles her hips, pulls her red dress off her shoulder, and holds her arms in the air. Nick sits, drugged, as another version of himself pops a champagne cork, shakes the bottle, fizzing the champagne up, and pours some into his wide-open mouth. Tom pours champagne into the seated Nick's mouth from a ceramic goblet as Nick sways on the spot with glazed, drunken eyes, and his exuberant self rolls about on a bed with Catherine. The woozy Nick goes to a window and looks across at other apartments as a young black woman leans on her window ledge, looking out. He sees himself standing in the street, looking up, and his street self walks off as scenes play out in windows. Nick finds Chester sleeping and wipes cream off his face as Myrtle marches in, followed by Tom, who gives Myrtle a vicious backhander across the face. Nick retreats onto the fire escape as the city recedes.",
    "1322": "Bob springs into action, clearing the door and flipping the dead bolt. The door is opened and Michael charges past Charlie and out into hell. With stunning calm, Michael marches straight for the pumps. In the minivan, Audrey screams as the windows begin to crack. Michael grabs a gas pump, flips the lever, and points it at the minivan. The creatures covering the car turn to look at Michael as if they've just now noticed him, and that's when he starts spraying gas at them. Up comes Michael's Glock in his other hand and blam! blam! blam! The spray of gas explodes into a spray of fire! The minivan is engulfed in flames. Creatures tear away from the car like fiery comets through the night. The windows explode, showering Audrey with tiny shards of glass. Michael drops the gas pump. He reaches through a fire-rimmed broken car window and unlocks the door. Audrey looks up to see Michael's expressionless face circled. Charlie dashes behind the counter to the sink and fills up a pitcher of water. She turns away from the sink with the filled pitcher as the boy swings the knife at her, slicing open the waitress outfit covering her pregnant belly. Charlie tumbles back to the ground behind the counter. She frantically pushes herself away from the approaching boy. She's backed against the end of the counter! The boy raises the knife to strike. Charlie grabs a baking pan off a shelf and swings it out in front of her body like a shield, as the knife is driven down. Clang! The knife hits the pan hard and stops, but the boy's hands don't. They slip off the handle and run right down the blade. The knife clatters to the ground. The boy instinctively raises his hands to strike again, but there's no knife. Charlie watches in horror as the boy calmly realizes that his thumbs are missing. Blood sprays from the stumps. Charlie pulls her legs in close then rockets them out at the boy's chest. He's catapulted away from her. Michael leaps over the counter, landing in front of Charlie, guns ready for action. Charlie shakes her head no. Jeep's light catches something on the ground. Bob flails around trying to pull the boy's small, but deadly strong arms away from his neck. Michael lowers his flashlight. A flickering light emanates from within the diner. Charlie, drenched in sweat, is writhing on the ground with Michael holding down her arms and Audrey kneeling between her legs. Bob and Jeep keep watch. The spectral lights in the distance seem to be growing larger -- closer. Jeep rests a comforting hand on his father's shoulder.",
    "666": "Next morning, using a can of Dr. Pepper as a target, Peter is busy fine-tuning his wrist webbing. He pulls it and then catches it, but he's not so lucky with the bed lamp. Peter closes the partly open door and turns around to find his room with spider's web dangling from wall to wall. Meanwhile, Norman Osborn is reading the Daily Bugle; the devils in his mind cause him to close his eyes tightly, and he shakes his head wearily. Uncle Ben gives an OK sign to Aunt May as Peter walks out of the door. Downtown, the four-door automobile pulls up at the curb, and Peter looks away as a look of pain creases Uncle Ben's face. Uncle Ben nods slightly, and a somber Peter again looks away from his uncle. Uncle Ben, with a grim face, gets ready to move off, and Peter clambers out of the car, standing in the middle of the road with a brown paper bag in his hand. He starts to cross the road and watches as his uncle makes a left turn out of sight; then he walks off away from the library. Peter makes his way up a stairway at the wrestling arena and from the balcony watches as Bone Saw McGraw, the master of disaster, slams an opponent on the floor and then jumps on him, leading with an arm to his throat. The large, long-haired, muscle man takes the plaudits, as fans rub big toy saws over their arms, being massaged by four leather-clad beauties. Peter joins the queue, and Bone Saw hauls his opponent out of the ring and grabs the mic. Peter bolts, then slips through the ropes. The crowd chants hostility as the cage is set up above the wrestling ring, and Peter, wearing the spider and web emblazoned on his sweatshirt, looks up as the cage is slowly lowered around the ring, trapping him in. Bone Saw charges as Peter leaps in the air and Bone Saw crashes into the cage. Bone Saw jumps up, and Peter somersaults out of his way, then uses his web to leap out of reach. Bone Saw is handed a folding chair, crashing it twice over Peter's head, and then thuds it across Peter's back. Grabbing Peter by a leg, Bone Saw crashes the youth into the cage bars, and then Bone Saw's handed a golf club. As the big wrestler charges, Peter, on his back on the floor, lashes out with his right foot into Bone Saw's body and face. Bone Saw comes again, and Peter uses both feet to propel the big man under the ropes. Bone Saw collapses to the floor, and Peter's eyes sparkle through the eye-holes of his balaclava as he listens to the crowd.",
    "402": "Dil is looking at Fergus, who blushes and buries himself in his drink, but throws his eyes toward her again. She has her face turned away but sees him in the mirror and eyes him. The barman, with infinite weariness, approaches Fergus, who is about to talk when she pipes up. The barman mixes it while she stares at the mirror, staring at Fergus, who is trying to avoid her eyes. The barman hands her the drink, and a burly man sits down beside her. She slaps the hand away, turns back to Fergus, and finds his seat empty. Fergus is standing across the road from the pub, sweating. Dil comes out of the pub, looks this way and that, searching for Fergus, who stands back into a shadow. Dave, the burly man, comes out, grabs her by the elbow, and she walks off. Dave follows, grabs her by the elbow again, and they walk with him holding Dil by the arm through a dilapidated street full of squats. They stop outside a door; Dil opens it with a key from her purse, and they both walk inside. Fergus stands there, observing. A light comes on in an upstairs room, and Dil enters, with her shadow in silhouette behind the curtain and the shadow of Dave coming in behind her. He begins to remove her blouse, and she stands absolutely still as he does so. Fergus is in bed, and we see Jody as a bowler, running in slow motion, toward the camera. Jody releases the ball, and we see Fergus in bed, breathing heavily. Fergus takes a break, watches the batsman hit a ball, and imitates the batsman's motion with his sledgehammer. Then a voice interrupts him, and Fergus turns to see Tristram Deveroux, a young Sloane type in a three-piece suit, whose house it is, and beside him is Franknum, the cockney foreman. Fergus resumes work, and it is now crowded with people, black, white, punky, and street chic, a lot of leather, with all the women heavily made-up. From the way Fergus walks through, it is obvious he has never been here at night. He seems most out of place in his cheap suit, making his way through the crowd to the bar. Col, the barman, sees him and smiles, pushing a colored cocktail with a Japanese umbrella toward him. Fergus reaches for his wallet to pay, but Col interrupts. Fergus tries to pretend he's familiar with the drink, and by implication, whatever are the norms of the place. He lifts the glass to his mouth, but the umbrella keeps getting in the way, so Fergus takes out the umbrella, holds it in one hand, and drinks with the other.",
    "428": "In the silence of the room, they bend over their cues and softly stroke out their shots. The balls roll down the table, bank off the far shoulder, and slowly return toward the two players. Fats' ball hits the closer shoulder. The balls are returned and Eddie makes his break shot, a glancing blow that leaves the pack of balls nearly intact and the white cue ball lying far away at the end of the table. Eddie looks up, with a smile. Fats walks around the table and peers at the balls. Placing his cigarette on the wooden rim of the table, Fats rams the cue ball into the pack, dropping the six ball into the pocket. The table is now his. Eddie sits down unhappily. Fats plays quickly, moving from shot to shot with studied authority, his eyes and hands working fluidly together. The shot goes in. As Eddie watches, the prancing, elegant Fats maneuvers around the table. The shot goes in. We see Fats' bejeweled fingers curl around the cue stick, the stick then darting out to send a ball caroming off a far bank and into a side pocket. Fats keeps sinking shots. It is eleven o'clock. Eddie is up. The crowd at Ames sits stolidly in their seats, watching each player, each move. The shot goes in and he lines up another. The shot is a difficult one involving a combination of balls. As it rolls in, the crowd breaks into applause, and Fats bangs the butt of his cue stick on the floor to show his appreciation. So Eddie does the same. Fats peers at the pack of balls huddled together, then points to one that lies in the middle of the pack. Big John looks around — the shot seems impossible. Fats slams the cue ball into the pack. The balls carom outward in all directions. Only the seven rolls slowly into the corner pocket. Eddie slumps back in his seat as the crowd applauds. It is twelve o'clock, and Fats dominates the play. As he calls out the litany of his shots, we see, superimposed over his hands and his face and the sound of socking pool balls, the spectators, stupefied by the action; Charlie, swallowing hard; Eddie, looking on, waiting to play; and the bills endlessly unfolding out of Charlie's hands and floating onto the table. One-thirty and Fats is still shooting. The shot rolls in. The shot goes in. Fats pounds his stick on the floor. Fats allows a perfunctory bow of his head, a courtly gesture, to Eddie's manager. Charlie looks away, avoiding his eyes. Now it's Eddie's voice we hear calling out the shots. He circles the table, a proud, cocky smile on his face, and superimposed over his movements we see the spectators, hunched up in their chairs, and Fats' face, glowering, hostile.",
    "272": "Nathan is leafing through the lingerie ads in the newspaper, muttering, when Florence enters. As Nathan gets into the driver's seat, he hands her the infant and then a copy of Dr. Spock's Baby and Child Care. Hi nods as he pulls away from the curb, and Ed suddenly bursts out crying. The lights are thrown on, revealing a room hung with streamers. Ed enters with Nathan Jr., and he reaches for the child, takes the baby in both hands, and holds him out at arm's length, pointing him at various places of interest. The baby looks goggle-eyed at each one. Impatient with the nonsense, he props Nathan Jr. up in the corner of the couch, while Hi sits at the other corner and Ed sits in a facing chair. Hi beams at Nathan Jr., Ed smiles at him, and Nathan Jr. looks from one to the other, deadpan, as they seem to be waiting for him to contribute to the conversation. Suddenly, Hi slaps his knee as Ed gets up, picks up the baby, and he frantically reaches for a Polaroid camera. She sits down on the couch with Nathan Jr. as Hi starts screwing the camera into a tripod, adjusting absently, peering through the lens, and as she complies, Hi sits on the couch, holding the camera's cable release. He puts his arm around Ed and smiles at the offscreen camera, while Ed nestles her head against Hi's shoulder, talking through his teeth as he continues to grin at the camera. Meanwhile, two men are trotting out to a Mercury that sits untended at a gas island with a gas hose on automatic stuck in its tank. As Gale starts up the car, Evelle yanks the hose out and drops it to the ground, with Gale already starting to peel out as Evelle gets in. Hi sits asleep on the sofa at the far end of the room, in a pool of lamp light. By the time the camera tightens on his face, the knocking has become quite loud, and he looks up, alarmed, at the front door of the trailer, where someone is pounding insistently. He sits up and tenses, looks around, squinting at Hi as she hisses. As Ed turns back to the bedroom and enters, shutting the door, she listens hard at the door to Hi's footsteps crossing the living room, the click of the door opening, followed by silence, and then a burst of raucous male laughter as Gale roars with laughter. Ed smiles politely and then squints at Hi, while Gale admires the baby, and Hi and Ed look at each other uncomfortably. Hi clears his throat while Gale stares at the streamers and decorations, reading aloud, as Hi and Ed respond simultaneously.",
    "1179": "In the middle of the night, a stormy sea lashes a small rocky island. In a lonely building, a stone hut, Mr. and Mrs. Dursley are fast asleep in a big double bed, and in the room below, Dudley is asleep on a sofa while Harry sprawls on the floor in a sleeping bag. He adds some candles and glances at the watch on Dudley's wrist. It's midnight. He blows the candles, and a flash of lightning causes Dudley to wake with a start. The heavy wooden door shudders, and Harry hides in a corner as the Dursleys appear on the stairs, with Vernon waving a shotgun nervously. The door falls into the room, and a huge figure looms in the doorway. He steps inside, tucking his pink umbrella into his coat, and fits the door back into the frame. Hagrid bends the shotgun barrel, which fires into the rafters. Harry steps forward, takes a large cake box from his pocket as Hagrid sits down, and points his umbrella at the fireplace to light the fire, terrifying the Dursleys. Harry puts down the cake and looks at the giant curiously as Hagrid smiles knowingly, takes out a letter with a wax seal, and gives it to Harry, who opens the envelope and reads the green writing. Spotting Dudley scuffing Harry's cake, Hagrid points his umbrella and gives him a curly pig's tail, causing the Dursleys to shriek with horror, but Harry laughs with delight. Hagrid throws open the door and goes out, followed by Harry after hesitating for only a moment. In a busy street in London, Harry reads from a list as Hagrid takes him into the Leaky Cauldron Public House. The Smokey Pub is lit with candles, and Harry looks around at the people dressed in old-fashioned clothes. The barman spots them, and everyone turns and looks, with people shaking Harry's hand. A man in a turban is present as they go out into the backyard, where Hagrid taps his umbrella all around a small metal grill. To Harry's surprise, the bricks in the wall start to move, rearranging themselves to form a doorway. Harry steps through the doorway into a strange new world. Diagon Alley is a narrow, crooked lane hustling with witches and wizards in flowing cloaks and pointed hats. Hagrid towers over them all as they pass tiny shops packed full of fascinating and unusual merchandise, including a selection of wizard's cloaks and hats and a pet shop full of owls and cages. An owl sits on a perch outside the shop, and a bat stretches its wings above Harry's head. A group of children gaze enviously at a sleek broomstick in a shop window, and Harry looks worried as all the clerks in Gringotts Bank are creepy little men with long noses and sharp pointed ears and teeth.",
    "185": "Laurie glances back at the bushes behind them. The two girls stop in front of Annie's house, another small suburban home. Annie walks up to her door. For a moment Laurie looks around cautiously before searching down the sidewalk again, with the camera tracking with her. Again she turns around and glances back down the street. Suddenly, Laurie walks right into a man standing on the sidewalk in front of her. She screams and drops her books. It is Lee Brackett, Annie's father, a tall man in a county sheriff's uniform. Laurie bundles her books and hurries up the street as Brackett walks down the sidewalk to his house. Laurie walks up on the front porch of her house, pauses a moment, and glances down the street. Several children in costumes are going door to door collecting their treats. She slams the receiver down. Almost immediately, the phone rings again. Laurie looks at it and picks it up. The camera begins on the trees that line the residential street, twisting and writhing in the dusk wind. Laurie carries a tote bag with schoolbooks and knitting needles inside, and a large pumpkin. The sun is a pale glow behind the trees. Slowly, the camera booms down to Laurie waiting outside her house by the street. Laurie turns her gaze down the street, where more children in costumes walk from house to house, some with mothers and sisters, trick or treating. The wind blows their costumes, billowing them outward. She watches the trick-or-treaters as a car swings around the corner and pulls up in front of her. There is a wide shot of an old graveyard on a windy hillside. The camera booms down as a car pulls up on the small road in the foreground. Sam Loomis gets out, along with Taylor, the graveyard owner. He glances at a small notepad. The two men begin walking along the graveyard, winding around headstones and flowers. Taylor stops cold and points to a plot right in front of them. Taylor gives Loomis a quizzical look as Loomis stares. The headstone is missing, uprooted from the ground. Loomis shakes his head and looks across the graveyard. Taylor checks his notebook, then counts the rows and plots. Behind them, through the rear-view mirror, we see Loomis' station wagon pull out of an alley and follow along. Annie points up ahead and quickly hides the joint as Annie's car drives through the main square of Haddonfield, with the station wagon following behind. Two police cars are parked in the street in front of Nichols Hardware Store. Annie's car stops at the police cars. They quickly roll down the windows and begin wildly clearing out the marijuana smoke. Lee Brackett strolls out to the car and leans down to the window.",
    "700": "Peter frees himself and punctures Venom. They fall off the web and plummet down the side of the skyscraper, trading kicks and blows as they descend the lift shaft. Peter tries to pull his mask back on but drops it, managing to fire a thread just before hitting the ground. He lands in a deserted construction site, his suit ripped and torn. He retrieves his mask and looks up sharply as the truck starts dropping towards the cab. Mary Jane leaps out of the cab just before the truck hits it and clings to the web. The sandy ground shakes, knocking Spider-Man over, and Sandman rises from a moving mountain of sand, towering over the cowering crowd like a colossus. The crowd scatters as Sandman's massive fist slams into the ground, narrowly missing Spider-Man, who looks up at Mary Jane clinging to the web. Spider-Man dodges Sandman's truck-sized foot, whizzing past the giant on threads while Sandman swats at him. Mary Jane loses her grip, landing on the lower section of webs exposed like a sacrificial victim, watching Spider-Man hurtling towards her. Venom leaps out at Spider-Man, knocking him into a column of girders that he bounces against as he falls. He lands on a horizontal girder and turns to face Sandman, who towers over him. Venom, standing beneath the girder, fires a thread down Spider-Man's neck and pulls him onto his back, garroting him as Sandman prepares to smash him. Spider-Man desperately reaches out a hand to free himself. The web holding the cab above Mary Jane starts to break as Spider-Man is pummeled by Sandman's fist, his mask torn. Peter stretches out his hand towards Mary Jane, who looks down helplessly as Sandman smashes his fist down on Peter, whose hand hangs limply at his side. Sandman rears up for another blow, but a pumpkin bomb is fired into the side of his head, blowing half of it away and leaving the rest looking like burning coals. A searchlight reveals the new goblin gliding through the air on his sky stick. He sends Venom flying through some walls with a flick of his sky stick. With his mask peeling back to reveal Harry's disfigured face, he glides alongside the battered Peter.",
    "437": "Don enters the chaotic living room, where the telephone on the desk is the only thing seemingly alive. Although he appears to be heading straight to the ringing phone, he is actually drawn to the bottle and the glass by the big chair. He moves slowly toward them, picks up the bottle, and holds it upside down over the glass. The room is in disorder, with books on the floor, a table on a chair under the ceiling fixture, the couch moved from the wall, and clothes and shoes spilled from the closet. Two empty bottles and a sticky glass are about, while a typewriter with a nearly blank sheet of paper sits on the desk. Don goes to the glass and holds two bottles upside down over it, yielding only one slow drop, followed by two more that barely stain the bottom of the glass. He puts down the bottles and empties the meager drops into his throat. Assessing his finances, Don quickly checks his pockets and finds exactly two cents in his palm. Looking around, he notices the typewriter and moves toward it, ripping the sheet of paper from the roller, slamming the lid shut, and picking it up. He drags it to the hallway, puts on his hat, carefully steps over two newspapers and bottles of milk, closes the door, and starts down the stairs, where a note from Helen remains pinned to the door. Exiting the house with the typewriter, he encounters a steel gate blocking the entrance and stands mystified. Nearby, a woman with a baby carriage stands, staring intrusively. Don, feeling pressured by her gaze, straightens up and heads toward another pawn shop, a distant goal given his condition. Each step is painful, and the thunderous noise of the elevated railway above is excruciating. He leans against a pillar, shaking, and waits for a trolley car to pass before continuing across the street to the second pawn shop, only to find it closed as well. Frustrated, he shakes a bar and peers through the iron gate into the dark shop. Seeing another pawn shop across the street, he sweats profusely as two men stand grinning nearby. Finally, discouraged, he picks up the typewriter and starts walking back.",
    "589": "He reads the letter using the light from a nearby window and then picks up the bottle, throwing it hard across the room, which explodes against the hanging photo of his son, staring at it motionless. Rain falls steadily as Whip sits in the car, pouring alcohol into a bottle of juice and taking a drink, before exiting the car and entering a large hangar where the crashed South Jet Aircraft stands almost completely assembled with parts strewn around beside it, alongside cabinets and shelves lining one side of the building. Hugh follows Charlie out of the plane as Whip cocks his head, then Hugh turns and walks away. Whip speeds down the mud road, splashing slush to the side and brakes when he sees news crews outside the farmhouse. Some reporters spot him, so he reverses and drives back onto the main road, stopping opposite a house in a quiet neighborhood, pulling up on a curb barely missing a fire hydrant and chugs on the bottle of juice. He steps out of the car and walks up a footpath to a house where a man watches him from a parked car, speaking into his cell phone. Whip's ex-wife opens the door, but her smile fades as Whip hugs the struggling Will and turns off the news. Whip lifts his arms and walks down a hotel corridor with Charlie holding a can of Coca-cola, approaching a burly man. Hugh emerges from a room, and Whip enters the room where they shake hands and hug. Whip looks around the spacious room, picks up a can of Coke, and goes over to the fridge, finding it stocked with juices and nonalcoholic beverages. Later, he eats a meal alone in his room, lies in bed surfing channels on the TV, shaves, then tries to open the thick file Hugh left for him, which spreads like an accordion, and he abandons it. He sits over the toilet smoking as the bath fills, and the clock shows 2.08 AM as he hangs a suit in a wardrobe. He looks around for the source of the knocking and, lying in bed, he's awakened by the same sound. He gets out of bed, goes to a side door, holds his ear to it, then pulls it open, revealing the extended lock on a door leading to an adjoining room bumping repeatedly against the doorjamb. Whip enters the room, feeling a gentle breeze blow through the balcony doors ruffling drawn curtains. He walks over, gazes at the skyline, and sees a plane's beacon lights flash in the night sky. Whip turns around, and his eyes fall on a fridge. He opens the door to reveal rows of miniature bottles of alcohol on the shelves.",
    "724": "Cal steps on a piece of broken banister and falls. He stands, picks up the gun, and runs after them. Jack and Rose run to the bottom of the staircase. Cal aims but doesn't fire. He knocks a man out of his way, then shoots again. Jack and Rose run down another staircase, then jump into waist-high water. Cal runs into the water. Jack and Rose hurry into the dining room. Cal aims, but the gun is empty. Cal looks around himself at the rising water. Jack and Rose run through the dining room. Cal climbs several steps, then stops. He chuckles to himself as Lovejoy appears. Rose and Jack run down a passageway. They turn, then run down more stairs. Stopping, Jack presses his finger to his mouth. In the dining room, a glass door swings slowly through the water. Small waves push plates and silverware, as rising water covers the tables and chairs. Rose and Jack step into another passageway. At the far end, a small boy stands against a wall. Water pours down the steps, and then they run towards the boy. Sparks shoot from an overhead pipe. Jack picks up the boy, then watches as water shoots in from cracks. They turn and run back up the passageway. They stop as water rushes into the passageway ahead of them. As they run in the opposite direction, a man, the boy's father, steps into the hall. The man grabs the boy from Jack, then knocks Jack against a wall. The man runs off with the boy, and Jack and Rose run after him. The man picks up a suitcase, then gapes at the door, which bursts. Water rushes in, knocking the man over. Water rushes after them as they run down the passageway. A wave knocks them over, and rushing water carries them away. Water pours around them as lights flicker. Jack struggles against the current toward a stairwell. They pull themselves along a wall toward the stairwell. Jack pushes Rose through the shoulder-high water toward the railing. Rose grabs the railings and climbs to another locked gate. Jack shakes the gate as the water rises below them. The water reaches their feet. A steward runs past them. The steward returns for them. He tries several keys in the lock, as water swirls around them. The water reaches their thighs. Sparks shoot nearby. The steward fumbles with the keys and then drops underwater. Holding onto the grate with one hand, he reaches for the keys. Jack grabs the keys, then resurfaces. Jack reaches around the grate with the key, but misses the lock. He slips the key into the lock. He turns the key. Rose opens the gate.",
    "133": "Gandhi is staring at the street, and from his point of view, we hold on a gaunt young, aged woman holding a baby wrapped in rags as threadbare as her sari, with another hollow-faced child leaning against her. A splendid peacock, its tail fanned in brilliant display, lords it on a velvet lawn while a woman in a sumptuous silk sari tries to feed it crumbs. Behind her, Gandhi's reception is in full spate with silver trays, tables covered in fine linen, Indian servants, a swimming pool, a small fountain, and the grounds filled with Indian millionaires and dignitaries gathered with their wives to meet the new hero from South Africa. A beautiful and beautifully dressed woman, Mrs. Nehru, stands next to her distinguished husband, Motilal Nehru, and she nods lightly toward Nehru. Nehru is introducing Gandhi to two men, one tall, slender, and ascetic-looking but dressed impeccably, Jinnah, and the other with a haunting face, beard, flowing dark hair, the air of a poet or a ruthlessly dedicated radical, Prakash, whom we recognize from the opening sequence in Delhi at Gandhi's assassination. Gandhi bows to Jinnah and then looks a little startled at Prakash, who grins and makes the pranam to Gandhi. Gandhi nods and meets Prakash's gaze firmly, showing the first moment of the Gandhi of South Africa. Charlie Andrews touches Gandhi's arm, excusing himself to the others, and Gandhi bows to the others and is led off to an Indian bishop in full clerical robes. Behind him, we see Patel regaling a small group with some story of court or society, and as Gandhi leaves, Jinnah, Nehru, and Prakash watch him clinically. Except for the servants, Gandhi is the only Indian male not in European clothes. Gokhale is pleased, and Gandhi is amused, sharing another grin. Gokhale has started to walk with him, looking at him intently and penetratingly, and although brusque, it is affectionate; we know he regards Charlie as Gandhi does. While Gokhale hasn't smiled, Gandhi and Charlie have, in a private, beautiful, and still moment. Gandhi walks along slowly, taking the pace of the ailing Gokhale, grinning self-deprecatingly, but Gokhale persists, pausing to look at Gandhi, and for the first time, he smiles. When he speaks, his voice is thick with feeling, his eyes watery with emotion, but he stares at Gandhi rigidly. Gandhi sits by a window in the dimly lit coach, as Ba sleeps on the seat next to him, with another member of the party next to her. Gandhi's solemn eyes are studying the huddled humanity in the rocking coach, while he writes in the cramped chaos of the Third Class coaches, and outside, a broad alluvial plain stretches, with the river threading through it, purple and gold in the rising sun.",
    "311": "Tommy rushes through the small crowd at Evan when suddenly a foot reaches out and trips him. Tommy falls to the floor, and the crowd cackles at him. He slowly gets up and locks eyes with Evan, who looks guilty and weakly shakes his head as if to say it's not what Tommy is thinking. Tommy suddenly lunges at a Teen Punk, who is at least a foot taller than he is, and lands a flurry of punches before the Teen Punk can defend himself, frequently taking opportunities to eyeball Evan. Evan, Kayleigh, and the punk's friends look on helplessly when two security guards seize Tommy. As Tommy is being dragged away, he turns to Evan with a sick smile on his face, while Evan and Kayleigh look back, speechless. Andrea drives through the winding roads, her eyes tormented, revealing she's driving Evan and Kayleigh home. Evan is up front, and Kayleigh sits behind them, and everyone is silent. Andrea, in her nurse uniform, exits the house to her car, discreetly watched by Evan through the window, while Kayleigh and Evan walk down toward the house. As a station wagon rolls up the street, Evan and Kayleigh duck in nearby bushes, and the station wagon finally heads into the driveway. Lenny looks back at the model airplane as Evan, Lenny, and Kayleigh pass a junk pile in the woods. As Evan and Kayleigh absorb this in silence, they see a column of smoke billowing on the horizon, and they run toward the smoke with Lenny nervously following behind. They exit the woods to find Tommy has stuffed a dog into a gunny sack which he douses with lighter fluid next to a campfire. Evan and Kayleigh rush toward the trapped, helpless dog, but Tommy is ready for them. He drops the lighter fluid, picks up a wooden plank, and swings at Evan, who ducks back at the last minute, causing Tommy to accidentally connect with Kayleigh's head, knocking her unconscious. Enraged, Tommy fakes a high swing, then goes for Evan's kneecap, bashing him and causing Evan to double over in pain and fall to the ground, clutching his knee. Tommy moves to the fire, where Crockett squirms inside the bag, and picks up the lighter fluid. Evan painfully looks up from the ground, and his eyes dart from the sight of Kayleigh, unconscious, to Crockett, trapped in the tied gunny sack. Tommy squeezes the bottle hard, creating a flaming fuse from the campfire to the fluid-soaked dog. As the flames near Crockett, Evan, seething with rage, stands up with clenched fists and charges Tommy at full speed. His body contorts spastically like a fish on land, now lying face down on the ground. Evan regains himself, sits up painfully, his face badly bruised, and clutches his battered ribs.",
    "1093": "A thin hollowed cheek man wanders towards them. Both Zus and Tuvia scramble to their feet and point their weapons. Zus runs after Lazar. Tuvia leaves Zus on the ground where he pushed him. The tall stranger addresses him. All eyes are on Tuvia. With his machine gun over his shoulder, he takes a step backwards and surveys the group, his face angry and dismayed. He glances across at Zus, who is skulking by a tree. Everyone turns to young Aron. Tuvia's tough expression weakens, and his thin lips tremble. Zus looks from Aron to Tuvia, waiting for a response. Tuvia tries to compose his face. He steps towards Aron and cradles his head in his arms. Aron wraps his arms around his big brother. Later hiding in some woodland with Zus and Benzion by his side, Tuvia appears through binoculars at Koscik's farmhouse. The three of them step towards it. Koscik's wife is in the garden hanging up washing. The three partisans armed with rifles come past a flock of geese on their way to the barn. Nearing the door, they stop as a pair of legs comes into view. Koscik is hanging from a rafter, with a wooden sign around his neck. Zus bangs a cross into the ground. Tuvia, holding a shovel, steps away from Koscik's newly dug grave. Her long, black skirt trailing on the ground, she leads the three men to a haystack where Tuvia and Zus open the trapdoor. They peer down into a shelter and smile. The brothers help Asael out into the sunshine. Zus gives him a bear hug. Rifles. Two women climbed, one a teenager, the other in her 30s. Zus leads Bella and Chaya away. Tuvia thanks Koscik's widow. He runs after the others. At the camp, Shimon and Malvin are shoving earth. The intellectuals shrug and get on with their digging. Asael is intently looking at the blond teenager. Tuvia gives Chaya a friendly wave. Asael strolls down to Chaya and Tuvia cracks a rare smile. An elderly Russian in a horse-drawn cart trundles along the dirt track. Zus with his machine gun steps out in front of him. Asael and Ben Zion step out. Zus smiles doubtfully. Later, wearing the man's coat and carrying two churns, Zus leads the way back through the woods. A man approaches Chaya. At dusk, Benzion comes up to Tuvia who is sitting by a fire, reading. Tuvia's rugged face stiffens. Benzion nods respectfully and leaves Tuvia alone. A young boy plays the violin. People in the camp sit quietly, sadness and loss etched on their faces. Asael watches Chaya from a distance. At the bottom of a leaf-strewn slope, Tuvia stands alone by a stream, grieving.",
    "332": "The strange tower of Orthanc, hewn from a solid pillar of black obsidian, rises up in the center of the Isengard Circle. Gandalf arrives at the foot of the Orthanc Stairs and sweeps down them. Gandalf moves quickly towards Saruman, grimy and weary from his long ride. Gandalf and Saruman walk slowly between the beautiful trees of Isengard, with Saruman's clean, white robe contrasting with Gandalf's dusty grey robes. Saruman and Gandalf are seated in a small, cluttered room to the side of the cavernous central chamber. Gandalf and Saruman stride through Orthanc toward a stone plinth on which a sphere-like shape is draped with a cloth. Saruman lifts the cloth to reveal the Palantir and then sits upon his throne. Gandalf backs away and turns to run to the door, horrified as the doors suddenly slam shut. Gandalf slowly turns to Saruman, a look of dawning horror on his face. At that moment, Gandalf is suddenly blasted across the room and slams against the wall, pinned there by some unseen force. With sudden effort, Gandalf wrenches himself off the wall and swings his staff at Saruman, blasting him off his feet, and Gandalf and Saruman battle, with powerful blasts throwing them across the room. Saruman screams, eyes blazing, as Gandalf's staff is suddenly wrenched from his grasp and flies across the chamber into Saruman's hand, and Gandalf is flung to the floor. Gandalf is breathing hard on the floor, his eyes looking into the madness of Saruman. Commanding two staffs, Saruman sends Gandalf into a sickening spin, and Gandalf tumbles towards the top of the chamber as if falling in reverse. The roof of Orthanc rockets toward the camera. Meanwhile, Frodo and Sam are walking along a country lane which borders Farmer Maggot's Fields. Sam is looking up as Frodo has disappeared around a corner in the lane. Suddenly, a figure comes crashing out of a hedgerow, sending Frodo flying. Merry, Pippin, and Frodo pick themselves up and a variety of vegetables have scattered everywhere. A large pitchfork can be seen racing towards them along the hedgerow, with angry shouts from Farmer Maggot. Merry and Pippin hurriedly gather their booty and race away with Frodo and Sam on their heels. Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin tumble head over heels down a bank, onto a dark, wooded road. A winded Pippin finds his face inches away from a large pile of horse droppings, and he pulls a large carrot, almost broken through in the middle, out from his back pocket. Pippin has spied something under the trees on the far side of the road: small, brown mushrooms growing amongst the loamy undergrowth. Sam, Merry, and Pippin race toward the mushrooms as Frodo remains tense and watchful. Frodo picks himself up and looks around quickly, realizing they are on a wooded road. Scattered leaves rise into the air, whirling down the road as if blown by an invisible wind.",
    "496": "Tiny statues of saints surround the interior perimeter, and we see that the statue Cole stole from the church is in here. This tent is a sanctuary made by an eight-year-old to hide in. Some are villagers, others are dressed as trees and animals, and Cole comes on stage holding a painted cardboard monkey. The arched halls of the private school are lined with posted drawings and test papers. Cole and Malcolm walk down an empty hall, continuing in silence, as Malcolm takes his time. Malcolm stops at a set of doors at the end of the hall and realizes Cole is no longer next to him. Malcolm turns to find Cole frozen about ten feet back and walks to him, noticing Cole's expression as he gets closer. Climbing ropes hang from the wood-beamed ceiling, and Malcolm looks to Cole, then turns back to the ceiling. Malcolm's body becomes very still as he looks at the wood beams and climbing ropes, glancing at Cole, then turning back to him, finding the child with tears in his eyes. Cole looks at Malcolm desperately, and Malcolm stares helplessly. A black man in britches and no shirt, with his face beaten to a pulp, hangs in the center, a white woman in a torn white frilly dress with tears soaking her face hangs to the right, and a small mixed race child in half pants hangs to their left; the family stares at Cole. Lynn fiddles with the dials, while Cole is standing before the beat-up twelve-inch kitchen TV. On the television screen is Tommy Tammisimo, standing in his pajamas in a doorway. Cole removes the gloves from his hand and places them next to his plate, then moves them to the floor. Lynn is irritated, as this is a sore point between them. Lynn and Cole eat quietly as Cole looks up with an anxious expression on his face, just staring, then looking down at his lap. Lynn stares at Cole, folding her napkin quietly, as Cole's eyes start to water up, just staring at his mother's expression. Cole gets up, never taking his eyes off his mother, and leaves the room, entering the dark hallway. He gets startled by the sound, as Sebastian comes racing down the hall and scurries past Cole. Cole watches his puppy dart into the living room and under a couch, then slowly turns back and looks down the hall. The door to Cole's room sits at the end of the corridor, and Cole stops breathing, too terrified to move. Meanwhile, Lynn is kneeling on the kitchen floor trying to coax the puppy out of the broom closet, fighting back some tears, and eventually hugs him.",
    "32": "He nods approval to Abdul, then a German appears in the doorway. Abdul starts to close the door on the man, who tries to push his way through as Rick walks up. Rick looks at the German calmly, takes the card out of his hand, and tears it up. At this moment, Ugarte, a small, thin man with a nervous air, tries to squeeze through the doorway blocked by the German. He gets through and passes Rick. The German storms off, tossing the pieces of his card into the air behind him. Rick meets Ugarte on his way back to his table. If he were an American, Ugarte would look like a tout. Fearing to offend Rick, Ugarte laughs, then pulls out a chair at Rick's table and sits down. A waiter comes up to the table with a tray of drinks, placing one before Ugarte. He takes an envelope from his pocket and lays it on the table. Rick appears ready to take them from Ugarte, and he does so. Ugarte leaves the table just as the waiter comes up, starts across the floor, but stops as Rick comes up to him. Ugarte hesitates for a moment, while Rick looks at Ugarte steadily. Rick leaves the gambling room and goes into the main room, which is in semi-darkness. During one of the periods when the spotlight is on the orchestra, Rick slips the letters of transit into the piano. Ferrari, owner of the Blue Parrot, a competing nightspot, comes into the cafe, sits down, and watches Sam, then sees Rick and they smile at each other. At the end of the number, Ferrari goes to the bar to speak to Rick, and they walk over to the piano. Apparently satisfied, Ferrari walks away. Back at the bar, Yvonne, an attractive young French woman, sits on a stool drinking brandy, as Sacha, who looks at her with lovesick eyes, fills her tumbler. Rick saunters over and leans on the bar next to Yvonne, who has never taken her eyes off him. Rick looks the check over, tears it up, and pays no attention to her. Yvonne turns, looks at Sacha, and extends her glass to him, then looks at him bitterly without saying a word. Yvonne wheels on Rick with drunken fury. Sacha stands at the curb on the street in front of Rick's and signals for a cab, pulling her along toward the door. Rick and Yvonne approach the waiting cab. Rick stands and looks up at the revolving beacon light from the airport as Renault sits at a table on the cafe terrace, watching this evening's performance. Rick walks over to him.",
    "475": "Constanze curtsies, and he giggles uncomfortably as Cavalieri glares at Mozart, who looks hastily away from her. She attempts to kiss the royal hand but faints instead, causing the Emperor to contemplate her prone body and step back a pace. He nods pleasantly to all and leaves the stage with his Chamberlain, while Cavalieri, with a savage look at Mozart, leaves the stage the opposite way to her dressing room, tossing her plumed head. Salieri watches as Mozart remains indecisive for a second about whether to follow the soprano or help Madame Weber, but when Constanze catches him looking at her and tries to compose herself, she seats herself at her mirror and removes her wig as Salieri looks astonished. The door opens, Constanze enters, and Mozart hurries Constanze out of the door. Cavalieri looks after them as they go, her voice breaking and rising out of control. The old man speaks passionately to the priest while the young Salieri is kneeling in desperation before the Cross, and we see Leopold kneeling now not to the Cross but to Archbishop Colloredo, sitting impassively on his throne. Leopold, a desperate, once-handsome man of sixty, now far too much the subservient courtier, expresses deepest gratitude by kissing the Archbishop's hand, who then motions Leopold to rise. The camera pulls back to reveal Leopold kneeling beside Constanze, a priest facing them, with Madame Weber, Josefa, and Sophie Weber, and a merry-looking lady in bright clothes, the Baroness, are behind them. Out of breath, the Princess nods nervously, and Salieri smiles at him, but Salieri's face falls almost imperceptibly as a servant enters, and Salieri goes into the salon. Constanze stands closely veiled, holding a portfolio stuffed with manuscripts, and Salieri enters the salon as Constanze drops him a shy curtsy and shyly unveils. He takes the portfolio and puts it on a table, indicating a dish piled high with glazed chestnuts, which he offers to her. She takes one, puts it in her mouth, and he watches carefully before taking one himself, wearing a heavy gold signet-ring. He smiles at her, and she takes another chestnut, as the old man faces the priest; close up, the manuscript is in Mozart's handwriting. The court composer, oblivious to Constanze, who sits happily chewing chestnuts with her mouth covered in sugar, walks around and around his salon, reading the pages and dropping them on the floor when finished, his face agonized and wondering, shuddering as if in a rough and tumbling sea, experiencing the point where beauty and great pain coalesce, while more pages fall than he can read, scattering across the floor in a white cascade as he circles the room.",
    "510": "Banky leans back into the couch, wearing a thoughtful face, as the Execs and Sloss laugh, prompting Holden and Banky to politely join in, though Banky shoots Holden a 'these guys are idiots' look, and Holden smiles. Later, Alyssa and Holden walk through the park, eating hot dogs, and upon reaching a swing set, they sit down on the swings. Alyssa holds up her hand, and after swallowing what she's chewing, she releases her tongue, which is just huge, leaving Holden transfixed. Alyssa wraps it back up with a smile and stands, then exits while Holden remains in the swing. Alyssa returns as Banky tries to balance way-too-much luggage, while Holden checks his beeper and exits. Banky starts packing his magazines up, and a little kid enters, staring at him before disappearing, leaving Banky standing open-mouthed. They head toward the skee-ball runs, where Holden rolls the ball, landing it in a twenty-point circle. Alyssa picks up a ball, squints to aim, and throws it overhand, causing it to pop off one of the circles and shoot back, making them duck. Holden reacts as Alyssa laughs, and he ducks again as the ball comes sailing back at his head, then gets up and throws the ball in surprise, causing it to ricochet off the ceiling and smash through the glass of an old pinball machine, while Alyssa laughs. Later, Banky sits there, shocked, puts the controller down, and crosses to the drawing table, where Holden starts drawing as Banky stares at him, then starts drawing something himself. Banky draws a four-way stop, finishes drawing, and illustrates according to his voice-over. Holden shakes his head and storms away, with Banky following. Holden looks at Banky for a long moment as Banky stares back, then suddenly softens and drops his head, looks into Holden's eyes, and walks away, while Holden watches him go and exits. Alyssa picks through her food as she and Holden sit at a booth, then she grabs her bag, slides out of the booth, and heads to the cashier's desk with Holden following, offering a puzzled shrug. Alyssa gestures with a 'just wait' finger when the cashier turns to her, as Holden stares at her, then ahead, swerving the wheel to the right to pull the car to the side of the road, throws it into park, noting the rain is a bit heavier now. Holden stares at Alyssa, and she stares back before getting out of the car. With the rain now pouring, Alyssa starts hitching up the road, and Holden reaches her, with both being drenched. She shakes her head ruefully and walks away, leaving Holden standing there at a loss before he turns and heads back to his car.",
    "1321": "Bob wanders in, squinting at the sudden presence of light, as headlights appear on the highway. Kyle stares at Audrey's beautiful, determined face and then pulls out his silver 45. The headlights become a family minivan careening wildly off the highway to stop at the pumps, and Kyle and Audrey aim their weapons at the vehicle. A well-dressed man in his mid-thirties jumps out of the car, looking around nervously, and after seeing the coast is clear, he offers a calming wave to his wife and young boy who wait anxiously inside the car. He races around to the gas pump as Kyle and Audrey spin to look out over the back side of the diner, seeing an army of dark shapes swarming in fast. Kyle looks urgently back at the family as the father lifts the pump, and Kyle and Audrey wave their arms frantically at the family. Kyle fires his gun in the air, and at the sound of gunfire, the man looks quickly up to the roof, and his family starts to scream to him. The man can only see silhouettes in the light, but he doesn't wait to see if they are friend or foe. Audrey watches in horror as the dark shapes reach the diner. The father dashes to the driver's side but sees a blur of movement rushing at him, and his blood paints the car windows. Kyle raises his MP5 to fire upon the dark shapes that surround the vehicle like swarming insects. The possessed move in from all sides, but Kyle is remarkably agile, dropping them one after another. He closes in on the family, blasting back the creatures huddled around them, and finds the young boy curled up with his hands protectively covering his face. Kyle swoops down, gathers the boy into his arms, and moves on to the mother. The creatures have stopped coming at him; instead, they're just standing there watching him. Kyle freezes, sensing something terribly wrong. Audrey raises the 45 and pulls the trigger, but it clicks. She continues pulling the trigger as the boy's tears stop instantly. Audrey backs away and looks toward the entrance to the diner, blocked by advancing creatures. They're everywhere, and she's trapped. She notices the open door to the minivan, dives into the car, and as the creatures rapidly close in, she hammers the auto door lock. Clunk! She moves to the center of the car as gruesome faces press against the windows, a nightmare come to life. Charlie rushes to Michael's side, but he's immovable. Charlie cocks the gun, moves toward the door, and looks back at him defiantly.",
    "16": "Carolyn switches on the bedside light and sinks into a chair, stunned, as it's clear he knows where she's most vulnerable. He sees this, and likes it; it feels good to win for a change, so he curls up under the covers contentedly. Close on Lester, smiling. We are flying high above the neighborhood, and below we see the two Jims jogging. We approach them steadily and are now at street level, following the two Jims. Still running, the Jims turn back in perfect unison as Lester runs into frame, wearing a baggy sweatshirt and a pair of faded old sweatpants. The Jims slow down until he catches up, and the three men run together in the early morning light. The Colonel stands, scowling, as Ricky comes out of the house, holding the urine sample in front of him. The Colonel is washing his Ford Explorer, squatting to scrub the bumper, when something catches his eye: Lester and the Jims jog down the street. Lester breaks off from the two Jims and jogs up to Ricky and the Colonel, out of breath. He grabs hold of his knees and bends over, panting, then laughs and extends his hand to the Colonel, saluting him good-naturedly, grinning. An awkward beat follows, and then he heads into the house. Lester waves at the Colonel, then follows him. The Colonel watches them go, his eyes dark. Ricky enters, followed by Lester. He gives the urine specimen to Lester, then locks the door. Lester picks up a CD case from a shelf and examines it while Ricky crosses to a bureau, opens a drawer, takes clothing out, and piles it on his bed. Ricky, having emptied the drawer, now removes a false bottom, revealing rows of marijuana tightly packed in Zip-loc bags. Lester smiles, thinking this kid's cool. Carolyn, carrying a basket of fresh cut roses, passes by the garage window and stops to sniff the air, frowning. She peers through the window and sees Lester, in a T-shirt and gym shorts, lying on a new weight bench, doing bench presses with shiny new barbells. The garage is in the process of becoming Lester's sanctuary. Lester finishes his last rep, straining, then puts the weights in their rack and sits up. He looks up, squinting, as the door raises to reveal Carolyn, silhouetted against the bright sunlight outside, pointing a remote at us. Lester leans back on the bench and grabs the weights, and then she's gone. Elsewhere, Brad is seated behind his desk, reading a document as Lester sits across from him, smiling. Brad laughs, stops laughing, then leans back in his chair, studying Lester. Exhilarated, Lester walks down a corridor, his belongings in a box on his shoulder, happier than he's been in years.",
    "39": "SYLVIE GAUDET, a French woman in her early thirties, joins REGGIE and JEAN-LOUIS from the railing of the sun deck. JEAN-LOUIS scampers off, pleased with the situation. SYLVIE notices REGGIE's lunch of cold chicken, potato salad, rolls and butter, wine, and coffee, as REGGIE starts eating a chicken leg. SYLVIE observes the disarrayed table before following. They pass through a magnificent indoor pool area with ceiling-high windows showing snow-covered mountains, continuing their conversation. An open balcony surrounds the pool with sun-worshippers in deck chairs, and REGGIE and SYLVIE continue their conversation. SYLVIE stops, noticing a strange figure in a grotesque knitted mask covering the face except for the eyes, nose, and mouth. The camera pans down to include JEAN-LOUIS, held by the masked man, and also shows REGGIE and SYLVIE. SYLVIE assesses the situation, stands up, and she and JEAN-LOUIS start to leave, with JEAN-LOUIS squirting PETER with his pistol. The camera shows the Arc de Triomphe at the Avenue's end and pans to a taxi pulling up to a handsome building with REGGIE, SYLVIE, and JEAN-LOUIS inside. REGGIE exits, and the driver begins unloading her suitcases as JEAN-LOUIS sticks his head out the window, and REGGIE looks at SYLVIE, surprised. REGGIE walks toward the house with the driver carrying her cases and presses the button to open the front door. As the elevator rises, REGGIE exits, followed by the driver who places the bags in front of the apartment door and leaves. Sighing, REGGIE takes out her keys to unlock the door and enters the empty Salon, with camera following. The room is stripped bare, with patches of original wall color where paintings once hung, hooks still in place. She rushes to the bedroom, camera lurching behind her, finding it too empty. She hastily opens wardrobe closets revealing only hangers, and finds drawers empty as well. REGGIE is in near-shock. We see a large metal drawer being opened, revealing a familiar shape under a damp muslin sheet, as REGGIE, GRANDPIERRE, and an ATTENDANT look into the drawer. GRANDPIERRE lifts the sheet's corner, revealing a bare foot with a ticket tied to its big toe.",
    "241": "Szpilman and Henryk struggle desperately as they begin to walk and continue on their way. They arrive at a wooden bridge constructed to link the small ghetto to the large ghetto, with few people around, mostly beggars and children. As they climb the bridge's stairs, Henryk stumbles and sinks to his knees, but Szpilman helps him stand and supports him towards the back of a cafe where Henryk finishes a bowl of soup and a piece of bread while sitting with Szpilman and Benek. The kitchen is small and busy with cooks, waiters, and washers-up. A dense crowd of people crosses the bridge in both directions. Szpilman, shabby and unshaven, hurries along and encounters Jehuda Zyskind with Majorek. They stop but are buffeted by the crowd. Meanwhile, cars, trams, pedestrians, and German guards are in the street below. Schultz, a fat, sweaty German, fills out a form while Majorek stands beside him, chatting and laughing quietly. Szpilman and Father stand in the doorway of a small office on an upper level, overlooking a factory floor where Jewish men and women work at sewing machines, creating a terrible clatter. The name 'Samuel Szpilman' is written on a certificate, which Schultz stamps and hands to Majorek, who gives it to Father. A great mass of agitated people crosses from the small ghetto to the large ghetto, carrying their belongings as a German film crew records. They struggle across the bridge, and a truck backs up, revealing a load of furniture, linen, clothing, mirrors, carpets, and bedclothes. Three Jews in the van unload the items, and the Szpilman family, along with others, stands ready to sort them. Szpilman and Henryk sort carpets, Father sorts mirrors, Regina sorts linen, and Halina and Mother sort clothing. They carry the items into a warehouse that resembles an Aladdin's cave, filled with similar objects. The activity continues in a large room separated by an improvised partition of blankets for men and women, with three-tiered bunks. On the men's side, Father is on the upper bunk, and Henryk is on the lower. Suddenly, a volley of shots and German voices are heard. Szpilman slips off his bunk, hurries to the door, opens it, and comes face to face with a German NCO and soldiers. The NCO hits Szpilman across the face, then turns and leaves.",
    "665": "Peter tries to shoot webs from his wrist but initially nothing happens. On his second attempt, a column of threads flies out, and on the third attempt, the web wraps around the jib of a crane, with Peter holding the other end. He grabs the web with both hands, leaps onto the wall surrounding the roof, takes a quick look down to the street, steadies himself, and jumps. Clinging to the web, he swings through the air like Tarzan and lands on the roof opposite, where he crashes into a wall poster and falls to the ground. Later that evening, Peter races to his aunt and uncle's house, where he sees paint supplies set out and finds a note about dinner. His attention is drawn to an argument at MJ's house, and he takes the garbage out to the backyard, separated from MJ's by a small fence. MJ comes out, stands for a moment, then turns to Peter with her hands in her pockets, looking coy. Peter leans on the fence, and they both react to the sound of Flash's convertible. Peter then looks for cars for sale in the paper, finding various options and prices. He spots an amateur wrestling ad offering $3,000 for three minutes, dreams of MJ and a sports car, and sketches costume ideas, including a cape, utility belt, and a spider symbol. He imagines a spider design with red legs and a blue body, a red checked mask, and adds color with red checks on boots, a blue body stocking, red checks on the head mask, a center strip down the chest, around the waist, and a touch of red along the arm.",
    "218": "The rumble is building and then erupts into a deafening roar as a wall of water crashes through the hollow, engulfing everything and everybody. The cabin itself is ripped away, and the Soggy Bottom Boys are knocked off their feet amid noise and confusion. Suddenly, the world becomes silent as Everett tumbles in the current in natural slow motion, suspended around scores of tins of Dapper Dan pomade. Other objects, including framed sepia-tinted family portraits, tree limbs, a fishing pole, an outhouse door, a frying pan, a noose, an old banjo, a wild-eyed frantically paddling bloodhound, and a tire with a rope tied around it, spin slowly by. The churning torrent opens into a lowland, becoming a newly created river, fast-moving but no longer violent. After a moment holding on the rippling waters, the surface is broken as a pine coffin up-bobs and floats downstream, soon joined by Everett, who gasps for air, shakes his head clear of water, and finishes freeing himself from the rope round his wrists. Pete and Delmar emerge nearby, also gasping for air, and the men hang onto the coffin that bears them downstream. Dazed, they look around at the inundated valley, where only occasional roof- or treetops poke out of the newly formed river. Everett waxes smug but trails off as he notices a cottonhouse submerged to its eaves with a cow on its roof staring at him, a stare he returns before shaking off the vision and clearing his throat. Downstream, Tommy surfaces, clinging to a half-submerged piece of furniture that begins to rotate in the current, causing him to climb in place like a hamster on a wheel to stay above water. Meanwhile, Everett and Penny walk arm in arm with the seven Wharvey gals behind, the girls singing 'Angel Band' as the grown-ups talk. Everett fumbles in his pocket and shakes his head, prompting Penny to quicken her pace in indignation, and he keeps up as they pull forward out of frame. The Wharvey gals follow in a ragged bunch, still singing, as the second-to-last and oldest girl holds a piece of string that leads our gaze to reveal a train track in the distance. The blind seer pumps his car along the distant track, singing harmony under the Wharvey gals' receding voices.",
    "234": "Three young Poles carry long objects wrapped in newspaper. One man checks his watch, kneels, and places the package he's carrying to his shoulder, revealing the barrel of a machine gun as it begins firing. His two companions do the same, targeting the Schutzpolizei building, hitting the sentry who falls in front of his box. Suddenly, gunfire echoes throughout the city. Pedestrians scatter, except for an old man with a walking stick, who manages to enter a building. Rifle and machine-gun fire erupt from the Schutzpolizei building, and the three young Poles maneuver to a corner opposite it, tossing grenades inside. A battle ensues as the Germans retaliate from the hospital, with grenades and machine-gun fire exchanged. Szpilman watches from his window, noticing smoke rising as a Panzerfaust rocket emerges from a lower window in a neighboring building. It fires, hitting the hospital as the city becomes engulfed in flames. The firing wanes, with sporadic shots and isolated explosions. Szpilman lies on his bed, staring at the ceiling, with the Schutzpolizei building reduced to ashes. A horse-drawn cab rounds the corner, clattering down the street before vanishing from view. Beneath him, a man and woman walk with their hands up, followed by a German soldier with a rifle. As they begin to flee, the woman is shot and collapses awkwardly on the street. Szpilman watches in shock as he hears voices, shouts, and footsteps outside his door. He listens intently, hearing footsteps descend stairs amidst shouts. A German Captain appears, studying Szpilman briefly, nods, and instructs him to follow. Szpilman picks up a tin and follows the Captain through a damaged double door into a room with a broken table that used to be a dining room.",
    "282": "Jeff is seated by the window in his wheelchair, looking out tensely. The camera moves in until his profile is in big close-up. From Jeff's viewpoint, all the windows and the salesman's apartment are dark. Suddenly, a match flares, and we see the salesman light a cigar, the flame briefly illuminating his face. The camera now faces Jeff as he talks in a low voice while keeping his eyes on the salesman's apartment; Lisa also speaks quietly. Behind Lisa, Sixth Avenue can be seen while she is on the phone. Jeff continues watching the salesman's apartment, puts the receiver down, and resumes his vigil. As the match dies out, only the glow of the cigar is visible. Jeff talks on the telephone, his eyes still on the neighborhood, as the camera pulls back slightly and Stella emerges from the kitchen with a breakfast tray. She squeezes past Jeff and places the tray on a window seat in front of him, with a touch of urgency in his voice as Stella peers cautiously toward Thorwald's apartment. She then retrieves the table, sets it across Jeff's lap, and places the breakfast tray on it, observing Thorwald's apartment once more. Jeff moves back slightly to avoid tangling the phone cable with the food and dishes and hangs up. The breakfast consists of eggs, bacon, toast, and coffee. Stella moves behind his chair, pausing again to look toward Thorwald's apartment. Jeff reaches for a knife and fork, lifting a piece of bacon to his lips, but hesitates when Stella speaks, then begins eating appreciatively. The bacon pauses near Jeff's mouth multiple times before he puts it back on the plate as his eyes move slightly to the left, and he just stares ahead. At Thorwald's apartment, with the shades up, we realize that the salesman is in his living room, lying out of sight on the sofa, as smoke from a newly lit cigar ascends to the ceiling. Meanwhile, the rope-tied trunk remains in the bedroom.",
    "124": "Neff sits in the swivel chair, talking into the dictaphone, having hooked the wastebasket under his feet to sit more comfortably. The camera moves slowly towards the davenport again, where Neff sits in one corner with his feet on the low table, smoking his cigarette and staring at the ceiling. Phyllis has been sitting fairly close to him, but she gets up slowly and crosses to her raincoat, lying over a chair. Neff still does not answer and looks at her slowly, almost absently, then he gets up and grips her arm, his fingers digging into her arm, and kisses her. They have now reached the door, and Neff opens it as Phyllis stands in the doorway, her lips white, and she goes quietly. He watches her down the corridor, slowly closes the door, and goes back into the room, moving across the window to open it wide. He stands there, looking down into the dark street as the rain drifts in against his face, and he just stands there motionless. Neff then sits slumped in his chair before the dictaphone, with a used record standing on the desk next to him. The checker-board is on the davenport between Phyllis and Lola, while Mr. Dietrichson sits in a big easy chair, his coat and tie over the back of the chair, the evening paper lying tumbled on the floor beside him, a drink in front of him and several more inside him. In another chair sits Neff, his briefcase on the floor, leaning against his chair, holding his rate book partly open with a finger in it for a marker. Phyllis looks up from the checker-board and cuts in on the dialogue as Lola listens without much interest, staring down at her wristwatch. She gets up and starts to go as Dietrichson sucks down a big swallow of his drink. Neff has taken two blank forms from his briefcase while Phyllis is watching closely, and he takes out his fountain pen, unscrews it, and hands it to Mr. Dietrichson, who puts on his glasses and withdraws the top copy barely enough to expose the signature line on the supposed duplicate, grunting and signing again. Neff and Phyllis exchange a quick glance as Neff casually lifts the briefcase and signed applications off Dietrichson's lap. Dietrichson has poured some more whisky into his glass, tries the siphon but it is empty, and gathers up his coat and tie, picking up his glass. Neff is zipping up his briefcase as Dietrichson trundles off towards the archway. Phyllis leads the way and Neff goes after her, his briefcase under his arm, as Phyllis enters through the living room archway with Neff behind her.",

    "796": "The kid removes his finger, then, before Willie can move, changes his mind and puts the counter back where it was. Willie struggles to contain his irritation. The kid quickly moves one of his pieces, taking three of Willie's, and reaching the far end of the board at the same time. Willie glares and throws the board in the air, while the kid stares placidly at him, unruffled. Willie opens the door to a balding man and proffers his hand, glancing at the kid. The man hands Willie some paperwork. As Grandma nods off in front of the TV, Willie is outside entertaining the barmaid in the hot tub, still wearing his festive red cap, energetically humping Sue, the barmaid, up against the side of the hot tub amid smokes and foam. Afterwards, in the living room, he pours himself a straight vodka and her one with orange. They sit on the sofa together, and he hands her her glass; they each take a swig of their respective drinks. She sits back and smiles, laughs to herself, and he nods off. She looks a little bit disappointed. Later, Willie accompanies her to the front door and sees her out. She gives him a kiss and trips over the front step before heading off into the night. Willie shuts the front door and, vodka bottle in hand, reaches over to the hall table where the kid's advent calendar is lying. He picks up the calendar and puts the bottle down on the table, then proceeds to tear open the remaining doors on the calendar and scarf the chocolate inside. Calendar ruined and chocolate eaten, he picks up the vodka bottle and lurches towards the lounge. He stops in the doorway and drains the bottle of its remaining contents, about a quarter, belches, falls backwards, and lies unconscious on the hall carpet. The next morning, he is roused by a distressed kid and is unfazed as his grandma. The kid's hand is covered in blood, and Willie follows him to the kitchen where he puts the hand under the tap and pours vodka on the cut. Willie turns the tap off, takes a slug of vodka, and walks back into the hall, looking slightly uneasy, then spots the tattered remains of the advent calendar lying on the hall table. Later that morning, Willie drives the BMW into the deserted car park where Marcus is standing beside a green van waiting for him. They open the back of the van, and Marcus irritably hands Willie an empty Santa sack. Willie shakes his head, puts a drill in the gift-wrapped box, and with the gift-wrapped safe-breaking equipment loaded into the sack, Willie and Marcus head for the mall.",
    "370": "Sandra checks the mail, hoping for a letter from Edward, when a black car pulls up and two army officers get out, causing Sandra to cry out upon hearing the news. Later, Sandra hangs sheets to dry, forming a tunnel of fabric, and as she pulls a dress from the basket, she looks up and sees a shadow ripple across the white fabric. She freezes, knowing it can't be him—he's dead—and turns away, but with determination, she hangs the dress and retrieves another. Looking up again, she sees Edward himself standing before her, and gasps in disbelief, but his hand is real, so she kisses him without hesitation. Under the covers, a man's hand traces the curves of a woman's back, then she turns over in bed, waking up to Will watching her. Edward is startled as both women quickly gather plates, and Will and Edward smile, knowing the women want this to happen. Edward looks away, angry and disbelieving, as Will cleans leaves from the pool, but the pool is overgrown with algae and slime. A sudden underwater ripple startles Will, who drops the pole into the water and looks around, relieved no one saw. The doors open to reveal Sandra, Will, and Josephine staring into a storeroom, filled with unfinished projects, old products Edward sold, a roll-top desk, and metal file cabinets. Sandra makes a sound of memory while looking through a file and hands Will a yellowed telegram, which shocks him. Sandra stands and Josephine kisses Will before following her, while he re-reads the telegram in disbelief. Searching for a place to set it, he tucks it into a mechanical hand on the desk, which clamps down on it. The camera pushes in on the telegram as Edward's voice begins as a memory, where on a platform Edward pitches a new product to a crowd and kisses his pregnant wife goodbye, still in love.",
    "1027": "He speeds through an intersection, continuing onto a busy street as Pete cuts off a car that narrowly avoids him. An SUV pulls up beside him. Back in the kitchen, Oliver cleans up outside, and Sadie approaches with Joseph. Debbie smiles, and Joseph avoids her gaze. Sadie leaves, and Joseph follows. Pete speeds down the middle of a street, slowing down traffic, and holds out his middle finger, waving a guy past. A car turns right in front of him, and the SUV accelerates ahead. Oliver sits with the girls, glances back at Sadie, and flashes a smile before running off. Sadie grabs her sister. Pete rides through a red light and makes a left between oncoming cars, taking a left onto a quiet side street as he soars down a winding hilly road. Pete coasts around a corner and stands upright, then accelerates past a group of serious cyclists. Debbie drives with Larry in her SUV. Pete makes a left at an empty intersection and rides past a white picket fence. A car door swings open, and a husky man looks down at him, then punches Pete in the face. The man easily absorbs Pete's stomach punch, then knocks Pete over with one. Debbie drives by, gets out, and runs to Pete as the man gets in his SUV. Pete writhes in glass, sees the dealer license plate, and puts his head down as Debbie arrives. The man pulls away. Now, in a hospital hallway, Debbie shakes her head as she sits with Larry. A nurse approaches and steps away, giving an incredulous look. She hugs him, and he gives her back a fatherly pat as she clings to him. They part, and he takes the bill. As he shuffles off, Debbie watches him go with a little smile. On the island, the hero Jack lies dying with Vincent the dog at his side. Oliver watches with the girls and Joseph. Holding Charlotte close, Oliver lifts his chin. Now, in the hospital hallway, a window shows Pete on a bed sporting a bruised, swollen eye. Debbie walks in with a sympathetic smile. He waves, and she perches beside him on the edge of the bed. Her injured husband regards her gravely, and Debbie smiles at him, stands, and starts to help him up. He winces, then swings one leg over the bed, and as she tries to help him again, Pete sits up and kisses her. They share a tender, lingering smooch. Now at a music club, a young singer with moppy dark brown hair strums a guitar at the mic. Debbie brings Pete a bottle of beer, setting her own drink down as she faces the stage and takes his hand. Pete shrugs and gives a delighted smile.",
    "1347": "Jack, in an Air Force uniform and holding a rifle, runs through a dark building and stops against the wall, visibly scared. He peers around a corner and spots guards and vehicles outside on the tarmac through a window. His eyes shift to an aircraft fuel tank, and with wild eyes, he unsafeties his weapon. A soldier crosses to a vehicle, radio in hand, when the fuel tank explodes in a massive blast. Airmen take cover and rush to move nearby vehicles amidst the general mayhem. The camera follows a military jeep as it drives with Jack behind the wheel, blasting through the exit along the road back to town. Jack drives up in the jeep and stops with a shocked expression, seeing a mass of vehicles driving from town. His mind races as the jeep speeds past the camera, revealing Donny driving, Joe in the passenger seat, and Charles, Cary, and Martin in the back. Donny yanks the steering wheel to turn onto a dirt road, and the car rumbles away from the camera. Donny's car pulls up, and the lights go off as the kids pile out. A shot shows the boys climbing a fence, moving quickly across an alley to a trailer locked with a padlock, referred to as the dungeon. Joe tries prying the locks off with a tire iron, but it doesn't budge. He hands the tire iron to Charles, who also fails to open the lock, and then Martin grabs it, successfully breaking off the latch. Inside the dungeon, in darkness, the boys look directly toward us as they discover the mother lode. With flashlights, they turn a corner and hurry down the hall, breaking a classroom door window to enter. Inside, they are surrounded by hundreds of documents, boxes, photographs, 16mm film canisters, and cassette tapes. Charles threads the film as Joe holds up a 20-year-old photo of men in a lab, including a 50-year-old named Woodward. Cary inserts a cassette into a tape deck and hits play. They see a hangar where dozens of scientists examine large, bus-sized pieces of jagged, unearthly material. A scientist explains something to a group of senior officers, among them a 32-year-old Nelec. The film jump cuts to a huge reinforced lab cage, inside which sits a massive creature. Another jump cut shows a soldier offering a bucket of food to the alien — it's Woodward.",
    "483": "The car dealer is out on the lot now, standing and waiting for Mary. As she approaches, lost in her newspaper, he smiles. She stops suddenly, almost with a gasp. She has seen the Patrolman. He is staring over at her, his face dispassionate. Mary has to force herself to look away. He starts into Mary's car. She stands in the middle of the lot, feeling like a shooting target. He still watches. With a self-angry sigh of resignment, she goes to a close car, looks at it. The Car Dealer is returning. As the car dealer looks at her in amazement, she reaches into her bag, feels the money-filled envelope, pauses. Mary pauses, turns, sees the Patrolman, then the Mechanic. Then the Mechanic waves, starts forward with her suitcase. The Mechanic smiles, throws the suitcase in. Mary zooms off. As she drives out of the lot, we see the Mechanic, the Car Dealer, and the Patrolman all looking after her. Mary is driving tensely. CAMERA IS CLOSE on Mary's face now, recording her anxiety, her fears. Mary looks weary, tired with strain and with hard driving. Her eyes are heavy with worry and deep thought. We can see that it is much later in the day, almost dusk. Now we cut to the view of the road, from Mary's viewpoint. Darkness of evening is coming. In the dim twilight, we see the neon sign of roadside restaurants and gas stations beginning to blaze on. Back on Mary's face, and after a moment, the imagined voices again. A flush of painful guilt and regret rises up in Mary's face. The first oncoming headlights slash at the windshield. The oncoming headlights blurt at her. It is completely dark now, night. Oncoming headlights throw a blinding light across her features. Big drops of rain begin to appear. She is becoming aware of the rain starting. The rain increasing and backlit by the oncoming headlights. Mary starts the windshield wipers. The wipers are having a battle with the now torrential rain. Peering through the blurred windshield, slowing down in the flooding highway, peering through the windshield. The oncoming lights are fewer, just blackness and rain, peering. An almost undiscernible light in the far distance, a neon sign blurred by the rain-sheeted windshield. She presses down, forces the car to move on through the flooded road. The lights are on within the office. She tries the door, finds it open, goes into the office. Mary goes to the desk, rings a small pushbell. She looks off in another direction, slightly behind the office, and sees. A path from the motel office leads directly up to this house. There is a light on in one of the upstairs rooms.",

Later, Pete sits at the counter, and Debbie and the kids are at the breakfast table. Pete drives Sadie and Charlotte to school, eating an egg sandwich and manically singing along. He walks Charlotte in, gives her a kiss, then walks back towards his car. On the way, he bumps into Joseph and his mom, thinks for a moment, not sure how to handle this, and pokes her shoulder. Meanwhile, Debbie is talking to Jodi, who is crying, when her phone buzzes. Pete and Debbie are sitting across from Vice Principal Laviani, with Joseph's mother, Catherine, in another seat. Debbie tries to hide a smile, and Pete and Debbie leave the school together, suppressing smiles. They get in separate cars and drive off. Debbie is making dinner as Pete and Charlotte sit at the table, and then she walks off. Sadie does her homework on her bed, while Charlotte brings in Sadie's electronics and puts them down in a pile beside her, walks away, and starts to slide the door closed behind her. Later, Debbie is sitting on the couch, Pete paces around the room, and they hug. The shades are closed, the room is dark, and Sadie watches the end of the last episode of Lost on a laptop as Pete enters. Debbie is speaking with Barb as they set up the kitchen for a barbecue for Pete's fortieth birthday, while Desi jumps in the pool in a small bikini and plays in the water with the kids. There's an angle on Barb and Debbie, then on Barry and Pete, followed by another angle on Barb and Debbie. Barry and Pete turn toward their wives, smile, and wave. Pete greets guests, including Graham and Grandma Molly. Pete and Ronnie are talking in the backyard, and Debbie walks over with Jason; they leave Ronnie and Jason alone. The guys spot Desi swimming in the pool as Debbie and Pete open the front door, where Oliver is standing with a nervous smile. Debbie looks at him and tries to be nice, opening the door wider, but they do not hug. He hands him a bottle. The party is in full swing, with Pete, Debbie, Oliver, Barry, and Barb getting food from the buffet as Barb and Barry try to help keep the conversation going. Larry arrives with Claire and the triplets, and Claire is holding two of them while Larry carries one. Larry lifts one of the triplets up and down by the arms, simulating an elevator, then puts Jack down, and he runs off, followed by Claire. Sadie, Charlotte, and Desi walk over, and he gives Desi a hug.",
    "709": "As pedestrians scatter, one of the cops stops along the side of the lorry with his gun drawn. He looks up and sees the tarpaulin rippling. He gestures to his partner, who holsters his gun and climbs a ladder on the back of the lorry. He unfastens one of the ropes attached to the tarpaulin, and the tarpaulin flies off to reveal a cargo of tightly-packed sand. The cop at the back of the lorry makes his way across the sand with a shovel. He stops and raises the shovel like a spear, but sand pushes the cop off the lorry onto the windscreen of a car. A huge wave of sand spreads across the top of the lorry and forms into a gigantic hand, which crumbles on the police gunfight. Sandman rises up like a walking giant as a group of cops take aim. As bits of Sandman crumble away in the gunfire, he sweeps down at the cops, bursting in a bucket of sand, blocking cars over as if they were toys. At the key to the city ceremony, Gwen Stacy is at the lectern flanked by city dignitaries. Photographers turn away from the stage, pointing their lenses to the sky as red and blue balloons are released and Spider-Man comes swinging through the crowd, high-fiving them as he sweeps past on a thread. He perches on top of the stage and glides onto the stage upside down. As Spider-Man hangs upside down in front of her, Gwen peels back his mask, exposing his mouth, and plants a passionate kiss on him. Mary Jane looks on in shock and walks off. Everyone looks up as a string of sand whizzes past like an express train. Elsewhere in the city, security guards load up an armored van with cash bags. As the van doors are closed, the sandstorm zooms in like a swarm of angry bees. The guard driving looks at the shadow alongside the van as the mass of sand forms into a human shape standing on the roof. Sandman punches a hole in the roof and boards inside, overwhelming the guards with a torrent of sand. The weight of the sand presses the accelerator on the van, picking up speed. Flint is zipping up a bag of cash as Spider-Man drops through the hole in the roof of the van behind him. Spider-Man dodges a couple of punches, then puts his fist through Flint's stomach. Flint's sandy fist swells to a huge size, and he punches Spider-Man through the back of the van, ripping the door off. Spider-Man fires a thread at the runaway van, leaps onto the torn-off door, and he's dragged along like a water skier as he dodges cars.",
    "205": "The door opens and a woman appears; it is Mrs. Bailey, who has changed amazingly with a harsh and tired face, and her eyes, once kindly and understanding, now show cold suspicion. She gives no sign that she knows him, which is a cruel blow to George. She starts to close the door, but George stops her, and she slams the door shut in George's face. George stands a moment, stunned, then turns and runs out to the sidewalk, until his face fills the screen, his features distorted by the emotional chaos within him. They walk out of scene. Now it is just outside a cemetery, with graves where the houses used to be. The two walk into the cemetery, with George wandering like a lost soul among the tombstones, and Clarence trotting at his heels. George jumps up, grabs Clarence by the coat collar, and shakes him, then lets Clarence go and runs off, while Clarence falls to the ground, rubbing his neck. Mary comes out the door, then turns and locks it; we see George watching her from the sidewalk. Mary is very different, with no buoyancy in her walk, none of Mary's abandon and love of life, wearing glasses, no make-up, lips compressed, elbows close to body. She looks flat, dried up, and extremely self-satisfied and efficient. George watches her as she looks up, surprised, but not recognizing him, continues on. George and Mary are on the sidewalk, and Mary starts to run away from him as he follows desperately. He catches up to her, grabs her by the arms, and keeps a tight grip on her as she struggles to free herself. Mary breaks away from him and dashes into the first door she comes to, the Blue Moon Bar, running in and screaming, while George comes in practically insane. It is crowded, and the place goes into an uproar. Some of the men grab and hold on to him, many of whom were present during the run on the Building and Loan. Mary lets out a final scream, then faints into the arms of a couple of women at the bar. Just as George breaks through the door, Bert arrives in his police car, gets out, and heads for the door to run into George as he comes out. He grabs for George, who punches him, knocking him down, then continues running down the street yelling for Clarence. Bert gets up, takes out his gun, and fires several shots after the fleeing figure. Bert gets into the police car and, with the siren screaming, sets off in pursuit of George, heading to the same part of the bridge where George was standing before Clarence jumped in.",
    "448": "Don Birnam, dressed in a light summer suit, paces up and down the lobby, keeping an eye on the elevator doors. He carries a florist's box under his arm and walks toward a circular settee, where he sits down, places the flower box next to him, and adjusts his tie, still watching the elevators. On the other side of the settee is a middle-aged couple, Mr. and Mrs. St. James. Although they can't see each other, Don overhears their conversation and eventually realizes they are Helen's parents. Mr. St. James wears a linen suit and a yellowing panama hat, while Mrs. St. James is a cheerful woman with glasses pinned to her dress. Feeling uncomfortable, Don leans his head against the back of the settee. Mr. St. James fumes slightly while Mrs. St. James laughs comfortably. Don then picks up the florist's box, rises, and moves away toward some potted palms for security, from where he looks back. Helen arrives through a revolving door in a new spring suit, sees her parents, and greets them with some conversation about Don arriving shortly. Don, undecided, locates the public phone booths and steps into one, depositing a nickel to dial the number of the Hotel Manhattan. Watching through the glass door of the booth, he sees Helen rise and move to the house phones, where she speaks into a phone and then hangs up with a crestfallen expression. As she returns to her parents, she appears to begin explaining. Meanwhile, Don quietly emerges with the florist's box and exits through a side door. In a dim foreground, the scene shifts to a small table and the vague outline of Don lying on a couch. A key turns in the lock, and Wick enters, finding an empty bottle on the floor and a half-filled glass in Don's hand. Wick turns on the entrance hall light, casually hangs his hat on a hook, and enters the living room, noticing Don's presence. Don covers his face with his arm. Wick, wearing a hat and carrying a briefcase, throws it into a chair and turns off the light.",
    "460": "Great waves of people kneeling are observed, and Buttercup, terribly moved, stands immobile among her subjects, blinking back tears as her beauty is held on for a moment. Buttercup barrels along, controlling her horse easily through a lovely, quiet, deserted area, but suddenly reins in as she encounters three men standing close together in the path, beyond whom can be seen the waters of Florin Channel. The three men are not your everyday commuter types; standing in front is a tiny man with the most angelic face, he is Sicilian, and his name is Vizzini. Beside him is a Spaniard, erect and taut as a blade of steel, and beside him is a giant. As she starts to fall, a sailboat is moored, and it's dusk now, with shadows long, as Inigo, the Spaniard, busies himself getting the boat ready, while the giant Fezzik carries Buttercup, unconscious, on board. Vizzini rips some tiny pieces of fabric from an army jacket and tucks them along the saddle of Buttercup's horse, and there is about the entire operation a sense of tremendous skill and precision as the horse takes off and they start for the boat. Vizzini hops onto the boat, in a fury, as Inigo and Fezzik stand as Vizzini advances on them and then glares at him, turns, and leaves them. During this, Inigo has gone close to Fezzik, who is very distressed at the insults he's just received. As they sail off, their voices are heard as the boat recedes; Inigo is at the helm, Fezzik stands near the body of the princess, whose eyelids flutter slightly—or do they? Vizzini sits motionless as the waves are higher, and there are only occasional flashes of moon slanting down between clouds. Inigo nods, glancing back as Vizzini turns a cold eye on the Princess and keeps staring behind them. Suddenly the three whirl and stare back, and as they do, it's hard to see; the moon is behind clouds now, but the wind whistles and the waves pound, and suddenly it's all gone ominous. Inigo, Fezzik, and Vizzini squint back, trying desperately to see, and at this moment, they are all holding their breaths. Then, the moon slips through, and Inigo was right—something is very much there—a sailboat. It's a good distance behind them but coming fast, closing the gap, as they stare at the other boat. Buttercup dives into the water, starting to swim away, and Vizzini screams as Buttercup, still close to the boat, switches from a crawl to a silent breaststroke. The wind dies, and as it does, something new is heard; Buttercup stops suddenly and treads water, still not far from the boat, staying silent, and she's gutsy. Behind her now, something dark and gigantic slithers past, and though she's scared, petrified—who wouldn't be—she makes no reply, and now a shrieking eel has zeroed in on her, and she sees it a short distance away, circling, starting to close. Buttercup is frozen, trying not to make a movement of any kind as the eel slithers closer and closer, and Buttercup knows now there's nothing she can do, it's over, all over, and now the eel opens its mouth wide, making a noise it's never made before, as its great jaws are about to clamp down.",
    "374": "It's very early morning, and the first blue light of day is glowing through the vertical blinds. Still in his chair, Will wakes up a bit at a time with the notepad on his lap and the pen in his hand, then cracks his neck, crooked from sleeping on it wrong. Wondering what woke him up, he looks to his right and holds his gaze for a breath. His father, Edward, is awake, silently gasping for breath, with eyes open, scared and confused. Edward shakes his head unambiguously, then nods. Will pours a glass from the pitcher on the nightstand and holds it to his father's lips, but Edward won't drink and pushes it away, wanting something else. It takes Edward all his strength to put together each thought, feeling like he's only half-there, fighting to hang on to this world. Will realizes something, and Edward nods again, looking around confused and increasingly scared, seeing the end approaching but not knowing exactly what's coming. Without the story, he's lost and fighting the urge to panic. Will looks around the room, increasingly desperate, and eyes the nurse call button, really wanting to press it. Edward waits for Will to begin but throws back the covers, and before Will can answer, he spots Edward rolling the chair himself, pumping both arms. Will dashes to catch up as the Heavyset Nurse leans out of Edward's hospital room. Seeing security guards heading their way, a quick-thinking Sandra shoves a nearby cart into them, bowling them down. Will brakes hard, sliding with both feet as the chair nearly crashes into the back wall while the doors close. Racing Edward down the row, they finally reach the Chevrolet, and Will lifts his father out of the chair and sets him in the passenger seat, then hands it off. Edward unscrews the cap but instead of drinking it, douses himself and soaks the blanket. Will pops the trunk, and Edward, focused completely on Will's story, enjoys that detail. Will stops short because of traffic backed up, honking to get around the jam. Then, up ahead, the cars start moving, shoved aside by massive hands as Karl the Giant clears a path by brute force. Edward leans out the window and waves to Karl, who waves back. They arrive at the same stretch of the river where it all began, where a crowd of more than 100 is waiting. Amos Calloway is here with the circus folk, including Mr. Soggybottom, as well as Edward's mother and father, the Mayor, and many others from along the way. While Ping scans the horizon, Jing nuzzles with her boyfriend, Norther Winslow. It's Ping who first spots the Chevrolet. Will gets out of the Chevrolet, overwhelmed by the crowd.",
    "431": "He looks over at Charlie, asleep in the next bed, then rolls out of bed and goes to the window, where he sees a neon sign flashing across the street that reads AMES BILLIARDS. Eddie returns to his bed, leaves the keys to the Packard and some money on the night table next to Charlie, picks up his valise, his hanging bag, and his leather cue case, and goes toward the door. As Eddie enters, carrying his bags, a few early morning travelers -- some soldiers and a man in a Stetson hat -- pass him by. He has been up all night. It is a typical bus station washroom at that time of the morning, with the residue of a full day's traveling in evidence: crumpled paper towels, cigarette butts, and more. Part of the residue is a drunk who sits on the shoeshine seat, fast asleep. Eddie looks at him, shaking his head. A sign on the wall reads IS THIS YOUR LUCKY DAY? Eddie laughs to himself, puts his hanging bag and cue case on a chair, then turns to face his image in the mirror. A wizened old attendant sits nearby, whose every move seems to require a tremendous effort, and shuffles over to grab a towel as Eddie removes his jacket. Near the row of coin lockers in the waiting room is a small lunch counter and several tables. At one table, facing the lockers, is a young woman, Sarah: a book is open before her, and a cup of coffee, and an ashtray filled with cigarette butts. She looks up for an instant as Eddie appears, then her eyes return to the printed page. He locks his bags in a locker and now has on a clean shirt and is clean and freshly shaven. Moving toward the counter, Eddie notices Sarah and goes to the lunch counter, still looking at her. He sniffs some wrapped sandwiches, then wanders over to a table next to Sarah's and sits down. She ignores him and returns to her reading. Eddie keeps looking at her. Her hair is brown, cut short, practically straight. Her lips are pale and thin, and the bone structure of her face, although delicate, is much in evidence. There is a suggestion of tired wakefulness, of self-sufficiency about her, and a frank, open regard which has nothing in it to imply flirtation -- or the lack of it. Sarah goes back to reading. The waitress arrives to take Eddie's order, and Eddie holds up two fingers to the waitress, who departs. The coffee comes, and Eddie leans back against the wall and shuts his eyes. He slips off to sleep, and the waitress brings a check.",
    "467": "The Prince grabs the empty poison packet, hands it to Rugen after first sniffing it himself, and as he vaults onto his horse, they all charge off. Buttercup, being spun into camera view, falls heavily as the Man In Black releases her at the edge of an almost sheer ravine. The drop is sharp and severe; below, the ravine floor is flat, but getting there would not be half the fun. The Man In Black says nothing, watching Buttercup closely, and if she did not hate Roberts so, there would probably be tears. Buttercup nods. The Man In Black is about to reply as they stand on the edge of the sheer ravine, but then something catches his attention. The dust cloud caused by Humperdinck's horses is rising up into the sky, and while his attention is on the dust cloud, Buttercup pushes him with all the strength she has. The Man In Black, teetering on the ravine edge for a moment, then begins to fall, rolling, spinning, and crashing down toward the flat rock floor of the ravine. Buttercup, staring transfixed at what she has wrought, stands alone as from far below words drift up to her on the wind. Without a second thought, she starts into the ravine and soon is falling, spinning and twisting, cartwheeling down toward what is left of her beloved. The dust cloud rises as Prince Humperdinck and the others rein in at the spot where Buttercup promised ransom in exchange for her freedom. The mere mention of the Fire Swamp makes him pale. Two bodies lie a few feet apart, not moving. After a time, Westley slowly forces his body into motion. Buttercup, bruised and torn, watches as Westley crawls slowly toward her. They begin to kiss, tender and loving and gentle, racing along the ravine floor. Westley glances up at the top of the cliff, looking down at Westley and Buttercup, and it really doesn't look any worse than any other moist, sulfurous, infernal horror you might run across. Great trees block the sun, and though Buttercup is clearly panicked and maybe Westley is too, he moves jauntily along, sword in hand. The giant trees, thick and black-green, look ominous as hell and shield all but intermittent stripes of sun. Westley instantly forces Buttercup to sit, gathering her flaming hem in his hands, doing his best to suffocate the fire.",
    "966": "David halts an oncoming car by holding up a hand and pulls Elise safely across the street. Fording through it, he leads Elise out onto a grassy island. Looking up, she sees the Statue of Liberty towering above. David spots a pair of doors, crosses to them, and faces Elise. Elise's eyes pool with tears. She hangs her head and then takes in David's earnest expression. A tear rolls down her cheek. She swallows and nods bravely. Elise goes to him and takes his hand. They face a set of double doors. David takes hold of the right hand knob. They turn the knobs, and the doors open to a long hallway with a polished marble floor. As they enter, the doors shut behind them. On the street, Thompson and his aide gawk. Their plan book shows David and Elise's pathway has united, and intermittent red dots flash in a column. At the bureau, Harry reads the same in his plan book. With a grave look, he steps away. David and Elise push open a pair of doors and enter the bureau reading room. David knocks a staffer out of the way. Leaving Elise behind him, he shoves another. They race along a walkway bordering the room. David finds a door, and they hurry through. Thompson and his staff enter the reading room. Bureau members stare as they march down the center aisle. Meanwhile, David and Elise hurry up a palatial spiral staircase. In the reading room, Thompson leads his team to the peripheral walkway, then the door. David glances upward. The flights of stairs seem to continue infinitely. Now in a white marble hall. The staffer holds out a large manila envelope. Harry grimly takes it, heads back down the hall, and turns out of view. Now a black-garbed intervention team passes through a columned archway. Thompson and his staff jog up the spiraling stairway. At a landing, he slides open a door of bronze bars. Now David and Elise reach a hallway. He takes her hand, and they hurry on. David peers over his shoulder. They reach a door, glance about, and go through. In a green-carpeted office, a bookish receptionist looks up. The two intruders run through a series of identical offices. David offers a staffer a cordial wave as he and Elise proceed through the offices. Now the black-clad intervention team marches into a records archive where rows of bookcases shelve white-spine volumes. David and Elise arrive in another identical records room. Reaching the far end, they find two intervention teams approaching. David leads Elise through more of the bafflingly connected records rooms. Finding a dark green door framed in green marble, he desperately yanks it open.",
    "464": "The narrative begins with an unsuccessful attempt by the protagonist, followed by more failed efforts. As he attempts a few final desperate moves, they prove to be ineffective. The Man In Black is then smashed into a stone pillar and pinned there by the six-fingered sword. He switches hands, fully engaging in the battle, but is pushed back down the steps. Trying various styles, he is eventually controlled by the Man In Black, who then disarms him. Inigo retreats, jumping from the stairs to a moss-covered bar, swings out, lands, and retrieves his sword while the Man In Black watches him, then tosses his own sword to the landing. Mimicking Inigo, the Man In Black dives to the bar, performs a gymnastic maneuver with a high-scoring backflip, leaving Inigo staring in awe. He then dunks Inigo's head with the sword handle, rendering Inigo unconscious. The Man In Black retrieves his scabbard and pursues the Princess. Vizzini observes from a mountain path as the Man In Black runs below while FEZZIK stands with the Princess nearby. Time passes and Vizzini points them out. A nearby boulder is noted as Vizzini and Buttercup hurry away. FEZZIK grabs a rock and moves behind the boulder, as the Man In Black races up the mountain trail. He approaches a bend, slows, and listens. Hearing nothing, he continues, and a rock suddenly shatters on a boulder before him. Moving into the path, he picks up another rock but is signaled by the Man In Black to stop, who removes his sword and scabbard and approaches FEZZIK unarmed. He tosses away the rock, and although the Man In Black is sizable, he is dwarfed by FEZZIK. The Man In Black then launches an attack, delivering fierce blows, twisting FEZZIK’s arm, and executing wrestling moves, but FEZZIK is unaffected. Finally, the Man In Black steps back, gazing up at the Giant, and they prepare to begin their confrontation again.",

That night, Willie drives a seven series BMW in through the gates of the motel, sees someone with a torch in his room, and kills the lights of the car. She takes the strawberry blonde wig off and comes over. On the phone, Willie puts his stuff down on a bed and begins taking off his fake snow-covered boots. He gets off the bed, goes over to a wardrobe, and the kid watches Willie in the bath, blinking a couple of times. Willie lies in bed with the kid hovering at the bedside, and the next morning, Willie is still asleep in bed when the kid comes in, clutching a glass of orange juice and an advent calendar. Gradually, Willie surfaces from his slumber, sits up, and takes the glass, gives the kid a look, and puts the glass down. The kid climbs onto the bed, settles beside Willie, opens the relevant door on the calendar, and then reads what's written on the back of the door. The kid gives a doubtful-looking Willie the door, knocks the chocolate out of the calendar, performs the action, and turns to Willie. The kid gets off the bed, and Willie looks dubiously at the door off the calendar. At lunchtime, he is eating with Marcus and his oriental girlfriend, Lois, at a restaurant in the mall. Marcus regards him with thinly-veiled contempt as Willie masticates a massive mouthful of salad and glares vainfully at Marcus. Lois and Marcus head off, and a mom and her young son spot Willie in his Santa suit. Jimmy's mother looks at Willie expectantly as she holds the hand of her sulky boy by her side. Jimmy's mum scoops him up and hurries away, leaving dear old Santa to his salad. Out in the shops, Lois scrutinizes a swatch of fabric, tries on a pair of designer sunglasses, moves on, and looks over a mink stole with a very critical eye. Having decided it's not too bad, she notes it down on her shopping list, and detecting a possible sale, a saleswoman comes over to her. Again, Gin, the security chief, walks up behind a boy pursuing a shelf of video games and then turns back to the boy. Back at his new digs, Willie is playing checkers with the kid who moves a piece, keeping his finger on it, uncertain, he moves it back again. Willie eyes the kid a little impatiently as the kid moves another counter, still keeps a pudgy finger on it, looks at Willie, changes his mind, and moves it back. Willie watches as the kid moves a third piece but still keeps his finger on the counter.",
    "204": "The scene begins with a series of shots depicting night clubs, cafes, bars, liquor stores, and pool halls emitting blaring jazz music. Gower's drugstore is now a pawnbroker's establishment, and the motion picture theatre has become a burlesque house. George stops before the former offices of the Building and Loan, where a crowd watches the police raiding the place, dragging screaming women into a patrol wagon, including Violet Bick, who is dressed as a tart. George talks to one of the cops but is shoved aside. He notices Ernie's taxi cruising by, which stops to pick him up. As Ernie drives, he spots Bert the cop by his police car and signals him to follow, indicating a problematic passenger. Bert follows in his car as the taxi parks at the curb, and George exits to look at a house, momentarily stopped by its dilapidated appearance with broken windows, sagging porch, fallen roof section, and askew doors and shutters. The police car arrives and Bert and Ernie watch George, who approaches the house like a doomed man. Ernie uses his cab's spotlight to illuminate the house's interior ghostlike. George cries out, appearing like a call for help. Clarence suddenly leans against a wall as Bert, with gun in hand, stands in the entrance and rushes toward him. Ernie follows closely, ready to assist. Bert tries to lead George away, but George struggles to explain, prompting Bert to raise his gun intending to strike George. Clarence intervenes, biting Bert's wrist, allowing George to escape the house and run down the street while Bert and Clarence wrestle, falling to the ground. Bert attempts to handcuff Clarence, but Clarence disappears, leaving Bert amazed before he runs out of the scene. Meanwhile, George runs up the path and knocks on the door of the house.",
    "501": "The establishment is called the SILVER BULLET, with a sign flashing COCKTAILS — BEER — DANCING — FOOD. It features a large gravel parking lot filled with many pickup trucks and older cars, indicating that even though it's early, it is a true night spot, and it's already pretty crowded and lively. There are ten pool tables surrounded by crowds, a long bar filled with customers, and tables and booths, while the room is dense with smoke. The dance floor remains inactive as the band is still setting up, and there are many single men present. Numerous heads turn to watch Thelma and Louise as they find an empty table. A waitress arrives and leaves two menus at their table. After leaving briefly, the Waitress returns with Louise's drink, which Louise understands. Harlan laughs, and although Thelma joins in, she doesn't fully get the joke, and Harlan soon leaves. Thelma downs her Wild Turkey shot and signals the Waitress for another. Both women momentarily drift into thoughts about their domestic issues until the Waitress returns. Thelma observes Harlan at the bar making dancing gestures at her, she smiles and waves, but then her expression turns serious when she looks back at Louise. Thelma's speech is rapid, but Louise is accustomed to it, smiling wistfully at Thelma's insights. Louise finishes her Wild Turkey, raising her glass as the BAND starts a lively tune. She then drinks her tequila shot and raises her glass again. Thelma has been dancing with Harlan for some time, while Louise is dancing with a quiet man named Dan. Thelma, breathless, drunk, and giggly, holds a beer bottle and laughs over nothing as Harlan watches her closely, which Louise notices before heading to the bathroom. Thelma stumbles, dropping her beer, and Louise approaches a long line of women outside the bathroom. Harlan steers Thelma out the door to the parking lot. Thelma is limp and pulls away as Harlan leans close to her and tries to embrace her. Just as Louise exits the bathroom while another woman enters, she scans the room for Thelma, approaches the table, and sees Thelma's belongings still there.",
    "936": "Holmes is pulled up by Watson, who removes the meat hook from his shoulder, and as Holmes looks up at him, Watson helps him up and supports him as they make their way back across the factory floor, passing several Howitzers ready to be shipped out. They arm themselves, with Watson carrying a machine gun and Holmes a pistol, and Watson leads the way. In the ruins, Moran frees Moriarty from the rubble. Sim spots Holmes and Watson, running ahead of them. Holmes sees some guards, and Watson opens fire, laying down covering fire as Sim and the gypsies lead the way out of the factory. As Watson retreats and reloads, Holmes shoots a guard dead, reloads, and follows the others out into a rail yard, where one of the gypsies is killed by the rough-looking twins. Holmes and Watson return fire, killing them both. The raiders make their way to the perimeter wall of the rail yard and throw a rope over it, but before they can escape, guards spot them and open fire, forcing them to take cover. Watson returns fire with his machine gun, but the guards respond with a heavy-caliber Gatling gun, forcing them behind some crates as a huge artillery piece is turned on them. The shell goes over their heads and blasts a hole in the perimeter wall, and Holmes and the others run for it, out into the woods beyond. In the distance, a railway line runs through the trees with a train approaching. The captain of the guards rallies his troops through the breach in the perimeter wall to chase them down, and as the guards shoot through the trees, others in the rail yard adjust the mortars and open fire. Explosions erupt around Holmes, Watson, and the others as they keep running towards the railway line. Moran, giving chase, picks up a rifle and takes a shot at Watson, clipping his right flank, but he keeps running as bullets rip chunks out of tree trunks. Holmes returns fire with his pistol, hitting a guard in the chest amidst massive explosions, as Sims sprints forward with guards in chase. Moran takes another shot, hitting one of the gypsies, and Sims sees the man go down but keeps running. Little Hansel, a heavy-caliber artillery piece, has a massive shell loaded into its breach, the barrel's elevation is adjusted, a powder charge is loaded, and after final adjustments, the gun crew chief gives the order to fire.",
    "492": "Malcolm stares up at the historic Philadelphia church quietly, with its old stone and huge towers making it stand out from the modern buildings all around it. He has to use all his strength to push open the highly ornate doors and slips inside. Only a few people sit and pray in the sea of oak pews. Malcolm scans the majestic room and finds what he's looking for in the last row of the church. He moves down the center aisle towards the back and finds Cole playing in his pew with a set of green and beige plastic soldiers. Cole makes the soldiers talk to each other but stays rigid, hands clutching a handful of plastic riflemen. Malcolm nods at the information, smiles at Cole, and his eyes drift down to Cole's arms, which are covered in tiny cuts and bruises. Cole and Malcolm just stare at each other. Lynn walks over to Cole, checks his tie, and unclips the tie. Cole takes a seat at the kitchen table as Lynn walks back into the laundry room. The dog is gone now, and Lynn reaches into the dryer, digging for a new tie. She finds one, then turns and steps back into the kitchen and screams at the top of her lungs, as every cabinet and every drawer is wide open. Cole sits at the kitchen table, his hands pressed flat on the tabletop, looking shaken. Neither says anything for a beat. Lynn looks over to the open cabinet near the sink, where the pop tarts are clearly visible. Lynn leans down, Cole does, and he looks at her eyes. Cole turns to see Lynn holding the pop tarts, takes them from her, and leaves. Lynn glances to the kitchen table, and her gaze stops on the two tiny handprints of sweat formed on the table's surface. Tommy Tammisimo, a tough-looking, eight-year-old Italian kid in his school uniform, waits at the bottom of Cole's brownstone stairs. Cole emerges from the brownstone, moves down the steps, and the two boys begin their walk down the street to school. Tommy puts his arm around Cole, and Cole waves back. When the two boys turn the corner and are out of Lynn's sight, Tommy rips his arm away. Cole starts to smile too and thinks. Cole and Lynn smile at each other, and Lynn takes Cole's school bag and jacket before moving to the kitchen. The den doubles as a playroom, with boxes of old toys sitting in the corner and a small, plastic, multi-colored table on the rug. Cole appears in the doorway, and Malcolm sits up and smiles.",
    "1142": "She peers mischievously into the water as Harry attempts to preserve his modesty with some bubbles while Myrtle leans her head on his naked shoulder. In the library, Ron puts the golden egg on the table, and he and Hermione leave reluctantly as Harry piles up his books and tidies his notes. Moody leaves them alone, and Harry looks at Neville apologetically. At the lake, Fred and George take bets as Neville hands over the gillyweed. Three tall spectator pavilions have been erected in the lake, and Harry chokes on the gillyweed as three of the competitors dive in and Moody pushes Harry in after them. Gasping for breath, he sinks down amongst the metal supports of the pavilions, clutching his neck as gills develop on either side like a fish. He looks down and sees his feet turn into flippers, holding up his hands as they become webbed. Seamus stares down into the water as Harry suddenly hurtles up out of the water, somersaults in the air like a dolphin, and vanishes again under the surface. Harry kicks out with his flippers and swims through the water weed over the rock-strewn bed of the lake, which falls away in front of him into a deep ravine as he dives into the murky darkness, arms held close by his sides. Fish swim beside him as he moves easily through the water, wearing shorts and a singlet with Potter written on the back, and his wand is in a sheath, strapped to his leg. He heads through a narrow channel, peering uncertainly through the cloudy water, and swims through ropes of dark green weed hanging like curtains in front of him. Harry looks over his shoulder and spots a figure behind: Fleur is swimming strongly, a delicate filmy veil over her mouth and nose, with her long fair hair streaming behind her. Something whips past her face, and Fleur suddenly disappears, pulled down out of sight as Harry is knocked aside by something that flashes past. Recovering himself, he catches sight of a silvery tail vanishing into the Forest of Weed and follows the merperson as it leads him above the jagged rocks on the bottom of the lake. Far ahead, he sees the ruins of a stone archway and kicks out strongly with his flipper feet, with tall columns rising around him like an underwater cathedral. He swims past ruined archways, their outlines softened by algae and water weed, before reaching four people in black cloaks floating upright in front of him - Ron, Hermione, Cho, and a small girl with long fair hair - their eyes closed and faces blank, while unfriendly-looking merpeople lurk ominously close, carrying sharp tridents and lashing their tails. Harry unties the rope around Ron's ankle and moves toward Hermione.",
    "174": "Harry's smile goes away as Chili smiles at her, and they appear hooked. Martin is leaning and then leans forward. Bo Catlett exchanges a look with the Bear and signals the waiter. Karen, Martin, and Chili walk out to the driveway, and Chili follows Martin over to the minivan, opening the door for him. In the meantime, Bo Catlett and Harry are laughing, with Harry very drunk as he finishes another drink. Harry looks at Bo, unable to believe what's happening to his life, thinks for a moment, shakes his head, and looks around the restaurant. Bo and the Bear exchange looks as Chili and Karen enter the restaurant. Chili checks out the bar, sees they aren't there, then looks up at the railing, keeping his eyes up there as he speaks. Another glance at the Bear, and they all look. Chili moves to the staircase, seeing the Bear in his Hawaiian shirt standing a few steps from the top, and slowly moves his gaze up through hibiscus until he's looking at the man's bearded face. Chili continues up the stairs to where Bo Catlett stands beside the table, unbuttons his coat, and gets within three steps of the guy before stopping, keeping his eyes fixed on the man's gut. Bo walks past Chili and goes down the stairs. Karen watches as Bo Catlett puts a hand in his coat pocket and steps right up to Chili; she looks at him. Even Karen is looking at him differently now as they slide into the booth with a now shocked, rapidly sobering Harry. Karen and Chili look at each other as Harry finishes his drink, and Harry looks at the two of them differently now. Chili looks at Karen, smiles, and shakes his head. Harry looks at him and then hangs up at the other end. Bones thinks about it a moment and tosses the book aside, while phone to his ear, Harry downs another drink and sits up as Bones bursts out of the john, grabs the phone, getting Bones's attention. Bones stares at the phone, sits there a moment, also staring at the phone, while Chili stands as Curtis opens Chili's wallet, looks at the driver's license, and Dunbar in the plaid shirt pulls the Lakers T-shirt out of the athletic bag, feels around inside. Chili watches Curtis pick up the note with the Newark Flight number and arrival time written on it, glances about to make sure no one's around, then pulls the key for the 'right' locker out from a crack in the pavement near the stairwell. Now there's a big guy in a plaid wool shirt next to him, the same guy seen when Bo Catlett was there, and another guy down the aisle talking on his hand radio.",
    "455": "The Assistant Brute takes the full force of the blow right in the chops. Two large tubs are present, one filled with steaming water, the other with icy water. Without a word, Fezzik stuffs Inigo's head into the icy water, then, after a reasonable amount of time, pulls him out, ducks him into the steaming stuff, and, a short time after that, puts him back in the cold again, then back in the hot. Then a wild look hits Inigo. Yellin enters and kneels, showing the key dangling from a chain around his neck. Just at that moment, Buttercup enters, and the Prince looks at her blankly for a moment. Buttercup stares at Humperdinck. With that, he whirls, turns on The Machine, and shoves the lever all the way up. There has never been such pain. A few children pale and bolt toward their parents. The Albino appears wheeling a barrow as Inigo's sword pushes at his chest. The Albino shakes his head, says nothing, and Fezzik crunches the Albino on the top of the head as if he had a hammer and was driving in a nail. The Albino drops without a sound. Inigo kneels, the sword held tight between his hands, eyes closed, facing the grove of trees, starting to talk with a low and strange voice. Now he rises, eyes still closed, as he walks forward, the great sword held in his hands. Fezzik, frightened, follows close behind, walking blind through the grove of trees. Inigo moves to the Secret Knot, hesitates, then moves past it, then stops. For a long moment, he stands frozen, suddenly whirls, eyes still closed, and the sword strikes home dead center into a knot, and nothing happens. He has failed. In utter despair, he collapses against the tree, against a knot in the tree, against the knot in the tree, which slides away, revealing the staircase. Fezzik and Inigo look at each other, then start down to Westley, dead by The Machine. Fezzik leans over him, listening for a heartbeat, then he looks at Inigo and shakes his head. For a moment, he just sags, terribly excited, and looks stronger than they've yet seen him, desperately fighting for control. Inigo, in despair, in the Pit, as before. They approach the door and knock. If Mel Brooks' 2000 Year Old Man was really old, he'd resemble this guy. Inigo pounds again, and the window is shut. They rap on the door. Inigo and Fezzik hurry inside, with Fezzik carrying Westley who is just starting to stiffen up a little.",
    "1045": "Howard zooms back in vision as Barnes watches keenly, observing Veronica throw her bag under the podium. Suddenly, Barnes and Howard are thrown off their feet by the force of the explosion, and flames soar up from the podium while black smoke fills the plaza. As the smoke subsides, Howard slowly sits up, rubs the back of his neck, checks his hand for blood, and takes in the scene of devastation in front of him. He stretches out for his camera by his side and sees Barnes with the injured Matthews. Howard pushes himself up onto his feet, looks around, and sees little Anna standing alone. She nods OK, and he picks her up in his arms and runs out of the plaza with her. Outside, he hears Holden chasing Enrique, sees Enrique making his escape, and notices Holden and Parsons in pursuit. Still carrying Anna, Howard runs after them and stops in front of a policewoman as Enrique keeps running, with Holden and Parsons racing after him on the street outside the plaza. Howard heads after them, filming as he goes, as Enrique dashes into a gated stone building with Holden and Parsons sprinting after him. Howard charges through the tall gate and halts inside a large church while the agents pursue Enrique out into the street, with Howard hot on their tail. Anna looks frantically for her mother and mistakenly chases a different olive skin woman. Howard videotapes a red sedan plowing into Enrique, who staggers to his feet and runs, prompting Parsons and Holden to dart after him across the busy road. Howard dashes through the panicking crowd in hot pursuit as they race under colored canopies on a market street. Heavyset Howard stops to catch his breath, captures Holden and Parsons on tape as they disappear around a corner, and then darts down a parallel street. Beating down the side street, Howard sees Enrique make a B-line for a busy highway, beams incredulously, and gives chase with the camcorder held out in front of him. Enrique's pistol is holstered in his belt beside his police badge as a white sedan brakes sharply while he bounds out into the road. Howard stops by the roadside, spots a pedestrian bridge over the highway, scampers up steel steps, and hot foots it along the bridge. He stops and stares out through some chain link mesh to see Enrique slow to a stop at an underpass and cranes the camera on him, spotting Enrique's badge as a squad car drives up in front of Enrique and a policeman approaches him.",
    "21": "Jackie breaks into tears, and they share a helpless half-laugh before Frank appears in the doorway. She starts to hand him a large mirror from her purse but thinks better of it. However, he holds out his hand, and she gives him the mirror. Simon holds the mirror poised for a moment of discovery, takes a breath as if about to dive underwater, and starts to look, giving himself a small, mumbled pep talk. He quickly brings his hand up and looks at the mirror. An establishing shot features Verdell tied up in front as Carol looks totally beat while setting down a cup of coffee. Melvin cranes periodically to keep an eye on his dog. When she reaches for the plate of uneaten bacon, he goes nuts, and she is jolted by the insensitivity of his interruption, but he doesn't notice and becomes almost chatty. Melvin nods, slightly frustrated about not being able to finish his dog story, and he pockets the remaining bacon. As Melvin walks Verdell back home, we notice, a beat before Melvin, something remarkable: Verdell is avoiding the cracks in the sidewalk. Melvin slows down and observes the dog mirroring his behavior by carefully placing his paws to avoid cracks. Melvin laughs out loud and hurriedly puts on plastic gloves to lift the dog to eye level. Later, Melvin is at his computer, reading to himself with great satisfaction as Verdell sits fascinated by the speed of his master's fingers on the keyboard. He reads his writing aloud to the dog, and as he looks over, Verdell trots over, and without realizing it, Melvin smiles at him, surprising Frank. Verdell looks up at him, then Melvin walks to the door, turns the lock, and checks that they are locked. He feels anguished until he briefly breaks down while the dog looks on. Melvin opens the door and shudders when he sees the scarred Simon in a wheelchair. A beat of silence follows as Melvin considers whether to comply with Simon, who pats his leg, trying unsuccessfully to get Verdell to approach him. Instead, the dog goes to the door and scratches at it. Jackie starts to pick the dog up as Melvin bursts in on the psychiatrist and emits one word. Melvin shakes his head and notices every new element carefully before getting comfortable. In the almost-crowded waiting room, more patients are visible as Melvin passes through, visibly drawn and upset. He stops, eyes on them, and they look stricken. He exits as Cheryl, a heavy-set waitress, reluctantly moves to his table while he, unseen, takes out his utensils and arranges them.",
    "417": "Mrs. Robinson's face appears in the crack in the door at Elaine's shoulder, and Elaine looks from Ben's face to the crack through which she can see her mother's eyes staring. She moves toward him as though to hit him, and Elaine slams the door shut. Mrs. Robinson stands at the end of it, looking at Ben, and he looks at her in horror. She gets further and further away as though it is a very long hall in a very bad dream. Ben sits cross-legged on his bed in the dark, his back against the fish tank, smoking. Ben drives by in his car and looks at the house. Dressed differently, Ben stands by the window overlooking the backyard, and over his shoulder, Mr. Braddock is seen down by the pool, dressed in a sweater, cleaning the pool with a long-handled scoop. Mr. Braddock looks up at Ben's window, and Ben moves aside. Ben is standing behind a tree watching the Robinson house, where in the driveway, Elaine is getting into the Robinson car, and Mr. Robinson is putting Elaine's luggage into the car. Mrs. Robinson stands at the door as Mr. Robinson gets into the car and starts it, and the car drives down the driveway and down the street. Ben, dressed differently again, sits in a chair by his desk writing. On the piece of paper is written: DEAR ELAINE, ELAINE, ELAINE, ELAINE, and her name several dozen times. He stops and looks up. It is early morning. A swinging door is pushed open to reveal Mr. Braddock, dressed in a bathrobe, standing at the kitchen counter by the window through which an orange tree can be seen, while Ben stands inside the door. Mr. Braddock starts to smile. Ben is driving his car, and on the empty campus, dressed carefully in his black suit, he sits on a bench in the quadrangle outside of Wendell Hall. The quadrangle and the area around him fill up with students; walking, talking, hurrying to class, strolling, sitting, reading, handing out petitions, etc. Elaine comes out carrying her books and walks in Ben's direction, approaching from the distance. As she walks, she is joined by another girl with whom she converses, and as they approach, they are joined by a tall boy with a beard. He starts toward them, falters, straightens himself, and Mr. McCleery stops and turns, almost causing Ben to run into him. Mr. McCleery takes a couple of steps up, Ben following, and stops again before taking a couple more steps and stopping once more. He looks at Ben searchingly, then turns and continues up the stairs and down the hall. The lady sitting next to Elaine looks at her, turns around and looks at Ben, then looks at Elaine again.",
    "452": "Westley examines where the flames burst over Buttercup and pulls her aside to safety as another great spout of flame suddenly shoots up, while Buttercup is frozen with fear. He takes her hand and gently leads her forward as they move slowly through a particularly dangerous part of the Fire Swamp. Later, with the sun slanting down at a slightly different angle, Westley picks up Buttercup as they walk along, moves her out of danger, puts her back down, and continues talking without missing a beat. Using his sword, Westley slices a path for them, causing the vines to groan as they fall, all while chatting. Westley picks Buttercup up to carry her across some swamp water that is bridged by a narrow, rickety tree branch, and they have by now crossed the pond. As Buttercup, perplexed, is about to reply, the ground gives way beneath her—it’s Lightning Sand—and she sinks into it, crying Westley’s name before disappearing. Whirling, Westley slashes a U-shaped vine in half, grabs it, drops his sword, and dives into the lightning sand, clutching the other end of the vine, resulting in another cloud of white powder. Nothing can be seen now except the lightning sand, which is lovely and lethal. A giant R.O.U.S. darts into view, sniffs around, and then disappears. Westley, with lungs near bursting, explodes out of the sand with Buttercup across his shoulders, pulling them to the edge of the pit using the vine. Buttercup's face is caked with white powder—in her eyes, ears, hair, and mouth—yet she is still probably beautiful, but you have to look awfully hard to see it, as Westley continues to pull them to safety. The R.O.U.S., high above them, watches. Buttercup is placed against a tree while Westley cleans the lightning sand from her face. The R.O.U.S., now on a much lower branch, stares down at Westley, who stares back. As Buttercup's eyes flutter, he continues to work on her. There are now two R.O.U.S.s that have climbed into a nearby tree, staring hungrily down. Westley picks Buttercup up, puts an arm around her, and starts to walk with her as he encouragingly continues talking.",
    "937": "A lever is pulled, a ratchet releases, and the powder charge is ignited. The massive gun recoils violently as a huge ball of flame erupts from its muzzle, and the shock wave blows one of the gun crew's hat off. In the woods, the shell rips through a tree trunk, splintering it into matchwood, felling another tree just behind Holmes and missing him by a whisker. The shell explodes ahead of him, shattering the trees and filling the air with needle-sharp splinters, and the epic blast blows the fugitives off their feet. The guards keep coming, closing in, and Holmes lies still for a few moments, temporarily stunned by the blast. As dirt falls on his face, he comes to, and he and Watson get to their feet. Watson immediately tackles a guard as fierce hand-to-hand fighting breaks out, and Moran runs towards the fray. A gypsy shoots a guard just before a mortar shell goes off beside Holmes. As he leans against a tree, a guard comes at him, the bullet hits the tree, and then the guard tries to bayonet Holmes, who punches the guard away and reloads the guard's rifle. He hands it to Watson, who uses it to shoot Moran as he appears over a rise. Holmes, Watson, Sim, and the surviving gypsies run to the train and scramble into one of the boxcars. As they're doing so, Moran starts to sit up, examines his injury, and, as Holmes climbs up into the boxcar, Moran gets his gun, takes several deep breaths, loads his rifle, and takes aim. He shoots one of the gypsies as he tries to board the train, and another gypsy watches from the boxcar as his dead comrade is left behind. Moran stares after the train as it carries Holmes and the others to safety. The track winds along a wooded valley, and in the morning, the train makes its way across a snow-covered plain with craggy mountains in the distance. Sim sits cradling Holmes in her arms as Watson stitches a wound in his own flank, and Holmes closes his eyes. Sim regards Holmes with growing concern, holding her hand in front of his mouth, and concerned, Watson goes over to her and examines Holmes, who's completely unresponsive. A gypsy does so as Watson pumps away at Holmes' chest and thumps it. Still no response, Watson pounds Holmes' chest again. Sim pulls Watson away from Holmes and hugs him tight, and the gypsy pats Watson on the shoulder. Watson looks down sadly at Holmes, who lies motionless in the boxcar. Something suddenly occurs to him, and Watson opens the leather pouch which Holmes gave him and takes out a vial and hypodermic needle. Watson uncaps the needle and plunges it into Holmes' chest.",
    "382": "In an Alabama field where a second-rate carnival is parked, Edward controls his breathing, trying to push through the pain while still carrying the backpack seen earlier, scratched up from his trip through Spectre. She returns with her camera as Edward smiles, masking the pain. A devilish smile appears as he joins the crowd and heads into the big-top, where a troupe of stilt-walking firebreathers finishes their act to tremendous applause. As the performers clear away, the circus' owner-and-ringmaster, Amos Calloway, who is only four feet tall but has a titanic presence, approaches the stands. From behind Amos, carnies begin rolling a massive ball towards the crowd, and as the carnies back away, a deep drum roll begins. A foot suddenly bursts out from within the ball with gasps from the crowd, revealing its massive size as Edward looks closer. As the drum beat intensifies, a second foot, followed by hands, shoulders, and finally a head, emerges. From a low angle, we see just how massive he is, seeming to fill the Heavens, resembling more ogre than man with his shaved head and giant club. In the bandstands, a young boy's jaw drops in awe as a tight spotlight follows him, revealing faces in the crowd. Colossus passes Edward, who seems unimpressed, and leans with the spotlight, whistling to get the big man's attention, then points to the edge of the stands where his friend is sitting on the dirt. The giant stands up, a good foot taller than Colossus, causing gasps and nervous anticipation from the crowd. Amos stands stunned, megaphone dangling, while Colossus, realizing the gig is up, with a resigned shrug, rests his club on his shoulder and walks away into the shadows. As the stands empty, Edward and Karl talk to Amos, who pulls Karl aside for a hard sell, as Edward notices a beautiful young woman in a blue dress and hat leaving with her family. For no good reason, she looks back, making eye contact with Edward, freezing all motion around them as a fiery baton halts mid-twirl and a spilled box of popcorn hangs in mid-air. Only Edward is free to move, winding his way between the frozen bodies and ducking underneath arms to get closer to the woman.",
    "783": "Kevin slips into an apartment as another resident exits, while Jane is in the kitchen. She puts down a cup she's washing, goes to the door, and sees Kevin through the peephole, looking exasperated. Kevin, with his eyes closed, hopes he hasn't gone too far and talks into a dictaphone. In astonishment, his jaw drops as he spots a closet full of dresses. Jane rushes after him, barges him out of the way, and closes the closet doors before striding off to put on a shiny dark green dress. Kevin, disbelieving, takes a photo of the closet, and Jane rolls her eyes self-consciously. She then pulls out a yellow dress with pleats and orange flowers, while a bridesmaid falls over. Next is a twirly orange number and a Japanese-style kimono, and they bow to each other as Kevin takes a photo. At a wedding, Jane crouches to be the same height as the Japanese bridesmaids, one wearing long black gloves and even a man's evening suit. Jane performs a high-stepping routine with a top hat, sashays in pink floral print, and models a bright dress like yellow and pink candy floss. Kevin gets caught up in a white skirt like a giant snowflake, with dazzling yellow. The wedding takes place on a lawn overlooking the ocean, with bridesmaids in tiny pink strapless mini-dresses. Jane poses with a heavily made-up bride and much older, open-shirted groom in gauzy red, shiny candy pink, and flowery baby blue while Kevin lounges on the couch taking pictures. Kevin finds a cowboy hat with a red flower on the brim, and at a wedding, Jane sits on a horse that faces the wrong way for the photo. He also finds a pair of flippers, and at an underwater wedding, Jane smiles in a floral bathing cap as the bride and groom share a watery kiss. Kevin reaches for the dictaphone and catches Jane off guard, looking sad and vulnerable. They sit opposite each other in uncomfortable silence, and later, still looking unhappy, Jane hangs the dresses back in the closet. On a sunny day, Jane arrives at Tess' apartment and becomes suspicious as Tess blocks the doorway, while Pedro is vacuuming and dancing, making Jane look appalled. Meanwhile, Kevin is at work, watches Maureen walk off, shaking his head, and later he and Jane scan bar codes on wedding list items, including china penguins. Jane looks mortified as Kevin grins and brandishes the scanner. High above the busy streets at the New York Journal, Kevin approaches Maureen's office, looking horrified. Jane hurries to meet George on the terrace of the boathouse. Back at the paper, Kevin picks up the phone.",
    "568": "Edwards is shocked and pulls his own weapon, pointing it at Kay's head, then whirls around to see Jeebs' body growing another head, which takes only four or five seconds. Kay raises the weapon again, threatening, and Jeebs nods, the point taken. Edwards, still dazed by Jeebs' regrown head, glances down at all the weapons as Kay leaves. The flash dims on Edwards and Kay, sitting at a table in a Chinese restaurant where Edwards takes the remaining chair. Zed continues addressing the recruits, who all turn and regard Edwards a little smugly while Edwards's hand is indeed up. Then one of the young recruits eagerly raises his hand, and Zed calls on him. Edwards tries to stifle a laugh but can't while Zed looks into the gallery. Most obvious in the frozen tableau of creatures is a lunging, snarling beast with three bullet holes in its chest, next to a massively deformed humanoid creature with a large hook for a head with three holes in it. In the back corner of the gallery, there is a single bullet hole in a pretty eight-year-old girl, and Zed sighs, with sideways glances from the other recruits. Zed and Kay stand behind smoked glass, staring at the recruits still in the shooting gallery, waiting for a decision. Zed turns and walks away, and Kay stares through the glass at Edwards, who stands alone on one side of the room, apart from the rest of the group. Zed reappears on the other side of the glass, coming through a door and into the shooting gallery. The recruits follow Zed out of the shooting gallery into a long hallway, where Zed motions them off to the left. Edwards is the last one out of the room, but he stops as he steps into the hallway where Kay is outside the door, waiting for him. Edwards recognizes him from last night. As they pass an alcove, Edwards notices the six other recruits herded into a corner while Zed pulls a neuralyzer from his pocket, holding it up in front of them as the recruits stare obediently at it and Zed slips on a pair of black sunglasses. Alien shapes are visible within a photograph where Dee and Zed are much younger, and in another photograph, a young Kay, in a shirt and tie, holds a bouquet of flowers, staring at the open door of a landed flying saucer. Kay steers Edwards to the right down another corridor, just as long as the first, and another picture shows the 1964 World's Fair grounds still under construction, with giant models of rockets marking the Fair's theme of space travel, most prominently the two tall towers with the flying saucers now mounted at the top of each.",
    "499": "He stares statue-like at an abstract point in the room. The man slowly turns and looks down at the boy standing next to him. Cole is very shaky, and Malcolm watches everything anxiously. Cole stares at Mr. Collins, and the man's face begins to crumble as Cole holds out the jewelry box that trembles in his hands. The father just stares at it and becomes very still, his eyes filling with a storm of confusion and pain. After the longest time, the father reaches and gently takes the box out of Cole's small hands, causing Cole to begin to back away. The father gazes at Cole as he melts into the crowd until Cole reaches Malcolm and the two slip out of the house. The father looks down in a daze and goes to open the jewelry box with slow and strained movements. He lifts the latch and opens the box, and Mr. Collins stares at an unlabeled video cassette. Seated now, his face forms the most heartbreaking of smiles as he watches the performance. The puppets go limp as the entire stage gets lifted up, and we see it carried away by Kyra. The whole bedroom is now visible, and the camera is seated on her desk in the corner. Kyra climbs in bed and pretends to be sleeping when the door opens; she carries in a tray of soup and a sandwich as the crowd watches in riveted silence. The father never takes his eyes off the screen as the image of the mother walks to a closet and pulls out a bottle of floor cleaner. She reads the label for the ingredients, walks back to the food tray, unscrews the cap on the floor cleaner, and pours some into the cap. Kyra picks up the spoon, takes a sip, and slowly brings the spoon to her mouth, swallows another spoonful, leaving the room utterly silent. Mrs. Collins is seated at the dining room surround by friends and family, fixing one of the many bouquets of flowers on the table. It takes her a beat before she feels the stare and looks up to see Mr. Collins standing in the doorway to the dining room. A group of ashen-faced guests stand in the distance behind him. Husband and wife's eyes meet as Mr. Collins' eyes tremble with tears. The four-year-old stares at the finger puppet, then quietly takes it in her small hands. The two children don't say anything for a while as Malcolm glances to the house, where all movements in and out of the home have ceased, then looks across to the two children on the swings. Stanley Cunningham moves between two curtains and comes to a prop room door in the back.",
    "80": "Another TROOPER knocks the pistol from BEN'S lifted hand, causing BEN to sink to his knees as both men and two others close in on him. He takes in the GROUP with his mouth open, and they drive away fast in road dust. Their mother, WILLA, carrying a shopping bag, runs up from the background between the CHILDREN, looking towards cars off-screen; she has a rich body. PEARL comes to her, and she picks up PEARL and the doll, while JOHN, laden with his oath, walks quickly into the house. WILLA does a bewildered take and looks again towards the cars off-screen, while BEN lies in profile. From the bunk above, the face of PREACHER stretches down into the SHOT, upside down and snake-like. BEN wakes, sees PREACHER, and hits him so hard in the face that he falls from the bunk to the floor. PREACHER collects himself into a squat, nursing his face, as BEN sits up in bed. BEN picks up and wads a sock. PREACHER gets up and pockets the knife, while they rest on the sill of the cell window, with the lettered fingers legible, and the right hand is lettered L-O-V-E. The hands open, disclosing his open knife, and they close over it. His eyes lift from his hands, heavenward, in the moonlight on his face. He prays, quietly. In the same SHOT as before, prison lights are now on, and a man, a prison GUARD, waits close inside the door. BART the HANGMAN joins him with a silent salute, wearing a hard derby. They walk in silence into a MEDIUM, MOVING SHOT, with the GUARD talkative and BART reluctant to talk, as the Penitentiary recedes in the background. On the porch by the door is a doll's perambulator. BART and the GUARD walk into the SHOT. The GUARD stops, and BART starts up his front steps, while the GUARD leaves the SHOT; BART goes in and hangs up his coat and hat. Across this, his wife speaks off-screen, and a lighted door is ajar at the rear of the hall. He looks past her, and we see two small CHILDREN asleep in a big brass bed. BART registers, turns again to the basin, and we PAN them back into the original TWO-SHOT. His WIFE'S eyes go sharp and quiet. BART rinses his hands, lets out a sigh, and takes up the towel. He looks at her for a moment and then towards his CHILDREN. He goes into their room on tiptoe, and he approaches his children, across whose bed WE SHOOT without yet seeing them. He comes into MEDIUM CLOSE-UP, and as he leans, and we TILT DOWN, he extends his large hands. Two rose-and-gold little GIRLS lie in sleep; BART'S hands enter the SHOT and gently rearrange the covers so that their mouths and throats are free.",
    "574": "Parrish blinks uncertainly, unsure if he has heard something, and releases his arm as his pain subsides. He soon realizes that he has indeed heard a voice—not the wind—and looks around, finding no one. Unable to finish peeing, he returns to his bedroom, bewildered, trying to trace the source of the sound. Climbing back into bed, he pulls the covers up and attempts to close his eyes, but then sits up again, frightened and indecisive. He finally closes his eyes again, glances at the ceiling, and falls asleep, exhausted. Outside, workmen on the great lawn plant stakes, unroll a canvas tent, and set up platforms, speakers, and lights, while gardeners fashion topiary and add landscaping. Allison, Parrish's older daughter, manages the foremen and relishes the attention. A painter approaches as Parrish, groomed for the day, trots downstairs, observing the intensified activity through the windows. He grins and pours coffee, fidgeting as Susan observes. The sound of a helicopter chopping overhead is heard, and Parrish, leading his family, hurries toward it as the butler and May carry their bags. Drew kisses a woman, glancing at Parrish over her shoulder, while Quince approaches. Drew ushers everyone onto the helicopter, starting with Parrish, then Susan and Quince, before climbing in himself and shutting the door as Allison hurries away. Meanwhile, the Young Man sits at a counter with a plate of food, eating with relish while Susan watches him, captivated. He notices her gaze, swallows awkwardly, and Susan laughs as the Young Man smiles, prompting Susan to look into her coffee. Drew follows Parrish until the open door, where Parrish reminds him that he cannot proceed further without an invitation. Parrish disappears into his office, and Drew glides past Jennifer's desk on his way out.

    "841": "The detective leaves, while the boss lingers with his arms folded. Sandy gazes at the floor, then rises and watches the men leave. Holding his cell phone, he looks at the salon number displayed in red. He glances up, then down to the number's origin. The detective glances at Daniel, who rubs his face with one hand. Sandy runs off. Sandy's wife helps him pack. Sandy shrugs at his wife. He sets her on the bed. He takes the folded mug shot from his back pocket. She gives him a little nudge. Sandy heads out. He kisses Trish. She hands him his suitcase. Now, a plane sails across the sky. Our view moves over a sunny beach toward a city skyline. Outside Ladies Choice salon, Sandy rolls up his window in a gold Sedan. The plump thief strolls into view in a loud pink print shirt and poofy hair. She walks in slow motion. Sandy observes her go to a tiny blue Fiat with a red stripe on its side. She bounces to the driver's door and gets in. The garishly made-up woman takes a handicapped parking tag off the rear view mirror and tosses it in back. Sandy puts his seat belt on as the woman zips out of her parking space. Now, on a freeway, Sandy tails the thief while she plays with her smartphone. She looks in her rear view and catches sight of him. Setting her phone down, the redhead takes her sunglasses off, looks into the driver's side mirror, and gives her car some gas. The odometer needle rises. Sandy presses his accelerator. The speedometer ticks up to 50. The woman tightens her mouth and slams on the brakes with both feet. The sedan bangs the Fiat's rear bumper. In her rear view, she sees Sandy white-knuckling his wheel. She puts her sunglasses on and primps her hair, then gets out. The short woman looks up at Sandy, then punches his throat. She pushes him and goes for her car. He pulls her hair. She delivers a swift kick to his crotch. Sandy sags as she runs to his car. She gets into his sedan. Sandy limps toward her. She reverses while flipping him off. He shambles back to her Fiat and gets in. He discovers the key missing. In the rear view, he sees an empty road. She comes in from the sides. The sedan T-bones the compact. She pins it to the guardrail. Sandy tries in vain to open the crushed door as she speeds down the highway. He reaches through the sunroof. He finds a pink registration form in the glove box. He takes it out. He reads the address. Now, in a tiny pink house with a jet ski on the lawn, a variety of small expensive products in sets of three or more clutters the kitchen.",
    "1055": "Mr. Darcy raises a hand to his mouth, then leaps from his seat, with his mouth tight and brows furrowed. Lizzie lowers her eyes, sadness fills her face, and she curtsies. Mr. Darcy gives his usual stilted bow in return, turns, and leaves the room. At the door, he stops and looks back at Lizzie for a moment before finally walking out. Outside, horses are being harnessed to the carriage, and Mrs. Gardiner and Lizzie emerge, dressed in their outdoor clothes. Lizzie turns to him, then climbs into the carriage. At Pemberley, Mr. Darcy is sitting in the drawing room, watching Georgiana practice her piano playing. The Hursts, Mr. Bingley, and Miss Bingley are also present. Miss Bingley stands up, and with a look of utter contempt, Mr. Darcy leaves the room. The two sisters exchange glances. At Longbourn, the Gardiners' four children are playing on the lawn when the carriage pulls into the driveway, and they quickly hurry over to greet it. As the four white horses come to a halt, the footman comes over to open the carriage door and help Lizzie out. Briefly greeting the children, Lizzie hurries inside, where Jane has come to meet her. In her bedroom, Mrs. Bennet is lying back in her chair, fanning herself. Meanwhile, Mr. Darcy is traveling in a carriage, his expression thoughtful and determined, with four chestnut horses speed through the countryside, a seated driver and two footmen on the back of Darcy's carriage. Now, the Bennet sisters are taking lunch with the Gardiners. Later, Lizzie enters a room and finds Jane standing at the window, gazing out at the gardens. She shuts the door behind her, then walks over to her sister. Lizzie opens it and begins to read. Lydia and Wickham climb into a carriage in the dead of night. Jane looks away with a serious expression, and Lizzie leaves the room. Now, Lizzie is in her nightgown, standing in front of the mirror in her room. Slowly, she looks herself in the eye, then sits down. Her face is full of sorrow, and her eyes are glistening with as yet unshed tears. She remembers Mr. Darcy striding away from her. A knock disturbs her thoughts. Jane comes in and shuts the door behind her, walks over to Lizzie, and takes her hand. Lizzie looks down, then takes Jane's hand again. Meanwhile, Mr. Darcy has arrived at a coaching inn. As the innkeeper leads him, a serving boy comes out with tankards full of ale, and Mr. Darcy takes one and drinks from it. The next day, Kitty is playing with a cup and bowl in the garden when she spies a two-wheeled curricle approaching through the trees, and she quickly scampers off across the lawn.",
    "1214": "A truck of army reinforcements arrives, and Rambo gets back on the machine-gun platform as the reinforcements are cut to ribbons in the truck. Rambo fires on the boat, and bullets smash through its windscreen, killing the captain and helmsman. A bullet from School Boy decapitates the machine-gunner. On the shore, BN fires a loaded bazooka, and the boat is obliterated. Rambo spots the commander escaping up the hill, leaps down from the machine-gun platform, and gives chase. The commander stops, impaled on Rambo's machete, and faces Rambo, blowing out his cheeks and looking up at him. Rambo rips the commander's stomach open, and the commander drops to the ground. Rambo kicks the man's corpse away with a hefty boot, and it rolls away and lies face down. Rambo looks wearily down at the field of battle, and from her vantage point with School Boy, Sarah does the same. A couple of straggling troopers scuttle away, and Sarah makes her way down the hill, with School Boy picking up his hefty weapon and following her. Rambo also trudges back to the jeep. At the bottom of the hill, rebels buzz about as smoke billows and some of the foliage is burnt. Sarah looks about her, and Rambo lingers at the truck, watching her. He then frowns and feels his left shoulder with his right hand, checking his wound, and the back of his hand is bloody. Sarah finds Michael crouching over a wounded man, and he looks up as she runs to him and flings her arms around him. He has a wound to his forehead, and his face is black with soot and grime, while Rambo watches them. Sarah and Michael embrace for a few moments, then he gently pushes her arms away and strokes her hair before returning to the wounded man. School Boy kneels over Lewis, and Reese over En-Joo's corpse. Sarah looks up the hill at Rambo, her face grimy with a light cut across her forehead. She looks at School Boy, who stares down at Lewis as he stirs a little. She looks at the corpse of one of the volunteers, who has bullet wounds in his chest. Michael looks up the hill and sees Rambo, raising a hand to him wide-eyed and frowning. Sarah's face crumples and she starts to weep as Rambo turns away, clutching his shoulder. John Rambo walks along a lonely road halfway up a hill in Arizona, U.S.A., which is decorated with scrubby green grass and utility poles stretching along the length of the road. His hair is neatly brushed and face clean, wearing a pair of dark boots, blue denims, and a khaki parka over a black T-shirt, with a khaki kit bag slung over one shoulder.",
    "608": "The movie begins with notes on Alison's novel, followed by Ingrid slinking out in her bra and knickers. Alison waves as lean and shapely Ingrid pads off. Alison looks Sydney in the eye as they are seated in a restaurant, and Sydney's mouth hangs open. A snow-dusted black limousine draws up, and a man opens the car door for Sophie, who climbs out onto the street in a pink dress and a light pashmina. She poses for press photographers, and then Sophie and Elena leave Sydney alone. Sydney boogies on the dance floor, bouncing joyfully as he smiles and jives. Smiling suggestively, she wraps her arms around Sydney. Images from a moving car show tall palm trees and signs reading Hollywood and Beverly Hills as the limo sweeps down a main road, passing a billboard with an image of a pouting Sophie wearing a nun's habit. Stripped to his socks and boxer shorts, a terrified Sydney tries to gather the courage to leap between two high hotel balconies but hops back down from the railing. The hotel room is filled with the young, affluent, and beautiful, and Sophie unzips her blue dress, letting it fall to the floor. She hands Sydney her bottle of beer as she strides out onto the balcony in her bra and knickers, while the guests rush over to the adjacent balcony to watch. Smiling victoriously, Sophie stalks into the room from the adjacent balcony. Reluctantly, Sydney wrinkles his nose and snorts like a pig, hopping from one foot to another with his limp wrists held up to his chest. Drinking whiskey at the foot of his bed while half watching a monster movie on TV, he flicks through the channels and sees his mum. He drops the remote control and looks down at his bare hand as a handsome, Brill-creamed gent in a '50s movie slides an engagement ring onto Sydney's mum's finger, and she gazes love-struck into his eyes. Sydney is transfixed. A sleek black sedan arrives by a fountain outside the 53rd Annual Apollo Awards, and Sophie, Elena, and Sydney get out and head down the red carpet towards the entrance. Sophie is wearing gold with an ostentatious white fur stole and a long flowing red dress. Inside, she does an interview for the cameras while Sydney stands waiting nearby. Lawrence approaches, and Sydney's eyes rove in thought as the penny drops. He sits beside Sophie at the award ceremony as the woman onstage announces the winner, Sophie Maes. Sydney looks up from his seat to see that Sophie is wearing his mother's ring and lowers his eyes. The crowd applauds as Sophie makes for the stage, and he runs up behind her. Sophie charges and pins him on the table, and they fall to the floor. She slaps him while Richard watches on the hotel room TV, and the magazine models see Sophie kick Sydney. Alison chuckles to herself as she watches the debacle.",
    "549": "Elsa and Donovan take cover beside the parked car. Indy and Henry, followed by Sallah, take cover behind a rock to watch Kazim's Men and the Nazi Troops exchanging fire below them. The Brethren are firing at the Donovan party and are being fired on by the Donovan party. Two Nazi Soldiers throw hand grenades into the cliffs. They explode, killing one of Kazim's Brethren. The battle continues with a fierce exchange of gunshots, grenades, and machine gun fire, resulting in losses on both sides. Crouched behind a rock, they watch as men on both sides of the battle run amongst camels and horses. They look down at Kazim, who lies mortally wounded on the ground at their feet. Elsa looks saddened. Kazim dies. Indy leaps atop a Turkish Soldier on horseback, pulling the man and the horse to the ground. A second Turk comes to assist his comrade; Indy mounts the horse, knocking both Turks to the ground. Brody has been left alone in the tank. Henry climbs down into the tank and taps Brody on the shoulder, startling him. Brody then tugs his ears, flaps his arms, and touches his head. They exchange a handshake. The Nazi Soldiers point their guns at Henry and Brody. Vogel removes a glove and slaps Henry with it. He slaps Henry again. Another slap. Vogel reaches out to slap Henry yet again, but Henry grabs his arm, stopping him. Donovan appears at the turret cover. Indy and Sallah charge forward, leading their horses and camels. Then Vogel commands the Tank Driver to give chase. Vogel shouts to the Tank Driver. Henry and Brody are still held at gunpoint by the Nazi Soldier. The Nazi Soldier swings his fist, knocking Henry off his seat. Smoke pours from the top of the tank as the turret pops open. Vogel emerges and aims his gun at Indy. Indy and Vogel exchange shots as Indy chases the tank on his horse. Indy pulls the trigger again—his gun is empty! Indy immediately takes the high trail. Now Indy is above the tank, twelve feet on a paralleling trail. He moves out of the saddle and leaps from the speeding horse onto the trundling tank. Hate-staring at Indy. Hate-staring back at Vogel. Suddenly, from nowhere, a German soldier flies into frame, tackling Indy. One of the two troop carriers is paralleling the tank, and like pirates boarding a galleon, Nazi Soldiers leap over the treads and swarm all over Indy. Indy presses the Luger against his assailant and forces the Nazi to squeeze off a shot into himself. The bullet not only passes through the Nazi, but passes through two other Nazis standing directly behind him on the crowded tank top, and three bodies fall away, leaving Indy to stare at the gun in disbelief.",
    "1360": "Nelec moves to the door, with his back facing Woodward, as Overmyer approaches the bed. We see Nelec's face, revealing his true nature. Joe sleeps as the power remains out. Then, there is a knock at his window, which wakes him up. He moves to the window, opens it, half asleep but stunned. Alice quietly climbs in, and Joe sits on the floor, with Alice joining him. There is a moment of odd silence, and Joe, amazed, stares at Alice. Suddenly, the power returns, and Joe's clock light comes on, while the projector starts playing a silent home movie of his mother. Joe crawls to the projector to stop it, but Alice moves closer to the screen, and Joe sits behind her. Alice is captivated by the film, and a tear falls down her face, unseen by Joe. He is quietly stunned, watching his mother. The Super 8 movie ends, and Joe turns off the projector, but a shudder-hum sound remains, coming from the cube Joe took from the crash site on his desk. Joe and Alice move towards it as the cube begins to vibrate slightly. Joe uses a paintbrush to touch the cube, which shudders on its own, and they are amazed. They get close to the desk, but the shuddering increases in pitch and volume until the cube suddenly bullets away, leaving a five-inch hole in the wall. Alice screams, and they both fall to the floor, stunned, as Joe's heart pounds. Joe moves to the wall, looks through the hole, and sees trees and the town water tower in the distance. Alice enters a dark house quietly, stepping carefully towards her room, tense and her mind racing, and she breathes deeply before leaving the house. She cries and rides off on her bike, passing a distant fiery glow over the hills. The front door opens, and Louis comes out, miserable, and yells after her. But she is already far away as Louis's mind races; he runs to his Buick, starts it up, and pulls out quickly to go after her. Alice pedals hard, wanting to escape, a block ahead of her father, who is clearly drunk as he drives. Alice makes a daring stop, turns back up the hill, and pedals hard, crying and hyperventilating.",
    "1224": "Ben takes a key from behind an upper hinge of the workshop door and glances over his shoulder at Duke, who sits nearby watching him. Ben unlocks the padlock, and Duke follows him into the workshop. He flicks a switch, and Ben gets tools out of his bag, setting to work on the machine. Stripped down to his vest, lithe, muscular Ben hammers a pin out of the machine, undoes a huge knot with an equally huge monkey wrench, and fits a new belt on the flywheel. Duke lies snoozing nearby, as Ben reassembles the machine. Ben leaves the workshop with Duke, who escorts him down the side of the house to the gate. Ben gets in his car and drives off, then takes a shower at the motel. Looking troubled once more, he stands beneath the fine jets of water and stares down deep in thought, experiencing flashbacks of running through the night, his face bloody. He stops running and sinks to his haunches. In his motel, Ben sits on the edge of the bath, staring down, bare-chested with a white towel wrapped around his waist. A flashback of a bloodied garment and an inert, blood-smeared hand lying on earth passes through his mind. A dream-like image of Sarah emerges: she's wearing a pink dress, smiling gently as she looks down at something and then walks away slowly from Ben's motel room bed and out of sight. Ben, dressed, lies on his back on the bed and watches the bald boy, Nick, through a window. Nick looks weak and is attached to monitors, with his mother reading to him while a nurse fills in a chart beside them. Ben is lying face down on an examination table as the doctor uses a large syringe. Ben buries his face in a pillow as the doctor extracts the bone marrow from his hip. Later, Ben limps slowly into the motel, where Larry is watering plants, but Ben ignores him and enters his room. Ben lies on his side in the motel room bed, with an unfinished plate of food on the covers, along with documents and handwritten letters, ignoring his phone. Ben's face is now stubbly; he's sitting up in bed, staring ahead somberly, then lies asleep on his side. His mobile flashes as it rings, and Ben's eyes open slowly. He stares at the mobile, which lies beside him on the bed, hesitates before picking it up, checks the display, opens the clamshell phone, and puts the phone to his ear. She cringes and looks hopeful as Emily breaks into an uncertain smile. She smiles and puts down the phone, and the home nurse gives Emily a questioning look.",
    "797": "Outside a door, a tall, blonde security guard is on duty and checks his watch. In a back room, Willie puts a sack down while Marcus points to an air conditioning vent. Marcus removes the cover from the vent, clambers into the duct, and crawls along it clutching a torch. In an office, a man looks up at the duct as noises emanate from it, and a woman working at her desk also looks up, along with a woman at the next desk who then turns around, looks at the duct, shrugs, and resumes her work. Marcus arrives at a vent and observes a security office filled with monitors, looks at the equipment, and makes notes on a pad. Meanwhile, Gin is having a pedicure and answers his phone. Roger Merriman, the kid's dad, is in prison, and Gin walks into the prison visitors' room where Roger, who is balding and bespectacled, is sitting. Gin nods his head and gets up as Roger looks confused. Willie cooks for the kid and Grandma, serves it up, spoons a dollop onto it, turns back to the stove to flip the bologna, and serves a plate of North Pole-style fried bologna for himself, placing it on the breakfast bar. The kid heads off to get it, hands it to Willie, who gives it back to the kid struggling to open the door, which appears to have been stuck with excessive adhesive. Willie watches as the kid finds a cheap sweet inside. Bob is with Gin, who mixes and slurps a dose of Fibracell stool softener, grimacing as Bob winces. A bus pulls up outside the mall, and skaterats see the kid getting off at the stop. The kid sees them, hesitates, then walks down the street, with the skaterats following maliciously. They get him and grot him. The boy wanders off as Santa scratches his own ass, and the kid appears with his pants around his armpits. Marcus heads off while Willie looks at the kid, stares incredulously, shakes his head, and the kid just stares back before walking away with his underpants still around his armpits. Willie watches him go with a doleful expression and turns back to Marcus, who stares at him with a very deadpan expression for an elf. Gin is next in line, and Gin, Willie, and Marcus are in a bar, where Marcus shifts uneasily.",
    "635": "He walks tensely back to Graham, and Merrill and Graham turn and look behind them as something brushes past the swing, followed by an urgent rustling in the maize stalks beyond the swing that gradually dies away. The next morning, Caroline sits in the dining room with Morgan, who's holding her walkie talkie; Morgan nods, Caroline smiles warmly and nods back, and she grins. Bo sits in the adjoining lounge, watching cartoons as Graham walks over, and Bo does so. There are three glasses of water on the TV set. Caroline looks across at Merrill, who sits at the other end of the long dining room table, resting his head on his hand and looking up at her; Merrill grins at Caroline and absently rubs his finger on the table top while she shrugs. Caroline glances at Morgan, who's studying her walkie talkie, and looks back at Merrill. Graham walks across the lounge and spots three glasses of water on a small table, leans over, and picks them up. He stands upright and sees some more glasses of water on a nearby cabinet, then puts the three glasses back down and walks into the dining room, where he sits at the table by Merrill. She checks her notebook and gives them a patronizing look, and Graham looks tense and awkward; she nods. Graham shrugs, looks uncertainly at Merrill, blows out his cheeks, and Merrill looks at the ceiling, then holds up his hands and turns away in frustration. Bo comes into the dining room, taps Graham on the arm, and leaves, causing Merrill to shift awkwardly. Graham considers for a moment before Bo comes back, and Caroline looks up. In the lounge, the TV shows news footage of a corn field with a line of crop circles similar to Graham's, a man talks to the camera, 17 circles are scattered across a map of India, and footage shows people standing in some of the circles. Graham's steely blue eyes gleam as he stares at the TV while Morgan takes a puff of his inhaler and Caroline stands behind him. Graham and Caroline come out of the house, and as they stroll away from the farmhouse, she shakes her head. Caroline nods, opens the driver's door of her police car, smiles, gets in, and Graham stands and watches as Caroline pulls around an island of grass in the middle of a stretch of gravel and heads off down the driveway. Morgan and Bo sit in the back of a car, Bo points a finger at Morgan, and he brushes it away. Graham turns the radio off again, and in the driving seat, glances over his shoulder at Morgan, then turns back to the road as Morgan sighs wearily. An aerial view looks directly down onto a quiet freeway, which runs through a suburban part of town.",

He dials a number on the phone. He has another drag on the cigarette. He slowly raises the phone to his ear. A surveillance view of the city. In a park, Hoffman calls Ferris, who's walking through an airport terminal. On a residential street, Ferris and Skip get out of an SUV. They communicate through earpieces. Sadiki emerges from an apartment building. Ferris walks up and follows him to his car. They are watched by men in a white four-by-four. The four-by-four drives at them. Sadiki gets in his car. Ferris smashes a window. Sadiki drives away. Ferris and the attackers exchange fire. An agent drives the SUV after the four-by-four but crashes. Skip is thrown through the windscreen. Ferris keeps shooting. The attackers drive off after Sadiki. Skip lies on the ground covered in blood. Ferris feels for a pulse in his neck. He makes a call on his mobile. Sadiki sits on a chair in a shabby room. A man sits filming him. Al-Saleem's lieutenant pours a drink. He hands the drink to Sadiki. The lieutenant looks at Sadiki curiously. In another room, Al-Saleem watches the video footage of Sadiki on a small screen. Outside the city, a group of boys stand on a hillside. Further down the hill, some dogs mooch about. Sadiki lies dead amongst piles of rubbish. Skip lies unconscious in a hospital bed with a breathing tube in his throat. Ferris stands by the bed, staring at Skip. Ferris swigs from a bottle of soda. Ferris picks up a phone and sits by a window. Sitting on a terrace by a lake, Hoffman pulls out his earpiece and sighs. Ferris walks into his apartment and steps on an envelope. He picks it up and shuts the door. He walks into the living room. He puts his keys on the table and opens the envelope. He takes out a photograph of him and Aisha walking down a street. He stares at the photo. He looks around anxiously. Then, he picks up a bowl and hurls it at the wall. He storms out of the apartment. Aggressively driving through town, he calls Aisha on his mobile. A mobile on a table in Aisha's apartment rings. Ferris speeds along a street and stops. Ferris gets out and runs across the street. He holds out his hand and the car stops. Ferris slaps the bonnet and runs to Aisha's apartment building. He heads up the stairs with his phone pressed to his ear. Ferris slows up as he approaches a gate.",

Nema's grandma steadies a chicken and chops its head off. It is a winter hat. Yuri sits apart staring at a photograph of his ex-wife and the twins. Jackson joins him and hands him a flight jacket. Yuri glances at the women, and Jackson nods and raises his eyebrows. Gordon peers down the cockpit, descends steps in the Antonov, points his thumb upstairs, and climbs back up. Jackson and Yuri join him and Sasha in the cockpit. Through smoke and clouds, they see fire and mountain lava; Hawaii is devastated. The Antonov flies over the city as skyscrapers collapse and burn.

Her father and mother sit up in bed as the daughter runs into their room. Husband and wife exchange glances. Tony studies her photograph and fights back tears. His son picks up the receiver and studies it, then looks back across the room where his Japanese wife stands with her arms on the child's shoulders. The room begins to shake. Tony hears the screams before the line goes dead. He hangs up and glances away. In Washington, President Wilson walks through crowds outside the White House as ash falls like snow. The injured are being treated beside ambulances. Wilson enters the West Wing; his clothes are covered in ash, and people stare at him. A fireman touches the brim of his hat, and a female paramedic jumps to her feet to salute him. He acknowledges her salute, then crosses to a woman with a small girl. Behind the woman is a couch; his secretary runs over. Outside, the ash continues to fall as crowds mill around. The medic looks up, and everyone looks around. The ground now violently shakes. Patients are being treated on gurneys that are alarmed. It splits open. The president, clinging to a drip stand, fixes his eyes on the tall pointed Washington monument. It sways and starts to fall like a felled tree. On Air Force One, all eyes turn to Laura. Adrian watches Anheuser.

She, Miranda, and the children giggle as Andy creeps upstairs, reaching an upper floor where she encounters Miranda and her husband. They catch sight of Andy trying to creep back downstairs, and Miranda glowers at Andy like a rabbit trapped in the headlights. Andy leaves the book on the top step and hurries away. Arriving for work, Emily grabs Andy's arm and pulls her into a side room, pointing to Miranda's office, and Andy reluctantly goes in there. Andy smiles nervously and heads back to her desk, while Miranda answers her mobile.

She finds Christian sitting at the bar and takes the manuscript. At the appointed hour, she puts a hot coffee and the manuscript on Miranda's desk as the twins are reading them.

Ben reaches for the key and is handed the key. A waiter stands next to the table with a telephone as Mrs. Robinson turns in her chair to look through the glass into the lobby where Ben is in a phone booth no more than twenty feet away. Over Ben's shoulder, his face is reflected in the glass door, through which Mrs. Robinson is visible sitting in the Veranda Room. Ben hangs up, leaves the phone booth, walks back into the main lobby, and, as he passes the desk on his way to the elevator, starts to pat his breast pocket, making the desk clerk look up. He clears his throat and then kisses her. Ben opens the closet door as she turns her back, and he undoes the zipper at her neck. She turns and looks at him, leading him to back away and slam the bathroom door shut, causing the light in the room to disappear. The midsummer sun beats down on the Braddock swimming pool and on Ben, who lies on a rubber raft in the middle of the pool, wearing dark glasses, deeply tanned, and holding a beer can in one hand.

Outside, Homer shoots up the police car as another police car arrives down the block. Red waits in his car as the robbers exit with four hostages. Down the road, lawmen aim rifles over the car's hood. Dillinger and his men, using their hostages as shields, cross to the getaway car.

Hoover faces a microphone and motions for Purvis to take his place at the mic. Purvis squints decisively at the reporters. Now at his supper club, Dillinger grins as he dines with his friends. He checks his watch and looks toward the door. Rubbing the tip of his nose, he shifts his gaze to the dance floor where a brunette in a red dress dances with a man. Dillinger keeps his eyes fixed on her. His attention shifts as a scrawny guy with glasses approaches. Dillinger stands and shakes his hand. The scrawny Alvin takes a seat beside Dillinger and leans close.",
    "711": "In an animated scene, city lights glow behind giant letters on a cliff surrounded by shining spotlights. In sepia-tone film footage, people wearing early 20th-century clothing stand on a dock, waving toward the massive ocean liner, the RMS Titanic, while passengers on board the moored ships doff their hats or wave back. Surrounded by inky darkness, a pair of small bluish-white lights glow and grow brighter as revealed to be deep-sea submersibles approach and disappear as they sink into the dark ocean depths. Later, the subs creep just above the ocean floor, lighting up a small expanse of pale sand. A triangular shape appears on a sonar screen, revealing the prow of the sunken ocean liner ahead of the submersible. A brown-haired man cranes his neck, staring out of one of the submersible portals as one sub rises over the tapered bow and railing, which are covered in a growth resembling drippy, gray concrete. The sub's bright lights shine over a thick chain lying across a ship's deck as it moves forward, stirring up clouds of sediment with the second sub following close behind. The brown-haired man films himself with a camcorder as he stares out the window at the wreck and smiles at a bearded crew mate. Both subs glide off the wreck and illuminate twisted metal shapes encrusted with grayish growth, passing alongside upper balconies running down the side of the ship. The man sets down his camcorder as the subs descend toward the wreck, with lights illuminating rectangular windows with panes of broken glass. A crewman operates a remote control with a joystick, guiding a small robotic vehicle attached to a tether from the sub. Duncan enters a hole in the ship's side and films a door with an ornate leaded glass window, gliding past the door powered by a small propeller. Outside, the other sub releases a second remotely operated vehicle, Snoop Dog, which descends into an open pit in the ship's hull, moving through an opening. Its bright lights illuminate a crystal chandelier, still dangling from a ceiling, as it glides up a corridor past a partially decayed boot lying on the sediment beside a pair of eyeglasses missing one lens. Nearby, a porcelain doll's face juts out of the silt. Snoop Dog's lamps shine into a bunk room with a broken door on the floor beside a dilapidated bed frame. The bearded crewman stares into a visor as he pilots Snoop Dog through, while a pale eel slithers through the water as Snoop Dog approaches an elaborately carved fireplace surround and a mantel. One of the robotic explorers shines its lights on the rotted remains of a grand piano.",
    "1007": "Two men exit through the revolving doors, and the other door opens with Diana emerging. A black Mercedes pulls up, and the motorcycles swarm around the car as Diana gets inside. The Mercedes pulls away, followed by the motorbikes. Video footage shows Diana in a swimming costume in the sea, while the Mercedes is pursued by four motorcyclists, each with photographers riding pillion. Archive footage shows a younger Diana driving away from reporters, and a younger Diana smiling as a photographer snaps her picture. Now, six motorbikes gain on the Mercedes, and on the ski slope, Diana reaches out to mask a photographer's lens. Her hand blocks out the sunlight as a tunnel looms ahead of the Mercedes. Robin lies in bed in a dark room and switches on a bedside lamp. Outside in the darkness, Robin hurriedly approaches Balmoral Castle, rushes down a corridor bustling with people, puts on a black jacket while walking, and rushes up some stairs with a dark-haired woman close behind. Robin stops outside a door while the woman walks up to it. The Queen looks up from her bed and switches on a bedside lamp, with Prince Phillip sitting up beside her. The Queen exits the bedroom, and Robin bows, then turns to Cherie in bed. Charles enters the room where the Queen Mother, Phillip, and The Queen are present, then turns and leaves. Robin approaches a blonde woman, picks up a phone from a nearby desk, and later slowly ascends some stairs while the royal family watches television. Robin enters the room but stays by the door, and Charles stands in a dark room with Steven, rubs his brow, and Steven backs away. BBC video news footage plays as Tony stares at a nearby TV, and on the other end of the phone, Alistair Campbell scribbles on a notepad. The Queen walks down a dimly lit corridor, peeks through a doorway to see Charles talking to Prince William and Prince Harry, and as Charles sees her, he leaves the room, moves to reenter, and she extends her hand briefly before retracting it. Charles stops, his eyes well with tears, and the Queen casts her eyes downward. The Queen walks down a corridor and addresses a footman, then later sits at a desk and writes in a book. Phillip enters a room, stands by the door, holds out a small bottle of pills, and then leaves. People are gathering with shocked and anguished expressions on their faces, and some bury their faces into their hands.",
    "697": "They start to dance slowly, their faces close together. Peter suddenly throws in a fancy move. Gwen throws her head back. Peter puts his hand on her thigh and raises her leg. As the number ends, he bends her over in his arms. Peter's cold black eyes settle on Mary Jane who looks devastated. Gwen follows his gaze and turns to him in shock. She gives Peter a reproving look and crosses to Mary Jane who's standing motionless behind the microphone. Gwen pushes her way past Peter. Mary Jane hurries from the stage. Peter, looking uncertain, puts his hand to his chest. He comes up behind Mary Jane with a hostile scowl. She turns to face him with scorn in her eyes. Peter pins a bouncer against the wall and starts beating off two more. He lashes out, sending Mary Jane careening to the floor. His vicious expression turns to wide-eyed shock as he realizes what he's done. His eyes well up, then he glances down at the Black Spider-Man suit under his dark open-neck shirt. Covering the suit with his hand, he turns away from Mary Jane and hurries out into the night. Mary Jane, still sitting on the floor, looks around helplessly. Out in the rain's wet street, Peter, keeping his hand clasped at his collar, steps into a doorway to think. Drawn by the sound of the bells, he looks up as the torrential rain pours down. A flash of lightning illuminates a Gothic church with a tall studded spire topped by a stone crucifix. The storm clouds slowly drift away, leaving a lowering gray sky. Perched high up on the studded side of the steeple, black-suited Spider-Man looks at his hand, flexes his fist, then drops from his perch like a bird shot from a tree. He plummets down to a square archway, leading to the bell tower of the imposing cathedral, decorated with an intricate network of Gothic arches and flying buttresses. Inside the cathedral, Eddie Brock dips his fingers in a font of holy water and crosses himself before the altar. Up in the bell tower, Spider-Man claws at his mask, desperately trying to tear it off. It tears and stretches like rubber then snaps back like a second skin. He falls against the bell in a struggle. For a second, the mask seems to disintegrate then snaps back into place. Brock looks up at the sound. Peter pulls up the mask, ripping it across his contorted features. The black threads of the Symbiote sticking to his face like bulging veins. As if in a trance, Brock is drawn to the screams of his nemesis, pushing open a door that leads to a staircase winding around the walls of the bell tower.",
    "91": "The scene begins with a focus on their regular breathing and snoring, followed by the woman stirring and reaching for the phone, which she then hangs up. The man stirs, clears his throat with a long deep rumble, sits up, gazes around, and clears his throat again. There are remains of a large breakfast plate. A wider view shows Marge in a beige police uniform with a heavy belt carrying a revolver, walkie-talkie, and other police items, while Norm is in a dressing gown. Marge struggles into a parka and makes her way down the icy stoop to her prowler, hearing the front door open off-screen. She stamps the snow off her shoes and approaches the scene from her squad car, where two police cars and an ambulance idle by the road with men inside. A figure in a parka emerges from the first car with two styrofoam cups, handing her one. Marge looks around as they walk, peers into a car, looks up from it, around at the road, and at the prowler parked nearby. She gets up, sweeping snow from her knees, calls up to the road, and then is on her hands and knees by a body in the ditch, examining footprints. The foreground shows a state trooper's head as Marge, still on her hands and knees, peers at it. She claps snow off her hands, climbs out of the ditch, and looks at the idling prowler. Marge drives while Lou sits next to her, gazing out the window. Meanwhile, Jerry and Stan, wearing parkas and galoshes, stand near beached vehicles as Wade waits in an idling Lincoln and taps the horn for Stan, who then gets in. Jerry stares at his laptop. Elsewhere, a lakeside cabin is surrounded by white as a brown Ciera with dealer plates pulls into the drive. Grimsrud and Carl exit the car, with Grimsrud helping Jean out from the back; her hands are tied and a black hood covers her head. Jean cries out, escapes Grimsrud's grasp, and lurches across the lawn as Carl, grinning, stops Grimsrud from retrieving her.",
    "1081": "Girls peel potatoes, while some men pray. In his cabin, Tuvia is polishing a chess piece with a cloth, and Aron, sitting by the chessboard, smiles at Tuvia. Chaya beams at Asael. At night, as the community sleeps, one man stands guard. By a railway line in daylight, Gramov places a playing card on top of a detonator and slides it under the rail, explaining to Zus. He removes the card, inserts a knife blade into a hole in the detonator, and turns it, causing Zus to nearly jump out of his skin. Zus picks up the detonator and goes, and Gramov retrieves his playing card and follows him. At the camp, Shimon is giving a chess lesson, and Asael scowls at Arkady. Bella and Asael look across at Chaya, who appears carrying a basket. Asael takes a glug of the confiscated vodka and goes to meet her. Chaya smiles and lowers her eyes as Asael's lips part but no sound comes out; Asael nods and exhales, and shyly she takes his hand. Later, Shimon officiates their wedding as snow billows and a German truck crawls on a snowy track. The Russians line wait, and when Shimon nods, Tuvia steps forward with a ring. Asael tends to Chaya, who has a shawl over her long, loose hair, and takes her hand. He kisses his young bride as the onlookers smile, and Commander Panchenko gives the signal. Standing under the chuppah, Asael stamps on a glass, and the Russians let go. Germans fall on mountains, and at the wedding, people start to dance. Tuvia hugs Asael in the woods as Zus leads the onslaught. A young couple dances, and Zus fires on a truck. Tuvia joins the circular dance, smiles across at Lilka, and Zus sets a bomb under the truck. Tuvia finds Lilka as the dancers surge into the middle. Dead Germans are searched, and two officers, kneeling, await their fate. Zus comes up behind them and shoots them both in the head. Chaya, in a chair, is lifted up to shoulder height and twirled around. Panchenko addresses Zus as he walks by. Chaya and Asael are both held aloft by their well-wishers, who jig up and down in a huddle. Together, the young couple holds the napkin wrapped around the glass Asael crushed with his foot. Deep winter has set in at the Naliboki Forest Camp. A table and bench are blanketed in snow, and a wheelbarrow stands marooned. Frozen washing hangs heavily on the line, and a woman breaks the ice that has formed in a bucket of water. Next to her, Chaya ladles out some soup to a long line of people, as Asael, standing in a gutter nearby, holds up two potatoes. Tuvia looks around at the ashen faces of the people queuing up for food.",
    "1136": "The lights come on in the hall, and they close the front door. Gray smoke rises from the tiled floor in the long narrow corridor ahead of them and swells towards them. A ghostly Dumbledore appears, his hand reaches out, and then the face disappears as the smoke dissipates. They freeze, but Hermione steps forward and raises her wand. Harry dreams of Voldemort threatening the wand maker, Ollivander, and then wakes from his dream to find himself lying fully clothed on a sofa. On a sofa opposite, Hermione is still asleep, her left hand hanging over the edge almost touching Ron's hand, as Ron sleeps on the floor between them. Harry hauls himself upright, using the glowing tip of his wand to light the way, and mounts a staircase, his shadow cast on the wall. He turns the handle, pushes the door open, and stands in the doorway as light floods in through a dusty window. Inside the room, he pulls a cord, causing two skeletal bats to flap their bony wings as he looks around. On top of a chest of drawers, he finds a dusty old book and looks back at it. Hermione enters another room, which is a mess with a mattress falling off the bed, while Ron indicates the name of the door. Harry reads the message in the locket and, hearing a noise, they turn towards it. Harry gets up and cautiously crosses the room towards a door in the corner, yanking it open to reveal a house elf. Harry holds up the replica as Kreacher stares at the locket before he disapparates. Meanwhile, the Hogwarts Express puffs its way across a barren landscape, and in the train, Ginny sits with Neville Longbottom. Death Eaters fly over the engine, and a dark figure stands on the tread, halting the train. A student, Cormac, confronts the Death Eaters as they walk through the carriages, and Death Eaters approach Ginny and Neville. Dressed in pink, Dolores Umbridge stands beside Pius Thicknesse as a man is dragged towards the new Minister. Mundungus sells stolen property, and upon seeing a group of snatchers, he scurries away taking shelter in an alley where the reward posters of Harry, Undesirable Number One, are pasted on the walls. Hermione plays while Ron watches her with puppy dog eyes; she glances at him and he tries again. Harry stares at the Snitch fluttering in front of him, and Hermione joins him. He takes hold of the Snitch, causing its wings to fold, and stares at the Golden Ball as they all look round. Harry and Hermione run past Ron into the kitchen where Kreacher has Mundungus round the head and Dobby clings to his leg. They close in on Mundungus, who sees a photograph in a newspaper on the floor, picks it up, and puts it on the table, while outside, a city street with stone buildings is shown.",
    "538": "Elliot stops walking to browse through some books, then turns and walks back down the center aisle to a row of books he'd already passed. Lee walks over to Elliot in the center aisle, looks at the book, and he hands it to her. She thumbs through it, and later, Lee, holding the book in a brown bag, and Elliot are walking out. A taxi pulls over to the curb; they walk over to it, and Elliot opens the rear door for Lee. She laughs as she gets in. As Lee continues to read aloud, the movie cuts to Elliot's darkened den, lit by a light in the hallway. Elliot enters, wearing a robe, crossing the room in the dark, then turns on a light. The camera stays on his face as he looks off into the distance, mouthing indistinctly the line of poetry Lee next reads. The film leaves Elliot's face and cuts back to the loft, where Lee, having finished the poem, sits up in the bed, staring pensively, lost in her thoughts. Upbeat jazz begins to play, and the film cuts to the facade of Mount Sinai Hospital. A few cars whiz by as the film moves inside to various scenes depicting Mickey's comprehensive exam. First is a hearing test, and the movie cuts to a darkened hearing-test room. A light goes on, revealing a slouched-over Mickey sitting in a glass booth, wearing a set of headphones. The camera moves back, revealing a technician at the console on the other side of the booth. Mickey signals with his finger when he hears a sound on his headset. Next is an electronystagmography (ENG). Graph paper rolls out of a machine, and after a brief glimpse of the rolling paper, the camera moves over to show Mickey lying terrified, without his glasses, on a couch, with electrodes stuck all over his head. The film then cuts to a BSER test room, where Mickey, sitting in a corner chair, wears another set of headphones. An electrode is attached to his forehead; a nearby technician sits at a computer video screen, looking at a monitoring graph. Last but not least is the tomography. Over the shoulders of a technician in a booth, a large window displays a huge, white rotating machine. The camera moves down the giant cranelike device to reveal Mickey, once again lying down, this time on a table, his eyes closed, underneath it. A sitting Dr. Grey, his back to the camera, is examining a group of X-rays clipped to the light board behind his desk. The doctor turns his chair around to face a tense Mickey sitting on the other side of his desk.",
    "533": "Lamps hang down from the ceiling as classical music still plays in the background. Lee stops at a plastic-enclosed work area, where Frederick can be seen working at a drawing board on the other side of the clear plastic screen. As Lee walks over to the drawing board where Frederick is sitting, he is seen intently cleaning some paintbrushes with a rag. Lee stands by him, leaning over the board, and looks directly at him. The table is filled with cans of brushes and artist's equipment. Frederick and Lee embrace; Lee sighs. Lee kisses Frederick twice, then releases him and walks out of the work area. Lee walks over to the loft's stereo area, pulling up the sleeves of her sweater as Frederick talks. Lee picks up a book from the stereo shelf and leans back against the unit, glancing through its pages. Frederick, leaving his work area, walks past Lee with his hands in his pockets. The camera stays with Frederick as he walks into the loft's bedroom area. He sits down at the foot of the bed and starts taking off his shoes. Lee sits down next to Frederick; he takes her hand. Lee kisses Frederick back on the cheek, and they embrace. Frederick laughs; their embrace gets tighter. Without missing a beat, he takes Mary's wrist and continues walking. As the group walks through a large doorway, Larry catches up to Mickey. The group turns right into a new corridor, briefly off the screen. As the group briskly walks past an open door, Gail, another assistant, runs out, brandishing her glasses. The fast-tracking group turns the corner as Gail pats Mickey's back and gestures in exasperation. Mickey is interrupted by Ed Smythe, an official from the Standards and Practices Department, who's been standing in the corridor waiting for Mickey. Mickey stops and shakes Ed's hand as if he'd known the official would be there. Gail stops by his side while the others walk into a background studio doorway that is busy with scurrying personnel. A writer, holding a script, walks out of the background studio, looking around. Mickey and Gail walk over to the angry writer, Ed forgotten with this new crisis. Mickey, Gail, and the writer start walking down a corridor adjacent to the studio. The writer reacts angrily as Gail tries to get Mickey's attention while they walk. Mickey, still in surprised shock, turns away from the angry writer and stands by an open dressing room, where Ron, an actor, slouches, dazed, in a chair facing a makeup mirror. People mill in the background behind the actor as Mickey, remembering Ron, runs into the dressing room with Gail following him. Inside, a man and a woman talk, ignoring Ron as they share a drink in a paper cup.",
    "244": "The boy and girl laugh, their laughter putting a pause in there, back and forth. A waitress comes by with a pot of coffee and pours the young woman's coffee. The young man lights up another cigarette, calls to the waitress, then looks to his girl. The waitress comes by, pouring him some more. The young woman scans the restaurant with this new information and sees all the patrons eating, lost in conversations, and the busboys going through the motions, collecting dishes. A smile breaks out on the young woman's face, and with that, Pumpkin and Honey Bunny grab their weapons, stand up, and rob the restaurant. In the front seat are two young fellas, one white, one black, both wearing cheap black suits with thin black ties under long green dusters. Jules is behind the wheel. They close the trunk. Vincent and Jules, their long matching overcoats practically dragging on the ground, walk through the courtyard of what looks like a hacienda-style Hollywood apartment building. We track alongside. They enter the apartment building, walk through the reception area, and wait for the elevator. The elevator arrives, the men step inside, and the elevator doors open; Jules and Vincent exit. Steadicam in front of Jules and Vincent as they make a beeline down the hall. Jules stops Vincent, looks at him a long moment—he's been set up. He starts walking down the hall, Vincent, smiling, walks a little bit behind. They move a little away from the door, facing each other, still whispering, making a gun out of his finger and placing it to his head. Jules just looks at him. Three young guys, obviously in over their heads, sit at a table with hamburgers, french fries, and soda pops laid out. One of them flips the loud bolt on the door, opening it to reveal Jules and Vincent in the hallway. The two men stroll inside. The three young caught-off-guard guys are Marvin, the black young man, who opens the door and will, as the scene progresses, back into the corner, and Brett, a white, preppy-looking sort with a blow-dry haircut. Vincent and Jules take in the place with their hands in their pockets. Jules is the one who does the talking. Jules grabs the burger and takes a bite of it. Vincent moves to the bed, reaches underneath it, and pulls out a black snap briefcase. Vincent looks up at Jules, closing the case. As Brett talks, Jules takes out his gun and shoots Roger, blowing him out of his chair. Vince smiles to himself. He's not crying or whimpering, but he's so full of fear, it's as if his body is imploding. Brett can't say a word.",
    "421": "In the movie, a man stops to look at his hands and realizes the casts are off. He knocks on a door with his wrist as if the casts were still on. When the door opens, he holds up his hands boyishly, and a woman kisses them. Eddie flexes his fingers and tries a shot on Johnny's pool table, using an open hand bridge for support, as Bert Gordon enters and watches him play, smiling at Eddie. Later, Eddie and Sarah enter a quiet, elegant restaurant with soft piano music and subdued lighting, a place they passed on the day they first met. Sarah wears a new dress, while Eddie, looking a little uneasy, wears a suit and tie. The headwaiter seats them, and they exchange smiles. A waiter approaches, and Sarah suddenly laughs. The waiter returns with a bottle of sherry for Eddie's approval, leading to a long pause before Eddie responds. The waiter pours the sherry as Eddie and Sarah stare at each other over their glasses, until Eddie looks away. Sarah proposes a toast, and they touch glasses. The waiter brings the check, and Eddie nods, drinking the last of his brandy as the waiter leaves. Sarah notices Eddie's somber demeanor and, picking up her purse and gloves, she leaves. It is raining heavily as Sarah emerges from the building, leaning wearily against the awning. Eddie quickly pays the bill and follows her, catching up to take her by the arm and stepping out to hail a cab. Sarah angrily breaks away and walks into the rain, but Eddie pulls her back under the awning, and they enter a building, both drenched. She walks to a chair, limping noticeably, and he reaches over to pull her close, burying his face in her head. Bert Gordon leans on a cab, his expression dropping at the sight of Eddie and Sarah approaching. Eddie carries two suitcases and a leather cue case, setting the suitcases on the curb for the cab driver to take. Bert courteously opens the taxi door, and Sarah eyes Bert distrustfully as she gets in. Eddie, Sarah, and Bert then squeeze through the door of a train compartment as a redcap exits with their luggage, and Eddie shuts the door, with Bert and Sarah sitting across from each other.",

Carolyn's smile is frozen on her face. He crosses off. Lester stands at the bar. A bartender pours him a drink. The bartender complies. Lester takes his drink and turns to face the center of the room. Carolyn is talking to Buddy and Christy. She's on: smiling, animated, laughing too loud at their jokes. Lester shakes his head. Ricky approaches him, wearing a waiter's uniform, carrying a tray of empty glasses. Lester looks away, scans the crowd, then downs the rest of his drink in one gulp. Ricky just stands there, watching him. Finally Lester turns back to Ricky: what does this kid want. Lester's surprised, but instantly intrigued. Carolyn and Buddy are deep in conversation. Christy has wandered off. Carolyn is nervous; Buddy seems amused. They look at each other for a beat, then look away. This situation is loaded and they both know it. Ricky and Lester stand next to a dumpster behind the service entrance to the hotel, smoking a joint. Suddenly, the service entrance opens, and a large catering boss in a cheap suit peers out at them. Ricky hides the joint. He goes back inside. Lester looks at Ricky, who shrugs. Carolyn is standing in the open service entrance. Lester quickly hides the joint behind his back, and she goes back inside. Jane and Angela are watching MTV. Jane switches off the TV. She starts toward the kitchen. Lester enters and opens the refrigerator. He turns, and is instantly transfixed by: Angela leans against the counter, twirling her hair. She starts toward him. She reaches inside the refrigerator to grab a bottle. Extreme close-up on her hand as it briefly touches his shoulder in slow motion. As she does, she moves to place her other hand casually on Lester's shoulder. He sees it coming. Everything slows down, and all sound fades. Close on Lester: his eyes narrow slightly, then: He cups her face in his hands and kisses her. She seems shocked, but doesn't resist as he pulls her toward him with surprising strength. He breaks the kiss, looking at her in awe, then he reaches up and touches his lips. His eyes widen as he pulls a rose petal from his mouth right before we. Jane glances at Angela, irritated. Angela is back against the counter, drinking the root beer. Carolyn enters from the dining room. He can't believe what he's hearing.

Juno heads toward her desk, sets down her bag, looks up, and meets eyes with her longtime lab partner, Bleeker. Her girl lab partner stalks off dramatically. Juno examines a large ad in the newspaper depicting a distraught teen girl clutching her head. She smacks the phone a couple of times. A health teacher in slow motion puts a condom on a banana. We see Paulie's face at the moment of his deflowering; he's comically wide-eyed with shock. Juno, her father Mac, her stepmother Bren, and Liberty Bell sit at a typical kitchen table, eating dinner. Mac shovels food while chatting about his day. A pile of neglected cacti festers in a corner of Juno's room. Bren is cutting up Liberty Bell's food diligently, with her brilliant nails holding the silverware. Bren stitches a needlepoint pillow of a dog. Bren's nail salon is in full glory as she chats up a customer and applies a fresh coat while speaking in her strong city accent. Liberty Bell blithely pours bacon bits onto her dinner. Juno trudges toward the front entrance of the clinic and recognizes the protester as a classmate. She continues toward the clinic entrance, considers the situation, and pushes open the clinic door. The receptionist sits behind bulletproof glass. Juno flashes jazz hands, and the receptionist raises an eyebrow and arranges paperwork on a clipboard, handing it with a pen and holding up a fistful of purple condoms from a clinic jar. The semi-crowded waiting room is occupied mostly by pregnant women, teens, and ill-behaved children. The receptionist points to the paper, motions for Juno to look, and Juno scans an ad silently. The ad contains a photo of an attractive couple with ambiguous smiles. We see Paulie’s bedroom window with childish curtains and the light on inside. Bleeker lies on his car-bed in his track uniform, listening to the same LP from when he and Juno were intimate, and stares at Juno's yearbook photo, which has a sloppy handwritten message from her. Bren and Mac are predictably speechless when Leah presents the Penny Saver photos of the Lornings. Bren looks alarmed as Juno hastily attempts to legitimize the situation. Music plays, and we see sparse images of Vanessa Loring’s hands preparing her house for Juno's arrival, sprucing a vase of flowers.",
    "798": "Marcus leans forward and glances at Willie, rubbing his chin thoughtfully as Gin gets up from the table and leaves. Marcus and Willie regard each other, with Willie resignedly resting his head on his hand while Marcus slips into a brooding silence. The next day, a very large queue of excited children and their mothers forms at the western-themed Christmas Corral Grotto. A semi-comatose Santa lies on the escalator clutching a broken bottle as Marcus, back in elf guise, tries to calm the kids. At the top of the escalator, Santa drunkenly gets to his feet and lurches slowly towards the grotto, bumping into one of the kids as he does so, before keeling over and collapsing on top of a fake cactus and a sack of presents. The kids and moms gasp as Santa rallies and gets on his feet, only to fall over a life-size model donkey, falling on his back and seeing a second donkey going over. He scrambles to his feet and slugs the donkey with a big right hook, knocking its head off, then punches and kicks the donkey's body to bits in a display of drunken violence. The moms hurriedly usher their offspring away as Gin strides up, drops Willie, and drags him away. Later on, Willie is back at the kid's house in the garage, sitting in Roger's BMW with the engine running, having run a hose from the exhaust pipe into the driver's window to commit seasonal suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning. The kid walks into the garage, sees Willie whose head lolls to one side as he inhales the noxious fumes. The kid walks over to the car and looks in through the driver's window, and Willie moves slightly, raising his head a little to look at the kid. The kid turns to leave, and Willie winds the driver's window down, handing the kid a letter and noticing the kid has a black eye. Later, Willie is smashing into the chief skaterat's face and then turns to the rest of the gang. Two other kids on bikes watch astounded as Santa administers the festive beating. Back at the mall, Marcus and Willie are in the locker rooms after a hard day dishing out presents; Marcus gets changed out of his elf gear while Willie, in a contemplative mood, sits on a bench and sucks on a bottle of gut rot.",
    "1217": "There is light on the riverbank as Michael's party stirs and lights hang from the soffit of a dock house on the distant riverside. Michael, Sarah, and the party crouch low in the boat as it nears the building, where a group of pirates sit on a veranda overlooking the river. The volunteers wear worried frowns, but the boat's passage past the pirates appears to go unnoticed in the dark. Michael glances worriedly at Rambo, whose gaze does not waver from the pirates as the boat leaves the pirate dock behind. The volunteers move up the boat en masse towards Rambo, and Michael steps up to him. Suddenly, a floodlight is cast from a motorboat and a warning shot is fired as the boat bears down on them, with the pirates armed with a machine gun on a tripod. Sarah pulls on a white floppy hat as Rambo stands with his arms raised in surrender. The pirate motorboat pulls alongside them, and pirates in vests and bandannas cast ropes with grappling hooks over to Rambo's boat. The hooks catch and lock, as a floodlight plays on Rambo's face and a pirate brandishes a pistol. Rambo throws a switch and turns the lights on, then turns a gun on Sarah. The pirate leader turns his gun back on Rambo, who sees a pistol tucked into a second pirate's waistband. Rambo pulls a gun from his pocket and shoots them, the pirates dropping to the deck of their boat in slow motion. One of them is only wounded and reaches for his gun, but Rambo stands on his hand, aims at him, shoots him in the head, and turfs the corpse overboard. He grabs Michael by the throat, then releases him and throws a grappling hook over the side. He and Sarah grab the tiller as she stares at him desperately, placing her slim hand on his beefy forearm, her eyes wide and brimming with tears. Michael looks away disgustedly as she rejoins the group, who appear very subdued. She sits next to Michael, who holds her in his arms, as Rambo fires up the boat's motor with a sullen glare and adjusts the tiller. The boat plows through the river water, with the floodlights of the now derelict pirate boat touching their departing stand as it motors into the inky blackness. A bright sunny day follows as the boat is steered towards a riverbank with a simple harbor beneath a large, spreading tree overhanging the water. The volunteers stand up in the boat, collect their belongings, and begin to disembark while local peasants act as porters nearby. Rambo watches the volunteers leave, the last of them being Michael and Sarah. Michael rounds on Rambo, then gets off the boat and walks away up a wooden gangplank.",
    "696": "Peter takes a cookie and pulls a face as he drinks his glass of milk. Later, he struts and jives down the street like John Travolta in Saturday Night Fever, drawing a pitying glance from a slender Black woman passing by. In Jameson's office, Peter stands very close to Betty and sneers before sitting in Jameson's chair, helping himself to a bowl of sweets, and putting his feet up on the desk with a supercilious smile, while Robbie and Jameson look at him dumbfounded. Out on the street, Peter jives down the road, making shooting gestures with his fingers at any pretty girl who walks by, then swaggers into a clothes shop and comes out wearing a sharp black suit and black open-neck shirt. On the pavement, he launches into another hip-thrusting '80s dance routine, receiving strange looks from people on the street who hurry by as he coolly strides away. On the outskirts of the city, water from a sewer outfall drops into a pond, where a line of bubbles cleaves the water, leaving a trail behind that is followed by a muddy figure made of sand materializing on the swampy bank and hauling itself upright. As the figure dries out and becomes human, Flint stares at his hands, with Penny's photograph dangling from a locket and chain from his fingers, and gazes at the tiny image with eyes filled with resolve. Later, Peter is with Gwen, and Brock watches bitterly as they cross the street towards the jazz club. Gwen looks around as Peter spots Mary Jane waitressing and beckons the hostess, slipping her a wad of money, gallantly gesturing for her to sit down while he sits behind her, facing the on-stage back. Mary Jane goes by with a tray of drinks, and Gwen notices Peter glance at her as Mary Jane puts down her tray and hurries onto the stage. Peter glances at Gwen out of the corner of his eye, slips away to the stage, and just as Mary Jane is about to sing, he comes in on piano. Gwen looks up and realizes it's Peter playing the piano as he kicks away the stool, leaps onto the piano, and dances over the tables, grabbing a martini from a customer, swinging across the room on a chandelier, putting his legs around the chair, and sliding back across the dance floor, scattering customers. He drops to the floor, spins the chair, and poses with it before dancing towards Gwen, ripping his black suit jacket off his shoulders, causing her to gasp. He tosses the jacket towards Mary Jane on stage and strikes a series of poses, clicking his fingers and salsaing over to Gwen, holding out his hand. She takes it and rises to her feet as Mary Jane looks devastated when he leads Gwen into the center of the dance floor.",
    "527": "Elliot takes a last drag on his cigarette, and the camera follows his hand as he crushes it out in a nearby ashtray. Hare Krishna music is heard over a sunlit view of the Manhattan skyline and the green trees of Central Park. The camera moves down to reveal a large group of Hare Krishnas dancing on the broad green lawn among other New Yorkers enjoying the day. The leader, holding some pamphlets, stands by a chain-link fence a few feet away from his group, talking to someone on the other side. It's Mickey, as the camera soon shows, wearing a short-sleeved shirt, a paper tucked under his arm. Mickey walks off, the Hare Krishnas still dancing and singing on the other side of the fence. He flips through the literature as he walks, then looks straight ahead, pondering. Mickey puts his hand to his mouth as another title appears on a black screen. A bench faces some wharf pilings; the water gently laps against them as Lee walks into view, the wind blowing her hair. She stands and faces the water and the distant skyline across the bay. Lee is alone; her hands are in her pockets. The concerto stops, and the movie cuts to Holly, leaning into an open phone booth near a subway entrance. People rush past Holly towards the subway; others are walking up the station steps. Holly smokes a cigarette as she talks on the phone to Hannah. Holly hangs up the phone and takes a drag on her cigarette. She looks off in the distance, smiling, as the film cuts to guests crowded together in the living room, surrounding the piano, where Evan is sitting and flipping through some sheet music. Norma stands behind him, leaning against a book-laden wall. The guests are chattering, enjoying themselves; a lamp glows on the corner of the piano. A little boy sitting in a chair next to Evan is talking animatedly with a girl who is leaning over the arm of the sofa. An adult guest talks to the little boy; another guest takes a sip of wine from a glass she'd placed on the bookshelf behind her as Evan turns and addresses the group. The guests laugh appreciatively. A woman comes over to Evan and hands him some wine. He laughs; the guests laugh with him. The guests continue to laugh; they are charmed. Evan continues to laugh with everyone as he starts to play the piano. A nearby woman toasts him with her drink. The camera moves around the room as he plays, showing the various guests, chattering over the music. Some are in clusters, in private conversations; others listen and watch the offscreen Evan.",
    "1157": "Harry invades Snape's memories and sees him unhappy, humiliated by his father. Back in the storeroom, Snape, with his face twisted with anger, grabs Harry viciously and peers into his face. Harry cowers and runs from Snape's room, hearing crying in the corridor and finding the twins comforting a small boy while Umbridge stands watching them before she goes. During the O.W.L. exams, the great hall is set out with long rows of desks as Hermione writes busily, Ron sighs and looks worried, and Harry watches Umbridge standing on the stage in front of a huge swinging pendulum. Her smug smile fades as several students turn to look at the door, and Umbridge strides purposefully down the hall towards the great wooden doors. Everyone stops writing and turns to look as Umbridge opens the door, where a fizzing firework hovers in front of her nose and explodes inside. She looks anxiously around the empty hallway when suddenly Fred and George hurtle over her head on broomsticks, zooming backwards and forwards while flinging exam papers and whiz bangs into the air. The multicolored fireworks spiral down and explode, scattering papers everywhere, with Goyle getting a firework in his face, Crabbe a whiz bang up his backside, and another attacking Draco as Filch rushes in. One of the twins gives a signal, and his brother flings a large firework into the air, which explodes into a fiery dragon that heads for Umbridge, causing her to race for the door. The dragon bursts out after her, destroying the decrees Filch has nailed to the wall, as frames clatter down in a shower of glass, paper, and splintered wood. Fred and George fly from the building, swooping over the battlements on their broomsticks and flinging fireworks. Delighted students rush into the courtyard, applauding, while Professor Flitwick looks confused and a huge fiery letter W appears in the sky. Ron smiles with pride, Professor Flitwick punches the air, then looks around self-consciously as Harry's face grows pale and he collapses in slow motion. Hermione notices him fall as he is overwhelmed by an image of Sirius being tortured by Voldemort. Sirius gasps, his face contorted with pain, as Harry sees the number 97, the glass sphere, the black corridor, and the blue door. Hermione kneels beside him anxiously, looking at Ron before they enter Umbridge's study, where a white cat leaves his China plate through a cat flap. Harry throws flue powder into the fire as Draco drags in Neville, Umbridge leans over Harry, and he looks at Ron and Hermione.",
    "1344": "In a modest Ohio house in 1979, Charles, in an ill-fitting black suit, and Martin, dressed in a shirt and tie, are at the buffet. The scene includes forty-odd friends and neighbors dressed darkly, engaging in quiet discussions, with some crying on a grey, snowy day in early February in Lillian, Ohio. Many cars are parked outside, including a Sheriff's Department squad car in the driveway. Joe, dressed in a too-big black suit, solemnly sits on a swing set, holding a locket. He looks up when a distinct 1968 Buick GSX, a yellow muscle car with a black racing stripe, arrives. A man in his early 40s, wearing jeans and a work shirt, exits the car. Joe watches carefully as Louis moves to the house and inside. Joe's focus returns to the locket as tears fill his eyes, but the moment is broken by raised voices from the house. The sound of breaking glass follows, and the back door bursts open, revealing Joe's father, Jack, leading a handcuffed and in-pain Louis Dainard to the squad car. Their eyes lock briefly, but Jack, visibly uncomfortable, drives away. Joe watches them depart, looks back at the locket, and finally closes it. As winter becomes a memory, hundreds of kids celebrate leaving their last day of school. Girls emphatically embrace goodbye while boys run off happily. Charles, red-faced, hands Joe pages, and they head to the 7-Eleven. Cary, with a burn wrap on his arm, joins them as they scan the candy aisle. Joe nods at a magazine while a hectic family scene unfolds at Charles' house: his mother cooks, his sister Jen angrily sets the table, his father pays bills, his sister Peg works on a puzzle, and twin 9-year-old boys bicker over an action figure, as the TV plays a Match Game in the living room.",
    "1368": "Debbie crawls on the floor while Pete lays in bed. Pete stands with a starfish sticking out of his underwear. They eat room service, including chips and desserts and everything. She tries to deep throat it, and Pete loves it. Pete and Debbie drive back from Laguna, looking very happy and refreshed. They hold hands and smile at each other as they pull up to their house, shut off the car, and sit for a beat, knowing they're about to head back into the stress of the real world and not wanting their peaceful, loving time to end. Sadie walks outside, followed by Jodi. Charlotte is crying really hard and sits on the table. Pete and Debbie are talking to Dr. Seduku, a foreign doctor with both an accent and a lisp. Pete cycles with the crew while Debbie looks around the house for Pete. Debbie sees Pete on the bed, with his legs up in the air. He still has his bike top on but is naked from the waist down, trying to look at his back end while holding a mirror and an iPhone. Pete has his naked legs hiked up over his head, and Debbie takes a very quick glance inside. Debbie talks to Jodi while they fold clothes and watch Desi. Debbie walks over to Desi, who picks a shirt and begins to take all her clothes off in front of Debbie. Debbie squeezes Desi's breasts. Pete is in his office on the phone with his REALTOR. Sadie and her friend Wendy run around the yard with Charlotte and the triplets. Larry and Debbie greet the kids when they enter the kitchen. Larry picks up one of the triplets, and Charlotte leaves with the triplets. Larry takes some of the food she's throwing out. Wendy exits, and Sadie runs off. Pete enters from the hallway, sees Larry, and turns around before anyone notices him. Pete and Debbie are in bed, and Pete is reading Sadie's iChats on her confiscated iPad out loud to Debbie. They hear a door slam, and Debbie gasps. Debbie starts looking through the iPad. Pete's iPhone chimes, and he sees a message from Ronnie from work. He looks over at Debbie, who is oblivious. Pete paces. Pete is driving while Sadie and Charlotte sing show tunes loudly and happily. Pete is very upset about the record not selling as Debbie talks to their ACCOUNTANT. Pete enters and walks into Ronnie's office, where Ronnie is drawing on a blackboard behind his desk. Pete walks out of Ronnie's office and into the main office space, and Ronnie follows. Debbie sits in Dr. Pelligrino's office, and then she drives away. We cannot tell what she is feeling, but after a few beats, a joyous smile appears across her face.",
    "1058": "An empty carriage arrives at Longbourn, and as it pulls to a halt, the footman opens the door, allowing the Wickhams to emerge from the house, surrounded by Lydia's sisters and parents. He ushers Lydia into the carriage, which then pulls away as Lydia leans out of the window to wave a cheery goodbye to her family. Later, Lizzie and Jane are taking a turn in the gardens, with the bright sun beating down on them, while indoors, Mary practices her piano and Kitty is busy decorating a straw bonnet with ribbon until she stops, looks wearily at the bonnet, and tosses it away. Mrs. Bennet is lying back on a chaise lounge in her room, fanning herself and ordering the servants about, while Mr. Bennet sits peacefully by the fire in the parlor, reading a book and sipping a glass of wine. Lizzie, now in her room and in her nightgown, sits in front of the mirror, gazes sadly at her reflection, and then leans forward to blow out the candle. It is a bright, sunny day when Mrs. Phillips comes to visit her sister, Mrs. Bennet, at Longbourn, and a horse and cart filled with trunks pulls up at Netherfield. Inside the house, shutters are opened and smoke pours out of the chimney as the fires are lit, while a procession of servants troop inside, carrying baskets of food and provisions. Mr. Bingley is out shooting, and they are in the kitchen, hanging up bunches of herbs. Lizzie looks at her sister while Mary is at the piano, and as Mrs. Bennet scurries over to the window, Jane tries to hide her excitement. Lizzie breathes deeply as Mrs. Bennet checks her reflection in the mirror, swiftly taking a seat as the housekeeper shows their guests in. Jane and Lizzie look nervous as the two gentlemen enter and bow. Everyone takes their seats, except Mr. Darcy, who strolls over to the window and smiles at Jane. Mr. Darcy continues looking out the window as Lizzie glares at her mother with embarrassment. The two gentlemen are now on their horses, riding away from Longbourn, while Jane and Lizzie take a stroll in the gardens and continue on their walk, with Jane looking somewhat sheepish. At Netherfield, Mr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy emerge from the front door, and astonished, Mr. Bingley watches as Mr. Darcy climbs into his carriage. As the carriage pulls away, Mr. Bingley immediately looks around for the nearest servant, and then he is on horseback, trotting through a shady avenue of trees on his way to Longbourn. She bursts into Lizzie's room, and afterward, an awkward-looking Mr. Bingley is sitting opposite Lizzie, Kitty, and Jane in the parlor.",
    "19": "She puts two hands lightly on his waist to move him out of the way, and he gulps at the contact, since no one else ever touches him, but covers his self-consciousness. She barks a mirthless though hearty laugh. If we could read Melvin, which we can't, we'd see him unsettled by the date talk. The two waitresses signal their protests as Melvin walks back into the restaurant proper, hanging near their table, and his discomfort builds in this limbo. The Woman starts to protest. There is in Carol's attitude toward Melvin some ingredient of self-satisfaction—that she is the only one in the place who can handle him. She starts to clear the table. Some crazy street-freak has slipped under her perfect guard and momentarily devastated her, and Melvin senses that he's gone way too far. A beat and then Melvin nods, hardly breathing, backing down. She walks away, and Melvin watches her, biting his lower lip. She is underneath a YOUNGER, cuter MAN on the living room sofa, each time startling herself with her own noise and trying to reign it in. The Young Man stops and looks at her, and pulling herself together, she goes off down the hallway. She takes off her headphones when she sees Carol, then hears the cough. Carol now goes into her son's room, which is a monument to horrible, sleepless nights, with two drugstore de-humidifying filters, a nebulizer (breathing contraption), a waste basket, a nightstand filled with medicine, a blood pressure kit, stacks of seven-year-old toys, and a small TV wedged into the tiny space. Carol feels his head, and then he coughs, trying to suppress it. She brings up a waste basket as he throws up and she comforts him. He apologizes. As she re-enters the living room, he is taking a cigarette from a pack, palms the cigarette, and resumes making out. His hand squeezes her breast, then he stops and looks at his hand. She looks down and sees a bit of throw-up he picked up while feeling her and then notices him looking at her with extreme distaste. She barks a laugh to cover her embarrassment but speaks the truth. Seeing the Hustlers, he leads the way back toward the studio, chatting away unaware that Vincent is disrobing as he follows him and eyeing the expensive apartment. He turns and sees the naked model as Vincent moves back to retrieve his clothes. Vincent is striking blatantly sexual poses to the increasingly uneasy Simon. Vincent has instinctively put Simon on the defensive, and Vincent's slack-jawed expression changes as he feels an intellectual tingle to be having this conversation. There's a joy in him at this moment—a bit of purity. Carol and LESLIE, another waitress, are waiting for their order at the cappuccino bar.",
    "315": "She giggles and snuggles into him, and though he's grateful for her affection, he still looks uneasy. The phone rings and he automatically answers it. Evan smiles to himself and hugs her tighter. The pledges of Theta Chi busily gather around Evan, their clothes covered in dirt, food, and what might be vomit. Evan, now dressed like his usual self, bangs a wooden spoon on a metal salad bowl that a poor Theta Chi pledge wears as a hat. As she takes a step toward the table, flower petals shower down on her. She looks up to see two more pledges standing on ladders, delicately tossing petals. Kayleigh looks overwhelmed as she sits down. Her hand reaches out to his and grabs it fiercely, and they lean into each other for a kiss so enchanted it might as well be their first ever. Hunter bolts up the stairs, two at a time, and Evan and Kayleigh exchange worried looks. Evan runs down the front lawn to his car, the Honda parked at the bottom of the hill. Evan's car has been trashed and is surrounded by broken glass. The seats and tires have been slashed, the hood has been mysteriously yanked off, and the steering wheel sits on the roof. The most unnerving thing, however, is a spiked leather dog collar that hangs off the rearview mirror. By now a crowd has gathered, and she stares at the collar. Evan leads Kayleigh into his bedroom and shuts the door. He then locks the door, reaches into his desk, and finds a tiny canister of Pepper Spray. Evan sits in silence for a moment, contemplating this. Kayleigh and Evan walk through the all-but-deserted campus. Tommy rushes Evan and bashes him with the tire thumper in the shoulder and ribs, and Evan goes down. As Tommy prepares to bash his brains in, Evan whips out the Pepper Spray and nails Tommy in the face. Tommy reels back in pain, covering his eyes with his free hand. Evan struggles to his feet and circles around Tommy, keeping a distance as he douses Tommy with Pepper Spray. Tommy blindly stumbles around, madly swinging the tire thumper. She runs to a blue streetlight on the quad. Evan kicks Tommy hard in the ribs and raises the tire thumper for a final attack, swinging down off camera. Evan sees what he's done and drops the weapon, horrified. Kayleigh sees what Evan's done to her brother, and sirens come racing to the quad. Evan looks away from Tommy's limp body. A security vehicle pulls through the ominous metal gates of the large state prison. The vehicle stops, and Evan, along with nine other convicts, exits in leg and hand restraints. Evan, now wearing his standard issue inmate uniform, enters the General Population area of the prison."
