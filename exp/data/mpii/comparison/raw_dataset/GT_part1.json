    "117": "Several people come out, among them Neff, carrying his briefcase. Lola sees him and stands up, and as he is about to pass through the anteroom without recognizing her, she stops him. Neff looks at her a little startled. He pushes the swing door open and holds it for her. As she passes in front of him, his eyes narrow in uneasy speculation. Neff comes up level with Lola and leads her towards his office, with the camera following them. He opens the door of his office and holds it for her, and she enters. Lou Schwartz, one of the other salesmen, is working at his desk, but Lola enters, with Neff following after her. Lou gets up and goes out. Neff stares at her tensely, and she turns again to the window so he won't see that she is crying. Neff gets up and goes to her. In the foreground, Neff and Lola are having dinner, with the usual activity of Olvera Street—sidewalk peddlers, guitar players, etc.—in the background. Neff and Lola are driving along the beach near Santa Monica. Neff is wearing a light summer suit, in contrast to Lola's mourning. Apparently, she is telling him a story and now and then she laughs, but there is no sound. There is a close shot of Neff behind the steering wheel, and he is only half listening to Lola. Neff, with his hat on and no briefcase, is walking toward Keyes' office. As he comes up close to the door, he stops with a startled expression on his face. On a chair beside the door sits a familiar figure. He is Jackson, the man from the observation platform of the train. He is wearing his Stetson hat and smoking a cigar, studying something in the file folder. Neff recognizes him immediately, but Jackson does not look up. Neff controls his expression and goes on to open the door to Keyes' office. Neff is just closing the door from the inside. Keyes, with his coat off, is lying on his office couch, chewing on a cigar, as usual. Keyes bounces off the couch like a rubber ball and levels a finger at him. Keyes goes to the door and opens it, and Jackson enters with the file folder. Jackson indicates the cigar he himself is smoking and the file folder he is holding. Keyes remembers he forgot to introduce Jackson and picks up the telephone on his desk and speaks into it. Meanwhile, Jackson crosses over to Neff, and during the ensuing dialogue between him and Neff, we hear Keyes' low voice on the phone in the background. Keyes rejoins them at this point and has opened the door for Jackson, who goes out. Keyes puts a cigar in his mouth and starts tapping his pockets for matches.",
    "1263": "Voldemort glances at the snake, and they dis-apparate. Harry continues to shiver as disheveled and dirty, Hermione and Ron approach him. Hermione turns anxiously to Ron, and he crouches down beside Harry. Harry looks worried as Hermione squats down. Harry closes his eyes and takes a deep breath while his jaw remains tense, breathing through his mouth. Nagini is curled up in a boat house where Lucius Malfoy is present with Voldemort, who examines the skin on his own forearm. When Harry opens his eyes, the others stare at him anxiously as the Death Eaters sweep over the school. A student flies in on a broomstick as a giant swings a scythe, and the others fight on the stairs. Hermione runs through a door, narrowly avoiding a bolt, as Harry beats on a door and shoots a Death Eater. A giant with two-pronged weapons spots the trio, and they run, hiding inside a huge bell lying on its side as the giant's weapon strikes it. Colossal spiders appear scrambling over the rubble, causing them to retreat. Hermione runs between the giants, and they fend off attacks with their wands to reach a quieter area. They stop when they spot a Death Eater leaning over a girl's body, as a werewolf glances up. Hermione casts a spell, knocking Fenrir Greyback through a window. They run through a closed-end walkway with the giants keeping pace, smashing the walls. Racing to the front of the school, they see Dementors flying towards them, when suddenly a shimmering barrier is thrown by Aberforth Dumbledore, holding a wand in his outstretched hand. As Aberforth and his allies turn back to fight, the trio sprints away, running onto a raised walkway and down steps towards the boat house lights where Snape is with Voldemort. Voldemort stares at him as Snape perfects a smile, circling him with his eyes fixed on Voldemort. With a slicing move with the Elder Wand, Snape falls against a glass paneled wall with Harry on the other side. Mouth agape, the snake lunges repeatedly at Snape, thumping him against the lead panned glass, which shakes but doesn't give way, as Harry and the others grab helplessly outside. Snape's bloody hand slides down a window and falls limply to the floor as Harry and the others enter the boat house to find Snape still alive. His lower jaw trembles as Harry moves towards him, kneels down, and leans forward to staunch a wound on Snape's neck. The dying Snape turns his head to look at Harry, who gazes deeply into his eyes as a tear rolls down Snape's cheek, while Hermione rummages in her bag and pulls out a small phial.",
    "10": "Brad stands, ready to usher Lester out, as Lester stares at him, powerless. A moving van is parked in front of the colonial house next door to the Burnhams', while a Mercedes-Benz pulls into the Burnham driveway with Carolyn driving and Lester in the passenger seat. As they get out of the car, Carolyn scopes out the movers next door who carry furniture toward the house, and then she heads into the house, followed by Lester. Lester, Carolyn, and Jane are eating dinner by candlelight, with red roses bunched in a vase at the center of the table. Lester suddenly turns to Jane, who looks at him as if he's lost his mind, while Carolyn watches closely. Carolyn gets up, heads toward the kitchen, and is gone. Lester notices Carolyn looking at him critically and remains quiet, staring at his plate, before getting up and starting after Jane, taking his plate with him. Jane stands at the sink, rinsing her plate when Lester enters. Jane turns and stares at him, waiting for him to finish; he looks to her for help, but she's too uncomfortable with the sudden intimacy to provide any. Viewing through greenhouse windows, it's apparent Lester and Jane's interaction is not going well, although we can't hear them. Jane puts her plate in the dishwasher and leaves, and as we follow her out the door, the camera jerks back to Lester calling after her. His point of view, on video: through the kitchen window, Lester is seen at the sink, rinsing off his plate and muttering to himself. Close on the face of Ricky Fitts, illuminated by the screen of his digicam as he videotapes; Ricky is eighteen, but his eyes appear much older, with a wounded quality beneath his tranquil exterior. Lester turns off the faucet, and through the kitchen window, it's clear Ricky is no longer there. Lester's head jerks up as he realizes he's being watched, dries his hands, and tosses the towel on the counter, where it lands next to a framed photograph of Lester, Carolyn, and a much-younger Jane at an amusement park. Throughout all this, Carolyn keeps repeating to herself, arranging her sales materials on a desk, then stripping down to her undergarments. We see Carolyn working with fierce concentration as she cleans glass doors overlooking the patio and pool, scrubs countertops in the kitchen, perches on a stepladder to dust a cheap-looking ceiling fan in the master bedroom, and vacuums a dirty carpet that will never be clean. Finally, Carolyn stands in front of the mirror, wearing her suit once more, applying lipstick.",
    "654": "Peter nods and stands there with a stupid smile and a blank expression; once again, he simply nods and turns to watch her go as she gives him a little wave, and with a dejected look on his face, Peter walks off down the street. Later, he enters the apartment he shares with Harry, where Norman Osborne is on the phone. Peter saunters over to Harry, who looks up at him before looking a little sheepish as he turns to them both and reads the Bugle's reward for a Spider-Man photo. An armored car hoist ensues, with a camera suspended in a web, and Spider-Man swoops in, floors four robbers, flips another over the shoulder in a double move, kicks a gun from a robber's hand, and jumps on him. He then turns to the camera, and a photograph of Spider-Man swinging off a roof, crawling down a building, saluting the cops is shown to the Bugle's editor, J. Jonah Jameson. Peter hands back his photographs to a girl at a desk, who writes a check, and Peter has his camera slung around his neck. Across the city in the high-rise Oscorp building, Norman is chairing a meeting; he rises and faces the other ten board members, glares at Henry Balkan sitting directly opposite him, while the older man sips from a cup of coffee with his gaze fixed on Norman, who wipes his mouth with the back of his hand as a lopsided grin appears on Norman's face. Colorful balloons and costumed revelers fill Times Square, and Peter's there with his camera, kicking away with it. He aims it at a balcony high up on a massive stone building, where he sees Harry with MJ, who's wearing a high-colored Chinese dress. Harry places his fingertips on her chin and leans in close to try and kiss her, but she turns her head away. Down below, Harry sees Peter neck-craned watching, and MJ and Harry turn to go inside. Peter senses something and looks around uneasily as Harry meets an Oscorp board member who's in a wheelchair, then Peter is disturbed and shifts his gaze under the sky. Beyond the Times Square building with a singular wireless cubed top and other advertising hoardings, an object is moving toward the crowd, and everyone turns to look up as Balkan watches through binoculars. Astride the glider is a figure in a stolen green flightsuit like a goblin with a sharp-featured head, long pointy ears, large yellow eyes, nose, and bare teeth. The glider circles the tall singular building, then heads towards the balcony, weaving this way and that, past giant balloon figures floating above the festival, and the laughing goblin throws something at the building with the balcony, causing explosions that rip out the windows and the floor below the balcony.",
    "552": "Indy finally manages to pull himself atop the tank once more where he punches Vogel over the side, then peers down to Henry, still inside the tank. Indy pulls Henry and Brody from the tank. Vogel pulls himself back atop the tank armed again with the shovel which he swings at Indy, who ducks and grabs Vogel's arm. As Indy winds up to punch Vogel he catches Brody in the face on the backswing, then completes the movement and knocks Vogel down. Vogel's hat sails in and falls to the floor. Before Indy can answer, Vogel is up and swinging with the shovel. Indy ducks but the shovel catches Henry sending him over the side and onto the moving tread. Indy grabs his whip, knocking Vogel aside. As Henry speeds toward the front of the tank to certain doom, Indy, with lightning speed, whips out his bullwhip, wrapping the end of the whip around Henry's right ankle. Sallah draws his horse next to the treads. He tips his fez to Henry. Vogel now punches Indy in the back and grabs him around the neck. Still, Indy refuses to let go of the whip. Sallah reaches out to Henry. Sallah manages to hold onto Henry as he brings his horse to a stop just at the cliff's edge. Indy finally frees himself of Vogel's grasp, twisting his arm painfully away from Indy's neck, then landing a hard blow to Vogel's head. Looks down at the fast-approaching cliff, his face filled with horror. We see his hat blow off and sail over the cliff's edge. The tank trundles over the cliff and plummets to the bottom. Henry, Brody, and Sallah look down at the flaming wreckage of the tank. Looking dazed and bewildered, Indy staggers up behind them. He joins the others at the edge of the cliff, looking down at the wreckage below with a bewildered expression. Finally, Henry becomes aware of his presence. He just looks at Indy, overcome with emotion. Finally, he throws his arms around him. And he becomes aware of his father's embrace. He hugs his father back. Brody and Sallah are moved by this sudden reconciliation. Henry pats Indy on the back and Indy collapses, sitting hard on the rocky cliff edge. Unaware, Henry, Sallah, and Brody start to walk away. Henry turns and walks toward the horse with Brody and Sallah. Suddenly the fedora, borne on the wind, blows into scene and lands at Indy's feet. Donovan peers through binoculars to see the Canyon of the Crescent Moon. He lowers the binoculars and turns to Elsa. Now Elsa peers through the binoculars. Indy, Henry, Sallah, and Brody ride into the canyon. Now we turn a corner and they see the hidden city.",
    "823": "Cal waves, and his friend knocks back the wine. The guy, Bernie, eyes him anxiously, then looks down and puts a Macy's bag on the bar, causing Cal to frown, bewildered. Bernie gets up, Cal shrugs and smiles, and Bernie heads out of the bar. Jacob is at the table with one woman, while Cal is woeful. Jacob is listening as Cal glances over at him, and Jacob beckons him. Cal looks over his shoulder for someone else, but Jacob beckons him again. Cal regards Jacob thoughtfully, picks up his drink and cologne, and heads over to Jacob's table just as the woman gets up to leave. Cal nods and sits back down, lowering his glass and staring as Jacob takes a swig of his drink and nods at Cal. Cal studies him, and Jacob cocks his head. Cal nods, and Jacob raises his glass and drinks, prompting Cal to follow suit without using his straw. Jacob beckons to the woman, and Cal looks around. Jacob points at Cal, then gets up and heads off with the pretty dark-haired woman, who smiles at Cal. Cal turns to watch them leave, then relaxes into his chair and sucks on his straw. Molly rushes in front of the TV and starts dancing as Cal and Robbie lean against the kitchen counter, with Robbie letting his head flop onto his hands. Jessica smiles at Robbie, who fidgets awkwardly and looks down. In the mall, Cal ascends on an escalator and strolls through the mall. Hannah and Liz are at a bar with a group, and they all raise their glasses. The guy, who is dark-haired and a bit gawky looking, kisses Hannah on the lips, and Hannah smiles excitedly. Hannah looks over at him and smiles as Liz heads off. Hannah regards her boyfriend, who is playing with his phone and sitting next to another guy doing the same thing. Hannah's smile fades, and her eyes dart as Jacob stands by a glass barrier on the roof terrace of the mall. He bites into a piece of folded-up pizza, dressed smartly in a dark suit, brown shoes, and sunglasses. He leans on the barrier and peers over, looking up and chewing slowly as Cal approaches, wearing a baggy striped polo shirt, blue jeans, and running trainers. Jacob checks his watch and shrugs, then throws Cal's trainers over the barrier, slaps him on the cheek, and marches off. Cal smiles with disbelief, then suddenly relents and takes out his wallet. Jacob looks down at the wallet dryly, then frowns incredulously at Cal. Cal tries on various shirts and ties with Jacob by racks of sunglasses, accumulating loads of shopping bags as his credit card is swiped in a store. In a beauty product store, Cal's credit card is swiped again.",
    "1012": "A motorbike speeds past, and Charles reacts to the exhaust bank. Friday, a female servant, zips up the back of the Queen's black dress and hands her a pearl necklace, which the Queen takes, looks into a full-length mirror, and fastens around her neck before studying her reflection with a fixed stare. As the Queen descends some stairs, Prince Philip emerges from a nearby room. Looking troubled, the Queen descends the stairs, rushes into the courtyard, puts on a head scarf, and gets into the driver's side of a nearby Land Rover, which then pulls away. Three bodyguards quickly jump into a nearby car and follow her. Alastair bursts into Tony's office, goes to the door, and Tony looks up at Alastair as he leaves the room. The Queen's Land Rover enters the grounds of a country estate, followed by the bodyguards' car. The Queen emerges from the Land Rover, gazes around, and a middle-aged man in a cloth cap emerges from a nearby door. On seeing the Queen, he removes his cap, unlocks the door to a small, stone building, and opens it for her to enter. The Queen removes her sunglasses and glances at something inside: the stag, which hangs from the ceiling by its feet at the center of the room, skinned and with its head removed, with a patch of blood under the body. The Queen sees the stag's head and antlers arranged side-by-side on a nearby table, gently touches the side of the stag's head, and, with her face turned away from the man, catches her breath. The Queen closes her eyes, composes her features, turns to face the man, looks at the stag's body again, and moves towards the door, which the man opens. Video footage shows a carpet of flowers around the gates and walls of Buckingham Palace, with crowds swarming outside. Inside a plane, the Queen sits and stares out of a window in contemplation until Robin appears and stands before her. The Queen turns back to the window while Robin stares at her before the Queen turns back to him. Robin leaves, revealing the Queen Mother sitting opposite the Queen. Alastair is handed a sheet of paper, sits at his desk, and video footage shows the Queen arriving at Buckingham Palace. Black cars drive up to the palace and past crowds gathered behind barriers; inside one car, the Queen and Prince Philip watch the onlookers. In his office, Alastair scribbles some notes on the sheet he was given and hands it to Tony.",
    "702": "Harry holds out a hand, and Peter clasps it firmly. Harry nods, and Peter gets to his feet. They spin round to face their enemies. Venom flies at Peter. Harry swings Peter like a club to hit Sandman. He blasts Sandman's arm with flames from his sky stick. Sandman tries to grab Harry, but the monster's huge arm shatters like glass. Jameson's in the crowd below. He tries to take a photograph. The camera's empty. Jameson glares at the girl. Peter and Harry duck Sandman's huge fists. Above them, the cab plummets towards Mary Jane. The cab misses her. She hangs on by a thread. Harry and Peter fly towards her on the sky stick, weaving past the sandy hulk. The thread breaks, and Mary Jane tumbles. Peter slues the sky stick round. Being onto each other, they surf past Sandman, and Peter leaps off the sky stick and catches her. The watching crowd go wild as he swings away on a thread carrying Mary Jane in his arms and lands back on the half-built skyscraper. He nods through his torn mask. Sandman grabs at Harry. Peter kicks sand in Sandman's eyes. Sandman lumbers round, bemused, then punches Peter with his massive arm, sending him flying up to one of the upper floors of the half-completed building. He's out of Sandman's reach. He fires rockets from the sky stick. They hit their target, and the enormous sand creature staggers back, crumbling and disintegrating. As his huge left arm crumples into the ground leaving out of dust, the crowd whoop their delight. High up on the skyscraper, Peter, his Spider-Man mask badly torn, his eye and mouth quite visible, looks around for Venom. As Peter turns his way and that, Venom grabs him from above and hurls him into a girder. Peter falls on his face. Venom lassos his wrists with two black threads and holds him to his knees. He whacks him with an iron bar. He hits him twice more, ripping the mask right off. Venom holds the jagged metal bar to Peter's neck. Venom's tendrils engulf Brock's face. As he goes to stab Peter, a pumpkin bomb cuts into him. Harry flies up. Venom snatches the sky stick from under him. As Harry falls, he gets a rack of long metal tubes that fall to the floor. Peter still trapped watches as Venom puts his hands to his ears and seems to half-disintegrate. Peter remembers hitting himself on the bell when he tried to tear the black suit off. Venom leaps down Peter, wielding the sky stick as a weapon. Harry steps in between them. Harry looks down at the two blades protruding through his chest. Venom hoists him up into the air and tosses him away.",
    "631": "He switches it on as Merrill kneels beside him. Merrill removes the pickaxe from under the doorknob and pulls open the door. Gingerly, he starts to climb the gloomy stairwell leading up into the kitchen, thick rays of sunlight pouring through irregular holes punched into the wooden planks across the window. In the basement, Graham watches as Merrill tentatively reaches the top of the steps and looks around. Merrill turns left and disappears from Graham's view. Merrill reappears, looks down the stairwell, and nods. Graham carries Morgan slowly up the stairs and into the kitchen, where chairs are strewn across the floor, and the fridge door is open. Bo follows her father and then wanders out into the hallway as Graham carries Morgan through the dining room and into the living room, staring at the broken planks across the windows. A table lamp underneath one window is on its side. A picture hanging below a mounted baseball bat is askew, but otherwise the room is untouched. Graham lays Morgan gently down on the sofa. Bo comes back in. She does a little dance. She swings her arms and thrusts her hips. He looks down at Morgan. He heads to the cupboard under the stairs. Graham unplugs the set and wields the TV trolley down the hallway into the living room. He maneuvers it into position and crouches down to plug it in. He stares in horror at the reflection on the screen, a tall humanoid form silhouetted against the window, holding Morgan across one of its arms. Graham slowly stands and turns round to face the creature. Merrill comes in from the dining room and stops in his tracks, dropping the syringe. Merrill steps forward. The creature, with its highly domed head, stares between the two men. Graham looks at the alien's lower arm, which is wrapped around Morgan's back and matches his shirt fabric. Two of the creature's four clawed digits are missing. Graham remembers using the knife outside Ray's pantry. The alien holds its other hand out over Morgan's face, tilting its hand up at the wrist joint. A sharp spike slides out of the bottom of the wrist, the alien holding it above Morgan's nose. Merrill, Graham, and Bo stand rooted to the spot, staring in abject horror as the alien looks down at Morgan and then up at Graham. Graham studies the creature with its smooth-skinned earless head, an odd-shaped mouth, dull gray teeth exposed. He glares into the alien's hooded eyes as he remembers driving to the scene of the accident, Caroline in the road waving her arms. Graham narrows his eyes slightly as he remembers crouching by the front of Ray's pickup, his wife's head resting on the bonnet.",
    "1": "Jane looks at us and sits up as we're flying above suburban America, descending slowly toward a tree-lined street. We're looking down at a king-sized bed from overhead: Lester Burnham lies sleeping amidst expensive bed linens, face down, wearing pajamas. An irritating alarm clock rings, and Lester gropes blindly to shut it off. He rolls over, looks up at us, and sighs, then sits up and puts on his slippers. Lester thrusts his face directly into a steaming hot shower, and from outside the shower, his naked body is silhouetted through the fogged-up glass door; it becomes apparent he is masturbating. Close on a single, dewy American Beauty rose, a gloved hand with clippers appears and snips the flower off as Carolyn Burnham tends her rose bushes in front of the Burnham house. A very well-put-together woman of forty, she wears color-coordinated gardening togs and has lots of useful and expensive tools, while Lester watches her through a window on the first floor, peeping out through the drapes. In the fenced front yard of the house next door, a dog barks repeatedly, and a man in a conservative suit (Jim #1) chastises the barking dog. A second man in a conservative suit (Jim #2) comes out of the house as Lester watches all this from the window. Jim #1 walks toward the fence to greet Carolyn, and they continue to chat, unaware that Lester is watching them. Jane is seated at her desk, working at her computer when outside, a car horn blares. Jane stuffs items into her bag and studies herself in a mirror, shifts to get a good profile of her breasts, then shuffles out of the house, her backpack slung over her shoulder. Lester hurries out the front door, carrying a briefcase. Jane gets in the car, and Lester's briefcase suddenly springs open, spilling papers all over the driveway. He drops to his knees to gather everything as Carolyn looks down at us contemptuously but also bored, as if she gave up expecting anything more long ago. Lester smiles sheepishly, trying to lighten the moment as Carolyn drives with Jane staring out the window and Lester asleep in the back seat. He's later staring at a computer monitor and talking on a headset phone, with a beleaguered expression on his face at odds with the light, friendly tone of his voice. Lester sits at his workstation, a beige cubicle surrounded by identical beige cubicles, when Brad, a dapper man in his thirties, approaches and observes Lester, who is unaware of his presence. Lester disconnects the call, obviously irritated, turns around, and smiles perfunctorily. Brad, seated behind his desk in his big corner office, faces Lester, who sits across from him, looking small and isolated.",
    "861": "Underwater, a French tricolor is visible. A wooden galleon is being hauled into a dry dock in rough seas, listing heavily to its starboard side. Lines of men in the dry dock pull on heavy ropes attached to the ship, with those in the center waist-high in water. Others are positioned at higher levels. The men are scruffy, unshaven prisoners who grunt as they pull in unison, with rough, chained hands moving the rope. A grave-looking man in a blue uniform named Javert watches from above on the quay side, staring intently at one particular prisoner who avoids his gaze. The ship is now in the dock, and the prisoners begin to file out. Javert stops one, the same prisoner he had been watching closely. This tall prisoner, who has a beard, closely-cropped hair, and a stoop, turns back from a broken flagpole on the ground. Another prisoner is stopped from following him. The flagpole is long and thick, and the prisoner heaves, squatting and raising one end onto his shoulder. He struggles to his feet and, grimacing, lumbers forward under Javert's cold gaze. The flag, still attached to the pole, drags through the water as the prisoner reaches Javert and drops the pole. Javert's eyes remain fixed on Valjean, who staggers away from the dry dock. Valjean, using a stout staff, plods across rocky terrain towards a cross on a mountain summit. He passes the cross and looks ahead as the sun begins to rise. He walks up a snow-covered hillside, silhouetted against the skyline, with a satchel over his shoulder. Stepping onto a ledge, he glances at the mountains and stops by a farmer upon seeing men at work. The farmer reads them as Valjean removes his woolen hat. As Valjean leaves, a fleshy-jowled town hall officer speaks to a guard. On the street, children throw stones at Valjean, who later warms his hands at a fire in an inn. Valjean is then attacked outside, punched, and kicked. Wandering through a churchyard, he lies down by the church, where something startles him: a bishop holding a lamp. Valjean frowns, then crouches by a blazing fire and eats at a table, shoveling food. He stops momentarily to stare at the bishop and two women by the table. On his feet, he watches as one woman places silverware in a cupboard. Later, lying in bed, he stares up at the ornate ceiling before going to the cupboard. As the bishop sleeps, Valjean stuffs silverware into his satchel.",
    "877": "Nick gives Paula a look and then takes the plate of spaghetti over to where Kate is sitting at the far end of the table and sets it down in front of her. As Leah and Bernadette hungrily tuck into their food, they watch Nick and Kate, who, while doing a crossword in the paper, sticks a pencil into her neat bun and takes a mouthful of the pasta. She looks up at Nick petulantly as he walks back over to Paula. Kate glares at Nick, then, with a face like thunder, stands up and storms out. In her office, Kate slices a menu in half and gets back to her paperwork. Later, in the busy kitchen, she goes over to Nick, who dips a spoon into a pan and holds it out for Kate to taste, but Kate has her own spoon and walks off. Nick tries the sauce and looks pleased, later stirring another pan. Nick smiles as he chats with Leah, while Kate notices the two of them talking and looks over at them disapprovingly. Leah throws her head back and laughs, causing Nick to catch Kate's eye and hold out a pan offering her a taste of the food he's cooking, but she shakes her head dismissively and wanders off. A selection of mouth-watering desserts are arranged neatly on gleaming, white plates, including a circular chocolate pud garnished with raspberries, a delicate chocolate teardrop topped with a swirl of cream, and an immaculate fruit tart. Kate uses a blowtorch to caramelize a fourth dessert, then turns away from her workspace and almost collides with Nick, who puts a plate down on the worktop and picks up a squeezy bottle of dessert sauce. Kate picks up another bottle and begins to decorate a plate, briefly looking up at him. She picks up a delicate spun-sugar cage and gently positions it over a white chocolate mousse on a bed of sliced strawberries, as Nick watches over her shoulder, unnerving her. She breaks the cage, then picks up the dessert plate and a plate containing a second sugar cage, and moves to the other side of the worktop, as Nick stares at her contemplatively. She walks off to the walk-in fridge, where Bernadette hurries out. Kate leans wearily against a shelving unit and looks up as Nick enters the fridge and walks up to her, but she looks away from him. Nick removes his apron, and they leave the fridge. Kate turns to Leah, who looks back at her pleadingly, and then eyes Nick coolly before turning on the blowtorch. Nick walks off past her as Kate absentmindedly holds the blowtorch to her side, causing a tea towel tucked into her apron to catch fire, which she throws to the floor and stamps out.",
    "1068": "Drover, Magarri, and Goolaj gallop across a plain while Japanese fighters fly over Mission Island. One plane dives down towards it, and squatting in his cell, King George raises his head and looks up. On the beach on the island, Nullah looks skywards as four planes peel away from the mass of fighters and swoop towards him. Sarah walks into the army operations room and looks at Cath with concern, while Nullah continues to stare at the planes. King George stands in his cell as the planes dive towards the children on the beach, and Nullah's eyes widen with fear as he sprints across the beach just as bombs fall on the Mission. A priest hurries to the radio hut, but a plane targets it, and as the bomb obliterates the radio shack, King George looks out through the barred window of his cell. Fletcher signs the contract to buy Faraway Downs, then turns and walks out onto the balcony surrounding his office at the top of a high clock tower. Dutton pauses, hearing the noise as fighters appear in the sky over Darwin. On his balcony, Fletcher watches the approaching black dots in the air as planes peel off from the formation to start their attack. Sarah stands up and slowly removes her headset as she stares out of the window, and then a bomb explodes just outside, engulfing her in smoke, flame, and flying glass. The planes, with the red rising sun on their wings, swoop and dive across the town, as soldiers desperately try to get organized. A bomb bursts outside the prison and fire billows into King George's cell, prompting Captain Dutton to bellow orders as policemen let prisoners out of their cells. Soldiers climb into a truck while King George walks out of the prison. As the soldiers stand helpless in their truck and smoke billows over the town, King George walks slowly out through the burning prison gates. A bomb scores a direct hit on a ship, causing fire and black smoke to erupt from the superstructure, while pillars of fire leap skywards as the bombs fall. King George stands and watches the destruction rage all around him, the old magic-man staring around impassively at the plumes of fire and bomb bursts, as the planes continue to completely obliterate the town. The Drover and Magarri sit on their horses amid the smoke and blazing buildings, with Drover staring in shock at the carnage. Fires blaze in the darkness as a pall of smoke covers the town. The burning building collapses as they ride to find Sarah. The Carney house is ablaze, with firefighters vainly trying to tackle it. Drover's eyes widen in horror as a group of men restrain him from walking into the blaze, and Captain Dutton looks in shock at the stretcher his men brought in.",
    "948": "The shadow of a boy cycling a bike with a dumpy alien in the handlebar basket passes in front of a full moon. A small robot races back and forth through long grass, under a cloudy sky. The robot stops and blinks. Sparks shower in the Lillian Steel Foundry. A detached house on a snowy street has a police car on the drive, and a boy, Joe Lamb, sits on a swing in the garden. He's about 14 and glumly looks down at a locket that he's holding. A wake is being held inside the house. Mr. and Mrs. Kaznyk look at Joe through the window. Some other boys stand by a buffet table. An American 1970s yellow Coupe with a black vinyl roof pulls up outside the house. Joe, from the swing, watches as a good-looking man with shoulder-length blonde hair, Lewis, gets out of the car, glances at Joe, adjusts his hair, and goes into the house. Joe watches as his dad, Jack, bundles Lewis outside and shoves him into the back of the police car on the drive. Jack, a dark-haired man of about 40, sees an apprehensive Joe watching him, then gets in the patrol car and drives it off with its lights flashing. Joe watches as it disappears up the road and looks back down at the locket he's holding before snapping it shut. Excited pupils spill out of Lillian Middle School as it closes for the summer holidays, bicycles are taken out of a bike rack, and Joe is amongst the throng of pupils. One boy from the wake, Charles, comes over to him. Joe looks shocked, as in their movie, a boy, Martin, plays a detective character while another boy, Cary, is a zombie. Martin pulls a gun, but Cary knocks it from his hand. They tussle, and Martin shoves Cary back onto some spikes on the wall, impaling him as blood spills from Cary's mouth while Joe and Charles watch. Joe leaves, and Mr. and Mrs. Kaznyk exchange a look. Outside, Joe cycles across the quiet residential street to his house where Jack's patrol car is on the drive. Joe goes inside, makes his way through the kitchen to the living room, and finds his father weeping in the bathroom and shuts the door on the shocked Joe. Later, Jack and Joe are at a table in Carol's Diner. As they eat, Jack hands Joe a leaflet, and Joe looks unconvinced while Jack takes a pull on a bottle of beer and regards Joe sincerely before turning his attention to the pamphlet.",
    "1035": "Ryan and Kara go to the Sunday School room, where Ryan peers through a window in the door. Inside, Jim is sitting in suit trousers, a white shirt, and a maroon waistcoat, reading a children's book. Ryan turns to Kara, who raises her eyebrows, urging him to go in. Jim looks up from the book, and Ryan shuts the door, his eyes roving before he sits down and shrugs. Jim nods and raises his eyebrows, while Ryan smiles and Kara, watching, smiles back. Kara ushers Jim into the room where Julie sits being consoled by the other bridesmaids. Jim walks over to Julie, kneels down, takes her hands in his, and she smiles and nods before they hug each other. Watching from the doorway, Kara glances at Ryan as an usher hands guests the order of service, and they take their seats in the church. In the vestry, Alex helps Ryan get into his suit, and they sit watching as flower girls walk down the aisle, while Jim stands waiting with the bridesmaids. Everyone looks around as Julie walks down the aisle, arm-in-arm with Jim's uncle, and then Julie and Jim walk up to the priest, who conducts the ceremony. Everyone stands watching as Jim slips the wedding ring onto Julie's finger, and she beams. Ryan sits with Alex's hand in his as Julie and Jim light candles. Jim lifts Julie's veil, they kiss, and everyone applauds as Julie and Jim walk up the aisle, arm-in-arm, with Julie waving her bouquet. Everyone lines up outside for photographs, and later, at the reception, Julie and Jim dance together while guests wave tiny wedding bells. Alex and Ryan smile and laugh together, and Julie and Ryan dance cheek-to-cheek as the dance floor fills. Alex and Ryan dance together, with him pulling a goofy face and falling back into her arms, then they play pat-a-cake. Ryan looks serious and waggles his arms while Alex shimmies from side to side. Julie tosses her bouquet over her shoulder, and one of the bridesmaids catches it. Later, Alex and Ryan slow dance together, and as the guests start to leave, they sit together with Ryan handing Alex a bouquet of flowers, making her crack up. Ryan helps Alex on with her jacket, and they leave. In the hotel lift, Alex and Ryan kiss, and the next day, at the airport, they face each other smiling while holding their wheelie cases. Alex's smile drops for a moment, and she walks off as Ryan watches her head to her Departure gate. In Omaha, Ryan walks along the hall and lets himself into his apartment, stops for a moment in the sparse white room, opens the closet to hang up some shirts, and in the bathroom, puts his toothbrush in a glass. Finally, with Natalie, Ryan walks along a line of cubicles where workers talk to people on video links.",
    "1268": "A blast deflects onto the ceiling, bringing stone beams down onto the stair as Harry steadies himself with a Basilisk fang in hand. Voldemort spots Harry and fires, causing him to fall onto a lower staircase and drop the fang, which Voldemort destroys. Harry then disappears from Voldemort's sight as the Dark Lord dis-apparates. Nagini slithers across a landing, is hit by a stone, and turns to look over the edge of the stairs where Hermione stands alone and throws another stone as Nagini descends. The unconscious Neville comes to, sits up woozily, and is oblivious to the mayhem of battle around him, even as a burning body floats past. He turns his head and sees the Sword of Gryffindor on the ground behind him. Voldemort lands and takes aim as the walkway collapses, causing Harry to drop to the floor below. As Harry scrabbles away, strips of Voldemort's black cloak twist around his wrists and neck, restraining him, and Voldemort reins him in. Nagini advances on Hermione, who retreats with a basilisk fang in hand, while Ron also wielding a fang creeps up the stairs towards the snake, which turns on him, causing him to escape but drop the fang. The snake rears up between Ron and Hermione. In another part of the school, Bellatrix and Ginny are dueling until Molly takes Ginny's place. On a narrow platform, they exchange energy blasts with Bellatrix seemingly having the upper hand, but Molly advances wildly and strikes Bellatrix several times. The stunned Death Eater raises her hands in the air, and Molly wields her wand once more, causing Bellatrix to explode into tiny black fragments, after which Molly grins. On the walkway, Voldemort uses physical strength against Harry, slapping and kicking him as Harry scuttles backwards. High on the ramparts, Harry flings his arms around Voldemort's neck and jumps off the edge with him. They plummet from the heights, struggling for supremacy, clawing at each other and soaring above the school. Harry seems to split Voldemort's head in two, revealing only black smoke, and as they land in the courtyard, they roll away from each other across the cobbles, lying on the ground some distance apart. Energy spent, each crawls towards his wand, with Voldemort reaching the Elder Wand just before Harry reaches his. On their knees, they fire at each other, with a burst of green energy from the Elder Wand meeting a burst of red from Harry, resulting in a bright white ball of light. Inside, Nagini chases Hermione and Ron downstairs, and as they fall, Nagini raises her head with her mouth open.",
    "1284": "Helen and her escort walk past two agents pushing an empty wheelchair towards Klaatu's room as the lift doors slide open. Inside the lift is Klaatu in a wheelchair with four agents, manacled to the chair, and pushed down a passageway with pipes lining one wall. He's pushed into a room where the agent bringing up the rear checks the passageway before entering and closing the door. The room is large, with a man in glasses sitting at a table covered with electronic equipment, and Klaatu is pushed up to the table. Electrodes are placed around his body and attached to his temples, and the operator activates the polygraph. The agents leave the room and join others standing guard outside at regular intervals along the walls of the corridor. The man studies his equipment as the operator stares at the electronic traces on his flickering screen. Klaatu turns to look at the man, while the polygraph operator stares fixedly at his screen through glasses perched on the end of his nose as his screen blurs and distorts. Needles trace wave patterns on scrolling graph paper, and Klaatu eyes the interrogator steadily. The man returns his stare with a frown, then reaches out to his console, and is thrown backwards by the charge. Half lying under the table, he twitches, then slowly slides back upright, staring blankly. Klaatu focuses his vision down the electrode cables, wiring to a security camera overlooking an agent standing guard, then channels through to another camera and another guard. Two more suited agents walk along the corridor as Klaatu closes his eyes. The agents clamp their hands over their earpieces, and all collapse to the floor in agony. Still seated but wearing a suit, Klaatu looks up as the lights flicker and the power fluctuates all over the building. Helen looks up in alarm, then puts on her coat and grabs the sample of Klaatu's fatty outer skin. The alien, now standing, turns to the catatonic polygraph operator sitting in his underwear, removes the electrodes, and the operator collapses on the table. Klaatu strides down the corridor past the agents who are still writhing in agony while Helen, glancing around warily, runs down a corridor full of shadows cast by the flickering lights. Klaatu enters the lift, walks down a railway line in an industrial area, with flame flaring from a stack at a refinery behind him, and arrives on a railway station platform. In slow motion, he walks alongside a train, then into the busy station concourse. He walks calmly through the teeming crowds and looks up at the departures board where all the trains are delayed. A guy with a beard jostles through the crowd and snatches a ticket from a man's pocket as he brushes past him.",
    "447": "The raincoats swaying slowly. The camera approaches one of them. From the pocket projects a bottle of whiskey. He is wiping his parched mouth. He puts the handkerchief back. He fishes the coat check from his pocket, buries it in his fist, fighting the foolish impulse. He rises and, to the irritation of his neighbors, leaves his seat amid some disapproving shushings from the row behind. He puts the check on the counter. The attendant looks up from a newspaper. The attendant takes the check and leaves. Don rolls his program and sticks it into the sand of the cuspidor. The attendant returns. The attendant holds a short leopard coat and a lady's small umbrella. Don looks. Don's nervousness is mounting. He is biting his lips, unable to find another argument. He shoves the leopard coat and umbrella close to Don. The attendant has returned to the other end of the counter and resumed his doze. He takes his coat rather brusquely, thrusts the leopard coat at her. Don takes the coat, feels it hurriedly to make sure the bottle is still there, and starts away. Helen is left with the leopard coat and his bowler. Don comes back, takes the hat, starts away again. His patience exhausted, Don stops again, takes the umbrella and tosses it in Helen's direction. Helen, who is getting into her coat, can't catch it. It falls right next to her. Don stands abashed. He goes back, picks up the umbrella. As they go on talking, they walk from the cloak room, through the vestibule, to the street, Don carrying his coat over his arm. There is a split second of indecision but it is ended by Don's awareness of the bottle in his raincoat. He is unfurling his raincoat in order to put it on before he steps from under the marquee. Helen is about a step and a half away when there is a crash. On the sidewalk lies the pint of whiskey, broken. She stops and looks down, as does Don. She goes. Don looks at the broken bottle, then after Helen. With sudden decision he calls after her. It is dark and the rain has settled to a drizzle. He joins her, takes the umbrella out of her hand and holds it over them both as they go down the street. As we have left it, empty save for Nat and Don. Sunlight outside. Nat is now taking the chairs from the tables and arranging the bar for the afternoon and evening trade, while Don leans back against the bar, the jigger of whiskey in his hand, and goes on talking. Don drinks. It is filled with the routine activity of a big commercial hotel on a hot summer day.",
    "264": "Gale and Evelle, both covered in blue, are screaming in rage, fear, and incomprehension as blue dollar bills snap and flutter around the inside of the car. The car is swerving wildly as Gale drives blind, with the inside of the windshield covered with blue paint. He reaches forward to wipe clear a patch of windshield, and as the blue paint is smeared away, we see Hi and Ed's car parked broadside in the middle of the road. Hi and Ed are in front of it, with Hi aiming his scatter gun and Ed a revolver. Ed runs over to Gale and Evelle's car, throws open the back door to look for the baby, but comes out only with Dr. Spock's Baby and Child Care. Evelle is staggering around in shock, looking in disbelief at his own blue body. Hi and Ed climb into their car and peel out. Sitting placidly in his car seat in the middle of the road in front of a bank is Nathan Jr. As the camera focuses on Nathan Jr., it booms up to show the empty street beyond him while the crack of return fire and furiously squealing brakes are heard, culminating in a loud explosion that snaps off the siren wail. The police car is apparently history, and beyond the crest of the road ahead, a ball of flame has leapt up with the explosion. As the explosion echoes and fades, the deep rumble of an approaching engine is heard, and Lenny Smalls' motorcycle appears over the rise. Framed against fire and smoke, he is coming directly toward us and the baby. As they top a rise from the other direction, we see the baby sitting in the middle of the street, with Lenny fast approaching from the background. The extremely low wide shot, locked down to the speeding bike, shows us rushing toward the rear of Nathan Jr.'s car seat. With a clank of chains, Lenny's hand drops down into frame, palm forward, tensing to scoop up the car seat that we are almost upon. In a low shot with Nathan Jr. in the foreground, he is scooped up and out of frame as Lenny roars by. Roaring along, Lenny hooks the car seat over his handlebars. Approaching, Lenny saws a shotgun out of his back holster and levels it at the oncoming car, sighting down the gun and swinging it around as he approaches the car. The shotgun spits orange flame, and the windshield explodes in as Lenny roars by, with the baby on the handlebars in the foreground and the road rushing by beyond him. The bike banks into a hard turn, shooting through where the windshield used to be, cutting in at the end of the skid as the car rocks to a halt.",
    "603": "Draco is in a cluttered room, he pauses, looks around, tossing an apple, and turns as he hears creaking behind him. He hauls down a heavy cloth cover, revealing a tall triangular cabinet similar to the one in Borgin and Burke shop, and studies it closely. A lone student flies over the Quidditch stadium as Harry and Ginny stand facing the Gryffindor triallists, who all turn toward them. Ron stands stiffly wearing a protective leather helmet, and from the stands, Hermione waves to him. Cormac swaggers up to Ron, catches a fly, slaps Ron's arm, and marches off, leaving Ron looking miserable. Cormac flies confidently towards a circular goalpost as Ron almost slips off his broomstick heading for the opposing goal, watched closely by Lavender. Cormac smirks, catching Hermione's eye, and she glances away, then back as the trials begin and two players collide and fall. Holding a round leather Quaffle, Ginny aims it at Cormac's goal; he punches it away with his right hand, kicks another, and punches a third with his left hand before grabbing hold of the next Quaffle. It's Ron's turn to protect his goal; he punches and kicks out wildly, deflecting shots, but a Quaffle unseats him, leaving him dangling from the end of his broomstick as Lavender gets up on her feet rooting for him. Ron regains his seat on the broomstick, and watched by Hermione, clings on anxiously as two chasers zoom past Harry and Cormac smirks confidently. Hermione whispers into her hand, smiles as Cormac is jerked sideways, and the Quaffle flies past him through the goal. A Quaffle aimed at Ron hits his head and bounces away as he swings helplessly. In the Gryffindor common room, Hermione pulls a face as Ron glances at Lavender, who waves to him and glares at Ron. Harry closes it and gets up, Ginny grabs it from him, Hermione and Ginny stare at Harry who shifts awkwardly, Ginny tosses the book back, and Harry walks away as both girls watch him leave. In his room, Harry sits at a table with the book open in front of him, notes scribbled all over its pages. Walking in the snow, Flitwick passes the trio near the Three Broomsticks where Harry sees Draco, who walks out. Ron spots Ginny with Dean Thomas, Hermione looks over at them as Ginny and Dean kiss at their corner table. Ron turns, clenches his jaw, scowls at Harry, leans on the table, raises his eyebrows, glances at Hermione, and points to his upper lip. Hermione wipes the butterbeer froth from her lip with her sleeve, then gazes at Ron, and on the way back, Leanne and Katie are walking ahead of them.",

The PATH over the SUMMIT is in FULL VIEW of the ORCS. FRODO stays CLOSE to the ROCK WALL, masked by SHADOWS. Behind FRODO, SHELOB APPEARS! With hideous STEALTH, she follows FRODO. FRODO slowly climbing the STONE STAIRS, his GAZE and CONCENTRATION on the ORC TOWER. Behind him, SHELOB lurches into a HORRIBLE SCUTTLE down the SHEER ROCK FACE. FRODO suddenly senses the LURKING MALICE. He SPINS AROUND: Before he can react, SHELOB VICIOUSLY STABS FRODO in the NECK with her monstrous abdominal STINGER! FRODO instantly goes LIMP.

    "291": "Jeff is sitting on the wheelchair near the bar, a drink in his hand. He starts to take a sip from the glass when Lisa comes out of the kitchen. She is an ethereal beauty, in a sheer peach nightgown, covered by a gossamer matching kimono. She turns gracefully in front of Jeff, and he lowers his drink. Instead of increasing her sobbing, this news quiets, momentarily, the woman who owned the dog. Her hands go down to the railing of the fire escape, gripping it fiercely. The guests at the songwriter's party begin to move silently back to the studio apartment, and the people move off their balcony into the apartment. The woman almost screams at the people now, as she looks up at the apartment. The husband leans over the fire escape and motions Miss Lonely Hearts to place the dog in the basket, which is already lowered. Miss Lonely Hearts puts the dog in the basket and watches as the husband draws it slowly up. The dog moves closer to the fire escape, slowly, the husband pulling the rope in hand over hand. The dog reaches the fire escape, and the husband tenderly takes it out of the basket. She breaks out sobbing anew and returns to her apartment and out of sight, the crying growing fainter with her retreat. He turns to carry it into the apartment. The newlyweds draw their shades again. The landlord moves away from the window. Miss Torso goes back to her apartment. Miss Hearing Aid turns down the volume of her hearing aid and goes back to her apartment. Jeff and Lisa are at the window, and he is holding one of her hands. Jeff speaks without looking up. Thorwald's apartment. The only light that can be seen in it is the glowing end of a cigar in the center of the room, back from the window -- as if Thorwald was sitting quietly on his sofa, smoking. Lisa looks down at Jeff. He nods solemnly and then turns back to the window, as both he and Lisa look again towards the dark apartment, with only the unmoving glow of a cigar showing in the center. Thorwald's apartment. Jeff, Stella, and Lisa are grouped at the window, looking out. The camera is behind them. Jeff holds the long-focus lens to his eye. In the bathroom, Thorwald is wiping the enameled wall with a damp cloth. He rubs at particular spots now and then. We see the upper part of the bedroom window, belonging to Thorwald. The lower part of the window is covered by a wall. Over this, we hear. Jeff lowers the camera with a long-focus lens. We now see their faces. Neither he nor Lisa makes any comment.",
    "1304": "Mathison puts down his shopping bags and moves to her, kneels down, and gestures for the bundle of sweatshirts in her arms. The woman smiles for the first time and hands him the wrapped child. The doctor lowers the baby to his lap and unwraps him while the woman, unable to see her baby, watches Dr. Mathison as he looks down and examines her child. The doctor finally glances up, looking shaken, and makes eye contact with the woman for only a second, causing a chill to go through her body. He looks to the three saleswomen in the room, his hard stare unsettling them, and the older saleswoman speaks up. Everyone becomes very still, the mother looks like she stopped breathing, and the baby screams. The doctor whispers something we can't hear, looks up to the saleswoman who brought him in, and Mathison turns back to the mother. The woman looks over the one being offered and then points to the Sports Illustrated peeking out of the seat pocket, and David pulls the magazine out and gives it to her. David waits until the opposing train passes. The woman goes back to her magazine, and Kelly looks up from her Sports Illustrated, her striking blue eyes gazing at David. She holds up her hand, taps the diamond ring on her finger, leading to an awkward silence. Kelly gets up, balances herself against a headrest as the train rumbles, and starts to the back of the car, leaving David sitting alone looking like he's drowning, but there's no water. David feels a stare, glancing up to see the little girl spying on him from between the seats. He leans towards the window to avoid eye contact, his hand reaching into his coat to slide out his wedding band, which he puts back on. The vibration of the train begins to lull his eyes closed, and his head bounces lightly against the window, but the shaking of the glass never allows his eyes to completely close. He sits up when he realizes the shaking is getting stronger and looks out the window, where the scenery blurs as it flies by. David turns, noticing some of the other passengers reacting as the train picks up speed, with the normal bumps of the tracks becoming amplified and the train going faster. David's eyes move to the seat in front of him to find the little girl no longer watching him. David looks to the passengers across from him, seeing the ground slowly drop away in the windows behind them as a boy, age ten, sits on his head on the family couch and watches television upside down, his floppy brown hair spreading out in a circle in front of his red face.",
    "373": "Young Jenny Hill watches barefoot Edward leave Spectre for the first time. Finally realizing who this woman is, before he can say anything more, Edward pulls the door shut behind him as he leaves, but it breaks off in his hands. Inside, Jenny looks out, surprised and annoyed. Edward tries to lift the door back on the hinges, but they snap off. The door frame buckles and the whole shack creaks. He tries to lean the door against the frame, but it keeps slipping. He leans the door a different way; it holds for a beat then falls in, smashing a small table. Karl pushes against the side of the house until it fits. Holding nails between his lips, Edward puts in new windows himself, a white picket fence. In every detail, it is impossibly charming. Edward is screwing a hat rack into the wall in the foyer while Jenny leans against the doorframe, listening to his story and watching him with deepest affection. Finished with his work, he takes his hat off the chair and hangs it on the rack. Perfect. A look between them. With that last job done, there's no reason for him to be staying any longer. Does she really mean it? She comes closer, but Edward holds his ground. She takes his hand, lifting his hat up to the peg. She's very close—just a half-inch from kissing him when—Edward gently holds her back. She freezes, stunned and humiliated, then pulls away. With that, he begins to leave. She finds a pen and hastily signs the deed to the house, handing it to him. With a look, he thanks her, then goes. Edward takes a final look at this perfect little town. He climbs in his car and starts the engine. As we watch, the swamp begins to overtake the house, swallowing it in a tangle of vines and mossy branches. Shoots burst up through the planks in the porch. Snakes slither through the marsh. Day becomes night. Will and Jenny are still sitting at her table, a pitcher of iced tea between them. Will smiles to hear it called that. Jenny is working herself into more of a state by not talking. Angle on Will, sorting through his swirling thoughts, he turns to see his wife at a payphone. She hangs up. She was calling him. How can she answer? He half-smiles, realizing the idiocy of his question. Of course, his father's not going to be okay. Dr. Bennett smiles as he checks Edward's chart. A long silence, just the sounds of the hospital, doctors being paged. Will half-smiles. Patting Will's shoulder, Dr. Bennett leaves. We stay on Will and his father for a long time, then Will takes his pen and starts making a list.",

Other owners look at John, and with a smile, the tanned bikini beauty unclips the leash on her pet boxer. Others follow suit and a huge Rottweiler charges into the surf. John grins as the dogs play together in the shallows and more join the fun. An owner throws a Frisbee for his border collie. John grins as the dogs splash around. Bikini girl looks concerned. Marley is circling in the shallows, preparing to poop. Other owners watch in horror. The big Rottweiler owner closes his eyes in shocked disbelief as John lunges for Marley. The big man summons the Rottweiler and a police 4x4 noses onto the beach. The officers, in shorts and ball caps, get out of the vehicle. At night, John arrives home in the Volvo with Marley. Marley and John enter the darkened house. Grinning with embarrassed delight, John scoops up Connor as his two boys run forward to greet him. Jenny comes forward, holding Colleen and kisses him and brings in a huge square cake covered in candles. Marley immediately puts his paws on the table and starts eating the cake. The pool is covered with floating flower candles. John feeds Marley cake. She takes off her dress and grins, naked, in front of him. He grins as she takes a running jump into the pool. He unbuttons his shirt. He cannonballs in, surfaces and swims towards her. As they cuddle naked, Marley swims past. John's putting items from his desk into a box. He hefts the box under his arm and walks towards Arnie, who's standing outside his office. He pats Arnie on the shoulder and the older man leans forward and gives him a half hug. John walks away, grinning. Their people carrier drives through green fields and lush woodland. Marley is leaning out of the window as the Grogans drive down a country road. Marley bounds up the steps to the large stone-built house and headbutts a stone bird table. He knocked the table off the porch. John's at his desk in the cavernous offices of the Philadelphia Inquirer daily news. John joins the kids and Marley at the bedroom window. Huge garden is covered in snow. They all pile outside wrapped up for the cold. A snowball fight starts, then Jenny and John pull the children on a sledge while Marley trots alongside. Little Colleen falls off. Marley attacks their snowman. John looks at his wife, then they smile and hug. John walks upstairs and switches off the lights. He looks in on sleeping Colleen, then checks on the boys in their bunks.",
    "1376": "Ron gasps as Hermione storms off, and Harry is walking up some steps. He reaches the top and bumps into Cho who has come around the corner. Ron is being helped into the room, looking shaky, and he shakes his head as the Patil twins walk past. Ron gets dressed in front of a mirror, looking panicked and uncomfortable in his ridiculous dress robes. Harry walks in dressed in a more conventional suit and sniffs at his clothes. Harry and Ron walk down the stairs into the hall, with Ron fidgeting with his outfit, and they approach the Patil twins. Hermione enters the room all dressed up, walks down the stairs, and Viktor Krum takes her hand as they walk together and dance. Soon others join in, including Dumbledore and McGonagall, Mr. Filch and his cat, and Hagrid and Madame Maxime, while Mad-Eye Moody sits on the sidelines drinking. The crowd is jumping, but Harry, Ron, and their dates sit some distance away looking miserable. Hermione comes up after a great time with Viktor and then walks off. Harry walks up, and he and Ron walk away. They return to the old house, where a sleeve is rolled up to reveal a marking of a skull and snake on the arm, and Harry wakes up. Floorboards creak as someone walks up to his bed, and he chuckles and dances off. Harry nods as he takes his clothes off and gets in the bath, with his golden egg on the side. The ghostly figure of little Myrtle flies around, gets in the water, and laughs, embarrassing Harry. Mad-Eye Moody appears in the doorway as Neville emerges from behind a bookcase. The Weasley twins shout and take bets as Harry walks along with Neville, carrying green plant life in hand. Harry puts the gillyweed in his mouth and starts choking when the cannon fires and the champions enter the water, with three diving in while Harry is pushed. Underwater, the effects of gillyweed take hold, making Harry's hands and feet webbed. Harry flies into the air like a dolphin to the crowd’s cheers, then swims among the fish and rocks, still searching. He finds Ron, Hermione, Cho Chang, and a blonde girl from Beauxbatons tied by their ankles. Cedric takes Cho with him, and Harry sets about freeing Ron and Hermione as vicious merpeople appear. What looks like a shark approaches at high speed, but it has legs, revealing it's Viktor, who takes Hermione and heads for the surface.",
    "63": "At this question, he rises and looks through the doorway. Escobar sees him and ignores him. Evelyn looks up to see Gittes standing in the doorway only a foot or two from her, and she stops cold. Escobar is right at her back. They look at one another for a long moment, and Gittes says nothing. She finishes, looks plaintively at Gittes, and Evelyn nods slightly as Escobar coughs. Gittes picks up the sheet and pulls it back, revealing eyes open and a face that is badly cut and bruised. They begin to walk slowly, and again have to move out of the way as some other corpse is being wheeled out of one of the Coroner cubicles. Morty is wheeling in another body with the help of an assistant. Morty pulls back the sheet, brushes some sand from the man's face, and laughs. As he begins to move the body into the refrigerator, he breaks into a wrenching spasm of coughing and Morty shrugs. The Boy doesn't answer, but then nods. The horse snorts, and The Boy rides slowly on. Gittes scrambles up the embankment to note the direction the storm drain by Hollenbeck Bridge takes. It is headed above toward the Hollywood Hills, where the sun is setting, along the flood channel. It is dark now and Gittes follows the channel with the car spotlight. The road is dirt, with heavy clusters of oak trees and eucalyptus everywhere. Another turn reveals a pie-shaped view of a lake of lights in the city below, over the road, bolted. He turns at a fork in the road which allows him to continue following the flood channel. The road is narrower and Gittes drives more slowly. The chain-link itself actually extends over the flood channel and down into it, making access along the channel itself impossible. Gittes backs up, turns off the motor, the car lights, and the spotlight. Alone light overhead on tension wires is the sole illumination. Gittes gets out of the car, clubs the fence near the Flood channel itself. Lights from the reservoir still higher above can be seen. Gittes carefully works his way up through the thick foliage toward a second and large chain-link fence. He dives into the flood control channel, which is at this point about four feet deep and six feet wide. Gittes loses himself among the ivy in the channel and starts to lift his head to catch the direction. Then he's inundated with a rush of water which pours over him, knocks off his hat, and carries him down the channel, banging into its banks, as he desperately tries to grab some of the overgrowth to hang on and pull himself out, but the force of the stream batters him and carries him with it until he's brought rudely to the chain-link fence.",

He then stands watching a row of lockers, where Yayo, now soaked with sweat, is still here, and he stares at one of them as we push in. He starts to move for it, then looks off, and we tilt down to her ankle, noticing a bulge, while we quickly tilt down to the guy's ankle, noticing a similar bulge. She is dressed casually in slacks and a blouse, tapping to some unheard rhythm with what looks like a bulge near the ankle. He lights a cigarette, looks off screen, and freezes as Yayo leans against the railing, giving a look at the Bear. Bo Catlett leans on the railing, looking down at Yayo again, and Bear looks at him as Chili points to a star on the map. They both look to the front door where a tall, skinny woman with wild, jet-black hair stands. Karen starts to answer, but Nicki is already hustling Chili inside, and Chili steps inside to check out some photographs, most of which are of Martin. Way off in the background, there is a view of the huge backyard, which somehow makes Karen feel better. Chili follows her gaze, and we see that he hugs her and hangs on, leaving Nicki and Chili standing there like idiots, while Karen fights a smile, and Nicki nods solemnly. A gardener blows leaves as Martin's extensive photography collection lines the walls, done in cracked oils, the whole bit, while Martin, Karen, and Chili all sit on white couches. Martin is checking out Karen, nodding, and brings his hand back, nodding, lost in thought, while Karen looks like she wants to throw up, ready to give up. Martin cracks himself up, and Karen and Chili crack up with him, Karen leaning into Chili, as Chili watches the movie star hunch over, narrowing his shoulders but keeps looking at Martin. Karen shakes her head as for a few moments he holds his hands together in front of him, getting a shifty look in his eyes, and she looks away, fighting a smile. Karen watches as Martin stares at Chili, his expression gradually becoming deadpan and sleepy, and Martin nods, giving Chili a nice dead-eyed look, while Chili exchanges a look with Karen, who sits back now thoroughly enjoying Chili's manipulation of Martin. Chili sits back, and Karen is starting to enjoy Chili's handling of Martin, as she looks at Martin and shakes her head, then looks at Chili as he sits back, while Martin looks at Chili. Harry looks up to see Bo Catlett, dressed up as usual, standing there with the Bear, who is wearing a Hawaiian shirt.",
    "15": "Lester, still listening, looks like he's about to implode. Jane covers her ears and starts singing to drown her out. Jane's singing stops, and panicked, Lester scurries down the hall. Angela crosses to the window and looks out. We see Angela standing at the window in her underwear, looking down at us. We're across from Jane's window, looking in. We zoom toward her, even as Angela poses in the window; we're clearly not interested in Angela. Finally, we settle on the small make-up mirror where we see a reflection of Jane, back at her computer. Ricky sits in darkness with his digicam, videotaping. She's smiling. Then suddenly the drapes close and she's gone. He lowers the camera and smiles, then something below catches his attention. Through a window on the side of the Burnham's garage door, we see Lester, still in his suit, digging through shelves against the back wall. Lester digs through stuff stored on the shelves, searching for something as if his very life depended on it. Suddenly we hear someone trying to open a locked door. Moving swiftly, Ricky pulls the drapes shut and switches on a light. His room is a haven of high-tech. A state-of-the-art multimedia computer crowds his desk, and high-end stereo and video equipment line the shelves, as well as hundreds of CDs. There is easily twenty thousand dollars worth of equipment in this room. Ricky opens the door. The Colonel stands outside, eyeing him. The Colonel holds out a small plastic cup with a cap. He disappears down the hall. Ricky smiles, shuts and locks his door. He puts the plastic cup on the shelf, then crosses to a mini refrigerator in the corner of his room and takes out a cup-sized Tupperware container from the freezer, already filled with urine, albeit frozen, and places it on a saucer to thaw overnight. Carolyn lies sleeping. Lester is awake, staring at the ceiling. After a moment, he gets up, taking care not to disturb Carolyn, and walks toward the bathroom. The room is filled with steam. Lester looks around, confused, then focuses on: Across from us, in a pedestal bathtub, is Angela. Rose petals float on the surface of the water, obscuring her naked body. Lester kneels by the bathtub like a man in church. She arches her back and looks up at him provocatively. Lester gives her a hard look, then slowly slips his hand into the water between her legs. Her eyes widen and she throws her head back. Close on Carolyn, her eyes wide, listening to the rhythmic brush of Lester's hand as he masturbates under the covers. She flips over and faces him. Carolyn gets out of bed, repelled.",
    "1064": "At dawn, an orange glow silhouettes two people and a tree. His grandfather grabs his fishing pole as the boy lies wide-eyed on the bottom while a White man in a suit falls face-first into the water. The man floats lifelessly over the boy, his blood staining the water, and then sinks to the bottom. The boy breaks the surface and sees a horse panicking in the water, reaches out, and the horse swims towards him, allowing him to stroke its muzzle. He climbs on the horse's back, urging it out of the water. Wearing only shorts, with his long hair streaming, he rides through a dusty landscape with thinly spread trees and rocky crags, continuing through a settlement of wood buildings and animal pens. Bonfire smoke mixes with the dust in the air, and an animal skull hangs from a dry branch. Spotting an overloaded truck approaching, he dismounts and looks worried, sprinting through the settlement called Faraway Downs. He hides in a water tank as a man tries to grab the horse, peeking through a crack as an elegant woman in a bonnet and long coat strides towards the house. A woman rides a horse, and a car pulls up at a large country house while a man in a bowler hat gets out. She frowns, her blue eyes glittering, and screws up a telegram, later looking out of an airplane window at a port with a moored ship. A red-bearded speaker is sent sprawling, making the rough-looking crew in a bar nervous; Drover downs a drink and up-ends his glass as an Aboriginal man approaches, while the pipe-smoking barman glares. Coolly, the barman closes the sealing doors as Drover is busy with Bull with the red beard. Meanwhile, Sarah marshals her porters, brushing past disdainfully and striding on. Drover is thrown over the bar but comes up swinging, with the brawl in full swing as Sarah approaches the pub. As she walks in, the fight spills out the back. Upon entering the pub, she notices the barman's raised truncheon and an old drunk in the corner. The barman rolls his eyes as she heads for the door, walking out just as Drover hurls Bull into her luggage. They hit each other with the suitcases, one bursts, sending underwear flying. Carney watches with binoculars as she approaches in horror through the brawlers, rubberneckers, and flying undies. Drover breaks a case over his opponent's head, and Bull goes down. Sarah looks appalled at the exhausted Drover as his black friend gestures that she is behind him.",
    "247": "Brett still can't speak, and Jules savagely tips the card table over, removing the barrier between himself and Brett, who now sits like a political prisoner in front of an interrogator. Jules takes his .45 and presses the barrel hard into Brett's cheek as Brett regresses on the spot. Jules' eyes go to Vincent, who smirks, leading Jules to roll his eyes and shoot Brett in the shoulder. The two men then empty their guns at the same time on the sitting Brett. We fade up on Butch Coolidge, a white, 26-year-old prizefighter, who sits at a table wearing a red and blue high school athletic jacket. Talking to him off-screen is everybody's boss, Marsellus Wallace. A hand lays an envelope full of money on the table in front of Butch, who picks it up. Vincent Vega looks really cool behind the wheel of a 1964 cherry red Chevy Malibu convertible. The front entrance is unlocked, revealing the Dapper Dan fellow inside: English Dave. Vincent, carrying the black briefcase from the scene with Jules, steps inside, and English Dave slams the door in our faces. The spacious club is empty this time of day as English Dave crosses to the bar with Vince following. Butch shakes hands with a huge figure with his back to us, the infamous and as of yet still unseen Marsellus. English Dave smiles to himself and puts Vince's coffee in front of him. Butch does a slow turn toward Vincent, and as he turns his body, Vincent walks forward out of frame, never giving Butch another glance, before hugging and kissing the obscured figure that is Marsellus. Butch wisely decides that since this asshole is a friend of Marsellus, he better let it go for now and is snapped out of his ass-kicking thoughts. He pays English Dave and walks out of the shot. A woman who seems to have a fondness for earrings, with both ears pierced five times, and rings in her lips, eyebrows, and nose, is seen. Jody, Vincent, and a young woman named Trudi sit at the kitchen table of a suburban house in Echo Park. Vince has been letting the conversation go through one ear and out the other until the last remark catches his attention. Jody looks at him and states something as if it were the most obvious thing in the world, then continues talking to Trudi, leaving Vincent to ponder the truth of her statement. Vincent takes out a roll of money large enough to choke a horse to death and his case of works (utensils for shooting up) as he cooks his heroin.",
    "1202": "John walks down the front path of the house with a pool and palm trees at the front, where there's a large new car in the driveway. He unsmilingly bends down and picks the newspapers up off the drive. Holding a baby, he snaps at Marley, who's paws up on the breakfast table and taking an interest in Patrick's food. John frowns at the implication, and the moment's captured on camera. He arrives back home at night, driving his old blue Honda and parks up behind their new people carrier. Gloomily, he glances up, and through a window, sees Jenny holding the baby with Marley bouncing around, playfully. He leans back thoughtfully in the driving seat. Jenny spots him sitting in the car and gestures to him, asking if he's actually going to come indoors. He gets reluctantly out of the car. He sits with a blank expression. Jenny and Patrick sit glumly side by side at the table as John goes and sees to the baby. Marley is next to Patrick, eyeing his food, as she's trying to wrestle a book away from him. John shakes his head as Marley savages the book. Later, Jenny tucks the baby into his cot, then goes over to kiss Patrick, who's snug in his little bed. She shuts the blinds and leaves the room, easing the door closed behind her. She walks softly on bare feet to her and John's room, where Marley is lying on the bed. She puts a pillow next to the dog and lies down on her back. Marley lies with his head in her lap, gently wagging his tail. She claps her hands to her face in frustration and stomps to the boys' room as Marley blunders excitedly from one window to another, knocking over a lamp and pulling down a blind in the process. She puts the baby in his high chair, and Marley knocks Patrick over. John gets home, and Marley's chewing a toy on the sofa. He hands a bag of dog food to Sebastian. There's a pile of boxes, and he looks out of the window at the city as Sebastian nods awkwardly. Back home, Jenny's dozing on the sofa when John walks in. He sits opposite her, and she eyes him, shaking her head. He smiles quizzically at her. Jenny's holding a newborn baby, smiling as a nurse pushes her in a wheelchair. Colleen sleeps in a swinging seat as the rest of the family and Marley play ball in the pool. He picks up the phone in the kitchen and walks back outside wearing a towel. John runs on the beach with Marley, and they jog past a tanned young woman in a skimpy bikini. John stops for a breather.",
    "945": "They step into their cabin, where champagne is on ice. Watson sees a woman with the conductor in the corridor, then turns back to Mary, who is smiling as she hands it over. The train speeds through the night, clouds of steam and smoke belching from its funnel as it races along. In their compartment, Watson and Mary are kissing, but they move apart as a steward with a bottle of wine enters. As the steward slides the door shut, the lights go out, and he draws a knife and lunges at Watson. Watson grapples with the steward, while Mary gets Watson's gun and aims it at the steward's hand. Watson opens the exterior compartment door and grabs the steward by the scruff, throwing him off the train. Mary sits, and Watson takes the gun from her hand, puts his finger to his lips, and then opens the door to the corridor. He sees the woman, who was wanting to use the onboard lavatory while at the station, punch a couple of the soldiers and then shoot two more. The woman is Holmes in a bad disguise. As Watson holds off the soldiers in the corridor, Holmes looks out of the open exterior door and shoves her out of the carriage as they go over a bridge. Watson shuts the door to the corridor and sees Mary has gone. Watson looks out of the window, then at Holmes. As Watson grapples with Holmes, he rips his blouse off as soldiers come in, one aiming a rifle at Watson. Holmes remembers back to earlier, applying lipstick in the corridor as the conductor walks past him while he stands outside the lavatory. Watson watches the exchange. In it, Holmes looks through a grill into the next carriage and sees the soldiers readying their guns. He takes the chain of the cistern, then removes one of the taps from the basin and uses it to open the cover on a gas valve. Holmes decants phosphorous into a container and opens the gas valve, leaving the loo just as the train enters a tunnel. In the darkness, Holmes placed phosphorous dust over the soldier, replaced a cartridge in one of the men's bandoliers with his lipstick, and shoved the lipstick case into the muzzle of one of the men's rifles. In the present, the soldier with the rifle pulls the trigger, causing the gun to explode and set fire to the other soldier's phosphorous-dusted clothes. Holmes sets a booby-trap on the door and removes his skirt. Bare-chested, Holmes climbs out of the compartment and shims along the side of the carriage, followed by Watson. They edge their way along the train as a soldier makes his way into Watson's compartment, unwittingly triggering the booby-trapped grenade.",
    "566": "Behind him, six more men in black, all wearing black suits and sunglasses, come over the hill, and Kay barks a few orders to them. He holds up the neuralyzer, and the agents peer closely at it. Kay reaches into his pocket, puts on his own black sunglasses, and pushes a button on the side of the neuralyzer. A blinding flash, a tenth of a second long, sears the agents' eyeballs, and they stare blankly. Kay gestures behind him, where the men in black are now using fire extinguishers to douse the flames they themselves started, and the agents look around, confused. Dee has moved away from them all and is sitting on a rock, staring up at the night sky, his sunglasses dangling idly from one hand. Kay steps away from the group and finds him, sitting down next to him. He looks up at the million stars shining overhead and pulls his neuralyzer from his pocket, looking down at it. These belong to James Edwards, a NYC cop in undercover street clothes. In the background, about ten feet behind, are two other cops trying to keep up, but Edwards is a lot faster. A pair of feet running belongs to a man we will know as the perpetrator. A new set of feet comes into frame as they run down the bridge that traverses Park Avenue in the low forties. The Perp veers to the left and, seemingly oblivious to the fact that it's a thirty-foot drop, he hurdles the guard rail and drops to Forty-first Street below. Edwards is surprised by this maneuver but doesn't waste a second. A double-decker bus, one of those cheesy sightseers that hold up midtown traffic, appears as he too hurdles the guard rail and lands on it. The bus, of course, is completely filled with Japanese tourists, and it seems like every single one of them has a video camera. Edwards pushes through the crowd and pulls out his badge that hangs from a chain under his shirt. Edwards is about to slap the cuffs on the Perp when the Perp blinks. Edwards is thrown for a moment, which is all the time the Perp needs to pull out his weapon, which is the strangest-looking gun you've ever seen. Reacting quickly, Edwards bats it out of the Perp's hand, and the weapon smashes into the stone wall surrounding Central Park and shatters into a million pieces. WHOMP! The Perp kicks him in the nuts, then scrambles to his feet and takes off again. Edwards staggers after him, in pain. The Perp leaps over a moving car towards the Guggenheim Museum; Edwards tries to follow, but a bus pulls in front of him. After it passes, the Perp is gone.",
    "292": "Finally, Stella blurts out as Lisa turns away from the window, and Stella also turns, interrupting her. Jeff, who is still staring out the window, has a look of sudden discovery on his face and calls quickly, turning halfway around and pointing. We see Lisa moving behind him toward the shelf as he adds, then he turns back to the window, holding out his right hand to the side, waiting for the box and viewer. The camera pulls back a little as Lisa comes up and places the box and viewer in his hand. Jeff opens the box, which contains color slides, and holds one or two of the slides up to the light as Lisa looks down at him curiously and Stella comes forward from the background. He squints out through the viewer, then looks away a moment without it before looking back through the viewer. Jeff takes the viewer from his eye, hands it to Lisa, who raises it to her eye. Through the viewer, we see the identical view out of the window, then the viewer moves away, and we are left with the same scene but not quite so still, as a slight breeze stirs the foliage. Jeff looks up to a puzzled Lisa, and all three ease back in awe as Lisa, still looking out, says something. Suddenly Stella begins to chuckle, but her face sobers as she answers their unasked question while Jeff looks at Stella. Halfway through Lisa's speech, Jeff begins speaking, and Lisa suddenly appears at the ground floor door below Thorwald's, hiding and pressing back against the wall tensely. In the corridor above, Thorwald returns frustrated and comes out onto the fire escape directly above Lisa, who is aware of him and immediately retreats into the doorway, disappearing down the lower corridor as Thorwald searches his fire escape. There is a sigh of relief from both of them, and Jeff hands something to her as Stella's brow knits a little, seeing something, and she reaches for the long-focus lens. She lifts it to her eye and opens a small brown bottle, taking out four red capsules which she places on the white tablecloth of her little table in Miss Lonely Hearts' apartment, where a candle burns in a holder, and other lamps also light the apartment. Miss Lonely Hearts is dressed in sedate street clothes and seems quite at peace as she sits at the table, and by the light of the candle, proceeds to open a black-covered book and read it. The print is fine, and she bends over it a moment, looks up at the capsules, and returns to the book while Stella and Jeff are heard over. She comes down the stairs as Lisa comes up to the two of them.",
    "1043": "Enrique approaches a security checkpoint and a female officer, who calls next. He notices a couple whispering and keeps his eyes on the young couple. As he approaches them, the short cropped-haired man walks away, and the two exchange looks as Enrique strides up to the pretty long-haired woman, Veronica. He grabs her hair and pushes her against a pillar; she holds his head. As she hugs him, he hands her her bag. Enrique reluctantly lets go of her hand and moves away, stopping to glance back. She blows him a kiss. Enrique turns and walks to the security barrier, where he shows his ID and is allowed through. He marches through the podium as the Mayor shakes the President's hand. The Mayor goes to the lectern, and Spanish flags are waved. Enrique rubs his palms together and reflects on Veronica's assignation. The young man leaves her, and Enrique looks up as the Mayor finishes his introduction. President Ashton steps forward and raises his arms wide at his sides, then staggers back and falls. Enrique jumps up onto the podium and runs across it, only to be tackled by Barnes. Matthews and Holden lead Enrique away, as the man in the checked shirt videos it. Enrique spots Veronica striding through the crowd and watches her keenly. She catches sight of him and holds his gaze. His eyes move down from her face to the bag he brought through security for her, which she tosses under the podium. An agent leads Enrique away, but Enrique elbows him in the face and takes the agent's gun. Smoke fills the plaza as Enrique sits up, and Holden, leaning beside the fallen Mathews alongside Barnes, glances across and sees him. Enrique holsters the agent's gun, and Holden gives chase. Enrique rounds a corner with Holden and another agent in pursuit, and Holden shoots in the air. Enrique rushes out into the street, darting into the road as an ambulance approaches, where Veronica sits in the passenger seat. He stands gooping and is hit by a car, but he gets to his feet and runs. Holden and the second agent, Parsons, chase Enrique into an arcade, where he shoves people out of his way. Enrique sprints upstairs and dashes into an apartment building, with residents on the staircase delaying the secret service agents. Enrique runs onto a balcony and leaps from it into a courtyard, and Holden and Parsons reach the balcony railing. They race along the balcony as Enrique dashes away from the apartment building and sprints along the street, looking behind constantly. Dodging traffic, he crosses the road until he is hit by another car, then runs across a road to an underpass carrying highway traffic.",
    "607": "A young blond boy sits cross-legged in front of the large wooden TV set on screen in black and white. Seated guests clap as a movie clip plays at an award ceremony. A man is seated nearby. Sophie is slender and beautiful. A woman on stage reads her name, seated beside a gobsmacked Sophie. Sidney cracks a wide smile and claps. Shapely raven-haired Sophie rises from her seat, Sidney turns to the camera. A smartly dressed man and woman rise from a nearby table. Camera phone pictures of Ricky Gervais. Sidney stands at a red rope barrier. He has a pig on a lead. She looks around nervously. He grins as she lifts the barrier. Alison leads Sidney and the pig away. The Haymarket Hotel. Sidney is dressed as a waiter with a fake mustache. Britney wags her curly tail. Sidney tosses her a canape, and she snaffles it down. Obscuring his face with a tray of canapes, he saunters into the party past the Nazi Clipboard woman. He sits by a pool chatting with Thandie Newton. The brown-haired hotel manager knocks on Sidney's room door. He enters to find that the room has been trashed. Chocolates and booze bottles litter the floor by the open fridge, and upturned furniture is strewn about the room. Unseen, Britney trots out of the hotel room and scurries down a corridor to a lift. The electric doors close. Thandie smiles coyly. She bursts out laughing and pats him at the thigh. Britney wanders out of the lift. Thandie smiles flirtatiously. He sips champagne. She gives him a sultry look, and he grins as he lets out a bashful sigh disturbing the fake mustache. Noticing this, Thandie frowns. Britney urinates on a lady's red high heels. The PR Nazi pushes through the crowd. Sidney spots Britney. Thandie stands. Bouncers approach. Sidney scampers. The PR Nazi watches hawkishly. Thandie shrugs. Two bouncers give chase. A woman is pushed away. He takes a running jump and a photographer snaps him mid-flight. The postmodern review has a photo from the newspaper in which Clint Eastwood has him in a headlock. He hears the phone ringing, and staff arguing in the next room. Holding a lit cigarette, Sydney strides into his busy living room come office. A cover of postmodern review disparages Sharp's editor. The writers have gathered in a frenzy to watch the fight brew. The women flaunt and flip the fax machine over. An airplane soars through the blue sky. At night, the glimmer of a taxi staring out the window as he's swept through. He gazes, wide-eyed, at a sign over the entrance of a theater, cruises through Chinatown. His smile fades as he sees a helicopter.",
    "846": "Looking through the passenger side window, he sees the skiptracer lying groggily against the wheel. The side door bursts open and Diana rolls onto her feet. Blood drips from her nose. She hugs him. He glances back. A tractor-trailer plows through the rental car, tearing it to pieces. Sandy stands motionless with his gaze fixed on the wreckage. Sandy looks at her and softly nods. Later, he drives the beat-up van along a narrow dirt road. In an office, Big Chuck sits across from Marisol and Julian. Big Chuck's smile fades. Chuck eyes the thugs. Julian slams Chuck's head against the desk. Diana searches the van. The temperature gauge rises. Sandy pulls over as steam wafts from the hood. Sandy steps out and approaches the steaming hood as Diana duct tapes the unconscious skiptracer. She takes a sip. She touches his pecs. Her nose grazes his beard. Sandy props the hood open and lets steam vent out. He stares at the sign, then opens the van. The skiptracer breathes deeply in his duct tape restraint. Now, a state trooper waves on traffic past Sandy's wrecked sedan. As Julian and Marisol cruise by, they overhear a witness. Now, Sandy talks on his cell as he and Diana walk along a deserted road. He shoots Diana a look. She looks away. At night, a pickup truck approaches. Her thumbs. He shows her his phone. Later, they start a fire. He looks up and she shuts her eyes. Sandy shrugs. Sandy lies on his side next to the fire, and Diana snuggles up behind him. She pulls her arm away. A snake slithers toward them. The snake moves closer. He glances back at Diana as the snake slithers into his pants. He springs up and fumbles with his jeans. He pushes his pants off. Sandy tosses his jeans into the woods. A snake lowers from a tree. It drops onto his shoulders. She dips the stick into the fire. She swings the stick. The snake tightens around his neck. The snake watches the flame, then bites into Sandy's neck. Diana whacks it with a stick, and Sandy drops to the ground. She hits it a few more times, then tosses away the stick. Diana grabs the snake and tugs at it, as Sandy pries the reptile's teeth from his neck. Diana tosses the snake away and shakes her hands. In the morning, a cargo train passes by a rusty disheveled station. Diana applies makeup while Sandy lies on a bench in a pair of dirt-covered khakis. Sandy wakes up and reaches for his neck. Diana watches him with a smile. He walks away. He moves to the ticket booth. He looks back at Diana and paces.",
    "1346": "The boys look at each other, afraid, and in quick close-ups, they rewind the film and rip it. In a wide shot of the neighborhood, in the distance, military trucks, jeeps, and buses drive, while neighbors come from their homes in the mid-ground, filled with confusion and talk, with more vehicles arriving. As we boom down, we see Joe and Charles trying to make sense of this as Joe calls to a passing adult, Mr. Harkin, who points out something to Joe. Joe turns to look, and we pan across the scene with various shots of military buses stopping, soldiers ordering and assisting people onto vehicles, all carrying as many belongings as they can. Others load up cars quickly, strapping belongings to the roof, and more people in a panic run to find others who are lost. Orders are being barked, residents can be heard complaining and arguing, walkies squawk, and PA announcements blare as soldiers check their wrist bands. Joe passes an arguing man and soldier. A thousand people have been accounted for so far. Louis lies in a cot in the triage unit, which had fifty beds transferred from the hospital, staring off, head bandaged, eyes open, muttering to himself, as tired, hung over, injured, and in shock as he is. Joe is looking everywhere for his dad and finally sees Louis, hurrying to him. Louis grabs Joe's shirt and pulls him close, speaking in a voice desperate and heartsick. Joe's mind is on fire as he absorbs this, whispering back to Louis, who looks at him with hope. They look at him like he's from Uranus. Jen, Charles’ sister, lies on her cot making her Columbia House Records choices, while Charles is in her face. Jen suddenly closes her magazine, staring suspiciously at him and looking right at us, vulnerable yet seductive. Donny, utterly stunned, is now seen as we move past Donny moving through parked cars, with Joe, Charles, Cary, and Martin keeping up, and the boys ducking as soldiers pass by. In a small, tiled room with no windows, Jack, up all night, pissed off but bored being pissed off, pounds on the door, doing so again until it finally unlocks and opens. A 32-year-old humorless, armed soldier stands there, and Jack is led down a dilapidated, narrow hall with a soldier holding a semi-auto behind him, aimed at Jack's back. As Jack passes an open door, he spies an empty office, through the window of which are a few military vehicles and a handful of airmen on the tarmac. Jack's mind races as he approaches the bathroom at the end of the hall and turns, only to be slam-flattened by Jack, who kneels to him, pushing in close, eyes wide, mind racing with the question of what the hell happens next.",

Now, on a backyard trampoline, Debbie's youngest does a flip while Debbie and Sadie look on. Sitting on a toilet, Pete plays online Scrabble until Debbie opens the door. She lifts her brow with a skeptical nod before snatching his computer tablet and leaving. Later, Pete stands onstage, and in the audience, Pete's goateed friend and Barb share a table with Debbie. The silver-haired man in the amber-tinted glasses takes the stage with a backup musician while at the table, Pete sits by his wife, his boyishly ardent gaze fixed on the stage. Debbie sighs as the music producer bobs his head, mouthing along with the lyrics. Debbie turns away discreetly to yawn as Pete briefly lip syncs at her, and Debbie's eyes close. Later, Pete drives his wife home and pulls over as the fire truck passes in the opposite direction. Debbie watches with a smirk as two other emergency vehicles drive by. Back at home, they enter Sadie's room where Debbie takes Sadie's MP3 player, sets it in a dock, and Sadie smiles as her mother dances. Charlotte bounces up and down, and Sadie grins, then bops her head as she gets up and joins them. Looking on, Pete takes a seat as his wife and daughters dance, and standing, Pete replaces Sadie's music player with his own. Debbie and the girls halt, and as his wife and daughters look on, Pete sways awkwardly, letting his head rock side to side. Debbie gestures toward their glum-faced daughters, and eyeing them, Pete takes his music player from the speaker dock. In the morning, Debbie rushes to the kitchen island, where Pete eats breakfast with the girls, and preparing their lunches, she glares at her husband. Later, Charlotte runs upstairs at a school as Debbie and Charlotte pass a pregnant woman with long, gray hair. They reach a classroom where Debbie hugs an old woman. Later, Debbie ducks down in her car as she smokes a cigarette, blowing smoke out the window and pulling away. Now, a laptop shows a young Graham Parker performing in his heyday, and Pete watches with a mustached 30-something and a hip, young woman. He glances toward his office where Graham heads out. Now, at a home office, Pete plucks a sitar. At night, Debbie faces a laptop as she and Pete lounge in bed, viewing video from the store where Desi's hook-up takes her from behind. Debbie averts her face and hits Pete with a pillow. Now, Charlotte bounces in the doorway across the bathroom between the girls' rooms, and her own hand snatches her out of view as she collapses with her feet sticking out.",

Jack and Fabrizio run up a gangplank. Carrying sacks over their shoulders, Jack and Fabrizio dash into the ship. They run onto one of the upper decks and wave to arm lockers from a railing. Black smoke belches from one of the Titanic's four stacks. Hundreds of passengers wave to the people on the dock below as tugboats pull the Titanic away from the shore. Turning up clouds of silt on the dock, a bearded man turns a crank on a movie camera as the ship glides forward. White seagulls appear no larger than insects as they flutter past the Titanic's massive crowd. Four rows of portholes line the sides of the ocean liner, which glides past a small two-manned sailboat. Inside the Titanic, a brown-haired woman herds a young boy and girl up a corridor. Jack and Fabrizio pass in the opposite direction. Jack enters a berth, and Jack's roommates exchange puzzled looks. In her cabin, Rose unpacks a painting. A porter carries in a pair of suitcases as Cal enters from the adjoining promenade deck. As a porter wheels in a safe on a dolly, Cal jams a bottle of champagne into an ice bucket. As the Titanic cruises in open water, the white-bearded captain steps up beside the first officer. Murdoch strides into the wheelhouse. Moody pulls a telegraph lever to a head full in the engine room, and the needle on an identical machine moves to the same position. Men dash along catwalks as turning gears pump huge pistons up and down. The mustached foreman turns the wheel connected to several steam pipes in the smokey boiler room, which is covered in coal from large furnaces. A needle rises on a steam pressure gauge. Pumping pistons move faster and faster, slicing through the ocean. On deck, Jack and Fabrizio growl against the railing. Behind them, Captain Smith stands on the uppermost deck outside the pilot hub. First Officer Murdoch steps up beside him, and the captain glances at him and grins. Jack points towards something below, where a dolphin swims ahead of the ship. Other dolphins join the first one, zooming through the clear water like zig-zagging torpedoes. One dolphin leaps out of the water. Jack smiles as he gazes down at the dolphins, and behind them, a crew member hands a teacup to Captain Smith. He sips his drink while gazing out to sea. From the boiler room, men dump wheelbarrows of coal beside stokers who shovel the fuel. An engineer leans over a railing as massive pistons pump on either side of it.",
    "11": "She stares at her reflection critically and says this as if it were a threat, then notices a smudge on the mirror and wipes it off. The front door opens to reveal Carolyn, greeting us with the smile she thinks could sell ice to an Eskimo. Smiling, Carolyn leads a man and woman into the living room. They're thirtyish, and they've seen a lot of houses today. The man and woman glance around the dark room, unimpressed, and the woman wrinkles her face, skeptical. Carolyn enters, followed by a different couple in their fifties, and stands with another couple: African American, late twenties. The woman is pregnant. Carolyn stands by the pool next to two fortyish women. She locks the sliding glass door and starts to pull the vertical blinds shut, then stops. Standing very still, with the blinds casting shadows across her face, she starts to cry: brief, staccato sobs that seemingly escape against her will. Suddenly she slaps herself, hard, but the tears continue. She slaps herself again and repeatedly until she stops crying. She stands there, taking deep breaths until she has everything under control, then pulls the blinds shut, once again all business. She walks out calmly, leaving us alone in the dark, empty room. We're at a high-school basketball game where teenage boys play a fast and furious game. One team wearing pale blue and white uniforms scores a basket. Perky cheerleaders jump up and down as the crowd goes wild. Seated in the bleachers, next to the high school band, is a group of about twenty teenage girls, dressed in pale blue and white uniforms. Among them, Jane sits next to Angela Hayes. At sixteen, Angela is strikingly beautiful, with perfect even features, blonde hair, and a nubile young body; she's the archetypal American dream girl. Carolyn drives with Lester slumped in the passenger seat, and Carolyn stares at him, unsure of how to respond. The uniformed girls now stand in formation on the gym floor, and in the crowded stands, Lester and Carolyn find seats. They're well-rehearsed, but too young to carry off the ambitious Vegas routine they're attempting. Lester, watching from the stands, picks out his daughter. Jane performs well, concentrating, while dancing awkwardly next to her is Angela. Suddenly Angela looks right at us and smiles, a lazy, insolent smile. We're focused on Angela now, and everything starts to shift as the music acquires an eerie echo. We zoom slowly toward Lester as he watches, transfixed. The light on Angela grows stronger, and the other girls disappear entirely. Lester is suddenly alone in the stands, spellbound, as Angela looks directly at us now, dancing only for Lester. Her movements take on a blatantly erotic edge as she starts to unzip her uniform, teasing us with an expression that's both innocent and knowing, then.",
    "822": "Hannah beams at him as she is already halfway towards the door and putting her coat on, while the handsome guy, Jacob, stares after her with a smile. Cal drives along a dark street with Jessica in the passenger seat, who gazes down uncomfortably before she glances up at Cal, who’s focused on the road. She hangs her head and gazes down again, and with trepidation, she glances at him again but looks away again. He shakes his head, she nods, and he smiles. Cal claps a hand over his mouth, puts a hand to his head, and then pulls up outside a house. Jessica frowns and nods, as she, tall and slightly gangly, stands outside a house and watches as Cal drives off, her brow pinched forlornly. People are leaving the upmarket bar where Hannah and Liz were, while Cal sits at the bar, resting his head on his hand, and stares down glumly, drumming his fingers on the countertop. Cal smiles gently and turns to look at a woman on his left, leaning towards her as she turns to him, but he shakes his head. She’s talking to her friend as Cal taps his glass on the bar and laughs at his own joke, looking over at Jacob, who’s making a bunch of women laugh. Cal sucks his drink through a straw as a balding man makes his way through an open-plan office and knocks on a glass door where his colleague fakes surprise. Cal heads out as his colleague pats him, and he closes his eyes as everyone in the office gives him a round of applause. It’s raining outside, with two chairs and a table in a pretty garden with white and red rose bushes, along with a wooden bench and a climbing frame. Cal stands by a rental truck and stares ahead, solemn-faced, as Emily pinches the bridge of her nose with tears welling in her eyes, and she nods. He looks her in the eye, she reels slightly, their gaze lingers, then Cal gets in the driver’s seat of a rental truck, closes the door, and Emily watches as Cal reverses. She walks along by the truck, her arms folded, then looks down. Cal’s back at the same bar, which is busy with people chatting, and he sits alone at the counter, drinking a vodka cranberry through a straw. He spots Jacob opposite him, eating a burger and chips alone at the bar, and Jacob wipes his mouth with a napkin and then gets up. Jacob puts on his suit jacket and glances over at Cal, who quickly lowers his gaze and sips his drink as Jacob makes his way over to a table of young women and starts chatting to them. Cal shakes his head disapprovingly and lets out a sigh as a middle-aged man in a shirt and tank top comes in.",
    "498": "Cole's attention is drawn back to the bed by his mother's voice, where he finds her laying, her face showing deep sadness as she speaks in her sleep. He touches her face with his tiny fingers while holding her stare with trembling eyes. After some time, he opens his mouth to speak, taking a while before the words come out. On a downtown Septa public bus, Malcolm and Cole are among the passengers, wearing suits. Cole leans his head against the glass of the scratched window, taking in the passing scenery, as Malcolm slips back into silence. The city bus maneuvers through the old Philadelphia streets, heading downtown, past rows of parked cars extending onto the streets. A somber crowd, including people in suits and dark dresses, moves in and out of a home's front door. Cole and Malcolm join the visitors, slowly walking towards the doors. A frail, little four-year-old girl in a dark dress sits on swings outside the house. Inside, the packed home is standing room only with mourners. The air is filled with dozens of hushed voices. Cole quietly stares at the door, waits for a long time before reaching for the doorknob, then gazes into the girl's bedroom. He sees a hospital bed near the window, walls covered with get-well cards and drawings, and shelves filled with puppets. Next to the shelf is a puppet stage and a camcorder on a mini tripod. Cole approaches the shelf, picks up a finger puppet dancer, and places it in his pocket. On the girl's desk, he notices a large collection of video cassettes. Carefully reading the labels, he moves towards the closets, watches as the girl's hand retracts under the bed, and stays very still. Waiting, he slowly bends down, his hands touching the floor, then tilts his head to look under the bed, seeing the emaciated little girl who had come to his tent, curled on the floor glaring at him with bulging eyes. She suddenly moves, thrusting a jewelry box forward, which slides across the floor and stops at Cole's feet. They stare at each other in the room, thick with mourners, most gathered around the girl's mother, a young woman in her late twenties. Malcolm observes breathlessly from the doorway as Cole navigates through the adults across the room. The girl's father, Mr. Collins, a thin man in his late twenties, is seated on a reading chair next to a TV.",
    "119": "The cylinder goes on revolving, but no more voice comes—only the whir of the needle on the empty record. At last, he remembers to replace the horn. Neff has just come out of Keyes' office. He walks slowly back towards the reception room entrance, then stands there looking out through the glass doors. All the employees have now left. Neff is entirely alone. He moves as if to go out, then stops rigidly as his face lights up with the excitement of a sudden idea. He turns quickly and walks on to his own office and enters. Neff walks across to his desk, lifts the telephone, and dials a number. Neff hangs up and stands beside the desk with a grim expression on his face, takes a handkerchief out, and wipes perspiration from his forehead and the palms of his hands. The gesture has a symbolic quality, as if he were trying to wipe away the murder. Over his face comes the commentary. The lights are turned on. Phyllis is coming down the stairs. She wears white lounging pajamas, and she is carrying something small and heavy concealed in a scarf in her right hand. She reaches the front door, opens it slightly, fixes the catch so that the door can be opened from outside. She switches off the porch light and the hall light. She moves towards the living room, where there is still light on. Neff comes through the arch and walks slowly towards her. Neff sits down on the arm of the davenport, close to her. Neff gets up from the davenport. He listens to the music for a moment. Phyllis just stares at him. He goes quietly over to the window, shuts it, and draws the curtain. Neff takes a few more steps towards her and stops again. Phyllis is silent. Her expression is tortured. Neff goes on until he is close to her. Quietly, he takes the gun out of her unresisting hand. Phyllis puts her arms around him in complete surrender. Neff draws her close to him. As she comes out of the kiss, there is realization in her eyes that this is the final moment. Out of the shot, the gun explodes once, twice. Phyllis quivers in his arms. Her eyes fill with tears. Her head falls limp against his shoulder. Slowly, he lifts her and carries her to the davenport. He lays her down on it carefully, almost tenderly. The moonlight coming in at the French doors shines on the anklet. He looks at it for the last time and slowly turns away. As he does so, he puts his hand inside his coat, and it comes out with blood on it.",
    "699": "A short time later, he takes a suitcase from under his bed and opens it to reveal his red and blue Spider-Man suit. He holds it up and gazes calmly at the spider emblazoned across the chest on its ribbed web, and his anxious eyes quieten. Up in his mansion, Harry turns off the TV and paces past a roaring fire with a hand clasped to his forehead. He stops in front of the portrait of his father and half turns his head to look at Peter, who is in his Spider-Man suit but without the mask. Lit by the glow from the fire, Harry turns around fully to face Peter, revealing ugly burns on his right cheek and a scar across his eye and throat. Harry looks impassively at Peter, then shakes his head. Peter turns away, rebuffed, and leaves by the balcony. In the goblin layer, Harry picks up the green goblin sword from among the debris on the floor. With the disfigured side of his face in shadow, a tear glistens in Harry's good eye, and he nods. Bernard softly withdraws. A huge searchlight picks up the yellow cab ensnared in a web high above the New York streets. Encaged in the cab, Mary Jane looks around nervously. The cab rocks and plummets down the web like a fish being tipped out of a net, then comes to rest on a lower web. A little girl in the vast crowd points up, and a wave of heads turn to face Spider-Man swinging down on a thread. Spider-Man leaps onto a building with the Stars and Stripes fluttering behind him, then launches himself towards the action. He swings up a lamppost, past the reporter, Jennifer Dugan. Spider-Man launches himself through the air, the night lights twinkling all around, and lands on the bonnet of the yellow cab. Venom swings into Spider-Man and knocks him through the windscreen, tearing off the roof. Spider-Man clambers onto the boot as Venom's mask slithers off his face like a tangle of snakes to reveal Brock, who grabs Mary Jane. Brock sends Spider-Man plummeting to a lower web. Spider-Man's wrists are lashed to the web with webbing fired by Brock, who lands on top of him and tears off the Spider-Man mask. Peter's eyes widen as a truck suspended above the yellow cab starts shedding its load of breeze blocks, which rain down like giant hailstones, ripping a door off the cab. Mary Jane tries to maneuver a breeze block lodged in the cab while Peter struggles to free himself. Mary Jane raises the breeze block above her head as the symbiote mask wraps itself around Brock's face. She drops the breeze block, hitting the snarling Venom on the head.",
    "181": "She can only stare in horror at the sight of her dead friend. It is almost as if our eyes have suddenly begun to adjust to the darkness and we see the outline of a man standing right behind her. The outline becomes more and more clear. Laurie suddenly moves away from the corner. The shape lunges out at her. He lunges again with the knife. He lunges at her suddenly with the knife. He stands there holding up the piece of material, then raises the butcher knife and moves for her. The hand grasps a piece of Laurie's blouse and rips it. The knife slices across her arm, ripping her flesh. She screams and spins around. Laurie bumps back into the railing. She leaps backward to avoid the blade and slips over the edge of the railing. The camera pounces down from the second floor and slams into the floor. The camera moves with her as she backs away, screaming at the top of her lungs. She hits the floor and rolls over, holding her leg painfully. It is the shape, wearing the mask, the butcher knife in his hand, gleaming. The shape moves to the top of the staircase and starts down toward her. Then she looks up at the staircase. She pulls herself up off the floor and hobbles into the living room. The shape races down the stairs. She moves for the kitchen. She crawls to the kitchen, rolls inside and slams the kitchen door behind her. In a flash, she leaps up and clicks the lock. She sees the kitchen window over the sink. Laurie slowly climbs to her feet and limps toward the back door. Her hand tries the door. Desperately she tries the door, glancing behind her. There is a pounding on the door from the other side. Suddenly, the kitchen door explodes, the middle of it breaking. The shape reaches through, groping for the lock. The shape's hand reaches for the lock. The shape's hand grabs the lock and clicks it open. The shape pushes the door open and leaps into the kitchen. With a heave, she opens it half-way. She can only get it three-fourths open. She drags herself roughly out the window. Laurie picks herself up from the ground and runs as fast as she can, limping across the backyard, camera moving with her. She looks behind her. She trips on the fallen lamp and falls to the floor. She passes the driveway and scurries into the neighbor's backyard, up to the back door of the house. She pounds furiously on the door. Laurie continues to pound on the door. The back porch light comes on. Through the glass in the back door we see an old woman dressed in a nightgown approach.",
    "762": "Elijah anxiously stares around and spots a man on the other side of the road from the dark brick stadium, then sees the man stride down into the subway. Elijah waits for a car to pass, crosses the road against the traffic lights, and the skirt of his coat flaps open to reveal a purple lining. He almost skips across the street in his anxiety, grabs the handrail to steady himself, and silhouetted against the daylight, he stares down the long steep staircase at the man striding into the tiled station. Elijah watches the man disappear into the station, looks down, and launches himself down the stairs. Using his stick and hanging onto the rail, Elijah tries to stay balanced, but his feet don't land accurately, and he slips. His glass stick flies downwards, and he is sprawled on the stairs on his back with his head downwards. Looking upside down into the station, he sees the man glance back before vaulting the ticket barrier. As the man's jacket flips up, Elijah sees a silver gun with a black grip under it, and his eyes flicker and close. On a sunny afternoon, a white bus stops on a hill at a suburban street, and David gets out still in his security uniform of a green jacket and maroon cap, carrying a holdall. He turns and walks slowly and smiling towards a small green park where a group of boys are playing American football on the grass. Joseph runs up some steps to join David, while the other children mill around a young man with a crew cut, admiring his muscles. They turn and walk away together, Joseph with his hand on his father's back. In the dim light of a basement, David, wearing a light grey sweatshirt, is laying flat on a narrow bench, pushing up a weight's bar. He straightens his arms, lets the bar down onto a pair of supports on either side of the bench, and sits up. Joseph, his fringe hanging to his eyebrows, gazes down at David, who looks around at the weights on the ends of the bar. David looks away, walks behind to the weights, and then sits on a bench, looking down while Joseph moves from one end of the bar to the other. David lies back on the bench, grips the bar, lifts it off the supports, frowning, and lowers it to his chest. As he starts to push it up, his mouth contorts with effort, and a large vein stands out on his forehead from between his eyes up into his scalp. His arms quiver, and his head trembles as he lowers the bar to his chest and pushes it up again. He reaches full arm extension and drops the bar back onto the supports.",
    "1036": "Ryan is distracted, sitting in front of a computer screen, and he puts on a headset. In a meeting with Craig and other employees, Ryan looks at the schedule for the Gold Quest Conference on his laptop. At home, he takes a couple of whiskey miniatures from his fridge and stands looking out of a window with a drink in his hand. A large video screen outside a Las Vegas hotel displays a caption. Ryan waits in the wings of a packed conference hall, and smartly suited, he puts his backpack on a table and steps up to a lectern. Computer-generated backpacks revolve on the screens behind him, and Ryan looks out across the room full of seated delegates. Lost in his thoughts, he hangs his head, then shakes it slightly before looking up and smiling to himself. He taps his thumb on the lectern, walks off past a backstage guy, and leaves the building. Ryan runs through the airport, dragging his case with one hand, while a boarding pass flaps in the other. He reaches a Departure gate, gets the pass checked, and goes through. On a jet, Ryan gazes out of the window at the nighttime lights of Chicago. In a flurry of snow, Ryan picks up a Hertz rental car, signs, gets in, and drives away. Ryan drives along slush-covered roads, glancing at a piece of paper in his hand and scanning the streets. He pulls up, leaves the lights on, and gets out of the car. Jogging along a pavement, he walks up to a large suburban townhouse and rings the doorbell. Ryan steps back, puts his hands in the pockets of his long black coat, and tries to act casual as Alex opens the door. His cheeky smile quickly fades when he sees two young boys run up the stairs behind Alex. Mortified, Alex stares at Ryan, who slowly backs away as she shuts the door. Ryan turns and goes. In a hotel room, he sits staring out of the window into the night and sips a large whiskey. Ryan's solitary figure is framed by one of the row of tall windows in a nondescript hotel block. Ryan arrives at the airport, drags his case through the busy terminal building, swipes his card at the self-service check-in, and takes the shuttle train to his gate. He perches on the edge of a seat, looking morose, when Alex calls him from her car. Ryan looks tearful, and tears well up in his eyes. Ryan opens his mouth as if he's about to speak, but instead shuts his eyes and hangs up, looking deeply hurt. On his flight, Ryan sits staring into space, and a stewardess hands him a glass of champagne.",
    "1359": "Overmyer enters and crosses to Nelec, who reviews a folder, but then Nelec sees something outside: the kids. Jack's cruiser pulls up, and Joe spins around as Jack arrives, grabbing his camera from Charles and saying firmly to Joe. Joe is stunned and instantly humiliated in front of Alice, and he's taken back to the squad car. Jack opens the car's back door, Joe gets in, and Jack slams it shut, then throws the camera and tripod into the passenger seat and slams that door before heading to the house and leaving Joe in the back. Nelec heads outside, and Jack moves to him; this lands on Nelec, and Jack heads off. Jack stops and turns to uncomfortable Nelec. Joe, his breathing heavy, sits in the car with his heart pounding, watching his father move over to talk to Nelec, close again, while Alice watches him sympathetically. The door opens, and Jack enters, letting Joe pass him. Joe closes the door hard and says angrily but restrained. Jack turns to leave, but Joe, enraged, says something that makes Jack stop, stunned, as Joe's heart pounds. Jack moves close to Joe, intimidating, and Joe steps back, feeling Jack is intense. Jack suddenly stops himself, realizing what he's saying and to whom he's saying it, but somehow, in this moment, he can't be a better father than law officer. More upset at himself than Joe, he heads out. Joe rides up a hill, revealing the town cemetery, and sits with his back against his mother's grave, holding her open locket and staring at it. But then he hears a sound and turns, hearing a deep and low sound in the distance. Joe is motionless. He stands, pulls out his flashlight, and aims the beam down the rows of graves toward the big caretaker's shed in the distance. He hears another intense, low sound, then a high pitch hit like metal on wood, and Joe backs up, nervous. Another odd sound occurs, which transitions us to Jack's squad car arriving at the abandoned airfield. Jack's car pulls up, and he gets out. Suddenly, the three large military trucks' headlights come on, all aimed at Jack; he is blinded and tries to see past an IV and medical machinery. He's looking at someone we don't yet see; in the background, Overmyer stands, watching. Nelec is quiet and simple. Now we see who he's talking to: battered and scraped, he lies in a medical bed, afraid but defiant. Dr. Woodward swallows and feels that his time on Earth is coming to an end no matter what he does here. By the door, Overmyer is quietly putting on his black gloves, while Nelec offers a vague, searching smile.",
    "1302": "Graham puts Bo down in the hallway and she stands close to him as the four of them stand quietly in a tight group. Morgan looks at his father, unable to speak, and all four look up. Merrill looks up the stairs at the boarded bedroom doors as Graham takes Morgan's hand and smiles down at his son, who smiles gently back. The group of four turns and watches the top of the stairs, and Merrill's eyes move quietly above the bedroom doors to the ceiling of the upstairs hallway, where he stares at a rectangle with a tiny rope hanging from it. Morgan and Bo are frozen watching a set of long fingers reach under the front door, which change to the exact color and texture of the yellow cracked paint on the door. Graham and Merrill arrive in the front hall, and Graham takes Morgan and Bo by the hand, leading them quickly down the hall as Merrill backs away while watching the top of the stairs. Graham comes down the last few steps and enters the basement, closing the door behind him, which has no lock. The basement is lined with metal shelves cluttered with canned goods, extension cords, cleaning supplies, decorations, and outdoor tools. Merrill rummages through the shelves frantically as Graham puts his ear to the door and listens. Merrill moves to another set of shelves, knocking things to the ground, and there is scratching against the door. The doorknob turns, and Graham grabs it with both hands as the door begins to push open. A single light bulb hangs from a wire in the ceiling, the only light in the room. Merrill reaches between two stacks of shelves and pulls out a pick for digging in the ground with a three-foot wooden handle, holding it up in the air. He turns and rushes in Graham's direction, clipping the light bulb with the end of the wooden handle as he crosses the room. Merrill turns the channel knob and checks all the stations, listening to the light hum from the speakers. Graham steps into the beam of lights, looks at the door, and then turns to face the lights. Graham looks at Merrill's corner of the darkness as Morgan moves his beam onto Merrill, putting the flashlight on the ground and rolling it across. The flashlight comes to a stop in Graham's palm, and he picks it up. Merrill slowly catches his breath and reaches over to his side to grab the remaining flashlight, training the beam. Merrill looks at his nephew turning gray as Graham pulls Morgan closer to his body and talks into the child's ear.",
    "507": "They are both quiet for a second. Louise goes a little faster. Hal smiles. The surveillance man motions to Hal to keep it going. Louise's eyes get wide as she hears this. A FINGER reaches up and presses down the lever and hangs up the phone. She has her finger on the lever. Louise is still standing there holding the phone. Thelma stops and looks at her. Max, still holding the phone, is surprised by this outburst. Louise is surprised to be hearing this from Thelma. They are both quiet for a moment. Louise starts the car. They lurch into reverse then screech forward as they tear off down the road. As they fly down the road, Louise and Thelma both get quiet for a second. They are both laughing. The car is still flying down the road. The sun is coming higher in the sky now. They come to an intersection in the middle of nowhere. They turn off onto a dirt road and pull to a stop. The Trucker reaches over and opens a glove compartment crammed full of condoms. He grabs a few and shoves them in his pocket. He turns off his engine and gets out of the truck. He walks up to the car. Louise and Thelma get out of the car. Louise nods. This is not what is supposed to be happening. He is getting a little panicky. Louise pulls the gun they stole from the State Patrolman. He looks at the gun. Louise looks at his truck off in the distance. She points the gun at it, takes a second to get a bead, then shoots two of the tires flat. The truck slowly sinks as the air escapes from the tires. Louise and Thelma look at each other. They both turn towards the truck and fire rounds into the tankers until they explode in a huge ball of fire. The truck driver screams at the top of his lungs. Louise starts the car and starts driving in circles around the truck driver. Thelma and Louise are both howling at the top of their lungs. A steady stream of state police cars pulls out of the parking lot with lights flashing while other policemen are running to their cars still parked in the lot. It does look like an Army. More police cars have joined, and from every direction, police cars are swarming across the desert, although none are in front of them. Thelma is looking way up ahead in the distance. Behind them is a huge wall of dust created by all the police cars following them. In front of them, looking larger every moment, is the awesome splendor of the Grand Canyon.",
    "979": "A postman arrives and hands Benjamin a telegram on the front porch, which Benjamin opens as the postman leaves. Clouds part to reveal a view of Paris from above, with the Arc de Triomphe in the center of the Place de l'Etoile, around which twelve roads extend. Benjamin leaves a taxi and strides through a grassy courtyard, climbs a flight of stairs, and approaches a nurse at a reception desk. He sits down opposite the desk as the nurse makes a call. Meanwhile, a woman leaves her apartment, and a black cab stops. A man takes the cab as she turns to lock her door. Daisy sits on the stage and kicks her legs while a cab breaks sharply. The man inside sits up, and she combs her hair. The nurse ends her call, and Benjamin rises to his feet and enters a hospital ward where he strolls past bed-bound patients. He plows into a woman's room and approaches her hospital bed where she lies with her face bruised and her right leg elevated in a metal frame. She opens her eyes to see his image blurred. He sits down, smiles warmly, but his face falls while she hides her face. He looks at her as she fights back tears. Benjamin looks at the floor, then stares at Daisy, who has her head turned away and her eyes closed. A moment passes, and she turns her head to find he's gone, as a dangling triangular support sways above her, which she grasps sharply. Caroline reads on and then leaps up and goes, wearing a harrowed expression. Her aged mother meets her eye with her wrist bent unnaturally across her chest. Caroline sits back and picks up the diary. Meanwhile, Benjamin sails on a calm lake and leaves a woman's doorstep, as a dark-haired young woman puts on her shoes and hurries out of Benjamin's bedroom. She stops dead, seeing the elderly resident staring at their rooms and at her. Benjamin, fresh-faced with short cropped hair and wearing a bright white T-shirt, stares wistfully, then goes to his window. He alights his sailboat and strolls casually on the wooden jetty, drives a blue motorbike parked outside, and is watched by Queenie from a high window as he crosses the lawn past a guy raking up dead leaves. He removes his cap and glances up at Queenie as he strides towards the main building and jogs up the steps on which he was left as a baby. He pauses on the porch as Daisy stands behind him, and he turns to see her standing in the doorway opposite, dressed in black with her hands knitted together at her waist.",
    "104": "Lt. Dan lifts his pant leg to display his metal leg as Susan shakes Forrest's hand. Jenny steps forward and kisses Lt. Dan's cheek, and the group is seated as they watch Forrest and Jenny take vows on the front lawn. Forrest Jr. stands next to Jenny as the wind blows fallen leaves across the ground. Jenny, Forrest, and Forrest Jr. walk toward the house, holding hands as they walk. Forrest steps into Jenny's bedroom carrying a tray with breakfast on it, and looks at Jenny as she sleeps. Slowly she wakes up and looks at Forrest. Forrest looks up into the sky as the rain stops, removes his helmet, and the stars emerge from behind the clouds. He stands on his boat, looking at a deep orange and red sunset. Forrest runs along a highway and later along a desert highway as a lake reflects the mountains and the sky, and the morning light casts an orange glow over the desert. Jenny looks out the window, and Forrest looks at Jenny, who then reaches over and takes his hand. Forrest stands under the old oak tree where Jenny has been buried, trying to hold back his tears, and watches as her dad's house is knocked down by a bulldozer. He looks at Jenny's grave marker, which reads: JENNY GUMP July 16, 1945 -- March 22, 1982 Beloved Mother, Wife and Friend. Forrest Jr. reads a book to Forrest as they sit together, and Forrest looks down as he sobs. Forrest tries to teach Forrest Jr. how to play ping-pong, but when Forrest Jr. serves the ball, Forrest dives and misses it. They sit on a log by the river and fish, and Forrest looks down at the grave marker, placing the letter next to fresh flowers. As he steps back and looks at the grave, a flock of birds flies overhead and lands in the tree, and Forrest turns to watch. The bus drives toward them and stops; the door opens, and Forrest Jr. walks toward the bus. Forrest stands up as Forrest Jr. looks into the bus and at the bus driver, recognizing her as the same driver, only older now, who drove Forrest to school as a boy. Forrest Jr. waves to his father, and Forrest nods approvingly as Forrest Jr. gets on the bus, which then pulls away. Forrest stands next to the mailbox, sits down, and the camera cranes down to reveal the feather lying at his feet. A gust of wind picks the feather up.",
    "641": "In an interrogation room, a corpulent policeman blows cigarette smoke across the table into the face of a terrified, sweating, young male prisoner. The prisoner, Jamal Malik, blinks rapidly as the smoke stings his eyes. The policeman suddenly lunges across the table. A question appears on the screen. Hands scatter Rupee notes onto the floor. The show's host turns to Jamal, standing in the wings of the studio. Jamal and the host walk to their chairs positioned at the center of the studio stage. Back in the police cell, the policeman forces Jamal's head into a bucket of water. A beautiful young woman stands on a train platform. She looks up and smiles. The inspector enters a room where Jamal is suspended off the floor by his wrists. Srinivas reluctantly sets up a car battery with jump leads beneath Jamal's dangling feet. Srinivas attaches the jump leads to each of Jamal's big toes. Jamal glares directly into the eyes of the inspector. The inspector moves to the other side of the room, as Srinivas switches on the battery. The inspector approaches the now limp body of Jamal again and notices that Jamal's eyes are closed and that he's dribbling. The inspector looks closely at his face. Jamal stares. Both the policemen turn slowly toward Jamal. He spits blood. A group of scruffy young boys in filthy t-shirts and shorts play cricket on a runway. Jamal, seen as a young boy here, trips and fails to catch the ball. The other boys slap their heads. They brandish long truncheons. The gang of boys suddenly disperses in all directions. Another boy turns to make a rude gesture at the security men. They clap a high-five. The boys clamber across a rubbish tip, up over corrugated rooftops and down into the narrow alleyways of their slum. The security men dismount and give chase on foot. The security guards struggle to follow the tiny boys as they wind and weave through the filthy, narrow streets between shanty buildings. Some boys throw rubbish from the roofs onto the heads of the guards. A determined guard perseveres in chasing Salim and Jamal down a walkway and past a river swollen with rubbish, plastic bags, and green slime. The boys run along a sewage pipe, followed by the guard hot on their heels. The boys run headlong into a Mercedes. Javed, the local gangster, sits in the back, shouting and angry at the boys. The boys run off as the guard then collides with the car. He backs away apologetically, holding his cap in hand. The boys taunt the guard, turn a corner, and suddenly run into their mother. She drags the boys to school.",
    "1206": "A montage of news images shows a pair of large military-style trucks driven in tandem along a dirt road, the first with a single soldier standing in the back and the second with a whole troop. The trucks pull up, and the troops, dressed in khaki fatigues and wearing wide-brimmed hats with a gold-colored Burmese military emblem, order a group of terrified and cowering peasants off the truck and onto the road while brandishing rifles. The troops pass cash among themselves, as an officer in dark glasses sits coolly smoking a cigarette in one of the trucks. A soldier walks in a nearby paddy field and tosses a primed grenade, causing the villagers to cower. The soldier then primes and tosses two more grenades, which splash harmlessly on sodden ground, before stopping about 100 yards from the truck. The peasants are pushed at gunpoint to the edge of the field and begin to half-run, half-stumble across the paddy field towards the solitary soldier as the troops watch impassively, and the commander pulls on his cigarette. One of the peasants is blown to pieces, leaving the rest to stand still. The commander nods to a soldier, and at the command, the troops open fire, shooting down the peasants. Low clouds hover above mountains, with a verdant valley edged with ferns and a small stream running through it. Captions in military white type appear as a mustachioed local man in a baseball cap and striped T-shirt pokes undergrowth with a stick, joined by a second man wearing a bandana and a red shirt, and a third man, John Rambo. Rambo, dark-haired, heavy-set, muscular, and sullen-faced, wears a khaki smock and a red paisley bandanna. Rambo pushes his stick, which has a hook on the end, into the greenery, where a cobra rears in the grass. The men, identified as snake-wranglers, surround the cobra as it lunges at them in turn, with Rambo ultimately scooping up the snake by its neck and securing it in a sack. The trio return to a small boat moored on a sandbank where the stream widens into a river, sloshing through shallow water as Rambo leads the men up the boat's gangplank. The boat is on a lake, silhouetted against the sun, where Rambo stands on the prow with a bow and arrow. His arrow has a line attached, and he draws the bow-string, fires into the water, and pulls out a large fish, which has been skewered by his arrow. On a river, the boat passes a small canoe with two men and a small boy, and one of Rambo's friends hands a fish to the small boy.",
    "1319": "Gin attaches the cables, then leans down to Gin. Behind Jesse, in Men's Wear, is Lois, wearing a frown of pruney disapproval, and, seeing that he's not looking, she inexplicably nudges a table of sweaters a few feet over, which makes a loud SQUEEEEEEEAK, but it's too chaotic on the floor for anyone to notice. Satisfied with her placement of the table, Lois heads out the door. Willie cracks open an ampule of Amyl Nitrate and inhales deeply, and Marcus grimaces. Jesse heads for the alarm panel near the doorway and punches the key labeled ARM, triggering an LED readout labeled ARMING to count down from 30 seconds. Marcus arrives at the vent above the surveillance room, reaches in his pocket, pulls out the remote control Lois bought, and aims it down into the room, causing the huge bank of VCRs to power down. Marcus arrives at the precipice of a descending duct as Willie stares at the safe and continues to stare, licking his lips. Meanwhile, Marcus emerges from a stockroom with a cart to begin his shopping spree, starting in Ladies' Accessories, finding the cashmere scarf, while Willie applies a stethoscope to the safe, tapping with one hand and listening intently. Marcus moves to Evening Wear, jumping to try to pull a stole off a mannequin. Willie applies and then pulls back a drill from the safe, batters a chisel into the seam of the safe door, and is atop the safe, swinging a sledgehammer at the lock. Marcus keeps leaping at the mannequin, swings at its knees with a golf club, and, having chopped it down, drags off its stole. Willie uses a plasma welder on the safe, returns to batter it with the sledgehammer, roaring with each swing, and then hunches at the back of the safe, stethoscope to its surface, giving exploratory taps with two knuckles. Through the stethoscope, hollow THUNKS are heard followed by an unnaturally loud and present CREEEEEEEEAK, and Willie reacts quizzically. After a considering moment, he rises, and one can see the safe door finishes creaking open as Marcus enters the room. Willie looks at Marcus, who starts removing stacks of cash and loading them into the Santa sack. A big, fuzzy, smiling, pink stuffed elephant is seen, and Willie's hand hesitates between this elephant and a purple one behind it, finally taking the pink one after briefly leaving with the purple. Willie turns around holding the stuffed elephant to find Marcus and Lois standing there, with Lois presenting a grotesque picture: she has a shopping cart filled with shoes, scarves, jewels, a salad spinner, purses, a block of Ginsu knives, and an abdomen exerciser.",
    "1155": "Krum strides past wearing a singlet, followed by a group of giggling girls, and Hermione looks flustered. In class, Ron whispers to Harry, and Snape clips his ear. Fred passes Ron a note and then throws the crumpled note at Angelina, pointing to her, miming dancing, and then pointing to himself. Angelina gives him a thumbs up, and Fred winks at Ron. Snape swipes Ron and Harry with a book, and she gets up, hands her book to Snape, and returns before stalking off. Snape hits them again. A blanket of snow lies over Hogwarts as Harry, hands pushed deep inside his pockets, runs up the stone steps to the owlery and stamps the snow off his boots. At the door, he almost bumps into Cho coming out, and they sidestep each other in the doorway. Harry swallows hard and later lies moodily in the common room, clutching the golden egg. Ron is led in by Ginny, and Harry runs after Parvati and Padma on the evening of the Yule Ball. Lights shine from the Durmstrang galleon on the frozen lake as excited students gather in the entrance to the great hall. The girls wear long gowns, and the boys dress robes. In his room, Ron adjusts his tatty robe and stares at himself in the mirror. Harry comes in wearing a smart black robe and a white bow tie, sniffs his armpit, and looks in the mirror again. On the stairs, Ron hurries Padma away, and she follows reluctantly. Harry spots Cho with Cedric as Parvati sees Hermione slowly descending the stairs. Harry turns his attention from Cho and sees Hermione looking like a princess in pink, her hair softly curled as she smiles at him shyly. Krum is in dress uniform with a fur-trimmed cloak over his shoulder, clicking his heels and bowing. Hermione takes his arm and gives Harry an excited little wave as the huge doors swing open. The Triwizard competitors and their partners process into the great hall, with Harry looking very apprehensive as he walks stiffly beside Parvati. Padma stares at Hermione as snow falls from the enchanted ceiling. Clutching Harry's arm, Parvati waves to her friends as he clutches her waist and she guides him around the floor. Harry lifts her awkwardly into the air and swings her around while Dumbledore leads Professor McGonagall onto the dance floor. Filch dances with his cat, and Viktor Krum swings Hermione high into the air as Cedric dances past with Cho. Neville confidently takes to the floor with Ginny and spins her around with ease. Exposing his metal leg, Mad-Eye Moody sits in an alcove wearing a kilt and a ferret sporran, swings from his hip flask, and gives a shudder. Hagrid sidles over to the towering Madame Maxime and gives her a wink, gesturing towards the dance floor.",
    "1053": "Darcy is striding towards Pemberley, his wet shirt clinging to his broad chest, as his groom leads the horse behind him. The groom goes off in one direction, and Darcy in the other. He emerges from the trees into a field filled with buttercups and makes his way down the hill towards the large lake fronting Pemberley, its classic lines reflected in the still waters. Lizzie is also making her way down to the lake, lost in thought, and she turns to see Darcy striding out of the woods towards her. Darcy stops dead in his tracks, bows, then continues on his way just as the Gardiners come down the hill towards Lizzie, who's looking a little unsettled. Darcy hurries down some steps into the courtyard, quickly pulling on his coat, pauses for a moment to decide which direction to go, then marches off through an archway, where he catches up with Lizzie. He walks off and Mrs. Gardiner takes Lizzie's arm, and they set off after Darcy and Mr. Gardiner, who are walking a few paces ahead. When they stop to look at the view, Lizzie hangs back, and Darcy comes over to her, leaving the Gardiners to their admiration of the countryside, and he and Lizzie walk on together. Lizzie keeps her gaze averted from him as the party continues their walk through the trees, with Lizzie and Darcy a fair distance ahead of the Gardiners. Later, Darcy is helping Lizzie up into her carriage and as the carriage draws away, Darcy stands watching it. Lizzie turns to see him grow ever smaller in the distance. A lady's hand is at work on a delicate piece of floral embroidery, with smooth rocks sculpted by the wind and the beautiful countryside of the Peak District stretching out to the horizon. Lizzie is walking down a narrow, cobbled street, and a young woman leans out of a top window of a building as Lizzie passes below. Lizzie looks surprised, goes inside, and heads straight into the parlor, where Mr. Darcy is sitting waiting for her. As soon as he sees her enter, he leaps up from his seat, bows in greeting and Lizzie curtsies in return. He indicates a young woman standing on the other side of the room, and Lizzie goes over. The two ladies curtsy, and Mr. Darcy nods and leaves the room. Lizzie looks at Georgiana and smiles. Mr. Bingley enters the room, Georgiana curtsies, and leaves them to it. That evening, Mr. Darcy watches Lizzie with adoring eyes as she plays and sings at the piano, with a number of guests gathered in the drawing room to listen, including Mr. Bingley, the Gardiners, Louisa Hurst, and Miss Bingley, who has a sour look on her face.",
    "915": "Alvin nods and heads off as Pete and Homer swagger off. Dillinger leans toward Red, who eyes the brunette in the red dress as she returns to her table. Anna leads a young woman to Red, then follows Red and Veronica as they stroll away, leaving Dillinger alone. He stares at the brunette in the red dress, who laughs and beams. The gang leader sips his drink and stands, keeping his eyes locked on the exotic woman. He strides resolutely through the crowd, halts just behind her, and leans onto her chair. She looks up at him, and he gives his head a stunned shake. Her bright red lips smile coyly, and she grins at the other women seated at her table before sashaying off with Dillinger. He warily locks eyes with her, then looks away. Billie leads the way to the dance floor, where he takes her hand, and she places her other hand on his shoulder. They sway together as Billie smiles. Dillinger gazes off shyly, then finds her lovely face, and Billie stares back defiantly. Her dark eyes probe his as they sway with the music, and she allows a faint smile. Dillinger summons up a breath and arches his brows, and her smile broadens. On stage, the songstress gazes out over the crowded dance floor. Later, Billie and Dillinger stride through the club's foyer, with Billie wrapping her crimson jacket tight around her body. They step outside, and she winces against a gust of wind as Dillinger turns her to face him and drapes his overcoat over her shoulders. She grins bashfully and continues down the sidewalk with his jacket and arm around her. In an elegant restaurant later, Billie uneasily scans her surroundings, then looks to Dillinger, smiles, and glances at a female diner. The snobbish woman gives her the eye, and Billie's smile briefly falters. Dillinger flashes an amused smile and sits back but then breaks off, eyeing another table. Billie and Dillinger lock gazes, and under Billie's thick, dark eyelashes and graceful nose, a faint smile curls the corners of her lips. Dillinger stands and holds her chair as she gets up, then guides her through the restaurant with a hand at her back until they face a coat check counter. At a bar, a stocky man with slicked-back hair notices them. Dillinger glances at the man over his shoulder, then leans toward Billie and steps away. Billie, irritably shifting her gaze, then glares at him and yanks on her coat before she storms out. The two men shake hands as Nitti, a lean man with dark, slick hair and a handlebar mustache, slouches as he eats. A short, husky man with olive skin and a toothbrush mustache approaches Dillinger, and they shake hands before D'Andrea leaves.",
    "1124": "Two eyes staring are followed by Rufus Scrimgeour, the Minister of Magic, being photographed at a press conference. At home, Hermione reads the headlines in the Daily Prophet while Harry Potter's uncle, Vernon, drags a suitcase to his car as Harry watches from his bedroom window. Outside the rebuilt Weasleys' home, Ron stands staring over the wreath beds toward the horizon as his mother and sister, Ginny, are busy in the kitchen. Ron glances briefly behind him before turning back to the wreath beds. Hermione's parents watch TV as she looks at them sadly and raises her wand, causing the tip to glow. The images of Hermione as a baby and a young child slowly fade from view in the photographs on the mantelpiece. Hermione's eyes fill with tears as she sees herself disappearing from every photograph in the home. Harry's Aunt Petunia sits in a car, staring blankly, while Uncle Vernon looks nervously at the sky and Dudley clambers into the backseat. Harry stands alone on the path watching them go. Standing outside her front door, Hermione looks back for a moment, then with her head lowered, walks down the path and strides along the street, her long wavy hair ruffled by a breeze as she carries a small beaded bag. A Death Eater, a dark shadowy figure, zooms over the countryside towards a large manor house on a country estate, descending to the ground. The Death Eater walks towards the gates, waves his wand to make them evaporate, allowing him to step through, his face somber with dark, lank, shoulder-length hair, and the gates reappear behind him. Snape enters a bare storeroom and climbs a flight of stairs to where people are seated at a long table in front of a blazing fire, and at the end of the table, a woman hangs horizontally in mid-air. Snape sits close to Voldemort as a huge snake glides on the floor beside Pius Thicknesse. Voldemort turns to Snape and she shrinks back. He passes behind the Malfoys as Lucius Malfoy turns his face twitching as he reaches for his wand, his hand shaking as he holds it out to Voldemort, who runs his fingers over it, then snaps off its handle. Snape watches keenly as Voldemort discards the handle, and Lucius trembles while Voldemort points the wand at the floating woman, who pleads with Snape as he stares coldly. Voldemort flicks the wand and she falls dead on the table, causing Draco Malfoy to wince and a single tear to fall from Charity's eye. Voldemort strokes the snake, which glides onto the table and slithers towards the dead woman, its tongue flickering and mouth opening wide. Albus Dumbledore falls from the astronomy tower, floating gently downwards.",
    "356": "The screaming Nazgûl fall from the sky in flames as the ground shakes so violently that Frodo and Sam can barely stand. Frodo stumbles, and Sam helps him up. Frodo smiles, and Sam looks down at Frodo, whose face is at peace with his burden destroyed. Frodo and Sam crawl onto a rock as lava streams towards them, and in seconds, their rock becomes an island in a sea of molten lava. Frodo shuts his eyes and then glances at Sam, who is weeping. Frodo wraps an arm around Sam's shoulder as the two tiny hobbits wait to die amid the cataclysmic landscape, with lava erupting around them and fireballs raining down from the sky. The scene slowly fades to black. Gwaihir, the great eagle, flaps towards the camera, bearing Gandalf on his back and followed by two more eagles. The eagles bravely fly amid the raining ash and molten rocks and snatch Frodo and Sam from the rock. Frodo's face can be seen as the fiery volcano recedes away beneath him, and the wind ruffles his hair before he passes out. Frodo's eyes flutter open, and he looks around slowly; his eyes alight on Gandalf, whose face breaks into a smile. There is laughter as Merry and Pippin run in, jumping on the bed and hugging Frodo. Gimli and Legolas enter the room, their joy plain. Aragorn joins them, and the Fellowship is complete. Finally, Frodo's eyes fall upon a figure standing apart from the others: it is Sam. Frodo's and Sam's eyes meet. The scene sweeps over the Minas Tirith walls, racing towards the top of the city through a blizzard of white flower petals as Minas Tirith is restored and gleams white. Soaring up, the scene reveals the Court of the Kings, crowded with 4000 people cramming the wide path leading to the tower. The Crown of Gondor glints in the brilliant light as Gandalf places it upon Aragorn's head. Aragorn smiles up at Gandalf and slowly rises, turning to face the crowd, who cheer and clap for their king. The cheers of his people are deafening as Aragorn sings for them, then walks in slow procession down the white-paved path while the crowd bows their heads in respect to their new king. Aragorn passes Eowyn and Faramir, who bow before him, and Éomer steps forward to bow in respect. Trumpets sound as a procession of elves, dressed in shimmering silvers and whites, led by Legolas, approach the king. Legolas gestures behind him, and Aragorn’s eyes scan among the elves. A banner is carried aloft bearing the White Tree of Gondor in full flower. The ranks of elves part, revealing Arwen, her eyes shining. Mortal now, but deeply in love, she is carrying the standard of Gondor. Aragorn kisses her as Elrond looks on, his face breaking into a smile. Aragorn and Arwen embrace, then walk through the crowd towards four small figures who stand nervously at the end of the procession.",
    "559": "Donovan strides across the room toward Indy, exuding confidence and power while dressed in a tuxedo, and shakes hands with Indy. Donovan goes to a table where an object is wrapped in cloth, throws back the cloth revealing a flat stone tablet about two feet square, inscribed with letters and symbols, and puts on his glasses to make a closer examination. Donovan pours champagne into several fluted glasses as Indy reads. Suddenly, Indy stops and looks up at Donovan with a startled expression, then rubs his chin with a dubious expression as he takes the glass of champagne Donovan now offers him. Indy stiffens slightly at the mention of his father and nods. The door opens and Mrs. Donovan, a matronly woman in an expensive evening gown, steps into the room. Donovan leans over and kisses her cheek, and she sighs to herself and returns to the party. Indy, meanwhile, has turned his attention back to the Grail Tablet, obviously hooked by its archaeological promise. He moistens his finger with champagne and rubs it over the Tablet, as Donovan steps up next to him. Indy has to shake his head at Donovan’s apparent lack of judgment. Donovan produces an ancient leather-bound volume with very brittle pages, and Indy views the manuscript with considerable interest. A Ford coupe speeds down the tree-lined street and pulls up in front of the house. Indy climbs from the car and hurries up the walkway, with Brody a step behind. They climb the porch, notice that the front door is ajar, and exchange a quick look of concern as they enter. Indy approaches the half-open front door, pushes open the door, and enters the house, calling out. Indy opens one half of the curtains dividing the hall from the sitting room to reveal the place has been ransacked. Brody sees Indy's face and opens the other half, and they walk into the room. Brody picks up some mail from Henry's cluttered desk, and Indy turns to see the pile of torn papers and envelopes. He immediately empties his pockets of his own mail taken earlier in the day from his college office and finds the envelope with the Venice postmark. Indy uncovers a small book that looks like a journal or diary and flips through it, finding page after page of handwritten notes and drawings. Brody glances at it with great curiosity. As Indy asks the question, he turns to a painting on the wall depicting Christ on the Cross, his blood being captured in a golden chalice, and a second painting showing Eleventh Century Crusaders plummeting to their deaths over a high cliff, with one Crusader floating safely in midair because he holds the Grail in his hands.",
    "1362": "Mike exits the stage door and walks into the alley, followed by the confused camera crew. As Abby looks horrified, the phones in the control room start ringing off the hook, and realizing her defeat, Abby sighs and grabs the microphone for Mike's earpiece. On the monitor, there is a slightly puzzled look from Mike, but he lifts the girl's finger and licks the Jello off it. As Mike waves to the camera, he's pulled into the Jello pool and the girls rip off his shirt. Mike walks in, covered in Jello, to find Abby standing there, arms crossed, quietly containing her rage, and she walks off. Confused by her reaction, he follows. Close on Stuart, wearing a grave expression, Abby nods, uncomfortable. Strategically placed cardboard suns and clouds cover her bosom. Abby covers the cat's eyes, then looks away, but a moment later, she's looking back in the window, to see Colin step out of the shower. Abby leans closer to see Colin start flossing, wearing only a towel, and she freezes. Mike approaches them, and she turns and walks off. Abby enters her office, and Mike follows her. Colin, in a white doctor's jacket, talks on the phone while going over patient files. Mike picks up the extension and listens in. Abby glares at him, but she can't stop him. A concerned look from Abby as the phone rings, she thinks, looks at the phone again, and she answers the phone. A confused look from Colin as he talks on the phone. Abby hesitates, there is a long pause, and then Mike hangs up the phone and hustles her out of the room. Night has fallen on the condo complex as Abby enters, looking amazing in a little black dress and slingbacks, and she grabs his ass. Switching tactics, Abby slips into seductress mode, tracing her finger up and down his arm, leans into him seductively, gives him a look, leans in closer, and then he shoves her away. Mike leaps over the couch and hides as Abby walks over to the door and opens it. Colin stands there, and she hustles him out the door. Abby realizes she's spoken aloud and blanches, waiting for Mike's instructions, she grabs a napkin and starts rubbing his khakis. The Jumbotron camera follows the guy catching the fly, then finds Abby and Colin, pans over to them, and it looks like Abby is giving Colin an enthusiastic hand job. The entire stadium, ballplayers included, stop what they're doing and stare. Colin gives a wave and walks toward his condo. Abby pretends to enter her house until she sees Colin close his front door, then she turns around and rushes over to Mike and throws her arms around him, embracing him, and Mike pulls back, a little uncomfortable.",
    "653": "Under a moody blue sky with tearing white and gold clouds, a woman in Grecian style robes holds aloft a shining torch. Pages of comic magazines flip by, with words like \"bap\" and \"boom,\" and finally the word \"marvel\" appears. A ray of blue light shines, and the scene cuts to starring Tobey Maguire. It feels like someone is punching through a red, smoky tunnel, but the spider's web is always present. A muscular arm and a clenched hand are entwined in the web as the hand stretches up to catch more silk threads. A sharp-featured head, resembling a mask with long pointed ears, a humped nose, barred teeth, and a jutting jaw, appears. The opening titles continue with an animated background of skyscrapers. Two hands touch fingertips to fingertips, the picture spins, and window frames appear, revealing a large guy eating a doughnut. A youth chases a school bus, which stops to let him on; he has dark hair and spectacles. The pasty-faced young man, Timothy, makes his way down the bus while a girl with her hair in bunches and big spectacles puts her books in the empty seat beside her. Flash Thompson, with his arm around Mary Jane, nods to another student as the doughnut eater shakes his head. Young Parker keeps walking, his eyes fixed on Mary Jane, not noticing a leg stuck out in front of him, causing him to tumble to the floor and his specs to fall off. The yellow school bus rolls on, arriving outside Columbia University. As Parker approaches Mary Jane, she smiles and waves, but he realizes she was greeting her girlfriends behind him, leaving him embarrassed. A Rolls Royce pulls out, and a sulky young man clamors out to address Parker. Peter and Harry turn away, with Peter pointing his camera as Flash Thompson bumps into him. Harry goes over to Mary Jane, and Peter overhears their conversation. Harry turns to Peter and grins as the spider hovers above. A teacher leads Harry away, and Peter stares at the curious Mary Jane standing in front of the display of spiders in their transparent plastic cages. Wide-eyed, Peter gazes forlornly at her as she moves to the side of the display, and he stands in front of a TV monitor. Unbeknownst to them, the missing super spider begins to ease its way down a silky thread from its newly spun web while Mary Jane continues to pose with notes in hand. The spider inches its way down towards Peter, and as it settles on his hand, Mary Jane's friend calls to her, and she turns to leave. The spider bites Peter, who shakes it off, sending it landing on the gray carpeted floor where it scuttles away. Peter examines the bite, noticing a circle of red around the already swollen area on the back of his hand.",
    "1320": "A dark shape, growing and coming down fast, appears in the reflection as a dark figure in a tattered trench coat tumbles onto the pavement, hands out to slow the impact. After a moment, he climbs to his feet, recovering from what seems to have been quite a fall. He has chiseled features, a shaved head, and deep-set eyes. He quickly checks his surroundings, seeing nothing but brick walls above him. Then the rain starts to hammer down, and Michael pulls his overcoat tight around his body, dashing toward the mouth of the alley. He reaches the street just in time to see a fleet of police cars tearing around the corner, sirens wailing, heading his way. He runs his finger along its edge. Michael begins to peel off his overcoat, revealing his bare chest underneath, which is covered with dark tattoos. As his coat falls to the ground, we drift over to the brick wall behind him where we see Michael's shadow crouch over. The rain pounds harder, seemingly as punishment from the heavens. The glint of a knife comes down fast, and then silence. Michael, his face tight with pain, puts his trench coat back on, steps out of the alley, and stares with determination at a dark storefront across the street. SMASH! Michael drops down through one of the skylights in a shower of glass and bursts in. He tosses a first-aid kit into the sink, then his trench coat falls to the floor; under the fluorescent light, we get a better look at him. He turns his back to the mirror, revealing two horrifically open wounds running between both shoulder blades. He threads a needle, not with thread but with fishing wire, and begins to stitch the wounds closed as blood pools on the cement floor around his feet. Trench coat and shirt back on, Michael races along endless racks of guns, searching for just the right weapons, his every movement precise as if he's trained his whole life for this. Weapon after ferocious weapon gets tossed into rifle bags. Rifle bags filled, Michael heads for the exit. The place is locked up tight, with a metal gate over the front doors and bars over the windows. Two cops, world weary, cruise through downtown. Burton stares out at the city's rain-soaked denizens with a deep hatred for the shadows looming in doorways and the streetwalkers. He holds his finger up like a pistol, aiming it at the people they pass, picking them off one by one. In the distance, the pop-pop of gunfire is heard. The police radio crackles with urgent chatter and many voices talking at once as Michael lets the gun bags hit the ground. Slowly, Michael places his palms on his skull.",

In an office, Debbie faces her gynecologist. Debbie cocks her head, her mouth twitching. She stares, her head tilted to the side. Averting her woeful gaze, she rubs her fingers across her throat. The doctor's smile fades. Fighting tears, she nods then shakes her head. Gazing upward, Debbie rubs her brow and throat. She strokes her forehead. Now, the sunlight casts a bright glow off of Debbie's long, golden blonde hair as she drives. Pouting, she lifts her chin and leans back against the headrest. She takes a deep breath. Debbie props her elbow on the windowsill and rubs her knuckles against her temple. She starts to smile, then presses her lips together and blinks back tears. Debbie takes the steering wheel in both hands and allows a hopeful smile. In his office, Pete sits at his desk glowering. He presses his lips together. Going to a wall, he takes down a framed piece of artwork. Now, Pete clutches the crude pen and ink drawing as he stands at his father's front door. On a stage, kids paint a set. Sadie's parents watch from a row in the back. Debbie stares at him. Now, the school's outdoor walkways bustle with kids around Sadie's age. Walking a more isolated path, Debbie spots a blonde boy with a prop. She steps in close.",

Elijah smiles even bigger. Audrey's eyes become utterly still. David stands at the lip of a tunnel that opens out onto the upper section of the second level. Waves of people move from their seats through the tunnel to the bathrooms and concession stands and back again. David stares to the side away from the movement, his shoulder leaned up against the wall. His shoulder leaves the wall. He steps out into the stream of people. Shoulders and arms bump into him and brush by him as they move. David's eyes are looking down -- his expression still -- like he's listening. He's in the heaviest part of the movement now. Fans continue to brush against him as they pass. And then it happens. A stocky woman bumps into him. Joseph turns to the thermometer boy. David nods. David stares at the white-haired nurse.

Joseph follows him with the barrel of the handgun. David stops moving. Joseph stops moving. Joseph's small face tenses. Confusion mixes with the desperation on his face. Joseph looks up, tears streaming down his cheeks. Joseph starts pressing the trigger. The hammer clicks back. Joseph freezes. David flashes a desperate glance at Audrey then back to Joseph. David becomes still as his words register. David looks unsteady all of a sudden. Elijah seems shaken for the first time. David stares at him coldly. The top of the man's head doesn't move. Ponytail man closes his register and walks towards the back. As he gets closer to the customer, he realizes that the man is in a wheelchair. The Ponytail man walks up to Elijah. He sits in his chair in a quiet daze. Ponytail man leans over. The Ponytail man shakes his head, moves behind Elijah. He starts wheeling him towards the front of the store. They move down a narrow aisle of comics. Elijah suddenly grabs the left wheel and turns the chair. His immobilized left leg hits a rack of comic books.",
    "1099": "He steps on the cigarette. Having just pulled the cover over the car, he stares at Ashley incredulously, and steps over to the door. He spits and walks out. Ashley rolls her eyes. Walt opens his front door to a teenager, Thao. Walt slams the door and turns to the priest. Walt shoves past the fresh-faced priest, Father Janovich. Next door, a steady stream of Southeast Asian Hmong people walk up to the front door. Most carry plates or bowls of food. As mourners leave, Walt uses jump leads to get a woman's car started. Mitch drives up in a Toyota Land Cruiser. Walt straightens up and stares at the silver four-by-four as it departs. Walt puts his jump leads on a garden table, and walks up onto the back porch. Looks across at his neighbor and their friends gathered in the garden. Walt snarls. An elder in ceremonial dress prepares to slaughter a chicken. Next door, a grandmother talks to a middle-aged man. The extended family gather before the elder, Kor Khue. He shakes a hoop with metal rings on it. Beside him is a young woman holding a baby, which is wrapped in a brightly embroidered papoose. He lays the hoop on the carpet and throws a horn split in two into it. Thao walks out of the back door. With cupped hands, Kor Khue gestures to the mother and child. Beside them, the father raises his hands. Next door, Walt sweeps his drive with a broom. His Labrador Daisy scampers down the front steps. Walt looks at next door's garden as Thao walks up his front steps. The grass is thin and parched. Grandma sits on the porch and watches Walt. Grandma mutters to herself. Glaring at her, Walt spits. Grandma spits copiously. Walt grimaces. Inside, he leans down to Daisy by the front door. Walt opens the door to Father Janovich. Walt shuts the door. Thao wanders along by a high chain link fence, browsing through a book. A large black sedan with side exhaust pipes rolls up. Two heavy-duty Latino guys lean out of the window. Thao keeps walking. Thao smiles. A white car with five South Asian guys in it stops up ahead. The driver, Spider, has long black hair and wears a bandanna. He sees Thao. Spider drives down the road and stops beside the black sedan. He and the guy he was talking to, Smokie, lean out of the window. A Latino guy has a revolver. Smokie wields a machine pistol. The Latino guys speed off. Spider reverses up beside Thao. Thao walks on, and Spider gets out. They drive off and Thao keeps walking. Later, Thao's gardening. His sister Sue is sitting on the front steps, reading.",
    "874": "Kate slowly wakes up and takes in her surroundings and looks across at Zoe, who’s staring at her. Aunt and niece gaze at each other for a few moments, then Kate sits up and stares unblinkingly at the young girl. Tears roll down Zoe's face, and Kate nods sadly. Zoe's anguished face is crumpled as a tear trickles down Kate’s face. Kate walks wearily into her apartment, removes her long, red scarf from around her neck, and walks over to the answer machine. Transfixed, Kate stands in the hallway, clutching her coat, then turns and walks back towards the door. At the restaurant, they all turn and stare as Kate walks in and past them, while Paula puts her wineglass down. In the empty kitchen, Kate ties her apron around her waist, and without looking at Paula, Kate walks away. Concerned, Leah looks over at Kate, who seems distracted, her eyes filling with tears. Kate crouches on the floor of the walk-in fridge with Christine's letter, and Paula looks in at her through a window in the door. Distraught, Kate looks up as Paula enters, nodding, her chin quivering, while Paula takes hold of Kate's hands. In Zoe's hospital room, Kate walks in, goes to the end of Zoe’s bed, and places her bag down on the over-bed table. Kate takes the bag and places it on a chair by the window, puts her handbag beside it, and takes off her coat and scarf as she talks to Zoe. Zoe goes back to watching the Bugs Bunny cartoon as Kate sits in the chair beside her bed. Zoe looks away but gives a faint nod and turns back to the TV. A yellow taxicab drives along a New York street, with Zoe in the back seat, looking out through the rain-splashed window as if in a trance. The cab pulls up, and Zoe and Kate get out. Zoe slings a red rucksack over her shoulder and stands looking up at Kate’s apartment building, a smart brownstone with a wide set of steps leading up to an arched entranceway. Inside, Kate shows Zoe around the apartment, walks down a hallway, and Zoe walks slowly into her new bedroom, which is light and airy, with a large bay window and window seat and a huge double bed. At a cemetery high on a hill overlooking the city, Zoe stares morosely at her mother's casket, which sits by the graveside. As other mourners begin to disburse, Zoe turns to Kate, and the two of them walk slowly away. A large, lifelike, cuddly toy giraffe is carried up the steps of Kate's brownstone, followed by more toys and a bike being taken inside, while Zoe carries a stuffed elephant. A collection of cuddly toys is arranged around Zoe’s room.",
    "354": "Sam can't believe it—relief and joy flood through him. Smack! Out of nowhere, the figure of Smeagol crashes into them, sending Sam and Frodo sprawling. Smeagol pounces on Frodo, his fingers wrapping around Frodo's throat, snapping Frodo's neck from side to side. Frodo struggles to unlock the bony, white fingers around his neck, but Smeagol's grip is too strong. Smeagol's fingers tighten around Frodo's neck, squeezing the life out of him. Whack! A rock connects with the side of Smeagol's head. Sam jumps on a stunned Smeagol. The battle between men and orcs rages on. From Mordor, high overhead, the Nazgul fly out into the fray. All the old hatred between Sam and Smeagol boils over as they fight. Sam falls back, and Smeagol bites at him. Sam pushes Smeagol away with his feet, rolls to his knees, as Smeagol charges at him. Sam slashes out with Sting, cutting Smeagol across the stomach. Smeagol staggers back, screaming with pain. Sam looks around desperately for Frodo. The eagles engage the Nazgul. Sam is gasping, his lungs exploding as he races up the slopes of Mount Doom searching for Frodo. Sam arrives at the stone doorway of Sammath Naur leading into the mountain and staggers into it. Sam flinches against the fierce heat blasting down the tunnel. Sam lurches forward towards an orange glow deep in the heart of the mountain. The heat is almost unbearable. Sam sees Frodo standing on the edge of the Crack of Doom, a deep lava-filled chasm in the very heart of ancient Sauron's forges, the greatest in Middle-earth. The raging orange glare from the chasm turns Frodo into a black silhouette, standing tense and still. Frodo holds the Ring in his hand and raises it over the bubbling lava far below, a strange expression on his face. The hum of the Ring grows louder and louder. Frodo pulls the Ring close to his body as he turns to Sam. Frodo looks at Sam; the Ring has finally taken him. Sam screams as Frodo puts the Ring on and vanishes. With a storm of wings, the Nazgul wheel around and hurtle towards Mount Doom. In the midst of the battle, Gandalf realizes Frodo has been seen. Footprints move across the ash-covered cavern. Suddenly, Gollum smashes a rock down on Sam's head, knocking him to the ground. Gollum leaps onto the invisible Frodo's footprints, clawing frantically, riding on the back of the invisible Frodo. Aragorn turns and is confronted by an armoured troll wielding an enormous mallet. Gollum suddenly lifts his hands to his face and bites.",
    "927": "Bond guns the engine and speeds off as the general points and roars, and an inflatable comes speeding after him. The general's men open fire while Camille and Bond struggle, causing the boat to swerve sideways. Bond regains control, and they duck a hail of bullets and stare straight at the inflatable. Camille takes out a gunman with a boat hook, then the inflatable turns for another run. The swerving boats kick up fountains of spray, and Bond crashes through more boats as their pursuers exchange frantic hand signals to coordinate a two-boat attack. Bond speeds at the two inflatables head-on, crashing between them and sending men sprawling. One gunman wrestles with his weapon as Bond rams an engine, which explodes. Bond grabs the wheel as the other boat closes in, the chase heading for the tightly packed marina. Bond throttles back, causing the other boat to rear-end them so hard it mounts their stern, knocking Camille down. With the two boats locked together, Bond grabs a grappling hook and throws it into the inflatable. The rope unrolls and becomes taut, hurling the inflatable away from their boat. Bond turns the boat around in calm water and heads away from the scene with barely a backward glance. With Camille unconscious in the bottom of the boat, Bond heads from a quiet inlet with rolling tree-covered highlands towards a landing stage near a development of opulent white buildings. He stops the boat at the jetty and carries Camille through crowds of retirement-aged tourists, dumping her on a puzzled member of staff. Bond walks past luxury yachts being maneuvered on trailers and consults the GPS tracker on his phone. He approaches a 4 by 4 with its door open, looks around the yard, then slips behind the wheel. He drives through rundown suburbs and makes a call to his neat glass-partitioned headquarters. Meanwhile, an agent heads for M's office, and two black 4 by 4s arrive at an airfield. Dominic Greene and his guard get out of the car; Greene walks onto an executive jet. The plane carrying Greene and the black agent with a beard takes off. The thin German adds sugar to coffee, turbulence hits as Greene returns from a comfort break, and the black agent glares at him. Greene looks noncommittal, while his colleague smiles coldly and shows Beam Bond's photo on his camera. The phone is tossed to the surly agent, who studies the picture, closes the phone, and hands it back, then eyeballs his colleague. The jet taxis outside a hangar, and Greene gets into a car, glancing up at the CIA agents and grinning. Felix gives a bitter smile, then follows Beam up the plane's steps.",
    "343": "Everything depends on Frodo going inside the tunnel. Frodo stares into the darkness. Gollum, his sparse oily hair hanging like rank weed over his hooded eyes, leads the way. Drawing a deep breath, Frodo follows Gollum into the tunnel. They continue on, deep into the dark tunnel. Frodo feels his way in the dark, following the sound of Gollum's scampering. Frodo follows the sound of Gollum's voice. He is very tired. Frodo cannot see Gollum in the murky tunnel. Frodo slips as he tries to follow the voice. He puts his hand to the wall to steady himself but quickly yanks it away. Strands of a white thread are stuck to his hand. Gollum is nowhere to be seen. Frodo is breathing hard, passing all manner of creatures trussed up in evil web-like material. There is a creaking as some great jointed thing moves with slow purpose in the dark. Frodo begins to run in blind panic. Meanwhile, Sam stumbles blindly down the ancient stairs, reckless and uncaring, his face pale and devastated. Sam's foot slips. Suddenly, as if the ground has given way beneath him, Sam is slipping and sliding dangerously out of control. Sam thuds into a large rock, which saves him from tumbling headlong over the precipice. Something catches Sam's eye, and he stares, barely breathing—a package of lembas bread. Sam looks back up the long steep stair. Frodo is running blindly; he falls, trapped in the sticky substance which clings to him. As he lays on the ground, unable to move, a voice comes to him as if from a distant memory. Frodo fumbles in his jacket, fear growing in him as he pulls out the glass phial—his gift from Galadriel—and holds it aloft. Gollum is on the other side of the web. Frodo slashes wildly with Sting. The shining blade of Sting hacks through the fibrous strands. They whip and snap back into Frodo's face as he cuts himself free. Back up the tunnel, lit by the Light of Galadriel, Shelob's heaving shadow approaches. Disbelief turns to fear as Shelob gets closer and closer; Gollum quickly turns and bolts. Frodo hacks at the web and, with a last desperate lunge, frees himself. Sting is caught in the web. Frodo leaves the sword and throws himself through a narrow crevice. Frodo stumbles out of Shelob's lair, tumbling onto cold rock, covered in cobwebs, wild-eyed and drenched in sweat. He looks up as Gollum lunges at him. Gollum and Frodo fight, rolling on the ground towards the edge of a precipice. Frodo pins Gollum on the ground, hands around his throat. Frodo's fingers squeeze tighter around Gollum's, but he has a sudden moment of self-realization and releases Gollum, horrified at his violence.",
    "290": "Doyle gives her a scathing look and Jeff challenges Doyle. Lisa answers, but very coldly, as Doyle hesitates a moment, letting his eyes wander to the overnight case with Lisa's lingerie, before his eyes go back to Jeff. Jeff replies, pointedly, while Lisa looks down at Jeff, not comprehending. Meanwhile, Doyle is wiping his coat lapels with a handkerchief. Neither Jeff nor Lisa display even the slightest friendliness; their faces are cold and set. Doyle looks at them pleasantly, starts away toward the door, as Lisa, still burning, then speaks icily. Doyle picks up his hat, relaxed, and poises on the step, snapping his fingers. He starts up the steps to the door, puts on his hat, smiles, and says something before quietly closing the door behind him. Jeff turns his chair around and looks out to the neighborhood, with Lisa standing glumly behind him. None of the gaiety is reflected in Lisa and Jeff, despite it being a happy, gay affair at the songwriter's party, now in full swing and fairly crowded. Miss Torso's apartment has the door closed, and all we can see of her are her legs swinging in arcs as she exercises to record music. During this, she has been staring out at Thorwald's apartment, but Lisa is not looking in the same direction as Jeff. She murmurs to Jeff, and now her eyes are looking at the apartment underneath. Jeff turns his eyes in the same direction as hers, witnessing the surprise of seeing her return with a lover hooked, who is much younger than she and more keyed up to the promise of an adventure still fresh to him. A light has gone on in Miss Lonely Hearts' apartment, and they look on. Her actions are coy and over-feminine, and as she sips her drink looking at him over the rim of the glass, he tosses his off with nervous dispatch. He moves toward her more cautiously this time, leading to an embrace and a long kiss. He begins kissing her cheek, ear, and neck, but suddenly and fiercely she pushes him away, slapping him across the face. He moves back with shock as she loudly and emphatically orders him out. He flushes with anger and embarrassment, his mouth twisting into unpleasant shapes as he slaps degrading words back at her, telling her what she is, and she screams at him to get out. He leaves, slamming the door behind him, as she goes back dumbly to the spilled liquor, making a futile effort to clean it up before collapsing onto the rug, sobbing hard enough to shake her whole body. Meanwhile, Lisa turns away from Jeff's chair to get a cigarette from the table.",
    "404": "She goes back into the room and begins taking things up, flinging down men's clothes, leather trousers, a suitcase, and a teddy bear. Fergus looks to the man down in the street, a parody of rejection with his things in his arms. Dil grabs a large goldfish bowl and flings it down, which breaks to bits on the pavement, and goldfish thrash around in the street. Upstairs, Dil closes the window shut. Fergus stands as Dil hands him a glass, and he walks past the photograph and sits down. He looks from her to the picture, nods toward it, and she looks down into her drink. They fall into one another's arms, and she stretches up with her whole body over him as they grow suddenly and violently passionate, with the photograph above them seeming to smile. He draws up her dress with his hands, but she suddenly pulls away, comes up toward him once more, opens the buttons on his shirt, and her mouth travels down his chest. Fergus tries to draw her up toward him, but her hand reaches up to his mouth and presses his head back while her other hand undoes his pants, kisses his stomach, and her mouth moves down his body. Fergus stares at the picture of Jody, whose eyes seem to burn through him. Dil raises her head and kisses his mouth, with tears in his eyes. She sits in front of the mirror, and Fergus gets up, stands behind her, and gently pushes the hair from her face. She embraces him, sits back down in front of the mirror, and Fergus leaves as she reapplies her lipstick. A singer in a blue dress performs while Dil and Fergus are by the bar, both drinking drinks with umbrellas. Dave comes up behind them with his neck brace, stands, and steps two feet back, while Fergus takes Dil's arm. The woman is singing, Dil holds her cheek close to his, looks at him out of the corner of her eye, draws back, looks at him, and dances closer. In the bar, people sing along with the music as Col sings, and Dave sits at the bar sulking. She puts her cheek against his, and Dave slams his drink down, stands up to leave, and on the stage, the act finishes. Dil draws Fergus back to the bar, Col, the barman, pours her drink, and Col pours and smiles. He drinks, grimaces, she throws it back in one, takes the bottle herself, fills their glasses, slams it back, and he sips as she tilts his glass back, and he swallows it in one. She enters; Fergus walks in slowly, and he looks from the cricket whites that are hanging up behind a curtain to the photographs.",
    "352": "Their attention is fixed on the plain below where thousands of orcs can be seen marching away from Mount Doom. Frodo and Sam move across a hellish dry landscape of twisted volcanic rock and steaming fissures. Forty miles away, Mount Doom rises out of the plain, its feet founded in ashen ruin, its huge cone rising to a great height, where its reeking head is swathed in cloud. Aragorn's force of 500 approaches the great Black Gates of Mordor and he positions his troops about half a mile from the gates. Frodo is slumped against a rock and tries to drink from his water bottle but finds it empty; he gratefully takes a small sip from Sam's bottle. There is a moment of eye contact between Frodo and Sam as they acknowledge what lies ahead, and Sam offers Frodo his hand and pulls him up. At the Black Gates, Aragorn musters his men. Frodo and Sam stagger across the tortured landscape, no longer wearing the orc armor. Frodo is walking half-bowed, often stumbling, as if his eyes no longer see the way before his feet. His right hand is pressed against his chest, supporting a heavy weight, while his left hand often rises as if to ward off some invisible blow. Sam watches him, concern etched across his face, as Frodo hears a malevolent voice in his head calling to him. Sam looks behind him in time to see a ray of red light stab through the gloom and begin to sweep over the barren landscape. Sam throws himself to the ground, and Frodo turns to the light, unable to stop himself, crumpling to the ground as the red light hits him like a searchlight. All is quiet as Gandalf is watchful, nodding at Aragorn. Aragorn, Gandalf, Legolas, Gimli, Eomer, Merry, and Pippin gallop towards the Black Gates, pulling up less than 50 yards from the towering gates. Frodo is slumped on the ground, unable to move, as Aragorn moves his horse forward. From behind the huge gates, the terrifying chanting and clanging of the armor of thousands can be heard. With the sound of tortured metal, the massive gates begin to open. Legolas, Merry, and Eomer look on in trepidation as the Eye of Sauron sweeps the plains around them, and Sam gets to his feet. The Black Gates of Mordor swing open and Sauron's army of 300,000 emerges. Aragorn, Gandalf, Legolas, Gimli, Eomer, Merry, and Pippin gallop back towards their small army as the orc masses slowly march toward them. Behind them, the Eye of Sauron is directed toward them. Frodo's eyes open with a start as Sam crawls toward him. Frodo and Sam stagger to their feet and move off as the massive orc army marches towards Aragorn's men, who are starting to waver as the orcs encircle them.",
    "716": "Meanwhile, water floods the cargo hold, knocking down the two stewards. In the front well deck, Jack pushes Rose back as the ship breaks off chunks of ice, which land on the deck and knock down two men. The ship continues moving alongside the iceberg. In the engine room, water pours in as a man scrambles past furnace stokers swept across. Jack runs to the starboard railing and watches as the back of the ship moves alongside the iceberg. Murdoch runs to the bridge and moves a lever, which closes the hydraulic watertight doors in the engine room. A man motions to the stokers. Workers run through the rising water and crawl under the lowering doors. He follows the others through one of the doorways. The door closes, leaving several stokers behind. As the others escape past closing doors, the remaining stoker dives under the last closing door and falls out as its steel hatch slams shut. On the bridge, a row of lights blinks on the watertight door indicator panel. Murdoch stares at the panel, then turns away. On the passenger deck, a man and a woman lean over the starboard rail and peer at the iceberg. In the crow's nest, Fleet turns to Lee. Jack, Rose, and the two men peer over the railing at the iceberg, now behind the ship. On the bridge, Murdoch addresses Moody. Moody glances at a wall clock as he exits. Hichens turns to the bridge door as Captain Smith enters. Murdoch follows Smith onto the bridge deck. Smith peers down from the bridge deck shelter, then stands at the bridge railing, overlooking the front well deck. Murdoch hurries off. In his cabin, Fabrizio jumps down from his bunk into inch-deep water and turns on the overhead light. His roommates follow as he opens the door. Tommy approaches. The countess steps out of her stateroom and stops a mustached steward. Andrews hurries past, carrying blueprints. Outside, smoke rises from the ship's huge funnels as people gather on the decks. Tommy, Fabrizio, and others follow running rats down a hallway. Cal and Lovejoy step out of the sitting room and stop a dark-haired steward in the hallway. The steward hurries off. On the upper deck, a dark-haired man tosses a blond man a chunk of ice. He tosses the ice back. Smith, Moody, Andrews, and Murdoch pass Jack and Rose. The master-at-arms studies Jack's drawings. Cal snatches the drawings from him. Holding hands, Jack and Rose approach Lovejoy, who stands in the hallway. Lovejoy walks alongside Jack and slips the heart of the ocean into Jack's coat pocket. Lovejoy follows Rose and Jack into the sitting room. Cal steps forward. Cal glances at Lovejoy, who arches his eyebrows.",
    "1079": "A wooden loading tunnel leads right to it. As Fletcher stares, policemen emerge from their office. Administrator Allsop looks down his telescope. Drover gallops through Carney's men and cuts the rope holding up the gate at the end of the tunnel. It drops closed, trapping the cattle inside. Drover cracks his whip as Sarah's cattle thunder down the wharf. Townspeople cheer her on as she rides past the hotel. The cattle are streaming onto a ship. Nullah rides up to Sarah. She nods and smiles triumphantly as Nullah rides behind the last of the herd. She catches Fletcher's eye. They glare at each other, and she rides towards him. He looks nervous, then blinks as she cracks her whip right in front of his face. She rides off, eyeballing him with a grin. Nullah chases the last steer onto the ship. Drover escorts Sarah to the pub through the cheering mob. She smiles with pride as two glasses are placed on the bar, and filled with Poor Fella Rum. They down the powerful brew, gasping at the strength. They laugh, staring into each other's eyes. Fletcher answers the phone at the holding yard. Carney glares down at him from the veranda of his house. Fletcher stands, shoulders slumped, by the phone. Sarah, with tears of joy in her eyes, throws her arms around Drover. Drover exercises Capricornia in a small yard. Sarah steps out on the balcony above, and watches him nuzzle the horse affectionately. She makes her way downstairs. He gets the mare to lie down. Sarah watches in amazement. He looks round, startled. He frowns and turns away. He breaks eye contact, and nods thoughtfully. He looks her in the eye and walks off, leaving her uncomfortable and disappointed. Nullah's sitting glumly by a cooking fire with Sing Song and Bandy Legs. She dips her fingers in ash. She smears black ash on his cheek, and smiles. A man watches nearby. He looks at her with his big eyes. Sitting downstairs in the black section of the audience with Sing Song, Bandy turns and looks up at the black Nullah. Sitting in the rafters near the projector, he watches wide-eyed. Everyone turns and stares as Carney swigs from a wine bottle. He approaches Sarah, who plonks his bottle on a waiter's tray. He holds out his hand. She eyes him warily. Sarah frowns as King, smiling broadly, leads her to the dance floor. Fletcher watches from the punchbowl. A photographer takes their picture. She sits and stares, thinking hard. Allsop pauses and stares. Everyone in the garden turns and looks up at the house. Sarah turns round and gasps, standing and staring. At the top of the steps leading to the garden, clean-shaven and wearing a white tuxedo, is the Drover.",
    "1177": "A horrible face appears, growing out of the back of Quirrell's head, with eyes sunk in dark sockets, and the skin stretched over the bony skull as Harry turns to run. A sheet of flame blocks his way, and they appear in the mirror. Harry takes the red stone in his pocket and looks at it as his parents disappear. Quirrell flies through the air and detects Harry, who falls over backwards, causing the glowing philosopher's stone to drop from his hand. He stretches out desperately to reach it, but Quirrell is trying to choke him. Harry grabs Quirrell's hand, which surprises him, causing Quirrell to pull away. Quirrell holds out his hand in front of him and sees it crumble into grey dust. Quirrell lurches towards the stone, and Harry's hands push against Quirrell's face, which also disintegrates into dust. Harry stares at his own hands in horror as Quirrell reaches out towards him and then crashes to the ground, his whole body turned to a pile of dust, and Voldemort has also disappeared. Puzzled, Harry stares at his hands again, then looks around for the philosopher's stone, seeing the dark red crystal lying on the stairs with a small flame flickering inside it. Harry picks it up, looks at it for a moment, smiles with relief, and clutches it tightly in his hand. He turns quickly as the cloud of swirling dust gathers behind him, and Voldemort's face appears and screams towards Harry in a violent rushing wind, knocking him off balance. The wind seems to pass through Harry's body, which whirls away like a tornado up the stone steps and disappears, leaving Harry unconscious but still holding in his hand the philosopher's stone, which flickers and glows a rich, deep red. When Harry wakes, he's in bed in the hospital wing. He rubs his eyes, with his face pale and a bandage on one hand. He sits up, reaches for his spectacles, puts them on, and smiles as he sees the get-well cards and the table at the bottom of his bed piled high with boxes of sweets. Professor Dumbledore walks in, sees the sweets, picks up an empty box, sits on Harry's bed, and Harry touches his scar. Dumbledore touches Harry's head, gets up, and chews thoughtfully. Wearing his black cloak, Harry walks along a corridor and sees Ron and Hermione talking together on an upper landing. Smiling happily, he stops and looks up at them. They catch sight of him, and Harry's smile gets even wider. At a bank within the great hall, the students are wearing their robes and pointed hats. At the high table, Professor Dumbledore gets to his feet and looks around, while Malfoy smirks and the Gryffindors join in the applause halfheartedly.",
    "1237": "Emily stops on the steps of her house, and their eyes lock as Ben stands, looking up at her apologetically while Emily looks disappointed. Her eyes linger on him briefly before she turns and goes inside, leaving Ben standing, looking up at the door. Ben then gets into his saloon, angrily tugs at his seat belt to fasten it, and screams. Inside, a middle-aged woman sits at a table in Emily's kitchen, and Emily clears the plates, taking them to the sink and leaving the nurse, Kate, at the table. Emily looks out of the window to see Ben working in the garden, and she watches him before walking through to the French windows in the living room and going out into the lush garden where Ben is bending from the waist down and pulling up weeds, tugs out more weeds, smiles, and carries on working. Emily watches him and then turns back to look at him. Ben, whose shirt sleeves are rolled up to his elbows, follows her to double wooden doors, which she unlocks with a padlock. Shafts of hazy, golden light flood into the workshop as they enter, and Emily takes paper, pedals a flywheel, and prints an angelic woman with butterfly wings, which Ben studies. Ben meets her gaze, and Emily smiles impishly. In a large, sunny field, Emily sits in long grass watching Ben play with Duke, who bounds to retrieve something, and Emily smiles gleefully as they sit in shade with Duke beneath a tree. Ben shakes his head, nods faintly, and watches her intently as she folds her cardigan around her. Emily glances at Ben and plays with a blade of grass. They look into each other's eyes, and Ben nods, but Emily looks away as her long, dark hair frames her soft features, and she draws a strand of hair back behind her ear. Ben studies her as she speaks, then lowers his eyes. Emily looks down and smiles wistfully, and Ben reaches out his hand, briefly caressing her hair. Later, Duke's head sticks out of Ben's car window as they drive along the avenue of palm trees to Emily's quaint clapboard house and pull up outside it. Emily gives Ben a sweet, uncertain smile and nods before beaming and leaning over to kiss him on the cheek. Ben looks emotional as she gets out, retrieves Duke from the back seat, and looks in through the open front passenger window. Ben watches Emily go, then turns away pensively, with a faint smile flickering across his features before driving off. Ben sits in the sunny field, smiling to himself. Later, Ben's saloon pulls up outside Emily's house, and he kills the lights, removes his seat belt, and sneaks through Emily's pretty garden towards the workshop, carrying a shoulder bag as soft light shines out from the house.",
    "348": "The first volley of arrows hit the Rohan soldiers as the charge continues. Gandalf wheels around on Shadowfax and pulls Pippin onto the horse. The Rohan charge is decimating the enemy. Meanwhile, Denethor stands on the table astride Faramir, pouring oil over his own head, which runs through his hair and down his face, quickly soaking his robes. Faramir's eyes flicker open, and as he tries to focus through his delirium, oil splashes onto his chest and bundles of oil-soaked wood are stacked all around them. Servants hold flaming torches, awaiting their orders. Denethor nods to them, and the servants approach the pyre with torches held firmly. At that moment, Gandalf and Pippin burst into the hallows, astride Shadowfax. The fearful servants back away from the pyre, but with a roar, Denethor snatches a flaming torch and hurls it at the pyre. The pyre ignites as Gandalf gallops toward it, knocking Denethor to his feet. Pippin leaps from Shadowfax onto the burning pyre with desperate strength, pushing Faramir off. They tumble down the bundles of wood onto the floor, and Pippin douses flames on Faramir's clothing. Denethor screams with rage and leaps across the pyre, ripping and tugging at Pippin. Fire spreads up Denethor's oil-soaked back as he hauls Pippin off Faramir. Shadowfax rears up and strikes at Denethor, who falls back onto the pyre. He looks into his son's eyes, and for a brief moment, sanity returns before the flames engulf him. Suddenly, Denethor lurches off the pyre, a screaming, unguided ball of flame, and runs across the chamber, disappearing out of the door. Denethor runs across the white court atop Minas Tirith and plummets straight over the 700-foot sheer drop into the flaming city below. Denethor's death plunge signals the Rohirrim gaining the upper hand, as vast numbers of orcs are slain or are fleeing. Theoden stands proud in his saddle, yelling to his Rohirrim, but his look of joy turns to horror as massive elephant-like creatures, each carrying a war-tower packed with Haradrim archers, appear across the vast sea of battle. Theoden on his horse circles amongst them while Gandalf looks at the small hobbit. Pippin looks up at Gandalf questioningly, and Gandalf sees the fear in Pippin’s eyes. Gandalf breaks off, lost in reverie, as Pippin stares up at the old wizard's face, softened, quiet, and full of peace. Gandalf and Pippin's faces turn as the wooden doors shudder under another blow. The battlefield is in chaos as Mumakil decimate the valiant Rohirrim. Theoden tries to rally his men amid the sea of crying men and neighing horses when suddenly the Witch-King swoops down on his Nazgul, scooping up Theoden and his horse.",
    "59": "Mulwray says something to the boy and points to the ground, after which the boy gestures. Mulwray then kneels down in the mud, stares at it, and seems to concentrate on it. After a moment, he rises, thanks the boy, and heads swiftly back upstream, scrambling up the bank to his car. There, he reaches through the window, pulls out a roll of blueprints or something similar, spreads them on the hood of his car, and begins to scribble notes while looking downstream from time to time. He drives off, pulls up, and parks. Gittes looks to his right where the bay is a long, clear crescent. Hesitating, Gittes moves in that direction but climbs along the promontory to be above Mulwray, who looks absently up toward Gittes. There's a promontory of sorts where Mulwray picks up a starfish and watches the water trickling down from the outfall near Gittes. Mulwray stands, fascinated by the water, which, even as Gittes watches Mulwray, increases in volume and velocity until it gushes in spurts, cascading into the sea and whipping it into a foam. Mulwray finds himself in a puddle of water with the seat of his trousers wet. There's a slip of paper stuck under the windshield wiper, which Gittes pulls off. He gets in the car, turns on the dash light, reaches down, and opens his glove compartment, which consists of a small mountain of Ingersoll pocket watches, with the cheap price tags still attached. Gittes pulls out one, winds it absentmindedly, checks the time with his own watch—it’s 9:37—and walks to Mulwray’s car where he places it behind the front wheel of Mulwray's car. Walsh shows him a series of photos taken outside a restaurant showing Mulwray with another man of striking appearance, and in two of the photos, a gnarled cane is visible. Gittes tosses down the photos in disgust. Meanwhile, Duffy is rowing with Gittes seated in the stern as they pass Mulwray with a slender blonde girl in a summer print dress, with Mulwray fondly doting on her while drifting in their rowboat. Gittes shoots past Duffy, expertly running off a couple of fast shots. Mulwray and the girl remain blissfully unaware of them as they turn again and row past the couple, Gittes clicking off several more fast shots. The scene moves along the red-tiled roof and down to a lower level where Gittes’ feet are hooked over the apex of the roof, with him stretched face downward on the tiles, pointing himself and his camera at a veranda below where the girl and Mulwray are eating.",
    "1200": "Jenny takes a gold necklace out of a box, but wagging his tail playfully, Marley gets the necklace. John trips on a chair and the chase is on around the living room. The dog easily outmaneuvers Jenny, but John grabs him and forces open his jaws. John sprays Marley's poop with a hose, looking for the necklace. The doctor holds a probe to Jenny's stomach and moves a scanner around on gel on Jenny's stomach. A fuzzy picture appears on a screen, but the doctor frowns and removes the scanner, then walks out, leaving the Grogans waiting anxiously in the examination room. The doctor returns, smiles reassuringly, and places the scanner on Jenny's stomach. Jenny nods, tight-lipped, and the doctor withdraws with a sympathetic smile of apology. Jenny glances at her husband, who's lost for words as they drive down a palm tree-lined road. John glances at Jenny and gropes to break the silence; without looking at him, she settles back against her headrest and stares out of the window. They drive on down the sunny freeway toward the city. Back home, John opens the front door for his wife. Marley jumps up at him, but he pushes the dog aside. Jenny shrugs and slumps onto the sofa. Eyes full of concern, John turns around from filling the kettle at the sink. Jenny sits blankly, petting Marley, who rests his chin on her knee. As she starts to cry, she leans forward and hugs the big Labrador. John walks over and sits next to her, stroking her back, and she leans against him as he rubs her arm soothingly. A young dark-haired woman gets out carrying a bag and a suitcase, and Marley chases Debbie around the house trying to pull off her bath towel; he wins the game. Debbie offers the sedatives, and Marley's eating the sofa. The elderly Irish landlady leaves them to their quaintly decorated twin room, and John winces at the noise of the springs as Jenny sits on the bed. They kiss, snuggled in the floral quilt on Jenny's single bed beneath a portrait of the Virgin Mary. A yellow taxi arrives at the Grogans' home, and the house is a chewed mess. Marley stands at the front door, wagging his tail, and then stands with his head tilted back at a rain-lashed window. The dog runs under the desk where John's working and climbs onto John's lap. Jenny comes out of the bathroom holding up a pregnancy kit, and John takes her in his arms, lifting her clean off the floor. The Grogans are asleep as Marley busies himself chewing some of John's socks, and then he headbutts open his food bin, knocking some books off a shelf in the process.",
    "1106": "Walt kicks a table, then marches into his front room and kicks over another table, then punches in some cupboard doors as Daisy runs for cover. Walt sits down in an armchair, blood dripping from his fingers, and stares into the distance, a frown on his face, his features fixed and grim. He sheds a tear, and the blood on his fists has dried. Daisy comes and sits beside him. Father Janovich knocks at Walt's door and lets himself in as Walt lights up a cigarette. Father Janovich perches on a coffee table beside an open photograph album and stares at Walt, who drags pensively on his cigarette and looks thoughtful. Father Janovich gets up, goes over to the cool box, returns with four cans, and passes a couple to Walt while keeping a couple for himself. They each take a swig, and Walt takes another swig as Father Janovich eyes him, who stares unwaveringly back. In the morning, Thao walks into Walt's kitchen and finds him sipping a mug of coffee. They sit at the kitchen table, Walt gives Thao a scornful look, Thao nods reluctantly, and then gets up and goes as Walt stares after him. Later, Walt is busy mowing his front lawn, and now he relaxes in the bath, lights a cigarette, and looks over at Daisy, who's sitting beside the tub. Martin gives Walt a haircut, chuckles, and pockets the money. At a tailor's, Walt is fitted for a suit. In church, Father Janovich walks up the aisle reading a Bible, looks up, and sees Walter in a confessional booth. They step out of the confessional, Walt walks away, looks back at Father Janovich, smiles, and goes. Walt sits at his kitchen table cleaning his Colt .45, Thao comes in through the back door, picks up Walt's rifle off the table, and shoulders the rifle, inadvertently pointing it at Walt. Thao follows Walt down into the basement, Walt shows him a medal, and pins it on Thao. Walt goes upstairs as Thao closes up the chest Walt took the medal from. Thao hurries up the stairs and finds that Walt has locked him in the basement. Walt walks out of his house with Daisy on a lead, goes over to Thao's house, where Grandma is sitting on the porch, ties Daisy to Grandma's chair, fusses Daisy, heads off, and Daisy lies down and watches him go. Sue is lying in bed, gets up and goes outside, her swollen face discolored and bruised, and Grandma follows her. She hurries to Walt's house, and Father Janovich is with the police outside Smokie's house as they bundle him into their cruiser and drive away.",
    "302": "The newlyweds' apartment has the shades still drawn, although there's a light burning inside. Jeff has a slight, but warm, smile on his face as he looks at the drawn shade. His eyes move away from the newlyweds' apartment and slowly explore the neighborhood to his right. His face sobers at what he sees. He finds something of interest and stops to stare at it. The salesman has prepared a dinner tray and is carrying it from the kitchen, through the living room, into the bedroom, in his apartment where we see both the living room and the bedroom. He places it on the lap of his wife, sitting up in bed, and puts a couple of pillows behind her back to make her more comfortable. Her attitude shows her dissatisfaction, and she begins criticizing him. He starts to answer her back but decides better of it and instead leaves the room. The wife grudgingly begins to eat the dinner. The husband quietly lifts a phone from the cradle and dials a number. Quietly, she moves the tray, gets out of bed, and goes to the bedroom door to listen. He goes to the kitchen, reaches up to a wall cabinet, takes down a bottle, and pours himself a drink. In the bedroom, his wife becomes aware of the call, and instantly there is a marked change in his attitude. We get a better view of the salesman waiting while his connection is being made. He relaxes, smiles, and is warm. Whoever he has called answers. He talks softly, perhaps guardedly, with an occasional glance at the bedroom door. Jeff becomes completely absorbed with what he sees and leans forward a little. The wall hides her from our view. Then suddenly, she apparently opens the door because, in the living room, we see her arm suddenly appear, pointing at the man and the telephone. He speaks quickly into the phone and hangs up. His face is flushed and angry as he goes toward the bedroom. In the bedroom, his wife appears walking back to the bed, followed by the husband. She is laughing, and he is answering her in angry tones. The more she laughs, the more angry he gets, and the harder she laughs. She climbs in bed laughing. Finally, he leaves the room, goes into the living room, back into the kitchen, and has another drink. He turns his eyes in the direction of the composer's apartment. Through the studio window of the songwriter's apartment, we see the man at work again on his original melody, and he is farther along the line of the melody than before. Lisa is emerging from the kitchen, carrying the serving dish of their lobster thermidor.",
    "805": "Skip pulls up on a busy street and gets out. Ferris walks into an apartment, throws keys on a table, and looks around. At the U.S. Embassy in Amman, Ferris and Skip in a silver Audi roll up to a checkpoint where Skip shows his ID. An older agent, Holiday, perches on a desk in a meeting room, and after the meeting, Skip walks out. Images of people coming and going from a house are displayed on a screen as Holiday stares at Ferris, then picks up his coat and walks out. Ferris watches him go, then picks up a file and a case as Skip comes back in. A black SUV drives through a checkpoint and up to the entrance of a grand building. Ferris, who still has cuts on his forehead, gets out of the SUV holding a briefcase. He walks up steps to an entrance hall where a tall bearded man, Marwan, Hani's bodyguard, is waiting. Marwan leads Ferris through a meeting room and slides back a glass door, allowing Ferris to step out into an ornate garden where a suave, middle-aged man sits at a table reading a newspaper. Ferris bows to him, then sits as Marwan waits in the meeting room. Hani nods, glances at the building, and pours Ferris a cup of coffee. They walk through the glass door and into the meeting room, where Marwan slides the door shut. Ferris takes a thick file from his case, and with his brow furrowed, Hani opens the file and looks through photographs of groups of men. He studies Ferris, and they both nod. In the surveillance room, Skip and Ferris drive along a narrow street that opens out onto a market square, where they stop and look across at a large, flat-roofed building. Ferris and Skip stand at a coffee store, while nearby, a man dressed in black sits reading. A young guy sits beside the man they're watching, who then briskly stands and runs off, pushing a guy over as he goes. Hoffman watches on the large surveillance screen as the streets are viewed from above. Ferris runs after the man but loses him in a crowd as Skip approaches from another direction. The man keeps running, and Ferris yells to Skip. The man runs down a quiet alley, rounds a corner, and pushes a cyclist over. Ferris sprints after him, and the man climbs over a high wall. Ferris follows, and as the man swipes at Ferris with a knife, two dogs attack. Ferris slams the man against a wall, yanks his arm up behind his back, and a dog sinks its teeth into Ferris' ankle. He grabs the knife, stabs the man repeatedly, and also stabs the dog biting him. Ferris clambers up on the wall, and the dogs bite his ankles.",
    "1119": "The envelope folds itself into a mouth and turns to Ginny, then it blows a raspberry in Ron's face before shredding itself into tiny pieces and fluttering down onto the table. Hermione looks at Ron sympathetically in a crowded classroom, where the door opens, and the girls are entranced as he flashes his teeth while the boys scowl. He taps a cage, uncovers a cage full of tiny blue creatures, and opens the door of the cage. The pixies fly out in all directions, tearing up books and lifting Neville Longbottom into the air by his ears, carrying him across the room. The students flap at the pixies ineffectually as the creatures hang Neville by the back of his cloak from the light fitting. The air is full of torn pages and flying pixies, with one pulling Hermione's hair, which Harry swipes away. Lockhart's spell has no effect as a pixie grabs his wand and a dragon skeleton falls in a clatter of bones and dust. Lockhart turns and runs up a flight of stairs, grabbing a photo of himself that a pixie has snatched from the wall, then looks down at Harry, Ron, and Hermione before running out. Hermione points her wand, and above their heads, the pixies freeze and float harmlessly in mid-air. Still hanging from the ceiling, Neville looks down at them mournfully as the Gryffindor captain, Oliver Wood, leads his team out for an early morning practice and spots the Slytherin team. Ron looks at Hermione as Draco Malfoy steps forward, and Harry stares at him and their broomsticks. Draco narrows his eyes and glares at Hermione, prompting Ron to pull out his wand in shock. Ron flies backwards, and the Slytherins laugh while Ron looks as if he's going to be sick and spits out a huge slug. Colin takes a photograph as Ron spits out another slug, and Harry and Hermione help Ron away while the laughing Slytherins watch them go. In Hagrid's cottage, he hands Ron a wooden bucket and sits down as Hermione gets up and walks away thoughtfully. Hagrid looks serious and takes Hermione's hand, and with her eyes full of tears, she gives him a faint smile. In Gilderoy Lockhart's room, Lockhart autographs a picture of himself as Harry looks up, hearing a strange voice, and Lockhart looks confused. The professor and student look around nervously before leaving Lockhart's room, where Harry stops as he hears the voice again, seeming to come from the stone wall. Following the sound, Harry bumps into Ron and Hermione, then runs off with his friends hurrying after him, Harry well ahead. He turns into a wide corridor and starts to walk along it as Ron and Hermione catch up with him. Suddenly, Harry stops them, and they look down in surprise to see a line of spiders following each other at their feet.",
    "1183": "All the boys are fast asleep except for Harry. He is sitting in his pajamas on the wide-stone sill gazing out of the window with his knees tucked up under his chin. Sitting beside him, his pet snowy owl turns its head as he gently strokes its soft, white feathers. As Harry looks out through the diamond shaped window panes across the moonlit courtyard at the school, he gives a contented smile. Next morning, Harry and Ron are late for class. A tabby cat is sitting on the teacher's desk. It looks up as they open the classroom door. Hermione looks at them disapprovingly as they hurry into the room. The cat leaps off of the table and turns into Professor McGonagall. Later, the dark figure of Professor Snape sweeps into his classroom. He fixes his eyes on Malfoy who smiles slyly. Harry takes careful notes. Snape spots him. Hermione nudges Harry. He puts his quill back in the inkwell. Hermione holds up her hand. Hermione knows. Hermione is desperate to answer. The great hall. Seamus peers into a goblet. Seamus' face is smudged with soot. Owls carrying mail flutter in through a high window. A parcel is dropped to one of the children below. The graceful birds swoop amongst the carved oak beams and fly from one end of the great hall to the other, delivering letters and parcels to their delighted owners. Ron has received a newspaper and some letters. He puts the newspaper to one side. Harry picks it up. Neville unwraps a small glass ball. It turns red. Hermione looks at them both with narrowed eyes. In the school grounds, a neat woman with spiky silver hair strides across the lawn. Harry's broom leaps straight into his hand. Malfoy catches his broomstick. The others keep trying. Ron's broom flies up and smacks him on the nose. Neville's broomstick lifts him into the air. Terrified he rises even higher. The broom carries him higher above their heads. He hangs on for dear life. The broom swings him round in circles and crashes into the side of a stone tower. It spins away just to turn again then dives towards the ground. Madam Hooch takes out her hound. The children scatter. The broomstick carries Neville, and zooms up over the statues on the battlements. His cloth gets caught on the sword and he drops the broomstick. The cloak rips and gives way. He plummets down and crashes heavily to the ground. Her cloak flying, Madam Hooch runs across to Neville and gently lifts him up. Malfoy finds the Remembrall. Malfoy mounts his broom. He flies on top of their heads. Harry steps astride his broomstick. Harry zooms after Malfoy.",
    "790": "He looks at the open safe door and smiles. Marcus smiles and nods. Willie heads out of the office, and Marcus begins filling a sack with wads of dollar bills from the safe. Willie walks up to a display of elephant soft toys. Some are purple, and some are pink. Willie picks up a purple one and examines it. He puts the purple elephant back and picks up a pink one. He stares at the toy for a moment, and then, smiling softly to himself, he turns to go. The sound of a revolver being cocked brings him to an abrupt hold. Marcus is holding a gun on him. Lois is behind Marcus with the handcart. Willie shakes his head slowly. Marcus' face softens, then he raises the gun. Willie closes his eyes. The police appear. Marcus hides behind the handcart and takes potshots at the cops who return fire. Willie runs holding the pink elephant, which gets its head blown off. He hides around a corner and catches his breath. A cop spots him and takes a shot, which blows the trunk of the wall beside Willie, who runs on. The statues in the nativity stable scene are smashed, which gets in the way. Later, he jumps out of the store's backdoor, and, still clutching the toy elephant, leaps into the BMW. He starts it up and speeds off. A police officer reaches out his way, and the BMW smashes the door off a squad car as Willie makes his escape. The cop shatters the BMW's back window. Willie drives on, and the cops speed after him. He glances back at the pursuing cruisers. The BMW rounds the corner onto Thurmond's street, raising smoke from its tires in the process. It races on down the street with the cruisers in hot pursuit. Willie pulls up outside Thurmond's house. Unable to get the car door open, he scrambles out of the driver's window clutching the pink elephant. Some children at a neighboring house come out to see what the commotion is all about. They watch as the cops cut Santa down in a hail of hot blood. He takes several bullets. Still clutching the elephant, Willie crawls towards Thurmond's front door. The gun-toting cops close in on him. Willie reaches the front step, but he's too badly injured to go any further. He collapses and lies motionless. The posse of cops surrounds him, keeping him covered as the screen fades slowly. Daytime, a close-up of the blood-soaked pink elephant. Thurmond opens a box on his bed. Thurmond cleans his bicycle as a skaterat walks up. Thurmond looks around. Thurmond gets to his feet. Thurmond looks down. Thurmond kicks the skaterat hard in the balls.",
    "976": "In the evening at the retirement home, an older Doris calls to Benjamin. A grainy flashback shows lightning hitting a truck. Benjamin looks out a window and sees a taxi pull up outside. Daisy, now in her 20s, exits the taxi and walks along the sidewalk toward the house. Benjamin moves to the next window to track her progress, watching as she enters through the gate. He goes downstairs and looks through the kitchen window at her. Daisy greets Mrs. Maple's dog, and Benjamin goes out to meet her. She steps closer with uncertainty, looking shocked, and then hugs him. She picks lint off his shirt, sees it, and laughs. Benjamin sits on the bed, and Daisy sits beside him, looking at an illustration and appearing pleasantly surprised. That night, a taxi pulls up outside a posh restaurant where Daisy and Benjamin exit. A waiter lights a cigarette for Daisy, and she turns her head to blow out the smoke. Outside, she walks onto a band stand. Benjamin watches as she removes her shoes, with light reflecting off water revolving on the ceiling. She takes off her jacket, and Benjamin is transfixed as Daisy dances, legs crossed, arching her body back with arms outstretched. She straightens, moves gracefully towards him with arms waving, leans to her left, and slowly raises her right leg into the air, her legs and arms almost parallel. She twists her body, arcs her leg, looks around at Benjamin, and sinks to her knees, arching her back to lie on the floor before sitting up again. She stands and walks towards him, crouches beside him on the band stand, and plants a lingering kiss on his lips; they part, their faces remaining close. He looks down, and she pulls away, stands, puts on her jacket, and picks up her shoes before walking down off the band stand. Meanwhile, Thomas uses a crutch, glances at an amputee in a wheelchair at a restaurant, and Benjamin smiles as Thomas looks pensive. Thomas shows him a collection of military uniforms and switches on the lights in his factory. Benjamin stares blankly at Thomas, who stands half hidden in shadow, then turns away awkwardly. Thomas shakes his head ruefully as Benjamin looks around the factory, then back at Thomas. Benjamin observes photos in a hallway, including one of a bride and a framed photo of Thomas and Caroline on their wedding day at Thomas's home. In the retirement home, Benjamin climbs the stairs to go to his room.",
    "276": "The low wide shot crops the BIKER at his shins, with the gas station in the background behind him. The Biker pauses for a moment, thinking or feeling. CRASH - the bathroom door flies open as the Biker bursts in astride his hog, bright daylight streaming in with him to throw him into imposing silhouette. Shafts of light pouring in are defined by motes of dust dancing in the air. A fast track in on the jar of hair jelly sitting on the shelf under the mirror is shown, followed by an extreme close shot of his nostrils dilating as we hear him sniff. They are both intently munching cornflakes, staring at something offscreen. Ed is sitting in the living room, bottle-feeding Nathan Jr., surrounded by the rumpled sheets and blankets used by the house guests. Gale puts his spoon down and picks up a cigarette which has been smoking in the ashtray next to him, with a bead of milk dribbling down his chin. He takes a contemplative puff, studying Ed through a mouthful of cornflakes. Gale blows out smoke and picks up his spoon to start back in on his cornflakes. Hi is walking in, yawning, holding the cornflakes box arrested in mid-air, looking at Ed, who is motioning to Gale and Evelle with her eyes. Gale and Evelle are looking dumbly from Ed to Hi, more relaxed now, to Ed, looking pleadingly at Hi. Feeling the look, he goes back to his cornflakes. Gale leans back to blow smoke at the ceiling. Hi, with Ed standing by, is just opening the door to a young couple. Glen is a short, stocky blond man in his early thirties, wearing Bermuda shorts, while DOT is wearing slacks, heels, and a scarf over her hair. From behind, Glen gives her an energetic THWOK on the ass. Dot spins and smacks Glen across the face with her purse through clenched teeth, and he reels under the blow. Dot shrieks again, but this time muffles it with her own hand, tiptoeing into the trailer, hand to her mouth. Glen, rubbing his cheek, seems angry at himself. At the top of the stoop, Glen turns out to the yard, where a scad of children, ranging in age from two to seven, are crawling over Hi's car. One is beating on it with a large stick, another sits on the hood pulling back one of the windshield wipers, etc. As Ed and Dot enter, Ed beams as they go to the crib. Dot puts her hand to her forehead, reacting to the baby as if she is about to faint, hides her face in her hands and looks away as if blinded, then sneaks a look around her hands.",
    "109": "The crowd yells for Forrest as he runs across the field with the defending team chasing him, continuing along the field until he runs into the end zone, prompting the crowd to cheer. Forrest stops in the end zone upon hearing the crowd and is met by band members rushing toward him with their hands up, signaling him to stop and stay in the end zone while a group of defending players falls over each other nearby. Forrest looks on as the crowd cheers wildly. President Kennedy holds an autographed football with the All-American Team, including Forrest in suits, standing behind him. The All-American players mingle around the food table, where Forrest steps up to see a large spread of food and soda, including numerous bottles of Dr. Pepper. He takes a bottle of Dr. Pepper from the buffet, a servant opens it for him, and Forrest begins to guzzle it, eventually setting down an empty bottle next to many others, holding his stomach, and burping. In black and white footage, President Kennedy shakes hands with the All-American football players, including Forrest, who steps up after another player and shakes the President's hand before President Kennedy turns and smiles. Forrest urinates in the bathroom, lowers the lid and flushes, then washes his hands and notices an autographed photo of Marilyn Monroe and a photo of John with his brother Bobby. Archival footage shows President Kennedy rising in a convertible and smiling, followed by Robert Kennedy at a podium receiving applause. Forrest, sitting on a bench, shakes his head as students in caps and gowns receive their diplomas, and upon his name being called, he steps up to accept his diploma with the dean shaking his hand vigorously. Looking out into the crowd, Forrest sees Mrs. Gump, who is crying, and later, they have their picture taken in front of a large statue. A military recruiter spots Forrest, steps up to him, and Mrs. Gump takes the diploma from Forrest as the recruiter slaps Forrest on the shoulder and hands him military literature. Forrest then steps onto the army bus amidst pouring rain as the bus driver yells at him. He is about to sit on the first available seat, but the recruit sitting there refuses him, leading him to try the next seat, where the second recruit slides over to block him, causing Forrest to step forward looking similar to how he did on his first school bus ride years ago.",
    "106": "Jenny puts her hand on Forrest's hand, and Forrest nods as he remembers while continuing to talk to the black woman, who looks up from her magazine. Jenny and Forrest walk, but a dirt clod hits Forrest in the back of the head, causing Jenny to look as Forrest rubs his head. Three young boys get off their bikes and pick up more rocks, and Forrest is hit in the eye with another dirt clod, causing him to fall backward onto the ground as the boys glare at him. Jenny helps Forrest back up as Boy #1 and Boy #2 throw more dirt clods at him, with another one hitting him in the arm. Forrest tries to run along the road, but his braces make it impossible, so he hobbles along as Jenny yells after him. Boy #1 and Boy #2 turn back toward the bikes, and the boys ride after Forrest, who continues to hobble along the dirt road while Jenny stands and watches. Forrest looks over his shoulder as the three boys race on their bikes, and he begins to run faster with his braces on as they chase him. Blood drips from a cut on his head, but he continues running despite the boys on the bikes gaining on him. Forrest hobbles along and then begins to gain speed, running from the chasing boys. The boys pedal faster as they gain on Forrest, who looks over his shoulder in fear and tries to run even faster to get away. Suddenly, his braces shatter, sending steel and plastic flying into the air. Surprised, Forrest runs and looks down at his legs as he continues to run faster, with the metal braces and straps flying off his legs. Forrest runs free of his braces and begins to pick up speed, while the chasing boys ride over the remains of his braces. The black woman continues to read her magazine, and Forrest smiles as he remembers. He is already at the far end of the road, clear of the chasing boys who stop and watch in disbelief as Forrest sprints away from them. Forrest runs down a driveway toward Jenny's small house, knocks on Jenny's door, looks around the field to the left, notices Jenny, and runs toward her. He reaches Jenny, and she grabs his hand and runs into the field. Jenny's dad, drunk, steps out onto the porch and shouts, then steps out toward the field, running through it with a liquor bottle in his hand while searching for Jenny. Jenny and Forrest run into a cornfield as Jenny's dad tries to chase her, and Jenny drops to her knees, pulling Forrest down with her.",
    "529": "They look at each other, reacting, as the film cuts back to Hannah's kitchen. Norma's face can be seen in the porthole window on the other side of the pantry's swinging door. She looks around the kitchen, then opens the door and steps inside. Holly stands nearby, working in the pantry area. Holly chuckles. Norma steps back out of the kitchen, the door swinging shut behind her. Holly looks at the door, sipping her wine, as the movie cuts back to Hannah's living room. A chubby, friendly uncle sits on a sofa, one child on his lap and several others gathered cross-legged around him on the floor. They lean on the coffee table, which is covered with glasses and a bowl of chips. Other guests mingle in the background; one couple enters the living room, smiling at the scene on the sofa. Mavis crosses the well-lit foyer in the background and opens the door to more guests. The uncle pours more beer from his bottle into the kids' outstretched glasses. They cry indistinctly with excitement. Laughing, he turns to the little girl sitting on his lap; he clinks his bottle against the bottle she is holding, which is almost as big as she is. The uncle and the children happily drink their beer as the movie cuts to a wall with subtly patterned wallpaper in Hannah's bedroom. Her face moves on to the screen. Hannah walks towards Elliot; he's in the bathroom standing over the sink. Elliot walks from behind the partially closed door to an offscreen medicine cabinet. Elliot turns back to the sink, once again obscured by the partially closed door. He dries his hands as Hannah, standing behind him, continues to talk. He closes the door, briefly obscuring Hannah and himself from view. The camera moves behind the closed door, into the bathroom. He opens the medicine cabinet and puts the aspirin bottle back. Elliot slams the medicine cabinet shut. He leaves. Hannah watches him go, reacting. She is stunned. Piano music is still heard very softly in the background as Hannah, hugging herself, walks slowly down the hallway into the living room. She briefly looks around, lost in thought. She sits down heavily, tiredly, on the arm of the couch as the movie cuts to several framed photographs on the mantel. The camera, however, moves closer and closer to a photograph showing Hannah, Lee, and Holly, the three sisters, smiling into the camera. The film shows the bedroom night table, holding a small lamp, a wooden box, a cast-iron fire truck, an ashtray, and glasses. Elliot's pajama-clad arm moves into view. He turns off the lamp; the room is now pitch-black. Elliot turns the lamp back on, then turns to Hannah; she is lying on her side of the bed, partially in shadow.",

Holden stares at Alyssa, flabbergasted, while the crowd around them is shocked, focusing not on the fight on the ice, but the fight in their midst. Alyssa fumes and storms away, with Holden chasing after her, observed by a Bystander. Alyssa marches quickly, pulling on her coat, and Holden catches up to her but pulls back. She stares at him, hurt and pissed, while Holden's eyes are downcast, as she waits for a response. Holden skulks off, and Alyssa stares after him before starting to kick and punch a car beside her, finally slumping to the ground, crying. Meanwhile, Holden sits on the couch, alone in the dark, when Banky enters and sits beside him, opening his arms. Later, Holden sits alone at a booth and looks up to see Jay and Silent Bob standing above him; the pair slide into the booth. Holden pulls an envelope out of his jacket and tosses it to Jay, as Silent Bob thumbs through the comic while Jay looks over his shoulder, beginning to roll a joint. A waitress joins them, and Holden rubs his eyes as the waitress returns with the order, staring wide-eyed and offended at Jay. There's silence as Holden's head snaps forward, staring wide-eyed at Silent Bob, shocked, while Jay and Holden look at him. Silent Bob busts a move with his hands, then backhands him, as Jay raises his fist as if to strike, and Silent Bob lights a cigarette before Jay and Silent Bob exit. Holden remains in the booth, thinking. Later, he sits in the park that he and Alyssa walked through, staring at Alyssa's yearbook picture, and then an idea hits him. He jumps up, dashes out of the park, grabs a chair from the side of the room, where Banky and Alyssa sit on the couch, and paces in front of them. Alyssa's face drops as she subtly shakes her head, and the room is silent. Alyssa lights a cigarette, her head dropping, while Holden leans back into the couch with a huge sigh. Banky stares forward, wide-eyed, then shrugs. Holden smiles at his friend, then looks at Alyssa and moves to her side of the couch. Alyssa looks at him sadly, as shocked Banky lets out a sigh of relief. Holden reacts, and a tear rolls down Alyssa's cheek. She looks at him sadly and touches his face, then releases him and slaps him, before storming away, stopping briefly to look Banky up and down, and walks out of the studio. The door closes behind her as Banky and Holden stand there, silently, and a copy of 'Bluntman and Chronic' enters the frame.",
    "113": "Neff walks in past the night watchman without answering and heads towards the elevator. The night watchman looks after Neff, relocks the door, and follows him to the elevator. Neff enters the elevator appearing pale and haggard with pain but maintains a deadpan expression as the night watchman joins him. The night watchman pulls the lever, the doors close, and the elevator rises. The door opens to reveal a small dark reception room with a pair of frosted glass doors labeled: PACIFIC ALL-RISK INSURANCE COMPANY - FOUNDED 1906 - MAIN OFFICE, with a little light beyond the glass doors. Neff straightens up and walks heavily out of the elevator, crosses the reception room to the doors, and pushes them open. These lead to a balcony that runs all the way around, overlooking the eleventh floor below, which is filled with desks, typewriters, filing cabinets, and business machines. Neff enters the area from the reception room while the twelfth floor remains dark and some light shines up from the eleventh floor where two colored women are cleaning the offices — one is dry-mopping the floor, the other moving chairs back into position. Neff moves away from the railing with a faint smile on his face and walks past two or three offices towards a glass door labeled with the number twenty-seven and the names: HENRY B. ANDERSON, WALTER NEFF, LOUIS L. SCHWARTZ. Neff opens the door to reveal three desks, filing cabinets, a typewriter on a stand, a dictaphone on a fixed stand against the wall with a rack of records underneath, and telephones on all three desks. Neff enters, switches on the desk lamp, and his head goes far back as his eyes close with cold sweat showing on his face. After staying like this for a moment, exhausted, his eyes open slowly and look down at his left shoulder. His good hand flips the overcoat back, unbuttons his jacket, loosens his tie and shirt, which proves to be quite an effort. He rests for a second, breathing hard with his eyes closed, then fingers a pack of cigarettes in his shirt pocket, pulls it out, and notices there is blood on it. He wheels himself back to the desk, dumps the loose cigarettes out of the packet, some blood-stained and a few clean. He takes a clean one, puts it between his lips, gropes for a match, lights the cigarette, takes a deep drag, and lets smoke out through his nose. Neff then pulls himself toward the dictaphone again while still in the swivel chair, reaches it, lifts the horn off the bracket causing the dictaphone to make a low buzzing sound. He presses the button switch on the horn, the sound stops, and the record revolves on the cylinder as he begins to speak. He then interrupts the dictation and lays down the horn on the desk.",
    "1225": "In the motel room, Ben looks in a mirror as he carefully shaves off his heavy stubble with a wet razor and then stops to study himself solemnly. Ben pulls up at Emily's and gets out of the car with a gift-wrapped parcel, then reconsiders, puts it back in the car, and walks towards the house, where Emily opens the door. The nurse comes out, and Ben, wearing his customary gray suit and shirt and tie, enters Emily's bedroom carrying the gift. One of the walls is covered in photos, some of Emily at different ages, and Ben studies them. He moves slowly over to the window with a fine net curtain over it and watches as Emily carries the casserole from the oven to a candlelit table, where the flame of a tea light glows in the darkness. Ben puts down the box and catches sight of himself in a full-length mirror. He comes out of the bedroom wearing a polo shirt and jeans and stands at the opened French windows. Emily is sitting at the table as Ben looks down at his outfit. Emily nods and smiles, waves her hand motioning for him to come outside, and, looking slightly awkward, he goes to the table and looks about at the lit candles everywhere. Emily nods and smiles at him, and Ben scratches his eyebrow shyly. Emily stretches out her upturned palm and gestures for Ben to sit at the table, then studies him seriously and nods encouragingly. Ben eagerly picks up his fork, tries a mouthful, stifles a slight grimace, and looks sincere as she smiles triumphantly. They're still at the table as Emily frowns listening to Ben humming and shakes her head, then goes to a record player. With her back to Ben, she falters slightly, takes a deep breath, puts a record on the turntable, and sings along, offering Ben her hand. Ben, sitting forward in his seat with his hands clasped, looks lost in sad thought until Emily slides her slender hand between his, pulling him to his feet, and he smiles. They dance close together, Emily's left hand on Ben's right shoulder, his right hand on her back, their free hands clasped as they move slowly, almost dancing on the spot, their eyes locked in an intense gaze, their faces close, and he nods. Emily walks behind Ben with her hands on his shoulders as he leads her into the workshop and switches on the light, then goes to the Beast as Emily opens her eyes, and Ben turns to face her while she scans the workshop, trying to spot the surprise.",
    "776": "Kate and Gordon shield their eyes as Jackson eyes the blast in the RV's mirror; a blinding flash fills the sky, followed by a vast wave of energy that flattens the remaining trees and sends Charlie flying backward. A tower of fire and thick black smoke fills the air as Kate hugs Noah by her side. Charlie clambers back to his feet as fireballs rain down behind him from the massive eruption, standing with his hands up wide as a huge chunk crashes right into him while fireballs slam down on the park. Jackson drives the RV along the road through this carnage, swerving to avoid crashing rock and then straightening the vehicle before a fireball hits the back of the RV, leaving a flaming hole. On the runway, Noah peers out of the plane, and Kate stands looking anxious as molten rocks crash down on the research center with the flaming rocks hammering the area. A fissure splits the ground between the RV and the runway as Jackson accelerates, making the RV jump. The ground falls away as the RV lands narrowly between the widening canyon, and Jackson pulls up behind the plane. Kate rushes over as Jackson emerges, hurrying back to the plane with Lilly. The tarmac cracks as Jackson looks back into the RV and finds a London tube map before a big burning fissure breaks open, and the RV tips backward into it. Jackson falls along the center aisle and desperately grabs a handle as, at the plane's controls, Gordon looks over his shoulder and sets the plane moving. Fireballs hit the ground by the runway as a hand appears on the jagged edge of the fissure, followed by another hand clutching a map. Thick smoke fills the sky as Jackson sprints along the runway after the plane, with Kate grabbing and yanking him inside the plane. Fireballs trailing thick columns slam into the ground as the plane rises to the end of the runway, with flaming rocks arrowing through the sky as Gordon clears a hilltop and outruns a volcanic eruption. The cloud gains on the plane, passing the occupants in shadow, before the plane rockets from the swirling cloud and flies away from the fireballs. Noah gives a thumbs up as Kate turns to Jackson, who catches his breath and opens up the map, revealing a big map of China while everyone stares at him dubiously. Gordon looks around from the pilot seat as Adrian hurries into Anheuser's office, following him into the corridor buzzing with activity. The famous arms-outstretched statue of Christ the Redeemer breaks apart and crumbles over the streets of Rio as Anheuser and Adrian enter the darkened chapel. Anheuser looks surprised, turns around, and walks out of the chapel while two agents close the doors, leaving Adrian and Wilson in the gloom.",
    "916": "Dillinger swaps looks with Gilbert, then shoves through a revolving door. Outside, he finds only a wealthy couple and a uniformed doorman. The gang leader glances around the sidewalk with a frown, then faces the doorman. Dillinger frowns. Now, a hood ornament of an archer gleams on Purvis' Pierce Arrow. In an FBI field office, a chubby agent shows a jacket. Purvis paces, then addresses his assembled task force. He faces a secretary. Purvis gazes out a window at a neighboring high rise, then faces his men. One agent briefly drops his gaze. Now in a telephone exchange with Baum, he plays a 78 record. Night time. Dillinger strides past a bright city park. Later, he marches through a crowded arch vaulted lobby. He finds Billie behind a hatcheck counter. She notices Dillinger as a male guest holds out his coat to her. Dillinger smacks the back of the bystander's head. As the man doubles over, the crime boss flips open the counter's pass-through and steps into Billie's work area. Yanking the man's wrist over the counter, Dillinger snatches his claim ticket. Billie stares as he finds the man's coat. The exotic beauty drops her gaze, and Dillinger throws the coat at its owner. He gets Billie's coat. He holds her coat open. Billie eyes it, then looks to a staring co-worker. With a coy smirk, she steps out from behind the counter and slips into her coat. Now, in an apartment, a hand drops a rabbit's foot key chain by a tabletop sculpture of two racing greyhounds. Dillinger leads Billie down a hall into a luxurious living room. As she takes in the space, he sets a chair near a sofa and looks to her. Billie joins him, slipping off her coat. Dillinger sets a simple cardboard box on the coffee table. Billie complies and looks around with a faint smile. Behind her, Red appears in his undershirt and leans through an open-air interior window. He gets a couple of glasses from a counter, then saunters off with two women. Dillinger sits facing Billie and lays his hand on the large box. The exotic beauty eyes it coolly. Dillinger allows a subdued smile, then shifts boyishly in his seat. Billie removes the lid, finding forest green tissue paper over the contents. Folding back the layers, she finds a camel-haired coat with a thick fur collar. Billie lifts the present from its box, staring at it. She swallows, then raises her tender gaze to meet Dillinger's. Her full lips curl into a smile. The crime boss grins. They gaze into each other's eyes. Later, on a bed, they smother each other with kisses. Silhouetted against a window, Billie leans over the reclined man, her bobbed hair tickling his brow.",
    "458": "He pulls out a deadly looking dagger, with a sharp point and a triangular shaped blade, and sprints on and Inigo, closing the gap, closer, closer, and he's down the stairs and heading into a dining hall and Count Rugen throws the dagger. Inigo tries like hell to get out of the way, but no, and it sticks deep into his stomach, and he hurtles back helplessly against the wall of the room, his eyes glazed, blood coming from his wound. Count Rugen looks across the room at Inigo, and Inigo sinks. Meanwhile, Buttercup shuts the door of the Honeymoon Suite, crosses quietly to the far wall where she sits at a table, opens a jeweled box, and takes out a very deadly looking dagger. She seems very much at peace as she touches the knife to her bosom and Buttercup whirls as we see Westley lying on the bed. Yellin's sword is beside him. His voice sounds just fine, but he does not move. Buttercup leaps to the bed, covering him with kisses. Westley is helpless, and she lets go, thumping his head against the headboard. Count Rugen looks very much surprised as Inigo, struggling feebly, pulls the dagger from his stomach, holding the wound with his left hand. Rugen pushes off from the table, sword in hand, moving in to kill Inigo. Inigo watches the Count approach, and the Count flicks his sword at Inigo's heart, and there's not much Inigo can do, just kind of vaguely parry the thrust with the six-fingered sword and Count Rugen's blade sinks deeply into Inigo's left shoulder. The Count steps back, going for the heart again, and as this blow comes, Inigo tries to use the wall for support in forcing himself to his feet, and it's not a roaring success of an attempt, but he does at least make some progress, and again he manages to parry the thrust, as this time Rugen's sword runs through his right arm. Again, Inigo doesn't seem to mind, doesn't even feel it. Count Rugen steps back for just a moment, watching as Inigo continues to inch his way to his feet and then, just before the Count is about to strike again, Inigo manages a little flick of his own and Rugen hadn't expected it, and he jumps back, makes a little involuntary cry of surprise. Inigo slowly pushes away from the wall, and Count Rugen suddenly goes into a fierce attack, striking with great power and precision for he is a master swordsman, and he forces Inigo easily back, driving him easily into the wall. But he does not penetrate Inigo's defense. None of the Count's blows get home. As the Count steps back a moment.",
    "1080": "Over the sound of Adolf Hitler addressing a rally, grainy black and white footage shows him with his arm extended at an angle of 10 degrees from his shoulder, giving the Nazi salute as he reviews troops. A Nazi motorcade approaches a curved metal bridge, and a skull and crossbones on a black flag flutters in the breeze. A man is dragged across the street, while others, identifying labels on their backs, are hounded along by Nazi officers. Jews are shot into a ditch, and women, cowering, are pushed from their homes. One woman falls to the ground and is dragged to her feet. Old men in cloth caps with bags on their shoulders, and women carrying cases, are herded from their village. Black-uniformed SS officers kick a man on the ground. A helmeted German shoots a man in the back, while an officer coolly pulls a revolver from an inside pocket, raises it, and a young man falls lifelessly to the ground; the officer then pockets his gun and resumes his conversation. An army photographer is filming the event. Small children are hauled up into trucks, and families are separated. The bony-cheeked SS officer puffs on a cigarette as a truckload of people trundles past. The departing truck, escorted by Nazi outriders, is observed by two men hiding behind a tree, one in his 30s, the other in his early 20s. Near them, they see men from the village being led into a wood by black-shirts and their dogs. The two watchers run from the scene, passing a body lying face-down in a marshy pond. They run past and vault over a farm gate, where a man lies slumped against the farm fence. The younger man, Asael, drops his head and breathes heavily, helplessly looking up at his older brother, Zus. Carrying a small axe, the tall, dark-haired, unshaven Zus creeps across the farmhouse, opens a low door, steps inside, crouches down, and pulls back two planks from the floor. A small boy with blackened face and hands peers up at his two older brothers. Wary, the boy takes Zus's hand and steps up out of the hole in the floor. Zus pats the boy's blackened face, and moments later, Asael drapes a cloth bag over Aron's shoulder. Zus puts down the saw he's carrying, noticing something in the doorway of the farmhouse. He removes a narrow ornamental case engraved with Hebrew writing, a mezuzah, from the right-hand side of the door frame, grabs the saw and a cloth bag, and hurries his little brother away past a flock of ducks. Zus holds his brother to his feet and leans him up against a tree, pats Asael's neck, and for a moment, rests his head against his brother's brow.",
    "203": "The owner of the house passes with some Christmas packages under his arm, bends down to examine the trunk of the tree, then straightens up and smells George's breath and backs away. The owner proceeds toward his house as George is completely bewildered. George puts his arm around Clarence, and they start off up the road to Martini's place, which is now almost unrecognizable. The cheerful Italian feeling is gone, and it is now more of a hard-drinking joint, a honky-tonk. The same bar is there, but the tables have no covers, and the people are lower down and tougher. George and Clarence come in and go up to the bar as two people leave the bar. Nick the bartender is behind the bar, and as he speaks, he leans over the counter, putting his left fist nearly in Clarence's eye, puzzling Clarence. Nick turns away to get the drinks while listening suspiciously to their conversation but stops pouring the drinks with the bottle poised in his hand. George glances up at Nick, who slams the bottle down on the counter. A small wreck of a man with weak, watery eyes, obviously a broken-down panhandler with his hat in hand, is Gower the druggist, who can hardly believe his eyes. Nick picks up a seltzer bottle and squirts Gower in the face with it as the crowd laughs brutally. Gower smiles weakly as the soda runs off his face, and George, horrified, leaps up and goes over to Gower. The bouncers throw Gower out the front door. George rushes back to the bar, and George and Clarence come flying through the door and land in the snow. Nick is at the cash register busily ringing the bell while George and Clarence lie in the snow with George having a strange, puzzled look on his face. They remain for a moment as they land, looking at each other, and George catches a glimpse of the front of the building with the neon sign over the door. George and Clarence get to their feet, and George points to the sign while looking at Clarence, who sort of hangs his head. George fixes him with a very interested look and, still looking at him, goes up to him and pokes his arm, and it's flesh. George rapidly searches his pockets for identification, but without success, and is completely befuddled as he feverishly continues to turn his pockets inside out and starts off. Clarence rises, and George strides off hurriedly as Clarence slowly follows him, glancing up toward Heaven as he goes. George looks at the changed character of the place in surprise, then starts up the street toward the main part of town, and as he goes, the camera moves with him, showing a town that has completely changed from a quiet, orderly small town to having the nature of a frontier village.",
    "1390": "The trio stops, fighting their tears as a quartet of bleak shadows files from the hut. One of the shadows, Dumbledore, raises his hand and points, directing the attention of the others away from Buckbeak. Dumbledore speaks briefly, unintelligible from this distance, then the crows shriek excitedly, causing the Executioner to separate from the others and disappear behind a low stand of trees. Sunlight kicks off the axe as it rises over the trees, hangs etched against the sky, and then drops from sight. A sickening chop fouls the breeze, and Ron and Harry stare toward the trees in numb disbelief while Hermione, face turned away, trembles. Slowly, Hermione's hand falls onto Ron's shoulder, and the camera falls with her, continuing down the length of Ron's arm to his hand, where a drop of blood hangs from his finger and drops like a tear. Ron stares at his hand, at the blood running down his finger, and his eyes shift to see Scabbers streaking away. As Ron pelts after Scabbers, Harry and Hermione give chase. Ron reaches the summit, disappears over the top, and Hermione and Harry follow. They reach the top of the ridge and stop as Ron nabs Scabbers, cradles him in his bloody palm, spins, and looks toward Harry. Harry's eyes shift to see an enormous, pale-eyed, jet-black dog bounding toward him in the gathering gloom. Harry shields himself when the dog leaps clear over him and vanishes into the gap at the base of the tree, beginning to pull Ron through. Harry and Hermione make their way through the primitive passageway, ducking the roots that dangle overhead, until the tunnel abruptly ends. Confused, Harry and Hermione glance about, then peer up at a small opening. Harry reaches up, hoists himself through, pulls Hermione up, and looks about to see stains suspiciously similar to dried blood blotting the floorboards and shattered furniture strewn everywhere. The ceiling creaks as they dash to the stairs and come out, looking down at a wide, shiny stripe cutting through the dust-laden floor, as if something has been dragged, to the end of the hallway where a light seeps from a door. Harry looks down, follows the paw prints on the floor to a pair of filthy human feet, and then looks up slowly at the man standing in the shadows, with filthy, matted hair hanging to his shoulders and skin like a corpse, who studies Harry's face keenly. Harry draws his wand, eyes Black with his wand hand shaking violently, and the two regard each other with the moment taut with tension, then Lupin steps forward and embraces Black like a brother, leaving Harry and Ron staring, dumbfounded, at Lupin.",
    "1115": "Beside the lifeless head of his enemy, the basilisk, Harry touches Ginny's hand, and she is still clutching the diary. Harry grabs the diary and opens it, then raises the basilisk's Poison Fang and stabs the diary. Riddle recoils as a light pierces the hole in his chest, and blood spreads over the page. Harry stabs again, and Riddle puts a hand to his face as the powerful light surges out of his body and lifts him off his feet. Raising the fang again, Harry closes the diary and stabs with all his might into the black leather cover. In a flash of light, Riddle completely disintegrates, leaving behind only a few faint sparks floating in the air. Ginny suddenly wakes and, looking confused, she sits up and sees Harry, who is clutching his arm in pain. Dumbledore's Phoenix swoops down and settles beside Harry, looking sadly at his face. The handsome bird lowers its head, and its huge tears fall from its eyes onto Harry's arm. Ginny watches, her eyes wide with amazement, as the Phoenix weeps. Vapor rises from the wound, and the torn flesh begins to heal. Harry looks up at Fawkes. Later, Lockhart, Ron, Harry, and Ginny cling to each other as the powerful Phoenix carries them to safety and away from the Chamber of Secrets. In Dumbledore's study, Ron and Harry look at each other in amazement, and Ron leaves. Harry nods thoughtfully at the silver sword, takes it in both hands, and reads the inscription on the blade. The door flies open, and Lucius Malfoy strides in with Dobby at his heels. Lucius walks towards Dumbledore and glares at Harry, who glances at Dumbledore and holds up Tom Riddle's diary, prompting Dumbledore to smile as he turns to Lucius. Lucius kicks Dobby down the stairs, then hits him with a stick. Harry puts the sword down on the desk and looks at the black leather diary before catching up with Lucius in the corridor. He gives him the diary, and Lucius hands it to Dobby, leaning close to Harry and giving a sneer before turning away. Dobby still holds the diary and finds the sock between the pages. Harry pulls up his trouser leg and shows Lucius his bad ankle, then Lucius pulls a wand from his stick and advances on Harry. Dobby stands between them and with a fix of his hand, Lucius is hurtled backwards. The little elf folds his arms in triumph and then turns to walk away. Harry smiles. Later, everyone is gathered in the great hall, and he floats between the tables. Filch stands by the door, stroking his cat. Sitting at the Gryffindor table, Neville looks around as Hermione stands in the doorway smiling. Ron and Harry are thrilled to see her; grinning broadly, they get to their feet as she runs down the hall to join her friends.",
    "188": "Annie listens to the growling of the dog and turns to Lindsey in the living room. We see the shape's legs a few feet from the house, next to Lester's legs, kicking and struggling a few feet above the ground; off screen, the shape is strangling the dog in mid-air. Finally, the dog's legs stop moving and dangle lifelessly. Laurie and Tommy are sitting on the couch watching the Horror-thon on TV. Laurie holds out her hand, and Tommy takes it, and together they walk into the kitchen. Annie walks through the passageway to the laundry room, wearing a nylon robe and carrying her clothes to be washed. The wind blows the robe open as the door creaks open, and Annie walks into the dark laundry room. In the light from the main house, Annie sees the light switch. Almost immediately, the wind blows the door shut. Annie stands motionless for a moment, then begins looking for the light switch and turns toward the slightly open door. Behind the door, we see the outline of the shape standing there. The wind blows the door open a little wider, and she glances outside the door. She steps back inside and crosses to the washing machine, opens the top, and dumps her clothes inside. Suddenly, a big gust of wind comes through the opened window above her, and the door slams shut. Annie hurries to the door and tries to open it, but she is unsuccessful and tries to pull the door open. Meanwhile, Lindsey Wallace, 8 years old with a pretty face, watches the Horror Marathon at top volume on TV and lets the phone ring away. Annie turns and glances at the window above the washing machine, where we see the shape looking in, but then the shape is gone. She quickly crosses to the washing machine, climbs up on top of it, and starts out the window, but halfway through she gets stuck. Lindsey finally gets up and walks to the phone, her eyes pivoted on the TV. Lindsey pulls on Annie's legs, and she slides from the window onto the dryer. As Annie and Lindsey walk back into the house, the phone rings, and from the house, Annie hears the phone ring. Lindsey races across the room and picks it up, then sets down the receiver and walks out of the kitchen. Annie gives Lindsey a dirty look and picks it up. Suddenly, behind Annie, the shape walks through the hallway between the living room and the kitchen. Annie then walks into the living room.",
    "1083": "As Tuvia contemplates the cabin full of sick people, Lilka comes in, and his eyes search her face as she hands back the revolver. At the army camp, Viktor is looking at a chart, and Tuvia has come into the camp, causing Zus to look at Tuvia and turn away. Zus comes up, and later at night in the deserted town of Stakiewicze, Zus and Tuvia are sitting in a parked vehicle, where Tuvia is coughing and produces the ornate Mezuzah case. Zus snatches it from him and climbs out of the truck, signaling to Benzion and Krensky. Keeping their heads low, the three of them scurry across to one building and then sneak towards the police station building flying the Nazi flag. Tuvia's feverish eyes watch nervously from inside the vehicle as he starts at the sight of lights flashing amid the sound of gunfire and grips his own gun. Inside the police station, Krensky is shot dead, and Benzion fires back, killing two policemen. Tuvia trembles as Zus dives towards the next office and is shot at by the police chief, but not before gunning him to the ground. Zus runs into the office, flings open the cupboard of small medicine bottles, and scoops them up into a sack. Benzion vaults over the police counter, reaches for the transmitter, and smashes it with the butt end of his rifle, but a policeman bursts in and plants Benzion with bullets. Zus runs back into the front office and guns down the policeman, clutching the wound in his stomach, while Tuvia's face is full of foreboding as the vehicle hurtles out of the town. Wincing with pain, Zus produces the bundle of medicine bottles, and the truck's headlights pierce the bliss of the country road. Sometime later, Shimon officiates the burial, as in his cabin, Tuvia is fighting the fever. At mealtime, as people huddle in groups, Arkady is standing at the food table and glares at Asael. Both draw knives, but Arkady stares at Tuvia's drawn pale face and the black rings under his eyes and sheathes his knife, then saunters off, his lip curled, as Asael watches Tuvia withdraw and Lilka also looks anxious. Asael's eyes blaze with anger. At the army camp, Zus is sitting on his own as Lova, one of his group, kneels down by a basin of water, his face and hands covered in blood. Zus's eyes flicker in anger. In his tent, Viktor, bleary-eyed, is playing the accordion with Gramov sitting by him whistling. Viktor pours another glass of vodka, and Zus indicates Gramov, who doesn't appear to be paying attention, prompting Viktor to swipe him across the face. Gramov glances at this commanding officer and looks up at Zus, as Viktor dismisses the incident with a wave of his hand, and Zus leaves the tent.",
    "1238": "Grainy footage shows matches from the time, featuring rough tackles, as it is revealed that England failed to qualify for the World Cup, making the position of England's manager the most coveted job in the country, with only one obvious choice. In an empty Leeds United stadium, rain soaks the muddy pitch while photographers' flashes light up the boardroom windows. Burly, middle-aged Don Revie, flanked by members of the Leeds board, makes his way from the boardroom to a press conference with a nonchalant wave, as gaunt, grey-haired Manny Cussins, director of the board, sits uneasily before the press, bringing his hand to his mouth. On a gloomy day, a Ford Zodiac travels a moorland road, with two boys in the back staring through rain-soaked windows as the handsome driver, Brian Clough, sings along to the radio, driving past the Leeds United stadium. In the Yorkshire television studios, Brian smirks a wry, lopsided smile. Watching at home, a livid Don storms to the phone and dials. Back at the Elland Road stadium, a group of boys scamper after Brian's Zodiac while it swings into the car park below the Leeds United AFC sign, and a gaggle of reporters flocks around as craggy-faced Jimmy Gordon opens the driver's door, letting Brian and his sons out. Brian waves to his boys and up at the footballers on the training field, who scowl down at him through a chain-link fence, before turning back to the press. Brian struts into the boardroom, shakes Cussins' hand, and sits at the end of the long board table, his broad grin setting hard as the board glare at him, but he still beams his toothy grin. Six years earlier, at the draw, Brian picks up the phone outside Derby County's rundown stadium, the baseball ground, where elderly groundskeepers eye the letters missing from the club's sign. Brian points at the visitor's entrance and marches in through the tatty door, dashing down corridors past smoking cleaners. On the pitch, the groundsman marks white lines as grubby kids gaze over the training ground from streets of terraced houses. Brian stands beside tubby Peter Taylor, watching the team play, and volleys a goal. In his trademark red track suit, Brian sweeps the dingy corridors by the Derby dressing rooms, under flickering strip lights, polishing the brass plaque on the visitors' door and stepping back to admire the now-untarnished sign. In the shower room, Brian stands in the chest-high plunge bath, scrubbing the white tiles with a coarse brush before laying an orange on each of the neatly folded towels on the benches, then placing a heavy, glass ashtray beside each of the towels and strolling out. Brian gravely eyes himself as he smooths his hair in his office mirror.",
    "170": "The strip leads to Mesas Casino, where Chili sits across the desk from Dick Allen, surrounded by lots of jewelry and a giant neon cowgirl visible out the window behind him. He returns a snapshot to Chili, then turns and stares at a minivan. Chili gives the driver a look, gets out of the bus, and stands in the rain, with his seat getting wet and nowhere to go. All the lights are out, except for the blue glow of a television from one of the downstairs rooms. Inside, a shape stirs and we see Harry Zimm, a balding and overweight movie producer. He sits up, grunts, gets out of bed, and looks out of the window. He starts looking around the room for his clothes, listening to a familiar voice at the door. We see it is a nice place as Harry crosses the entry hall to a doorway, with the flickering light of the television emitting from inside the room. Harry moves into the glow of a big Sony television, the rest of the room dark. On the screen, Dave is interviewing actor Martin Weir when suddenly the screen goes black and a desk lamp comes on, causing Harry to jump. Chili leans into the light and keeps his tone quiet and controlled. Harry presses a hand against his chest and then slides it down over his belly, taking his time to show he has it together now. He stares back, trying to figure out who Chili is. Chili nods, almost smiles. Harry lowers his hand, grabs the phone, and punches '0'. Chili leans forward, hangs up the phone with his index finger, and casually reaches for the receiver, then hangs it up. Harry sits down and starts to take another drink, looking at Chili, who shakes his head and keeps staring at Harry with a more thoughtful and curious expression. Chili nods and leans forward on the desk. Their conversation grows louder as Karen descends the stairs. Chili sits with Harry at a butcher block table, with a bottle of Dewars and a couple of glasses between them. He turns around and sees Karen standing in the doorway, her arms folded across her chest, wearing a Lakers T-shirt that comes down just past her crotch. Leo becomes really uncomfortable and motions to her for another drink, when a plane taxis past the window in the background as Leo's head hits the table, followed by a big fireball in the background. Fay reacts as the FAA guy points to a little green hat on one of the tables. She grabs it, clutches it to her chest, and pretends to faint.",
    "534": "The woman looks back at Ron; she gestures with disgust. Ron coughs. Gail walks around the chair. The camera shows she and Mickey talking to Ron through the reflection in the cluttered makeup mirror. Ron sighs. Mickey, as reflected in the mirror, starts to pace. Norman, a Los Angeles TV producer and Mickey's former partner, is driving down a peaceful street lined with palm trees. He's wearing sunglasses and headphones. He clicks his fingers in time to the music only he hears on his Walkman. He's smiling contentedly while Mickey talks over the sun-filled scene. As Mickey finishes his ruminations, Hannah is seen walking towards her front door. She opens it, her back to the camera. Mickey stands there holding two boxed gifts. Hannah continues to nod patiently, patting Mickey on the back, as they make their way across the foyer into the den, where the twins are playing. Mickey wears his coat. Mickey hands a gift to each twin. The twins put down their gifts, one on the sofa, one on the coffee table, and hug their father. Mickey throws the football. There's a sound of breaking glass. Hannah and Mickey react. Mickey is walking up a West Side street, his hands in his coat pockets. Mickey pushes open the outside door of Dr. Abel's office, as the movie cuts to the doctor's consultation room. The doctor is framed in the doorway, looking through a file cabinet. While Mickey answers him offscreen, Dr. Abel turns and walks toward him. The camera follows the doctor's movements from the other side of the wall, obscuring him briefly. It moves across a dark examining-room wall to a second doorway, where Mickey sits on a stool, continuing to talk to the offscreen Dr. Abel. Dr. Abel walks back onscreen. Both he and Mickey are now seen through the second doorway. Dr. Abel sniffs and stands directly in front of the sitting Mickey. He stares down at him as Mickey talks. Dr. Abel chuckles. An uptempo big-band sound is heard as the movie cuts to Mickey's examination, beginning with a close-up of Dr. Abel using an otoscope to examine the ear of a nervous Mickey. The film shows the doctor's hands turning the dials on a sonometer. Mickey sits on a nearby high stool, large earphones on his head. He listens with such concentration that he squints his eyes. He holds up a finger in response to the sounds he hears in his headset. Finally, the film shows Dr. Abel hitting a large tuning fork with his finger. He puts the vibrating fork to Mickey's ear. Mickey, looking up at the offscreen doctor's face, nods. Dr. Abel walks from the examining room, through the consultation room, to a second examining room across the way.",
    "18": "She turns and faces the hallway, her sweetness dissolves in a flash, replaced by repulsion, and quickly she reverses herself, re-entering her apartment and closing the door behind her. Meanwhile, all his considerable talent and strength are focused on seducing a tiny dog into the elevator door he holds open, sniffing at a particular spot on the hall carpeting. Melvin lets the elevator door close and advances on the mutt, who ignores him; the dog lifts his leg just as Melvin lunges and picks him up with a decisive heft, causing dog urine to squirt on the hall wall. Sensing a kindred spirit, the dog starts to growl and bark, taking a snap at Melvin, but Melvin, much meaner and quicker, holds the dog's snout shut with his hand and reaches for the garbage chute door, stuffing the dog in the chute and letting go, just as another apartment door opens, emitting loud party sounds and Simon Nye, in his early 30s, bolts into the hall. Melvin is about to enter his apartment when he notices Simon at the far end of the hall, starts to walk back to his apartment door directly opposite Simon's, and sees his black friend. Then he notices the handyman, tongue in cheek, trying to suppress his amusement. Melvin barely reacts as we hear a loud knocking, and he bursts from his chair. As Simon hears Melvin through the door, he takes a step back, and Melvin throws open the door, looking demonic. Melvin walks back into the apartment, about to close the door when Simon has another burst of bravery, but Melvin enters his apartment and slams the door shut. Meanwhile, Frank smiles affectionately; Simon turns serious as Frank waits patiently and Melvin jerks his door back open. Frank immediately grabs Melvin by his shirt, jerking him forward, and Melvin is scared but appears impressed. On a crowded and dirty street, Melvin comes walking briskly, like an animal wanting to pass through danger without giving off the scent of mounting fear, placing his palms together and extending his arms to cut a path through people, pointedly avoiding stepping on cracks and keeping his eyes focused on the terrain. Elsewhere, Carol Connelly talks with another mother, a customer, about her son for the umpteenth time; the mother nods too sympathetically, but Carol interrupts, and they turn away as Melvin walks a few paces to the waitress station where waitresses Lisa and Carol are talking.",
    "734": "Grabbing onto a cable, Jack stands on the railing of the ship's prow and raises his arms over his head. With his arms spread, he tilts his head back and closes his eyes as the enormous ship surges across the ocean. Meanwhile, Ruth, Rose, and Cal lunch with several guests, including Molly Brown and a brown-haired man with a mustache. Ruth stiffens as Rose lights a cigarette in a holder, inhales, and then blows the smoke in her mother's direction. Cal snatches the cigarette and stubs it out, while Rose smiles at him and then stands and leaves the table. Elsewhere, a brunette girl stands on a railing as her father grips her from behind, and Jack sits a few feet away sketching them with a stick of charcoal while crewmen walk dogs on leashes. The brown-haired Irishman extends his hand to Jack, who gazes across the ship. Rose steps to a railing on an upper deck behind Tommy, who turns and glances at her then grins at Jack. Jack stares up at Rose as she glances in his direction, looks away, and then peeks towards him from the corner of her eyes. Fabrizio waves his hand in front of Jack's face, and Cal steps up behind Rose and grabs her arm. They exchange words, and Rose strides off with Cal rolling his eyes and trailing after her. Wearing a ruby-colored evening gown, Rose shoves past other passengers as she runs down a deck, opens a gate, and dashes down the lower deck leading to the rear of the ship. Meanwhile, Jack lies on a bench smoking a cigarette and gazes up at the starry sky until he sits up as Rose runs past. With tears streaming down her face, Rose runs onto the poop deck at the rear of the ship, glances over her shoulder, and gazes down at the churning water. She places her hands on the railing, climbs onto its first wrung, and, holding onto a flag pole, swings her feet over the railing one at a time, lowering herself onto the gun wheel. Gripping the railing for support, Rose turns to face the water as the wind whips her curly, auburn hair around her face. She leans forward over the ocean, while Jack creeps up behind her, takes a last puff on his cigarette, and tosses it off the ship. Placing his hands into his pockets, he turns to Rose, removes his coat, unlaces his boots and pulls them off, and as Rose stares down at the water, she studies him. He takes off his vest, reaches out his hand, and Rose grabs it, turning around on a narrow ledge and staring into Jack's eyes. He smiles, and Rose steps on the hem of her dress and slips.",
    "1267": "Harry glances back the way they came, with Dumbledore a little way beyond him, facing away. Harry rises as Dumbledore spins around, smiles, raises his eyebrows, nods, and then backs away. The old man turns around again and vanishes into the whiteness. In the forest, Voldemort lies on the ground, pushing Bellatrix aside to see Harry lying motionless. Narcissa Malfoy strides towards the body as Bellatrix stares. Narcissa glances back, leans down, and checks Harry's pulse. Wide-eyed, she looks down and nods imperceptibly, remaining crouched for a moment as Hagrid watches keenly. Narcissa rises, turning to face Voldemort with a solemn expression. A lone figure staggers over rubble in the courtyard; it's Neville, who bends down to pick up the Sorting Hat, dusts it off, holds it upside down, and looks into it as reflection plays on his face. He looks up to see a slow procession of people in the distance and heads the procession as it trudges towards the school. Voldemort moves aside a giant's body, which falls from the bridge, and a large army of Death Eaters troops across. Neville, still clutching the Sorting Hat, slithers at Voldemort's side into the courtyard. Arthur pulls Ginny back as Ron and Hermione stand horrified and open-mouthed. Voldemort turns to his Death Eaters, and Lucius calls out, drawing all eyes to his son, Draco. Lucius stretches out his hand, purses his lips, and Draco sets off towards his parents as McGonagall and the students watch grim-faced. Draco joins his parents, and Narcissa puts her arm around him, leading him into the crowd of Death Eaters. Neville shuffles forward as Voldemort's face twitches and he flexes the bony fingers of his left hand. Neville glares at Seamus, his hand on his heart, and stares defiantly at Voldemort. As he draws the sword from the Sorting Hat, Harry leaps from Hagrid's arms; his spell bounces off Nagini, and he runs for cover. Voldemort uses his wand to shoot fire at Harry, prompting several Death Eaters to make their escape as the students run into the school and Shacklebolt deflects the attackers. A flash hits the Sword of Gryffindor, catapulting Neville backward, and the Malfoys make their escape back across the bridge. Harry is alone, clutching his wand, walking backward and turning sharply. Hearing movement, he spins, fires, and hits a door frame, with three bodies lying on the ground. He runs as Voldemort apparates at the main staircase. Harry hides behind a wall, clutching a Basilisk fang, and shows himself as Voldemort climbs the main staircase. They fend off each other's energy blasts like a sword fight. Voldemort, with Nagini behind him, moves towards Harry, disappears, and apparates above him on the stairs as they lock energy blasts. Harry is forced backward as Nagini slithers up the stairs towards him.",
    "1066": "Birds take flight over a land which has turned green as the dusty plains have been replaced by rivers, lakes and islands, and waterfalls tumble down the rocks of the previously dry canyon. Sarah and Drover are bathing in a pool in each other's arms when Nullah jumps in, and they all dine happily outside in the evening twilight. Later, Sarah and Drover stand together in each other's arms, kissing, and Sarah watches him ride away while a herd of horses thunders past the house, driven by Drover. He sprints up to Sarah, waiting on the porch, and launches himself into her arms, and they kiss passionately. Fletcher knocks Carney into a swamp with his rifle, and a crocodile attacks the cattle king. At sunset, Drover, in the saddle, leans down and kisses Sarah. The house and neat, colorful gardens of Faraway Downs are bathed in sunshine as a figure in crocodile boots ties cotton around a fly. Fletcher is sitting with a boot up on the dining table, and Sarah stares at him in dismay. He sidles up and whispers to her, then points to a display of spears before she frowns as he leaves. Bandy comes slowly back into the room, and Sarah turns anxiously to her. Nullah stands up on top of a water tower as Sarah watches his arrival from the verandah. He stops his horse, checks his herd, then gallops off, and she wakes up in bed, frowns, and then looks across at Drover lying next to her and smiles, running a hand down his bearded cheek and then down his hairy, muscular chest. A wild horse is ridden, bucking, around a training ring, and he frowns at the boy while Nullah cowers behind a gate. Drover watches him go, followed by his dog, and he frowns thoughtfully while trimming his beard. Sarah is sitting in the bath, looking upset as she listens sullenly, frowing as he stands expressionlessly on the verandah while birds fly over a rocky hill and Drover works a brumby in the paddock. He whirls a lariat as the wild horse canters around him and launches the rope, which slips around the horse's neck; the brumby bucks wildly, trying to get away. Bandy heats a brand in the fire and passes it to Sarah, who brands a steer being held down, while Nullah, minding the horses, looks up and sees his grandfather, exchanging hand gestures with him. In the paddock, Drover works the wild horse, hauling on the rope to prevent it from bucking, while Nullah looks at Sarah, then into her eyes, and across at his grandfather. The brumby trots towards Drover, who holds out his hand to it, while holding on to Nullah, Sarah looks around, and the plain behind her is empty.",
    "225": "He climbs in. The car belches and pops and toodles off down the road. Delmar staggers to his feet and stumbles over to the carcass of the frog, weeping. His arms, stretched high over his head, are tied to a tree limb. His interrogator wields a bullwhip. Another lash, another scream. A third man walks into the torchlight, a hound drooling at his heels. He is Cooley, the sheriff with mirrored sunglasses whom we remember from previous barn confrontations. The two men acknowledge by backing away from Pete and then the accelerating pitter-patter of arriving rain. Cooley looks up. He looks back down at Pete. He shrugs, looks off. Looking up, into black: a rope is tossed up - it recedes out of the torchlight into black night - and then drops back down into the light, a noose bouncing at its end. The two henchmen fit the noose over Pete's neck. Delmar doggedly shakes his head. We distantly hear picks ringing and male chanting. Hollow-eyed, Everett tries to convince himself as much as Delmar. His voice trails away as he looks out at the road. They are passing a line of chained men in prison stripes and duck-billed caps wielding pickaxes and shovels at the side of the road. As he stares at the line of men Everett tries to pick up his thread. The prisoners look like phantoms in the heat and dust. Everett is haunted. The last man in line swings his pick and, as he grows smaller, looks up. Everett stares. Lone and lorn, he returns Everett's slack-jawed stare until heat ripples and the truck's dusty wake dissolve him away. Everett blinks. Everett shakes his head as if to clear it. The truck rattles on. On a bunting-covered stage, a pencil-necked man with round rimless glasses addresses a crowd of rustics. The pencil-neck is identified on posters as 'Homer Stokes, Friend of the Little Man', and, in life as in the pictures, he shakes a broom over his head. A midget in overalls stands next to him. The midget waves his little midget broom in time with Stoke's waves. He beams amid cheers and then, as three girls in gingham frocks run out to join him. The oldest girl is about ten. Everett stomps toward the stage, fighting his way through the crowd. Puzzled, Delmar follows. A man in a straw boater joins them. Everett sniffs and, catching a scent, squints. With this he takes a wild swing which Waldrip easily eludes. Waldrip adapts a Marquess of Queensbury stance and prances about, delivering stinging punches to the nose of a stunned and outclassed Everett. Its glass doors swing open and Everett is hurled out and bellyflops into the dust of the street.",
    "178": "Laurie stands by the telephone, shrugs, turns away from the window, and walks back to Tommy and Lindsey sitting on the couch. Meanwhile, in another room, illuminated only by candlelight, sheets move slowly up and down on a bed. Empty beer cans form a trail from the door to the bed as lovemaking occurs between Bob and Lynda, suddenly stopping as Bob grabs Lynda, pushing her down on the bed. The camera moves back from the bed as they continue, through the bedroom doorway, where The Shape stands in the darkness watching them. Bob and Lynda finally climax, and Bob rolls off Lynda. She, with messy hair and a sense of frustration, lights a cigarette, handing it to Bob, then lights one for herself while he leaves. Lynda smiles to herself and leans back onto the pillows. Bob leaves and comes through the swinging doors, opening the refrigerator to take out two beers. He gathers the food and beers into his arms, looks around the kitchen, finds a can of peanuts in another cupboard, and steps to the door to look outside at the empty yard where just the wind blows the trees before he shuts the doors. Then, Bob freezes, staring at the two doors, walks to one and opens it, turns from it, steps to the other and opens it. Right behind the door, The Shape, wearing the rubber mask, steps out and grabs Bob around the neck with an instantaneous lunge. Bob attempts to jump away, but The Shape has a firm hold on his neck, causing Bob to cough and gag. The Shape then lifts Bob up off the floor; Bob's feet leave the ground as he makes a guttural sound with The Shape's hand tightening around his windpipe. Still holding him up with one hand, The Shape slams Bob against the wall, holding him several feet off the floor as Bob struggles to get free. The Shape lifts his other hand, which holds the butcher knife, and drives it deeply into Bob's chest with a slamming thud, embedding the other end of the knife into the wall. The Shape steps away, leaving Bob hanging there, impaled on the wall, eyes open in horror, dead. Unaware of what has happened, Lynda lounges in the bed, smoking another cigarette, and hears what she thinks is Bob entering the room, but doesn't look up. The Shape, disguised as a ghost, stands in the doorway, motionless. Lynda laughs at her own joke, then stops when she realizes the ghost doesn't move or respond, making her turn around and look again as the ghost just stands there.",
    "1279": "A truck rumbles down a desert highway towards the smoking chimneys of an industrial complex, and the driver fiddles with the radio, looks puzzled, then switches on his windscreen wipers as a cloud envelops the truck. Starting at the back, the truck is eaten to dust by the voracious mass which flies on, causing a road sign to disintegrate, chewed to nothing. Others start to panic as the cloud flows into the ops room while a huge array of men in vehicles has assembled nearby. Vast pressure strains the massive steel doors of the facility until they burst open and one is hurled high in the air. The soldiers let fly at the cloud with all the firepower at their disposal, but it rises inexorably down the hillside towards them, and men start to run as the cloud reaches them. The Defense Secretary stares at the officer, then lowers her eyes in resignation. Meanwhile, in a sparsely furnished room, Helen sits head bowed and then looks affectionately at Mike. She gathers up her belongings, including her phone, and checks her watch. In the woods near a high bridge, Jacob and Klaatu find an old ranger hut, force open the door, and Jacob tries the phone. Klaatu unplugs the receiver, touches his finger to the end of the cord, plugs it back in, and hands the phone to Jacob. The lad reaches up to dial on the wall-mounted phone as Klaatu looks around the room. A pickup drives down a forest road with Jacob and Klaatu sitting in the open back. Jacob looks earnestly at Klaatu, who considers him without emotion and then looks thoughtfully at Jacob. An iron gate is topped with ornate spikes as Jacob climbs over a low wall also topped with iron railings, followed by Klaatu. The alien follows the boy into a cemetery filled with rows of white headstones, and Klaatu looks down at the inscriptions. Jacob kicks leaves away from one of the graves and dusts off the headstone with his glove, then looks pleadingly at Klaatu, who studies him and walks away. Jacob kneels down dejectedly in front of his father's grave, and as he kneels crying, Helen rushes up to him, kneels down, puts her arms around him, and hugs him tightly. They put their arms around each other and hold each other tightly as Klaatu watches them intently. Remaining expressionless, Klaatu walks towards them, and as he approaches, wind blows the leaves. Mike arrives in his SUV, and Helen looks imploringly at him, her eyes filled with tears. The swarm darkens the sky behind Klaatu and approaches a sports stadium, which crumbles to dust as the cloud engulfs it. The mass, now a vast swirling gray sea, is heading for New York. The Secretary raises a hand to her mouth, stifling her emotion.",
    "1274": "Hermione and Ron go downstairs as Luna follows Harry. In the courtyard, she faces the school where massive stone statues of warriors wielding huge weapons land on the paved terrace by the main entrance. The stone warriors march down steps to the courtyard, as Professor Flitwick strides across the cobbled courtyard and points his wand in the air, joined by Professor Slughorn and Molly. Students stand beside them, staring up into the sky as flashes of light flow from the wands, causing clouds to join together. A Dementor flies past and is repelled by the ever-increasing mass that extends to cover the school and the grounds, forming a protective shield. Inside, Harry continues making his way up a spiral staircase against the tide of students, with Luna catching up to him. He stops and turns, spotting something outside a window. Moving towards it, he gazes out at the glowing protective shields as they slowly descend, and side by side, they stare at the shield. Flitwick is outside, watching the shield ascend, as Luna and Harry stand framed between torches. His shadow cast against a wall, Harry continues along a dark corridor, the only light coming from a tall window on his right, as he nears a stone doorway. Harry sees a ghostly dark-haired woman in a gray dress hovering by a window, who turns to him, becomes a ball of light, and passes through Harry. The ghostly woman stops with a somber and anxious face. Outside, the night is almost pitch black, with the lights of Hogwarts glowing dimly in the distance, as an amassed army of Death Eaters stands on a rocky outcrop looking down at the school. They part as Voldemort, followed by Bellatrix, strides through the army to the edge of the cliff and turns to glare at Pius Thicknesse, who backs away. The Death Eaters aim their wands in the air and loose a volley of bolts of light, raining down like shooting stars on the protective shield. Harry looks across at the ghostly Helena as she moves away. He runs around a walkway and leaps onto a low wall. Having confronted Harry, she recedes, floating away from him, out into the walkway. Harry follows her as she stands with her back to him, turns stiffly to face him, studies his careworn face, then moves closer before floating away. Helena transforms into a ball of light and speeds away. Harry races down the spiral staircase where Kingsley Shacklebolt is with Remus Lupin and student Dean Thomas. Shacklebolt stares up as the Death Eaters' bolts strike them, while the Weasley twins, George and Fred, stare up at the sky. Hermione stands behind Ron at a door decorated with six large metal snakes.",
    "182": "The old woman stares at her suspiciously for a moment, then turns from the door and walks away. Her hand reaches out and touches it. Tommy turns and runs upstairs crying. Laurie moves from the door to the telephone. She picks it up, dials a number, and waits. She puts down the phone and stands very still. Slowly, Laurie moves around the couch. Slowly, Laurie sinks down to her knees by the couch. Her hand brushes against the knitting needles protruding from her tote bag. She reacts to the feel of the knitting needles and pulls one out. She begins crying softly, her eyes wide with fear. Suddenly, the shape leaps up from behind the couch! He springs at her, plunging the butcher knife. The blade of the butcher knife thumps into the couch. Laurie suddenly jumps backward, raising her arm instinctively. Instinctively, Laurie raises the knitting needle and drives it home, right into the shape's neck! The shape springs backward, clawing at the needle, rolling his head back and forth. Then suddenly he freezes, hands outstretched, motionless, and falls into a heap on the floor. Laurie sits there. The shape doesn't move. She stares at it. The camera moves with Loomis as he moves along the street. Suddenly two headlights hit him, and a police car swerves to a stop next to him. Standing there is the shape, the butcher knife raised. Both children scream. Laurie shoves them into the bathroom and pulls the door shut, leaving herself outside in the bedroom. There is a click as the bathroom door is locked. Laurie leaps away from the door and circles around the bed. The shape keeps coming. The shape moves for her, slowly now, but relentless, the knife glistening. Laurie dashes to a clothes closet and ducks inside. Laurie pulls the sliding doors closed and crawls back into the small, dark interior of the closet. Suddenly the doors begin to buckle as the shape pounds on them. The door buckles inward as the shape smashes against it. She reaches up and grabs a wire hanger from the top of the closet. She twists the top of the hanger, unwinding the wire. The door breaks in. The shape steps inside, pushing aside the clothes. She unhooks the hanger and bends it out straight. The shape leans in, peering down at Laurie in the corner, raising the knife. Holding the hanger with both hands, she thrusts it forward with all her might. The wire hanger flashes into the shape's right eye. He leaps back in pain, dropping the butcher knife, grabbing his eye with both hands. She grasps the butcher knife with both hands and jabs it upward. The butcher knife plunges into the shape's mid-section, right down to the hilt.",
    "1210": "Rambo rips out his throat and throws him to the floor, and Sarah looks up. Soldiers fight over women at the dance as Rambo leads Sarah from the officer's hut and across the compound. The dance hut is engulfed in red smoke, and boozy soldiers stagger from it, grinning; one taps another on the shoulders. Rambo leads Sarah under the wooden bridge over the stream, and they hide there briefly, as drunken troopers stagger over it. From below, Sarah and Rambo watch their solid army boots go by. A woman is dragged from the smoky dance hut. Rambo leads Sarah up the stream as the party is all over, and the last of the soldiers stagger away from the dance hut. Sarah and Rambo climb up the banks of the stream and into the road, and she falls in the mud. They're spotted by patrolling guards who raise their rifles, and Rambo leaps onto Sarah to shield her. School Boy shoots one of them and then aims again, and the second guard's head explodes and he flies through a nearby fence to join his fallen comrade. Rambo and Sarah leave as School Boy closes a night-vision sight on his weapon. The rain has stopped, and the moon appears from behind a bank of cloud. The commander emerges from his hut in his vest, pushing the small boy before him. He stands on his veranda, watching the boy trudge away across the compound before turning and heading back inside, closing the hut door behind him. Rambo, Sarah, and School Boy run through the forest and pause breathlessly at a tree trunk. Rambo turns to School Boy, and they exchange stares before they move away. A golden sun peaks over the tops of trees, and the camp is a hive of activity. Tracker dogs sniff around clothing for scents, and they're lifted into the backs of trucks. The commander strides angrily out of his hut, exchanges words with a junior before stalking across the compound to the soldier's hut, and goes inside to stare wide-eyed in horror at the sight of the soldier's corpse on the hut floor, with blood either wet or caked about the man's dead neck or pooling on the floor. The commander takes a few short breaths and leaves again. Rambo, Sarah, and School Boy run past a wall of rock. The commander stands in the passenger seat of the truck with a mounted machine-gun and leads a small convoy out of the camp, followed by a pair of open-topped lorries packed with troopers. Lewis leads his party of mercenaries and rescued peasants through the forest, and some way behind him are Rambo, Sarah, and School Boy. On a dirt road, one of the lorries pulls up and a bunch of troopers dismount with weapons primed.",
    "167": "He holds her gaze as angrily as she holds his. As she starts to rise, he grabs her arm, but she pulls free. She says it derisively and it stings, but Gandhi is aware of Walker and he fights to hold his temper. Ba settles back defiantly. For a moment Gandhi stares at her, and she back at him, resentfully. He suddenly reaches down and grabs her arm, pulling her roughly to her feet. It is hushed but violent as he pulls her toward the rear door, opening it to push her out as she struggles against him. Gandhi stares at her breathlessly, his temper subsiding into a dazed remorse. He sinks numbly to a stool, sitting, holding his head in his hands. Ba studies him for a moment -- and she sighs, her temper and breathing subsiding too. She moves and kneels before him. A moment, then she soothes the top of his head -- like the mother-wife she is. Gandhi looks up at her, blankly, abjectly. And Gandhi grins weakly. Ba catches it and sends it back, warmer, less complicated by doubts. Gandhi sighs, putting his arms around her and she leans into him so that their heads are touching. Ba nods. Gandhi holds her back so that he can look at her. She looks at him evenly -- no smile, but the warmth still in her eyes. The theater is packed. The front rows near the stage are held by rich Muslim merchants, the back of the stalls with small traders, peddlers, artisans -- Muslim, Hindu, Parsee, Sikh. The gallery is bulging with indentured laborers -- largely Hindu. The mood is restless, belligerent. Gandhi moves forward and he holds up his hand for silence. Seated on the stage are Khan, Singh, three more leaders of the Indian community. Charlie Andrews and Herman Kallenbach sit at the very end of the line of chairs. Gandhi looks around the audience and we see the packed house from his point of view, ending with two plainclothes European policemen conspicuous in seats at the end of the front row. A uniformed policeman stands near them. A buzz, then applause -- loud and defiant. When it subsides, Gandhi looks down at the plainclothes policemen, fixing his gaze on them. And again the audience bursts into applause. The policemen just sit like stone -- confident, sure, immune to rhetoric. In the gallery, a rhythmic pounding signals the anger and protest and is taken up around the hall. The police stare imperturbably. Khan leans towards Singh, nodding to Gandhi. Singh smiles at the understatement. Gandhi holds up his hand, silencing the hall. Now a violent response -- a large, powerful merchant rises in the third row.",
    "944": "Holmes spots two pipers outside the church and gestures for them to play. Watson awakes with an appalled expression. Holmes starts pulling at a coat Watson is using as a blanket. Watson clings to it, so Holmes yanks it from his grasp. A couple of empty bottles fall out of the car as Watson struggles out of it. As Holmes tries to tidy him up, the sleeve of Watson's jacket rips off. Holmes tosses it into the car. Watson eyes him wearily, and Holmes nods. They clasp hands, and Holmes leads a shambling Watson towards the church. The guests are in their places as the bride makes her way up the aisle. Everyone gets to their feet, including Mrs. Hudson, who taps a slumbering Holmes on the shoulder. He comes to and rises to his feet. A spruced-up Watson is standing beside him. Holmes quickly adjusts Watson's tie and buttonhole, before Watson lifts the bride's veil. She smiles up at him and sees he's sporting a black eye and generally looks knocked about. She looks over at Holmes, who winks reassuringly. Watson places the ring on his new wife's finger, and they share a kiss. Holmes looks down thoughtfully. As Watson and his bride leave the church, they walk beneath the raised swords of several guardsmen. Standing alone by the latched gate of the churchyard, Holmes applauds. Holmes disappears through the gate and cranks his car's engine into life. Moriarty's bearded agent is leaning against the side of the car. The agent rolls a cigarette. The agent steps aside and Holmes pulls away in a cloud of smoke. Kings College, Cambridge. Puffing on his pipe, Holmes makes his way across a quadrangle and goes into a building. Holmes walks into a room where a gramophone is playing. Moriarty and another man, Matthew, are there. Moriarty looks round at him. As Moriarty sits at his desk and signs the book, Holmes walks behind him and looks at a blackboard covered in calculations. Moriarty looks up. Holmes spots a book by the blackboard. Holmes sees a dying plant nearby. Moriarty hands the signed asteroid book back to Holmes. They shake hands. Holmes steps away and looks at the signature. Moriarty gets up. A flashback to Irene. Irene's tea was poisoned. He shows Holmes her bloodstained handkerchief. Moriarty sits at a chessboard and picks up the black queen. Holmes looks down thoughtfully. He picks up Irene's handkerchief from the chessboard. Holmes glares at him then makes to go. Moriarty stares after Holmes then turns his attention back to the chessboard. He moves the black queen.

The camera stays focused on the doorway to this room as the doctor and Mickey talk offscreen. Dr. Abel briefly passes by the doorway. Looking preoccupied, Dr. Abel walks back into the consultation room, holding Mickey's open file. He strides over to his desk, revealing a frightened Mickey, sitting in a chair opposite it. Still standing, the doctor leans over the desk, his back to the camera, and makes a few notes in the file. Dr. Abel chuckles as he closes Mickey's file and straightens up. The camera looks past his back and shoulders to the anxious Mickey. Dr. Abel lays his pen across Mickey's closed file. He walks around his desk and sits on its edge close to Mickey. Mickey stands in a telephone booth on a corner near Dr. Abel's office; he talks on the phone. It is raining. A man and a woman holding an umbrella pass by; traffic moves across a nearby intersection. The film cuts to Dr. Wilkes, on the telephone at his end. He is in his office; he leans back in his chair, dangling his stethoscope as he speaks. Behind him, a chest X-ray is mounted on a light panel. The movie cuts back and forth between Mickey in his phone booth asking questions and Dr. Wilkes in his office answering them. Gail, wearing her glasses, stands behind a crowded but well-ordered desk. Two assistants, a man and a woman, stand around her. The assistants walk off. As they leave, Gail calls out after them. The telephone starts to ring, Gail pauses, looking offscreen. She takes off her glasses and squints. The film cuts to Mickey, who is pacing and wringing his hands. He walks over to Gail. He starts to pant, looking worriedly around the room. He continues to wring his hands as Gail stares at him, concerned. She sits down and picks up the phone. Gail hangs up the phone. He pants and begins to pace around the room. The camera follows him as he walks away from Gail. Mickey sighs. Mickey begins pacing around the room again. He wrings his hands and blows on them. An abstract painting on a wall fills the screen. Light laughter is heard, as well as the sophisticated music; offscreen brunch guests chatter indistinctly. Holly walks onto the screen in front of the painting. She holds an almost empty tray of hors d'oeuvres; she wears a uniform. One of the men, murmuring his thanks, takes a last shrimp puff as Holly passes. Holly finally makes her way into the cluttered loft kitchen. Her tray is empty.",
    "649": "Salim lowers Jamal by his legs over a window, where a family inside the carriage is sharing a huge meal of pickles, rice, vegetables, and chapati. A young boy in a turban spies Jamal as he reaches in through the window and steals a couple of chapatis. The boy nudges his father and points, prompting the father to grab Jamal through the window. Jamal grips onto the window frame for dear life, but the father violently tugs Jamal, causing him to lose his grip and fall from the train, pulling Salim with him. The two brothers tumble down a slope next to the passing train and eventually sit up, breathless. Jamal stares at the horizon, and as the dust clears, the majestic white marbled palace of the Taj Mahal is revealed in the distance. The boys walk through a set of ground gates, staring agog at the magnificent architecture. Jamal notices the hundreds of pairs of shoes left by visiting tourists, and he and Salim steal a pair of trainers each. A sign reads that guided tours visitors are requested to collect receipts. Jamal stands leaning against the doorway as throngs of tourists mill past into the Taj Mahal. A middle-aged couple approaches Jamal, and the man offers money to him, which Jamal pockets. Outside the Taj Mahal, Jamal takes Polaroid photographs of tourists as Salim steals the tourists' shoes while they pose for Jamal. The boys then sell the shoes from a store. At night, Jamal and Salim sit smoking a hookah pipe and drinking with friends around a campfire, and Salim wears fancy leather cowboy boots. By day, Jamal touts for tourists as a guide while Salim counts wads of cash. Jamal photographs an Asian tourist outside the Taj and shows her a picture of Princess Diana in the same spot, but security guards spot the boys and chase them off. Jamal guides the tourist couple to a riverside, and while they are there, Salim and his gang break into the tourist's Mercedes taxi. Meanwhile, Salim's gang steals the tires off the Mercedes just as Jamal brings the tourists back from the river. The Indian driver starts hitting and kicking Jamal, and the woman mouths the word \"money\" to her husband, who then takes out his wallet and hands Jamal a $100 bill. Jamal rubs his eye where the driver punched him, and at night, he kneels before a pool and bathes his black eye. He looks into the night in the direction from where the music is coming and walks through a forest toward an outdoor stage, where Salim, Jamal, and their gang of urchins scamper across scaffolding supporting rows of seats above. The audience is mesmerized by the performance and fails to notice the boys stealing handbags and purses from between people's legs, while Jamal is captivated by the singers on stage.",
    "719": "Rose watches the elevator ascend, then glances around as she wades through the water, and she glances up at a sign over a doorway. She walks down a short corridor and turns down a long hallway. In the office, Jack, still handcuffed to the pipe, climbs onto a desk as the water rises. Rose pauses at a staircase, then turns left and walks down another flooded corridor, littered with floating furniture. The hall lights flicker on and off. Jack turns toward the closed office door. Rose turns around and hurries to the office door. Rose steps into the office, kisses Jack, and searches through a cabinet filled with keys. Rose pulls out a desk drawer and turns to Jack. They exchange smiles while Rose searches in the drawer. Meanwhile, the bow of the ship sinks. Empty-handed, Rose glances around the office, pushes the desk chair out of her way as she walks to Jack, kisses him, and makes her way out of the office. Rose moves down the long, dim corridor in waist-deep water, climbs upstairs to the D deck, and runs down hallways. A mustached man runs toward Rose, then runs away. Rose gazes down the empty corridor, takes a few steps, and stops as the lights go out. Her chest heaves as she leans back against the wall. The lights turn back on, and Rose stands. A dark-haired steward rounds the corner, pulls her, and she punches him in the face. He stumbles back and touches his bloody nose, then hurries away. Rose leans back against the wall, blinks, then stares ahead. She steps forward, unwraps a fire hose, and uses it to break the glass on a case containing an axe. She grabs the axe and runs toward the E deck stairs. On the bridge, Smith leans over the railing and gazes down at the flooding bow and front well deck. Meanwhile, Rose descends the E deck stairs and stops above the water, which has risen above several steps. She steps down into the water, grabs an overhead frame, and ducks her head out into the hallway. She glances both ways down the flooded hallway, then steps back and hangs the axe on the frame. She takes off her long sweater and drops it, grabs the axe with one hand, and wades into the water. With her free hand, she grasps a long pipe running along the ceiling, propelling herself down the hallway. She holds the axe over her head and walks through the chest-deep water into the office. She holds out the axe. Jack stretches the chain connecting the handcuffs out on the water pipe. Rose lifts the axe, walks to the wooden cabinet, swings the axe, and strikes the cabinet door.",
    "1182": "Ron snickers and holds out his hand, but Harry does not shake it. Professor McGonagall returns and gives Malfoy a sharp, warning look before the oak doors swing open, leading the way into the magnificent great hall of Hogwarts School. The first-years march down the center of the room, watched curiously by the rest of the school sitting at long tables. Hermione looks up at the ceiling to see hundreds of lighted candles floating mid-air above their heads, below a moonlit sky. Professor McGonagall stops beside a patched and battered wizard's hat perched on a stool in front of the high table as Hermione tries to calm herself and sits. Professor McGonagall puts the sorting hat on her head, and the hat speaks. Delighted, Hermione runs to the Gryffindor table while Malfoy sits down. As the hat touches his head, a man with black hair is sitting next to Professor Quirrell, and Harry winces and touches his scar. Ron steps forward nervously, and the sorting hat is placed on his head, recognizing him at once. Ron sighs with relief, and Harry smiles. Professor Dumbledore leans forward with interest, and Hagrid holds his breath. Harry steps up onto the platform, sits on the stool, and the hat is placed on his head as the sorting hat regards him thoughtfully. Hagrid and the professors join in the applause, and the other Gryffindors welcome Harry as he joins Ron and Hermione. Harry looks up towards the high table, where Professor Dumbledore winks and raises his golden goblet in salute. A wonderful banquet appears magically on the long tables, and the delighted children fill their plates. Ron grabs a chicken drumstick in each hand and takes a bite from each one in turn, while Seamus introduces himself. Harry turns to Ron's brother, suddenly noticing a ghostly head appearing in the middle of the table as more ghostly figures float around the great hall, including a lady with ringlets, a plump man in a monk's habit, and a cavalier with a sword and a long, curling wig who swoop above the tables. Percy speaks to the ghost on the Gryffindor table, who then floats away, and Ron calls after him as he tilts his half-severed head and puts it back. Later, Percy leads them upstairs where, high above their heads, the staircases swing to different positions, and the images in the portraits are alive. A pretty flower girl curtsies and an old man looks up from his book as they walk along the corridor. Percy stops in front of a gilt-framed portrait of a large lady with ringlets wearing a pink silk dress, who looks at them inquiringly and beckons graciously. The portrait swings aside to reveal a cozy sitting room with a blazing fire, and in the boys' dormitory, uniforms are neatly folded on the chairs beside their four-poster beds.",
    "885": "A third man, Mr. Hurst, comes over as Darcy regards the building with an air of detachment. Inside, the dancing is well under way, with smiling men and women in pastel gowns holding hands and going round in a circle. An older man, Sir William Lucas, claps from the sidelines. Dressed in their empire-line dresses, Lizzie and Lydia are thoroughly enjoying themselves. With dainty steps, they set to their partners and do-si-do before re-forming the circle. In a two-line formation, before the chamber musicians, the ladies and gentlemen set to their respective partners, then in unison glide across the floor, back and forth, a blaze of color and feathers. Heralding the arrival of the Bingley party, an awestruck hush descends upon the room. The new arrivals look distinctly ill at ease before Sir William Lucas hurries over to greet them. As people take to the floor again, Lizzie joins Jane and Mary, who are standing with Sir William's daughter, Charlotte. The two girls go to join their mother, and the ladies curtsy. But, with a curt bow, Darcy is gone, much to Mrs. Bennet's annoyance. Jane glances at her mother, before returning her attention to Bingley. Later, she's dancing with him, holding hands and smiling warmly. Whilst the young couple are enjoying themselves, watching at the side, Darcy cannot hide his disdain. Darcy turns and spots Mrs. Bennet holding court over tea and cake, not bothering to hide her contempt for him. Then, moving on, he spots Kitty and Lydia, running wild through the hall. On the dark street below, local men are getting merry and mimicking the dancing going on inside. One man is so enthusiastic he trips and falls in a water trough. When Jane and Bingley's dance comes to an end, he leads her by the hand to present her to his sisters. Mrs. Bennet looks on, with an approving smile. Jane and Bingley dance again. Bingley wears a dark tailcoat with pale satin breeches. Jane's dress is a delicate creamy gold with puff sleeves. She wears long white evening gloves. Bingley, who has noble features and fair curly hair, is an accomplished dancer, moving through the steps with ease and grace. Darcy prowls through the hall, his face set in grim forbearance. Sir William goes to speak to him but then thinks better of it. Nearby, Lizzie is sitting with a rather serious Mary. With a nervous glance at his party, Bingley allows Jane to lead him to be introduced to Charlotte Lucas. Another dance begins. Sitting nearby, Lizzie hears him and bristles. Bingley heads off. Having heard everything, Lizzie looks at Darcy out the corner of her eye. Then, with a mischievous smile, she gets up and crosses the room in front of him.",
    "1306": "Joseph Dunne changes channels with a remote control, moving past the upside-down cartoons and talk shows, and stops on an upside-down picture of a crashed train. As his knees come forward and he flips over, he tumbles slowly off the couch and onto the carpet while gazing at the television screen, which shows a live aerial view of a train wreck smoldering below, with two trains tangled like snakes. Joseph gets up and moves to a small table with a phone next to a notepad. We are in a physical therapy center where about a dozen people are on specialized weight machines, including an elderly woman seated on an exercise table, breathing slowly, while Audrey looks away. The ancient secretary's right hand immediately picks up a pen and positions it over a blank pad while her left hand keeps typing, never looking up. Rain falls in sheets in the stadium where David stands at the entrance to a tunnel that empties onto the field. He is in an imposing dark green rain poncho and hood, which nearly touches the ground, and the word 'security' on the back has almost faded away, barely revealing David's face. There is a football game in progress on the enormous field, where the players seem unusually small as David steps out into the rain and turns on the bench. The room is still as they both stand awkwardly for a moment and Audrey tries to mask her reaction to the oddness of the question. Elijah just sits staring at the dark television screen, his face tense and unyielding. Elijah's mother says the next words in almost a whisper, and Elijah's eyes move from the television to his mother, seeing the emotion in her face. Neither says anything for a while as Elijah thinks it over and looks at his mother with disbelief. Elijah walks across the playground, very wary of the other children running about, toward the bench with the present on it, taking a seat and placing the package on his lap. It's flat, with edges bending down over his thin legs. He undoes the white bow, peels off the clear tape holding the brown paper together, and unfolds the paper to reveal a single comic book in his lap. He feels the shadow of his mother as she takes a seat next to him, and he looks at her with intelligent, piercing eyes, then back down at his lap. He opens the first page to find two figures depicted on top of a building locked in a fierce battle, one of which is extremely muscular with a mask.",
    "1339": "The judge is too stunned to respond, and he goes over to Valjean and gently leads him out. Meanwhile, Fantine starts to spasm and sees something over Valjean's shoulder. Her eyes go glassy as she passes away. Valjean then hears the unforgettable voice of Javert behind him and stands to face him. Javert draws his sword and aims it at Valjean, who breaks a section of timber beam from the roof. They sing at the same time, duelling in song, and the men start to circle each other. Meanwhile, Cosette goes to put the broom away as Madame Thenardier imitates her singing. We see Cosette's frightened eyes peering out from a tiny gap in the wall as Eponine comes in from outside. Madame Thenardier sees that Cosette, far from going, is hiding behind the far wall and goes outside to open up the rather pathetic frost fair stall on the porch of the inn. The innkeeper's gang, posing as customers who have been loitering outside, come in, explaining to a fifth man who is a newer recruit a story from Monsieur Thenardier's past, and Madame Thenardier ushers him inside. She pretends to accidentally drop a comb from her hair, and the customer helpfully picks it up, allowing Madame Thenardier to pick his wallet from a back pocket as he stands up. Thenardier has thieved the pocket watch using his handshake as a distraction and fusses over them, all the while pissing into the very wine bottle he's using to serve the customer. He is going through the groom's trousers elsewhere, while Cosette has filled her buckets at the well in the wood and is now heading back, going slowly because the buckets are heavy. After a few steps, she pauses to rest the weight of the buckets and looks up, amazed to see Valjean. Thenardier turns to his wife as Valjean gives him money, and then Valjean gives more money. He leads Cosette to the door and lifts her into the waiting cab as Madame Thenardier takes the bunch of notes from her husband's hand and inspects them. Through the open door, Thenardier sees a man on horseback rattling up to the inn, where Javert strides in. Valjean's cab, moving fast, passes down the road into the city. Inside the cab, Valjean has one arm around Cosette to protect her from the jolting as he gazes at her slipping into a fitful sleep. Valjean and Cosette turn down a narrow street, no longer hurrying, and make their way down a darkened street. They begin running down narrow alleys, into small dark courtyards, not knowing which way to turn, until Valjean finds a section of tumble-down wall and climbs over.",
    "88": "They stare at him, followed by an awkward beat as Jerry enters through the kitchen door, wearing a parka and a red plaid Elmer Fudd hat and carries a bag of groceries, which he deposits on the kitchen counter. Jerry enters again, pulling off his plaid cap, while Wade Gustafson is mid-sixtyish, vigorous, with a full head of gray hair. A twisting perspective reveals an aerial shot of a two-lane highway, bordered by snowfields, carrying one moving car, which is driven by Carl Showalter. Grimsrud gives Carl a sour look, followed by a long beat as Gaear Grimsrud stares blankly at Carl. Jerry sits in his glassed-in salesman's cubicle just off the showroom floor, facing an irate customer and his wife. He rises and, as he leaves, the couple watches him go into a nearby cubicle. Jerry sits, staring at his lap. Carl Showalter and Gaear Grimsrud are in twin beds, having sex with two truck-stop hookers. A woman picks up the phone, holds it away, and calls before someone takes the phone. Jerry wanders through the service area, where cars are being worked on, and stops by an Indian in blue jeans who is looking at the underside of a car on a hydraulic lift with a cage light hanging off it. Carl is driving, while Grimsrud stares out front and smokes, gazing out the window. He is driving and on the phone. A morning-show host in an apron stands behind a counter on a kitchen set. Jean sets down her coffee cup and rises, and as the two men enter, a door at the far side slams shut. Jean, sobbing, frantically pushes at buttons on the princess phone, which pops out of her hands, jangles across the tile floor, smashes against the door, and bounces away, its cord ripped free. Jean crosses to a high window above the toilet and throws it open, glancing back as she steps up from the toilet seat to the tank. The groaning of the door ends as the wood around its knob splinters, and the knob itself falls out onto the floor. The door swings open and creaks, moving as one piece in its frame as Grimsrud and Carl enter. The room is empty, and the window is open. Carl strides to the window and hoists himself out. Grimsrud opens the medicine cabinet and delicately taps aside various bottles and tubes, seeking the proper unguent. He finds a salve but sets it down after noticing something in the mirror; the shower curtain is drawn around the tub. As he reaches for the curtain, it explodes outward, animated by thrashing limbs as Jean screams, tangled in the curtain, ripping it off its rings and stumbling out into the bedroom.",
    "1026": "Pete enters the room and finds Sadie with tears in her eyes and holds up both hands. Meanwhile, Debbie prepares for the party as Barb enters the kitchen. By the pool, Pete and his goateed friend watch Desi in a bikini as she swims with Charlotte, while Barb glances toward the pool and Debbie notices Desi. The guys look toward their wives and wave. Pete greets guests and accepts presents, then stands with Ronnie. Jason turns Debbie around and stares at Pete while Ronnie stares off; they quickly leave, with Jason moving next to Ronnie, exchanging awkward smiles as they notice Desi swimming. Debbie opens the door for her father, who furrows his brows, while Pete looks down at the box and smiles. In the buffet line, Barb's husband turns to Debbie's father, and Larry extends his hand as Desi and the girls approach. Larry hugs Desi, eyes Oliver, and Charlotte takes Oliver's hand, while Debbie gives them a look. Desi swims in slow motion underwater, Jason and Ronnie swim side-by-side, and they meet in the middle as Desi surfaces with the guys following her up, emerging beside each other. Jason gazes into her eyes as Desi smiles, turns, and swims away, and the guys glance at each other and quickly follow. Later, Larry stands with Oliver as he eats; Oliver winks and takes a bite. Jason and Ronnie sit with Desi, who sits back and smiles. At another table, Larry nods and eyes Pete and Debbie, who nod with her, with Desi, Ronnie, and Jason nearby. Ronnie glances between them, Debbie glares to Pete, and he stops and looks at all of them, while she turns to Oliver. Debbie and Pete roll their eyes, Oliver nods at Pete, and Barb looks down. Graham Parker then leads the guests in song, Pete smiles at his wife, and leans toward his electric guitar-shaped cake, as she tilts her head with a slight grin and Oliver catches her gaze. Larry's triplets attack the cake and lick the frosting tuning pegs. Debbie hides behind some bushes with a cigarette in her mouth, desperately flicking and shaking a lighter, when Sadie rounds the corner, catches her mom, and startles her, prompting Debbie to drop her cigarette and head to the house. Debbie faces Pete and raises her arms as Sadie gawks at her mom storming away. Pete hurls his half-eaten cupcake at the kitchen wall, then hurries past his daughters to march to Debbie. Oliver leaves past Debbie, she follows him out, and stares at him slack-jawed. Pete rides his bike across the front lawn, and Sadie watches him go while Debbie turns to see Pete zoom out of the driveway. He races down a suburban street wearing his helmet and yellow-tinted sunglasses.",
    "625": "Ray is still staring ahead, and then he lowers his eyes and frowns as Graham regards him closely. Ray bows his head and reflects, his guilty eyes reluctant to confront Graham's gaze. Slowly, he turns and takes a breath, his doleful eyes lingering on Graham, then starts the engine and sits back in his seat while Graham stares. Ray peers earnestly at Graham, whose eyes moisten a little as he fights with his emotions. With his lips curled and features crumpled, Ray nods sufferingly before dropping his gaze as Graham turns to face Ray's clapboard home. At the farmhouse, in the closet under the stairs, Merrill is still watching TV, his brow creased with worry and lips slightly apart. Merrill moves his chair right up to the television and watches the camcorder footage of his hysterical young children inside the house, who are gathered by French windows pointing to the backyard, where tables laden with party food lie abandoned. The camera focuses on tall bushes at the back of the yard before returning to the interior and following the children as they swarm to another window. Merrill watches in frustration as a boy looks out on a narrow passageway, and the camera focuses on the passage. A lanky, dark figure with a human appearance steps across the passage and out of view, prompting Merrill to recoil, cupping a hand to his face in shock as he backs away from the TV. The film is rewound, and Merrill sits back down in front of the TV, watching with his mouth gaping as the picture freezes on the creature, the image flickering slightly. Graham enters Ray's house, pausing outside the open kitchen door, and steps timidly into the room, where chairs lie turned on the floor and tables wedge against the door leading into the pantry. A shadow passes under the door as Graham treads hesitantly toward it, accompanied by a sound. Graham stares intently at the gap under the door, and the shadow stops moving. He eyes the door anxiously, swallows, nods to himself, closes his eyes, and mouths \"Patty Wagon\" self-charmingly. The shadow under the door remains still as Graham glances briefly away from the door incredulously. Then, with his head turned wearily to one side and tucked defensively back a little, Graham drops delicately to a kneeling position, bends down, and, pressing his face to the tiles, peers under the pantry door, finding nothing but shards of glass. Kneeling up again and sighing with relief, he spots some chopped vegetables sitting on a worktop and a large kitchen knife lying next to them, which he contemplates for a moment before reaching out and grabbing it.",
    "1239": "He smooths his tie and carefully takes two crystal glasses from his case as Peter looks on. Brian sets them down side-by-side, then unwraps a bottle of red wine. Blowing dust off, he reverentially positions the bottle to the right of the glasses, then turns the label to face Peter by the door. Jimmy ducks in. Brian pulls his suit jacket on as he and Peter follow Jimmy out of the wood-paneled office. They hurry out of a side door in the side of the rusty, corrugated iron stand and over to the entrance gate. A coach is stopped down the street of terraced houses. Brian smooths his coiffed, dark hair and straightens his tailored suit jacket as he stands with Peter and Jimmy in the entrance gateway. Down the street, kids flock around Don and his team as they step from the coach and stroll towards the ground in their smart suits, signing autographs. A press photographer snaps photos as the players approach. Brian steps forward to greet them. Don sweeps past to meet his entourage, leaving Brian standing to one side at the entrance. Still seething, Brian watches the teams run out. Brian eyes Don in the visitor's dugout. Peter yells beside a glowering Brian as the Leeds players surround the ref. The physio carries McFarland off, piggyback. Brian grimaces introspectively. Brian sneers at Don. The wine stands untouched. Brian gazes out at Don ushering his players onto their coach, patting their backs for the press. Brian nods ruefully. Brian jabs a finger at Peter. The Clough family sits at a dining table in a semi-detached house in the rolling Derbyshire countryside. Peter glances at his wife. Brian smirks. Barbara Clough gets up from the dining table and wanders into the hall to find it empty. Brian speeds away from Peter's house. Peter feeds Brian crisps as Brian drives. Brian swigs a can of lager. They pull up in a suburban street. Brian and Peter swap grins as thick-set Dave Mackay opens his front door. Dave regards them. Derby players hit a ball, then run up and down the stands. Sam Longson joins Brian on the terraces. Press shots in team kit. Dave on the training field. Grainy black and white match footage. Derby climbing the table. Brian and Jimmy applaud. Top of the table. Champagne in the dressing room. A party in the board room. Having emptied a bottle of champagne into the silver cup, Brian pours it into the players' glasses. Peter smokes a cigarillo as he embraces Brian. They dance together while their wives and the team look on. Dave rushes forward to turn up the sound on Don accepting a trophy on TV. The Leeds players in track suits on the training ground near the stadium.",
    "114": "The front door opens and Phyllis steps out. She closes the door and looks in the direction of the tracks. She opens the back door of the car and leans in. She pulls the rug off the corpse (which is not visible) and stands looking into the car, unable to take her eyes off what she sees, while at the same time her hands mechanically begin to fold the rug. The running steps grow louder and Neff comes into the shot breathing hard. He reaches her. Neff points back towards the tracks. He reaches into the car and begins to drag out the body by the armpits. Phyllis coolly reaches past him and takes the hat off the dead man's head. She turns to go. Phyllis releases the hand brake and puts the car in reverse. Neff is again busy unwrapping the tape from his leg. The car moves. The car, with the headlights out, backs up, swings around and moves off along the dirt road the way it came. They are talking to each other. Their lips are seen moving but what they say is not heard. They stop talking. Phyllis stares straight ahead. The sedan drives into the shot and stops without pulling over to the curb. The car door opens. Neff starts to get out. Neff turns back to her. Phyllis bends towards him and puts her arms around him. Phyllis kisses him. In the kiss he is passive. Neff going up. Telephone bell box and the door bell. The cards are still in position. Neff's hand takes them out. Neff comes from the bedroom, wearing the light grey suit he wore before the murder, only without a tie. He buttons his jacket, looks around the room, and opens the corridor door. Fifteen or twenty cars are parked now. Charlie, the attendant has washed Neff's car and is now polishing the glass and metal work. Charlie sees him. He straightens up. He walks up the ramp towards the garage entrance. Neff comes out at the top of the ramp and starts to walk down the street, not too fast. Camera precedes him. He walks about ten or fifteen yards. At first his steps sound hard and distinct on the sidewalk and echo in the deserted street. But slowly, as he goes on, they fade into utter silence. He walks a few feet without sound, then becomes aware of the silence. He stops rigidly and looks back. Camera stops with him. He stands like that for a moment, then turns toward the camera again. There is a look of horror on his face now. He walks on, camera ahead of him again. Still his steps make no sound.",
    "594": "Harry's hair is disheveled as he splashes water on his ashen face. Harry watches the sobbing Draco from the doorway as Draco draws his wand and casts a spell, to which Harry responds. Draco casts another spell, and they hide at each of the cubicles. Draco appears around the corner and ducks back, while Harry peeks out, his image reflected in a mirror. They crawl on the floor, peering underneath the cubicles, and Draco misses Harry. Harry stands up and aims his wand, causing Draco to stumble back and fall into the water accumulating on the floor from a burst pipe. With a book in one hand and his wand in the other, Harry slowly walks the length of the cubicles, rounds the corner, and sees Draco sprawled on his back. Shocked, Harry stumbles forward and sees blood oozing into the water, with bloodstains spreading over Draco's white shirt. Snape strides in, brushes past Harry, and stands over Draco, glaring at Harry, who avoids his gaze and leaves. Snape kneels, and the blood recedes as the bloodstains disappear. In the Gryffindor common room, the potions book lies on the table in front of Harry, while Ginny, Hermione, and Ron are silhouetted against the light from a lead-paned window. Ginny crosses to Harry and sits beside him, and Harry nods. Standing in front of the unicorn tapestry, Harry takes Ginny's outstretched hand and grips it firmly inside the cluttered room. As Ginny leads him forward, they are reflected in a mirror, and they wander through the Room of Requirement. A sound comes from the triangular gap of a cabinet covered with a heavy cloth, and Harry approaches. The ends of the cloth don't quite meet, and through the gap, Harry sees the door. A bird flies out and settles on a stone shelf while Harry gazes at Ginny. She walks toward him, stands close, and they exchange a long look. She glances at the book, takes it from his hand, and he continues looking at her. She backs away, and Harry closes his eyes, standing rooted to the spot with shallow breathing. He swallows hard but keeps his eyes shut until Ginny returns, steps close, and kisses him gently on the lips. He responds, smiles, then opens his eyes to find Ginny has disappeared. Harry walks slowly along a corridor lost in thought when Ron approaches, and Professor Slughorn stops in front of them before hurrying away. In the common room, Harry uncorks the vial of Liquid Luck, watched by Hermione and Ron, and empties its contents into his mouth. They look at him as he stares into the distance, and they get to their feet while Harry grins and turns to them. As he passes students, Hermione and Ron look confused. A greenhouse window is forced open, and Slughorn's head appears.",
    "316": "The prisoners begin screaming vicious taunts and catcalls at the fresh batch of new inmates as Evan tries to keep composed and walks toward his cell. Evan looks up to see one of the men leaning over the second tier, Karl, a huge muscular con with tattoos of swastikas and other Nazi symbols on his arm, blows a kiss at Evan and winks. Evan enters a dimly lit cell plastered with pictures of Jesus Christ and various Saints. Sitting on the bottom bunk is Carlos, a massive Hispanic convict covered with faded Indian ink jail tats of Christ in agony. Carlos stares at Evan disinterestedly as Evan makes up his bed on the top bunk. Carlos leaves the cell without another word. Evan sets his tray down at a table filled with Carlos and some other inmates. Carlos shrugs at Evan and offers him a roll. Her hair is now bottle-blonde. Four inches of Plexiglas separate the two and they talk on monitored phones. Andrea nods, holding up two comp books. They look at each other and Evan slowly lowers the phone. He hangs up, Andrea still pressing her phone to her ear. Evan walks closely behind Carlos through a corridor, clutching his journals. As he passes Karl, the Neo-Nazi, Karl reaches over and firmly grabs Evan's crotch. Evan stands there, stunned, unable to react when another Neo-Nazi, Rick, swats Evan's journals out of his hands and onto the floor. Life springs back into Evan as he rushes for the journals. He and Rick grab the journals at the same time, initiating a minor tug of war. Rick tears them away, Evan coming up with only a few torn pages. Evan sees the damage and goes mental. Evan holds a tattered journal entry in his hand and finishes up a conversation and then studies the page. We are back in Mrs. Boswell's first grade class where all of the children draw colorful pictures. As he heads over to them, Mrs. Boswell firmly grabs his shoulders and steers him back to his own desk. Evan, defeated, looks over at his blank piece of paper. He smiles mischievously and grabs some colored pencils. Soon enough, an image emerges: Evan holding a knife stands over a heap of several dead inmates, Karl and Rick. When done, he sneaks over to Mrs. Boswell's desk, where the two paper spindles sit. The metal needles reach up and skewer a number of paper notes and messages. She looks over in time to see Evan using all of his seven-year-old strength to whip his hands down toward the spindles. The moment before his palms reach them there's a brief instant where soundscapes collide and the world behind him vibrates.",
    "605": "Fending off Gryffindor players, they pass the Quaffle, until one hurls it towards the goal. Ron swoops to save the shot. His supporters are ecstatic. In the air, Ron repulses wave after wave of Slytherin attacks. Hermione shakes her head but still looks towards. Gryffindor goes on the attack. A Slytherin Beater whacks a Bludger towards an opponent but misses and is himself knocked from his broomstick. A shot on target for Gryffindor brings cheers from their supporters, and a renewed attack by Slytherin in a V formation. The Quaffle zooms towards the goal. Ron saves it. His right fist raised in triumph, Ron looks down at the chanting crowd. Hermione barely smiles. Perfectly balanced on his broomstick, Ron raises both hands in the air. In the Gryffindor common room, he stands on a table showered with red confetti. Harry shows her the unopened vial of Liquid Luck. He shakes his head. Lavender flings her arms around Ron's neck and kisses him passionately. Harry grins. Next to him, Hermione takes a deep breath. As the kiss continues, she turns abruptly and walks out. Harry sees her go and follows. He hears sobbing in a dark corridor. From the top of a spiral staircase, he sees Hermione sitting on the bottom step, weeping. He walks down the steps, his shadow cast against the wall. Charm birds fly all around Hermione. She looks up at Harry. He sits down beside her. Ron and Lavender run into the cloister. She tries to lead Ron away. Hermione stands, her face grim. The birds dive headlong to attack Ron. He runs. They splat against a wooden door in a drift of feathers. Ron looks at Hermione in alarm and walks away. She sinks down onto the step. Hermione leans her head on Harry's shoulder. Awkwardly, he puts his hand on her arm. The celebration continues without Ron and Lavender, who run together up a flight of stairs. Standing beside a tall window, they move closer and kiss again. Draco Malfoy stands alone, high up on the astronomy tower. He leans on the balustrade and looks out over the school. Snow falls gently on the spires and roofs of Hogwarts. The cloisters are decorated with greenery. A raven-haired girl smiles. Luna with a knee-length tiered dress of pale pink silk, with chiffon ruffles round the neckline, skirt, and sleeves. Harry escorts her. They walk past a window bay, where Draco sits alone, deep in thought. His face grim, Draco walks along the upstairs corridor and stops. He closes his eyes. In the cluttered room, he pulls the heavy cloth from the cabinet. He opens the cabinet and places an apple inside. He opens the cabinet. The apple has gone.",
    "171": "As Karen finds herself listening, despite herself, meanwhile, the guy's hot, runs the three hundred up to half a million. Chili starts to speak, but Harry cuts him off, then turns back to Chili. Chili looks at Karen, and she's staring at Chili again, patient. Karen looks at the two of them sitting there; Harry turns to him, and they both look at her. She just looks at him, turns, and walks out, as Chili watches her go. Harry nods, thinks a moment, then Chili looks at him. We tilt up this time to reveal a little kid, listening to a Walkman, as Harry looks at him. Harry points across the street to the Cafe Med where we see a red Ferrari convertible parked out the front, and we see Martin Weir and a woman with jet-black hair sitting at a table. They watch Martin and the girl a moment, and Harry pulls out, starts driving again. There are some of Karen, Harry with a much younger, blonde Karen. Chili stands looking over some of the old photographs as Harry goes through the mess on the desk. Harry hands a script to Chili, who examines the cover, the first time he's ever held a movie script and opens it to the middle. Chili looks out the window as we see a long black stretch limo pull up to the curb down on the street. Chili tosses the script on the desk, moves between a pair of fat red leather chairs, as Harry moves away from the window and is tugging the string to lower the blinds behind the desk. Ronnie singing, and the door opens as the Bear opens the door for Bo Catlett and Ronnie. Chili sits behind the desk, watching the two of them come into the office, as Catlett comes first. Ronnie sits down in the chair and hooks one leg over the arm, swings it up and down, his motor running on some chemical, while Harry waves them right into the two cracked red leather chairs facing the desk. Sitting down, he nods to Chili, who ignores him, Harry already forgetting his instructions. Chili can't believe it, he too stares at Chili, and Chili shakes his head, he can't believe he's hearing this. The limo guys nod to Chili and Chili nods back, trying to catch Harry's eye. Ronnie looks over, so does Bo Catlett for that matter. Catlett looks at Chili again, now it's between them. The guy studies Chili, thinks about whether or not to make a move, when Harry steps in, reaches over the desk, and picks up a script. Chili looks at Harry, wonders if there's a way to shut him up without punching him in the mouth.",
    "597": "Water appears in the basin, and Harry scoops desperately but the shell wouldn't fill. Harry turns and looks at the lake, then crumbles down over the rocks towards the water. Holding onto a rock for support, he reaches down with the shell, and Dumbledore's ball of light sinks under the surface, darkness. Harry wields his wand, and the tip of his wand glows. He clenches his teeth, grips the wand with the hand he's using as support, and leans forward to dip the shell into the lake, filling it to the brim. A bony hand shoots from the water and grabs his arm, and he wrestles free. The water seethes all around the island, and the light brightens, revealing naked emaciated corpses clambering out of the water towards him. He lashes out at them as Dumbledore feebly tries to reach his own wand. Scores of corpses swarm onto the tiny island and attack Harry, and he's dragged underwater. A corpse wraps its arms around Harry from behind, and he grapples with it as they sink deeper and deeper. Above the surface, Harry sees flames, balls of fire streak through the water, and the creature releases Harry, allowing him to surface inside a circle of fire. Dumbledore is on his feet, flourishing his wand around his head, whipping up the fire, and the corpse retreats from the flames. Harry comes back onto the island and helps Dumbledore back to the boat. The flames part, revealing a clear channel of water ahead. Meanwhile, Draco Malfoy lies in bed wide awake, then gets up. The lights in Borgin and Burke's shop go out as Bellatrix leads a group through the courtyard to the room at the rear. She opens the door of the embossed cabinet, while Filch stands guard on the school battlements. Draco marches unnoticed along a corridor as Professor McGonagall leans out of a stone archway, looking out anxiously at the menacing clouds, and Snape looks out into the storm. In the Room of Requirement, Draco pulls the heavy cloth from the cabinet, steps back, and watches as the door handle turns. The cabinet opens, black smoke filters out, and Draco walks quickly away. Bellatrix, Greyback, and two Death Eaters with metal masks emerge from the smoke, and Bellatrix smirks. At the astronomy tower, Harry walks away then stops, looking back at Dumbledore. Harry hides as someone passes on the stairs, and the figure climbs to the upper platform, pointing his wand at Dumbledore. Harry watches from below as Draco pulls back his sleeve to show the Death Eater mark on his arm, and Dumbledore's wand falls. Still hidden, Harry sees Bellatrix, Greyback, and the two Death Eaters race to the upper platform, where Bellatrix faces Dumbledore and Draco still has his wand raised. Snape is behind Harry and enters the upper platform.",
    "1314": "Santa pushes him off his lap and shoves him on his way. The Elf nods as he peels off a pointed prosthetic ear. Santa pulls a fifth of Old Grandad from the cushions of his throne and takes a swig. With the sound of closing circuits, banks of lights systematically shut down in the various departments of the now empty store. Downstairs, the last of the store employees file out the door past an old Security Guard. Eventually, Santa emerges, and the Security Guard heads for a panel near the doorway and punches a key labeled ARM. The guard exits the store, locks the door, and heads home. Suddenly, a teddy bear moves, bolting upright and sprinting from the room. The alarm continues to count down -- 15. The teddy bear slides down the space between the railing of the escalators and scrambles for the door, crashing into everything in its path. Running past a clothing display, it rips the arm off a mannequin without breaking stride. It skids to a stop at the base of the alarm box, too short to reach the controls. Mission accomplished, the teddy bear rips off its head to reveal its true identity: Santa's Elf -- in civilian life known as Marcus Skidmore. He is covered in sweat and panting like an asthmatic. A hasp flips open, and Marcus swings the door wide to reveal a beer-guzzling Santa-in-the-off-season known as Willie T. Soke. Willie finishes the beer, crushes the can, and drops it to his feet next to eight more empties. Marcus sneers at him as he lumbers past. Marcus reaches into jewelry cases and removes a few particular items, drops them into a stock cart, then checks a typed list before moving on. Marcus pushes the cart through the store, gathering an odd array of items that range from furs to gowns to shoes to makeup. Marcus arrives outside a doorway and looks in to see Willie manning a large water drill and putting it to work on the store's vault. Marcus moves closer as Willie pulls back the drill on the track, places a screwdriver into the exposed lock assembly, and hits it with a sledgehammer. Suddenly, the door swings open, and bundled cash spills to the floor. Both men are impressed. Willie settles on the rear bench as Marcus gets into the passenger seat next to his Pilipino mail-order wife of several years, Lois, who is dressed in expensively ugly clothes and whose mouth is ever down-turned in pruney distaste. The van speeds away through the Christmas Eve night and disappears into the distance, like the down of a thistle. Finally, an alarm clock rings with a jolt, and Willie, in bed, blearily wakes to the insistent alarm.",
    "602": "Professor McGonagall is in the corridor, and Harry and Ron stand by the wall, laughing. Harry leaves Ron and goes to McGonagall, who shakes her head. In the potions class, a hand shoots up as McGonagall steps towards the potions. Harry opens a cupboard door and puts the lid on as the girls near it step back. Draco shows interest while there are hand-written notes in the margins. Ron tries to cut a Sopophorous bean, but it rolls away. He tries again, and it shoots into the air as Seamus stabs at his. Slughorn catches one in midair, and even Hermione's having problems. Harry reads a note in his book, and it works as he drips juice into his cauldron. Frowning, Hermione refers to her book again, while Crabbe and Goyle have no success. Seamus's cauldron flares up, blackening his face, as Harry follows the hand-written notes. Green slime slithers from one girl's cauldron and plops onto the table, while Hermione looks more and more frustrated. Harry pours in a clear liquid, and Professor Slughorn drops a leaf into Harry's brewing pot, leading the applause for Harry. Draco and his Slytherin friends don't join in. In his study, Professor Dumbledore examines a book with a hole burnt in it, places a ring in the hole, and closes the book in a drawer. A cabinet of vials sits nearby, and he selects one. Harry gingerly takes the vial and goes to a pensive, a hovering shallow metal basin. He glances at the elderly professor, who nods, and Harry pours the contents of the vial into the basin. Dumbledore flicks his hand in the air, and the lights dim as Harry plunges his face into the basin. Wispy trails of black smoke flow towards its base, and Harry sees a street with a large building straight ahead. A figure carrying an umbrella marches towards the building, and a younger Dumbledore steps into the room where an 11-year-old boy stares at him. Dumbledore touches a wardrobe as shells and pebbles line the window edge at the postcard of a craggy coastline. Tom sits at a table, frowning and staring at Dumbledore. The wardrobe by the door bursts into flames, and Tom removes a metal box from the burning wardrobe, opening the box and taking out small toys. Dumbledore walks away from the sullen Tom, then stops. Swirling black smoke consumes the image of the boy, and Harry takes his face out of the pensive. He keeps staring into the basin, takes a few deep breaths, nods, and stares resolutely ahead. Death Eaters hurtle through the clouds towards Hogwarts and hit the invisible shield, retreating. Two birds in a cage hang in a shadowy corridor as Draco Malfoy walks past them towards a wall covered with a tapestry of a unicorn.",
    "1303": "Morgan's throat is closing, his face is filled with strain and panic, while Merrill stares at his brother's desperate face. Graham closes his eyes, talks to the darkness, and Merrill's eyes fill up with water as Graham's eyes close, then open as he leans in close to Morgan's ear, after which Graham's eyes close again. He starts crying and speaks to no one, nods without looking over as the beam points up at the basement ceiling above, and Graham stares at the conviction in his younger brother's expression. Graham looks at Morgan lying limp on the ground, turns to Merrill, and the two men stand under the single dangling light bulb. Graham quietly turns and looks at Morgan, moves across the room towards him, and Merrill watches as Graham kneels down and reaches to Morgan's side. Graham unclips the baby monitor from his son's belt, walks back to Merrill, makes eye contact with Merrill, and holds it out between them, then turns it on, resulting in electrical static. The basement door cracks open a few inches, Merrill opens it all the way, moves up the stairs by himself, reaches the top and looks around, turns back down to the faces at the bottom, and gives them the thumbs up. He carries a limp Morgan in his arms, and Merrill nods as he begins to search the piles of things that have fallen from the cabinets, while Graham gently lays Morgan on the sofa. Bo steps out of the closet and looks into the family room, and Graham glances down, then looks up quickly, touches her cheek, and she starts crying. Colleen presses her cheek on top of Graham's hand, rests on it, with her eyes distant while Graham's eyes are not on Merrill. Merrill turns and looks to Graham, follows his eye line to the baseball bat mounted above him, and reaches up to take the bat off its resting place as the creature starts to move. Merrill's hands tighten around the handle as he walks forward, stops, shifts his weight to his right leg while Morgan's face is obscured by gas, and the creature begins to turn and becomes more visible as its lines and colors don't match in position in the room. Merrill's left leg goes out, the creature gets hammered across the back with the baseball bat, Morgan is dropped, falling to the carpet of the family room in an unnatural crumpled pile, with his arms and legs flopping lifelessly to the carpet. The creature turns to face Merrill and all the creature sees is the blur of wood as Merrill swings like a lumberjack, resulting in a slam and the creature falling to the ground. Graham picks up his son's limp body in his arms as the creature moves to its feet.",
    "1341": "Eponine is revealed staring at Marius through the door. Eponine comes to a stop, looking wistfully after Marius, who is stopped as he exits the front door of the Gorbeau Tenement by a passing carriage. Once it passes, Marius sees two people in the street outside: one is an old gentleman, Valjean, and the other is a beautiful young girl, Cosette. The two are giving alms to beggars as they walk back from evening church service. Marius can't take his eyes off Cosette. As if drawn by Marius's gaze, Cosette looks up and meets his eyes. She too is amazed; he's looking at her as if he already knows her. A second carriage breaks their held gaze. Marius continues on down the street, and when he looks back, at that precise moment, Cosette looks at him again. Valjean instinctively puts his arm around her, guarding her jealously from this distant boy's gaze. Further down the street, in an alleyway, the Thenardiers, heavily disguised, are waiting for Valjean's approach with their gang of crooks—Babet, Brujon, Clacquesous, and Montparnasse. Thenardier approaches Valjean and lures him into the mouth of the alleyway where Madame Thenardier is sitting on the ground holding the crying infant. Cosette is a few steps behind, still entranced by the sight of Marius. As Valjean bends down to look at Madame Thenardier, she recognizes him. Thenardier pulls off his disguise, and Valjean recognizes him. Thenardier signals to his gang. The gang moves in on Valjean menacingly, and a door opens in the alleyway revealing the huge Brujon. Marius and Gavroche, drawn by the rumpus, watch as the gang spills out into the street, confronting Javert and his men. Javert sees a man with his arm protectively around a girl but does not recognize Valjean as Valjean has averted his face. Javert turns back on the Thenardier gang in the passage but finds Valjean and Cosette gone, which makes him furious. Thenardier listens and hears this with great interest. She turns back to find Marius gazing down the street. Joly goes over to Marius at the back, a faraway look on his face. They sit and burst into laughter, but Enjolras isn't smiling. Enjolras turns to his companions, and as the students sing, Eponine enters wanting to talk to Marius, who sees her. In a pretty room, the best room in this small summer house, Cosette paces in her bedroom. Her shutters are open, giving a view of a wild unkempt garden. Valjean knocks and opens her door, then closes her shutters. Valjean leaves and goes into his own bedroom, and Cosette follows. Valjean sits on his bed, his back to Cosette. A simple wooden shack at the back of the summer house, Valjean himself lives with spartan simplicity, having given the best room to Cosette.",
    "586": "He opens a freezer and finds a bottle of vodka, pours it down the sink, and lifts the bulging plastic trash bag out of the trash can, carrying it outside. He slides the doors of the shed open, revealing a two-seat Cessna plane in the small hangar, removes the blanket covering the windshield, and switches on the lights. He looks at a group of photos hanging above a workstation off to one side of the hangar, takes a picture of a young African American boy wedged in a frame, and kisses the photograph. He pulls out a bottle of liquor from a bowling bag and tosses it aside, holds a framed wedding photo of himself and his wife, and later that evening sits watching the news. Charlie stands at a table strewn with pictures of the crash as men in suits look on. The next morning, Whip walks through the lobby of a hotel, cane in hand, with the large eye patch gone and now stitches remain about his eye. He enters a dining area with a buffet to one side and approaches Charlie seated with a man wearing glasses. Hugh looks through a file, Whip looks at the piece of paper before him, narrows his eyes, rises to leave, and stops in the bar area. A photo of Whip appears on the TV behind the bar, he sits at the bar and moves a cocktail napkin back and forth, as he studies the glass of vodka. He picks it up and takes a drink, smacks his lips, picks up the glass again, and drains the contents. Later, he sets a case of Budweiser in the passenger seat, gets in the car, unscrews a gallon bottle of vodka, looks around, and chugs it. Groggy-eyed, Whip drives down a street, beer can in hand, passes a dead-end street, and stops. He watches as Nicole loads items in the back of a car, looks away, then back at Nicole as she runs back through a worn fence, and pulls up to the apartment entrance behind Nicole's car. He passes the car with Nicole's things, glances through a few enlarged photographs in a basket, takes a sip from his beer, and looks up, alert. Whip walks toward the apartment, pushes Fran to the floor, Nicole nods, Whip takes out some money, looks at her for a moment, then nods. Nicole sits in the passenger seat of Whip's car as he drives and drinks his beer, she bites her thumb, he offers Nicole a beer and she refuses, he lights a cigarette, and she fidgets as she smiles to herself and observes Whip as he drives.",
    "1334": "He kneels by her side as Eponine is dying and then dies in Marius's arms. Marius looks up at the others, his eyes full of tears, and holds out his note. The landlady climbs the stairs, followed by Gavroche. The door opens a crack to reveal a cautious Valjean, who looks up, deeply distressed, and points to Javert in a dark corner, his hands tied. Javert looks up and meets Valjean's eyes in a steady shared look. Suddenly Valjean spots a couple of snipers creeping over the roofs to gain an angle of attack on them; they are aiming at Enjolras. Swiftly, Valjean grabs a gun and shoots up at them, sending them scattering. Quickly, other students join in, and the snipers are driven back. There is a burst of gunfire from both ends of the street as a brief firefight ensues, but the snipers have disappeared. Enjolras turns to Valjean, while Javert hears this with grim satisfaction. Valjean uses the knife to cut Javert free and raises his gun, pointing it at Javert. Marius is manically working to raise the height of one of the smaller barricades. Grantaire drunkenly starts singing a drinking song, and it is taken up more seriously by Feuilly as bottles are passed around. Valjean is moving through the cafe when he hears Marius through a window and moves to the window. Marius sits beneath it, and Valjean listens to Marius's song, moved by it. Valjean paces, unable to sleep, inside the cafe, comes to a stop, and gazes on Marius as he sleeps through the window. Valjean is now kneeling next to the sleeping Marius. Crane up and up to see the little world of the barricaded street now surrounded by waiting soldiers and the streets around them packed with soldiers in their thousands, so many that we know the little band can never win. Many of the rest of the rebels are sleeping. Crane up and up until the barricade and the army that entraps it become a small pool of darkness in the center of the bright lights of Paris. The sun is still below the rooftops as Enjolras re-enters the barricade through the secret gate. Below him, the students are up and getting ready. There is silence and uncertainty, yet no one moves to go. The rays of the rising sun break through, lighting up Gavroche. Crack! A musket shot, and Gavroche falls face down onto the barricade. Enjolras gazes on his pitifully small group as the sun now appears above the rooftops of the city. In its wake comes a massive barrage of musket fire. Valjean moves among them, tending to the wounded, lifting down the dead, regardless of his own safety. And the big guns fire—BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! The bombardment hits the barricade, rocking it.",
    "1307": "The other is half human, half animal. Elijah glances at the business man standing next to him and then back to the sketch. The business man rubs his face and gazes at the sketch. Elijah starts to the back of the store, which is some type of art gallery where all the framed pictures are images and sketches from comic books. Elijah jams his walking stick into the extra thick carpet and stops. He turns and starts back to the businessman, shaking his head strongly. Elijah's eyes pierce through the shaken man as he points at the sketch. Elijah turns and faces the customers for the first time; David Dunne stands with Joseph. Elijah just stands staring for the longest time and then walks closer to them. When Elijah speaks, his voice has a whispery quality to it. David nods while Elijah looks shaken, and Elijah gazes at David, then points at the framed comic sketches. David shakes his head and smiles out of frustration. Elijah watches David walk towards the front door, and through the window, he sees Joseph take David's hand as they cross the street. Elijah gazes out the window in a bit of a daze. David sits up in bed staring at a torn section of newspaper in his hands, while Joseph is asleep horizontally with his legs over David's legs. David slides out from under his son's legs; Joseph stirs but doesn't wake up. David moves to the darkness of the corner of the room, opens a closet door, and a naked hanging bulb goes on as David yanks a chain. David steps inside the narrow closet and closes the door slightly so the light from the bulb doesn't fall on Joseph. There's just enough room to stand and look around as David stretches and feels on the top shelf. His hand comes down with something wrapped in a t-shirt, which he unwraps to reveal a handgun. He stares at it for a beat before wrapping it back up and replacing it to the highest shelf. He stretches even more, reaches farther back, and pulls down a folder jammed with clippings. He opens the folder to reveal a young David in football uniform holding his helmet in the air victoriously. David flips through the top clippings, which are all images and stories of David and football, then turns the pile over to the last clipping. This piece of paper is folded over three times, unlike the others; it's a newspaper headline. David puts the new headline next to the old one, and they look like a set, even the font is similar. David stares at the old headline and stares hard at the photo of the bent and heavily damaged car laying upside down in the middle of the highway.",
    "1261": "A car plows into the side of them. Carl lies unconscious in a hospital bed with grazes on his face. A pretty nurse dressed in blue takes his pulse while Peter and Rooney sit beside the bed, with Rooney having a snack and Peter holding a drink. The nurse walks off, and Rooney watches her go as Carl stirs and looks fearful. Terrence pulls back a curtain, and Carl goes while Peter looks at Terrence. Wearing a hospital gown, Terrence goes, and Rooney gets into the bed and shushes Peter. Carl heads out, runs to an elevator as Lee steps out, and still in his hospital gown, revs Lee's Ducati bike, puts a helmet on, pulls a wheelie, and whizzes off. Up on the back wheel, Carl crashes through a barrier and heads out of the hospital car park. He rides up next to a UPS van, and the driver looks out and sees the Ducati's front wheel waggling about in midair. The bike's front wheel drops down, and Carl speeds through town, weaving precariously through traffic and hopping onto a pavement as pedestrians run for cover. A car pulls out ahead, and Carl pulls on the brakes so hard the back wheel flips up as he slows down. The car passes, and Carl wheelies off and, back on two wheels, weaves through the traffic. He speeds along a dual carriageway, his spotted hospital gown flapping in the breeze, keeping his head low and his arms bent as he rides the Ducati, which is a cross between a trail bike and a road bike. His gown has two ties at the back above the waist, and the gown billows, revealing his bare backside. He rides up to the domed observatory, where Allison is doing a warm-up with her jogging photographers. Carl rides up and does a few donuts, spinning the bike's back wheel on the tarmac and turning circles as Allison and her group stare incredulously, with Carl enveloped in a cloud of burnt-rubber smoke. Allison is transfixed as Carl does another donut. Taking off his helmet, he strides out of the cloud of smoke, heavy-browed, and walks up to Allison, as the group jog off. Grinning, Carl runs up next to Allison, who frowns. They're at a viewpoint overlooking the city; she smiles and looks at him. They share a lingering kiss and wrap their arms around each other. Reggie holds up his hand to apologize, and Carl and Allison kiss passionately as Reggie glances at his fellow photographers. They all aim their cameras and snap away at the couple, with the vast city spreading out beyond. Carl reaches round and grabs his gown to make sure he's not exposing himself. Outside the homeless shelter, Norm's with Soo-Mi, who sorts through clothes.",
    "865": "A number of urchins climb out of the elephant and slide down ropes, then run across the wasteland and through a restaurant, stealing food. Beggars hold out their hands to rich Parisians as the first urchin leans into a finely dressed couple in a carriage. Gavroche runs across the tops of several carriages and sits on the back of one as it drives through town. Young students join the beggars and urchins, with two standing on a platform. As police arrive on horseback, the students hand out leaflets. The white-haired man goes to his carriage, and his grandson Marius, with the others, punches the air. In his attic room, Marius removes a gold ring from his finger and takes a pistol from a case. A pretty young woman, Eponine, the daughter of the Thenardiers, stands at the door and watches him go thoughtfully. Marius walks out onto the street, stops to let a carriage cross, and is about to walk on when something catches his eye. Across the street, Valjean gives money to a beggar, with Cosette, now a beautiful young woman, beside him. Cosette, seeing Marius watching her, captivates him, gives the beggar a coin, and smiles at Marius as she goes with Valjean. Eponine watches sadly. Thenardier is by a hovel where he approaches Valjean, but Valjean and Cosette have run off. Thenardier grovels and dusts Javert's jacket as Javert looks him up and down. Marius comes over, and as Eponine walks off, he grabs her arm and smiles. The students meet in a tavern, where Marius sits lost in thought, and Enjolras frowns at him. Marius sees Eponine and rushes over to her as she walks out. Marius exchanges a glance with Enjolras and follows her. Cosette is in her bedroom when Valjean enters the candlelit room, showing a scar on his wrist. Valjean sits, and Cosette looks chastened and walks out of the front door. Valjean knits his fingers together. Marius walks down a dark street pursued by Eponine. In the darkness, Marius stands looking through the railings of Valjean's garden as Cosette walks towards him past branches laden with blossom. Cosette gazes at Marius, then returns to the house, and Marius goes, followed by Cosette with Valjean inside. Marius looks down, sees Cosette's handkerchief, picks it up, and walks off. Eponine looks down sadly and disappears into the shadows. Thenardier walks down the street with one of his cohorts, Babet, and slaps Eponine. Cosette looks desperate as Valjean puts a candlestick in her bag, and Cosette seals a folded letter with wax. She runs out to the garden, slots the letter in the railings, and Eponine emerges from the shadows to take the letter.",
    "1213": "En-Joo runs out of ammo and takes a grenade from a fallen soldier, pulls the pin, and throws it. Reese rifle-butts a soldier in the face, then shoots another, while Lewis shoots from behind a tree trunk. Diaz twists the neck of a soldier and stabs him. En-Joo climbs up a flight of wooden stairs and finds another rifle, then begins popping away. Rambo runs out of ammo and takes cover behind a gun as Sarah looks over with concern. A soldier hurls a primed grenade at En-Joo; Lewis shoots the soldier, but the grenade has found its target, and En-Joo's bloody carcass is hurled to the ground. Rambo ducks down, finds a box of ammo, tears it open, and starts reloading the gun. One of the volunteers gets away, followed by the commander armed with an automatic pistol, and Michael sees him. The commander aims at the volunteer's back, and the volunteer pitches forward in the dirt as the commander runs away. Rambo continues his reloading as soldiers surround his position. He ducks as hot metal whizzes by, and Michael watches as a soldier crawls toward Lewis' position. The soldier shoots Lewis in the shoulder; Michael leaps on the soldier, and they tumble together down a short incline. Michael finds a rock in the sand and pounds the soldier in the head into bloody unconsciousness, his face a mask of indignant fury, then horrified, he slumps onto the sand. Fire rips through the battleground, and a soldier flies through the air, his uniform on fire. A man in an orange top loads a mortar rocket into a launcher on the hill as a collection of people in khaki and civilian colors pour down the hill. Rambo completes his reload and fires into the remaining troops. On the hill, a rebel loads another mortar into the launcher and covers his ears. BN jumps over a tree trunk, rolls, and fires on troops. The commander runs towards a group of his soldiers, gesturing behind him, and they begin a retreat but are picked off one by one. The commander has to make his strategic withdrawal by himself. BN notices the patrol boat as it rounds a headland in the river and scrambles down an incline towards the waterside. The gunner on the boat starts firing on the shore, and the shells obliterate the canopy on Rambo's boat. The patrol boat is armed with a flamethrower and a machine-gun; a jet of flame belches towards the shore, engulfing rebels. Rambo fires on the boat, tearing through the metal wall of its cabin, then takes a hit and falls from the machine-gun platform as Sarah covers her ears. A sheet of flame catches a volunteer in a brown shirt, who rolls in the sand.",
    "791": "The elf shakes his head sadly as Santa mooches inside past his less than impressed elf. In the store's vault, Santa uses a heavy drill to bore through the door of a locked safe. Out on the shop floor of the store, the elf walks along towing a small hand cart, while Santa pulls out the drill from the safe door. On the shop floor, his little helper helps himself to an expensive handbag from a display cabinet, then some women's designer shoes, all of which are detailed on a list. He checks his list while eyeing a string of pearls in a cabinet, and uses a bead rack to smash it open. Later, he joins Santa in the vault and finds Santa peering through the hole he drilled. Santa uses a chisel, opens the safe, and wards of notes spill out onto the floor. An oriental woman sits at the wheel of a van as Santa and his little helper climb in the back with their booty. She turns to the elf, puts her foot on the accelerator, and the van speeds off, throwing Santa and the elf backwards. Later, Santa, who in less seasonal times goes by the name of Willie, dances with Marcus, the elf, in a bar. Willie puts down Marcus on a bar stool by the counter and sits down beside him. He calls over to the barmaid, who serves them. Willie and Marcus raise their glasses, down their drinks, and set the glasses back down on the counter. Marcus gives Willie a dubious look and looks expectantly at him, who considers and then turns to the barmaid. He turns back to Marcus with a half smile and looks down doubtfully at his empty glass. A plethora of beautiful bikini-clad women adorn the sand as Willie, now in a Hawaiian shirt, stands behind the counter of a beachfront bar, chopping up some lemons and limes. He puts them under the counter and pours a generous measure of vodka into a tumbler. As he does so, an irate man clutching a tray of glasses joins him behind the counter. Willie slurps at the drink, and the barman punches him in the guts and tosses him over the counter. Willie throws a vodka bottle at the barman and misses it. The barman leaps over the counter, and Willie runs for it. Willie does as suggested. Sometime later, he's sitting alone having a good leech at some more bikini-clad lovelies playing volleyball. He licks his lips as he admires their well-toned backsides and sips from a bottle of beer. The next morning, Willie is asleep on his bed in a not-so-awful, not-so-great apartment. He reaches over to the clock radio, which is surrounded by last night's empties, and fumbles for the off button; unable to find it, he rips it out of its socket.",
    "1180": "They count piles of money with nobly skinny fingers at the counter as the clerk puts down his quill. Hagrid digs into his pocket and hands over an envelope marked \"top secret.\" They travel on an underground railway and the goblin guide gets off the train. Hagrid hands over a key, and he and Harry follow the goblin along the dank, gloomy passage until a goblin stops beside a door. Hagrid takes the lamp, gives him the key, and turns it in the lock. The heavy steel door opens, and Hagrid shines the lamp inside the vault, causing Harry to blink in amazement, gazed by the sight of vast piles of gleaming golden coins. The goblin guide runs a long, sharp fingernail down the center of the locking mechanism on the door of vault 713. As the door swings slowly open, Harry stares in surprise as the lamplight illuminates a very small, badly wrapped package tied with string. Hagrid steps inside the vault, snatches up the package, and puts it in his pocket, to which Harry nods in agreement. Back in Diagon Alley, Harry consults his list and opens the door of Ollivanders, going inside and gazing around the deserted shop at the shelves full of dusty boxes. An old man slides into view on a ladder, climbs down, and looks along a shelf, taking a long, narrow box from it and carrying it to the counter. He opens the box and holds out a wand, which Harry takes gently and looks at him before waving it, causing drawers to fly open and wand boxes to catapult onto the floor. Mr. Ollivander chooses another box, opens it, and Harry waves the second wand, shattering a china vase. Mr. Ollivander picks out a third box, ponders for a moment, looks at Harry thoughtfully, then carries the slim box to the counter and carefully opens it, taking out a slender wand of polished wood and holding it out. Harry grips the wand, and a bright light shines as a breeze blows through his hair. Mr. Ollivander points at Harry's forehead just as Hagrid knocks on the window and holds up a beautiful snowy owl in a cage. At the Leaky Cauldron Pub, touching his scar, Harry is at King's Cross Station, where passersby stare up at the huge Hagrid, who takes out his watch as Harry reads the ticket, but Hagrid has disappeared, leaving behind his pet snowy owl perched in its cage on top of Harry's luggage. Harry pushes his trolley across the station, finds Platform 9, but the next platform is Platform 10. He spots a porter, follows a woman and her family as she holds a little girl by the hand, and four red-haired boys hurry behind. The tallest boy pushes his trolley towards a solid brick wall and disappears.",
    "1018": "Mike and Abby clasp hands and hold each other around the waist as they sink down, moving their shoulders seductively from side to side. They turn, round and round, moving smoothly to the music, and Abby leans back on Mike's arm as they dance with their hands held palm to palm. They hold hands above their heads as Mike sinks down, and Abby sways rhythmically to the music while Mike caresses her hair and runs his hands down her sides. Abby spins out, swishing her hair around, and Mike pulls her close as they continue to dance, smiling happily. Abby wraps her arms around Mike's neck and they dance close, as he spins her back and forth, then pulls her closer. Abby and Mike's noses almost touch, and they gaze at each other with their mouths slightly open, as if they're about to kiss. Abby blinks, surprised, and Mike forces himself to nod. Abby smiles nervously and heads off, with Mike following, looking dazed. Abby carries her shoes as she walks with Mike to an elevator, and he presses the call button. Mike turns and faces Abby, and they both fidget awkwardly before stepping into the elevator and standing side by side. Mike presses buttons and loosens his jacket as she flashes a smile at him. They hug, and he stops the doors from closing so they can hug again. Mike and Abby suddenly wrap their arms around each other and kiss hungrily, with Mike pressing Abby against the edge of the open door. The doors close, and Mike's mouth hangs open as he walks off, looking shocked. Abby lets herself into her room, looking equally surprised, and lets her jacket and bag fall to the floor, dropping her key on a table and flopping onto a couch, frowning. She takes off her shoes and flings them aside, then leaps to her feet, smooths out her tight-fitting beige dress, and goes to the door. She opens the door and looks horrified as they kiss, with Colin's shirt covered in champagne, which he takes off to reveal his toned chest. Meanwhile, Mike marches along a corridor, stops and turns around, then turns back and keeps walking before turning again and gesturing emphatically. Mike walks up to Abby's door and knocks, and Abby stares at him. Abby goes into the room, then quickly reemerges and runs down the corridor after Mike, who stops and turns to face her. Abby frowns and steps closer to Mike, staring at him intensely. Mike shakes his head, and Abby's smile gives way to a hardened expression as she watches him go with an anxious, thoughtful expression. Mike wanders off with his hands in his pockets as Abby returns to her room. Abby walks into the room where Colin is sitting on the edge of the bed, wearing a fresh, unbuttoned shirt.",
    "504": "Louise glides right back onto the road as if nothing unusual has happened at all, and they realize they have not been spotted. J.D. and Louise look at each other. Hal is on the phone to the FBI man, and Darryl is sitting on a chair looking dazed while other law enforcement types roam around the house. Max Stratton, an FBI man in his early forties, is looking at the ident-a-kit drawings of Louise and Thelma. The T-Bird barrels down the road at high speed as Louise, Thelma, and J.D. pull into the motel parking lot. Louise looks at J.D. in the back seat and takes the keys out of the ignition, gets out of the car, and goes inside, where an older woman behind the counter is looking at a computer screen. Louise is startled and turns around quickly as J.D. climbs out of the car, looking very uncomfortable. Jimmy is smiling, and Thelma is watching as Louise turns to face Thelma. J.D. attacks her again, causing Thelma to gasp, and Louise studies Thelma closely as she squirms in her seat, barely able to contain herself. Thelma is just laughing hysterically, and Louise suddenly understands, getting a bad feeling. She is already standing up, putting money on the table, while Thelma has forgotten all about the money, and they are both leaving the restaurant now. As they hit the door, they both break into a full run. Louise is stoic, fighting tears, and she sits down on the sidewalk in front of the room. Thelma comes and sits beside her, and neither one says anything for a moment until Louise quietly starts to fall apart, causing Thelma to leap into action. Louise is still sitting on the sidewalk but slowly gets to her feet. The rear wheel of the green T-Bird lays rubber out of the motel parking lot as Thelma and Louise, both looking a little rougher than we've seen so far, drive away. Hal, the FBI man, various other police and detective types pull up in front of the house, and the front door swings open to reveal Darryl looking like he's been shot out of a cannon. As Louise and Thelma pull into a convenience store, police are tapping the phones, dusting for prints, etc., while Darryl sits motionless in his recliner with a dull expression on his face. Max joins them as they walk down the hallway. Thelma and Louise sit in the car, and Louise looks at her as Thelma shrieks with excitement, leaving Louise completely stunned and shooting her a look. Thelma puts the car in gear and floors it out of the parking lot, still looking at Louise as if she has completely lost her mind. Hal, Max, various other cops, and Darryl all watch as TV plays back VCR tape of Thelma in the convenience store pulling a gun.",
    "870": "A beam of light shines out from a lighthouse and sweeps across a shimmering blue ocean. The woman, Kate Armstrong, raises her eyebrows. In a tidy restaurant kitchen, Kate, a pretty brunette in her late 30s, ties a dazzling white chef's apron around her waist. She checks some orders attached to a shelf. Kate steps into a walk-in fridge and leans wearily against a rack. In the restaurant, she chats to a middle-aged couple. Mr. and Mrs. Peterson leave. Kate shakes hands with another couple and makes her way back through the restaurant. Ken and his wife walk off. In the kitchen, to her chefs, the busy chefs carry on with what they're doing. Holding two plates of food, Kate turns around, her lips pursed as she contemplates their response. Snow falls as Kate walks along a New York street. Her long hair, previously tied up in a bun, now hangs loose under a black beret. She steps through her front door into a modest apartment. She drops her keys into a bowl on top of a cabinet and places some mail down beside it. She checks her phone messages. Kate's fast asleep in bed. Kate blearily raises her head and reaches out and turns off her alarm clock. It's half past four. At a fish market, Kate's cooking at home. Kate wears a blue apron over her black top and jeans. She hurries to answer the phone. Kate walks down a flight of stairs in her apartment building. Seeing a neighbor, she turns back. Kate carries on down the stairs, as Sean goes into his apartment. She walks back up the curving staircase to her apartment. She unlocks the door and opens it, stands beside it for a few seconds then closes it again. At her therapist's, Kate garnishes a plate of food. She sits down as he tucks in. Kate turns away. At the restaurant, the waitress collides with a colleague. Pregnant Leah takes the bottle. The waitress, Bernadette, gets it. Kate reluctantly walks over to the phone. Kate turns away from the hubbub of the kitchen as she listens. Her eyes fill with tears. Kate runs down a hospital corridor. She stops at the reception desk and speaks to a nurse, who points to a room opposite. Kate walks into the room, where young Zoe is lying in bed, her eyes closed. Kate walks around the bed and looks down sadly at her niece, who has grazes above and below her right eye. A balding doctor in his 40s stands in the open doorway. Dr. Barton pats Kate on the shoulder and walks away. She stares through the window at the sleeping Zoe. Kate's asleep on a chair next to Zoe's bed.",
    "368": "Young Don Price shines his flashlight on Edward, and a recap of earlier football, baseball, and basketball highlights reveals that Edward beats Don every time, leaving Edward dumbstruck. With all the strength he can muster, he turns and walks down the front steps while she stays in the doorway for a few beats, feeling genuinely horrible for what's happened, but eventually, she goes back inside. We lead Edward as he walks away, tears just starting to form, and he exits the frame, leaving only the sorority house in the background. Edward steps back into the frame, looking at the sorority house, as we circle and he shouts. Sandra and her sisters peer out through the curtains while the tweedy economics professor continues his explanation, but Sandra isn't paying a lot of attention. He switches on the overhead projector without looking at it, causing a titter from the students, but he doesn't notice until a classmate nudges Sandra, who looks up and the professor finally notices what's written there. Walking with her books, Sandra shakes her head, disbelieving, and we look up to the blue sky where a giant sky-written heart floats in the wind. At her sisters' prompting, a just-woken Sandra looks out the second-story window to find the lawn filled with Edward standing amid the sea of flowers. Sandra walks out to him, smiling, confused, joyful, and scared, and out of nowhere, a tear drops down Sandra's cheek. From down the street, the adult Don Price arrives, 230 pounds of football-playing, Skynyrd-loving, fraternity-proud muscle, and he's pissed. A gang of his brothers walk behind him, and Don Price decks him, knocking him down. Edward gets right back up but makes no move to defend himself, unfazed; Don slugs him again, shrugs fine, then proceeds to kick Edward's ass nine ways to Sunday, and as the ass-whupping continues, we see Don Price sitting on the can, pinching a loaf while reading the new Playboy, squeezing down hard, trying to shit the unshittable. Suddenly, he grasps his chest and collapses face-first on the tile, and the same image of Don's dead face on the tile is reflected in The Eye as the thrashing continues. Edward somehow fights his way back to his feet, ready to be knocked down again, and Don is about to slug Edward again when he turns as Sandra pulls off her engagement ring. There's an audible AHH! from her sisters and an OHH! from Don's brothers, and Don stands stunned, his mind reeling. Edward, whose eyes are swollen almost shut, keeps waiting for the next punch as she hands him the ring. Another beat passes, then Don storms off, and Sandra leans over Edward's broken body, his head lying on the daffodils. As the music reaches a crescendo, Edward reaches for his glass of water, but Josephine already has it for him.",
    "1159": "The friends find each other as Death Eaters advance and Ginny points her wand, causing their attackers to vanish. The passages are deserted, but several glass spheres drop from the highest shelves and shatter, prompting the friends to look up in alarm. Luna stands mesmerized by the falling spheres until Neville grabs her arm, and as they run, more spheres plummet from the shelves. They head for the door at the end of a long narrow passage, with the wooden shelves collapsing behind them and sending a cascade of glass spheres crashing down. Crunching broken glass underfoot, they reach the door, which opens, and they run straight through, only to fall into empty space. They land face down beside a large rocky mound, with Harry still clutching the glowing sphere. A stone archway filled with misty vapor stands on the mound as they raise their wands for protection against a group of black-cloaked figures that swoop down. The Death Eaters swirl around them, trailing plumes of dense black smoke. Harry lies huddled on the rocky mound, clutching the prophecy sphere, and cautiously gets to his feet. Ahead of him, a scowling Death Eater restrains Luna with his wand at her throat, while Harry looks around for the others, each held prisoner by a grim-faced Death Eater. Ron struggles, and Hermione's captor tightens his hold as Lucius approaches Harry and holds out his hand. Harry looks around at his friends, helpless in the grip of the Death Eaters, and then back at Lucius' outstretched hand. Bellatrix is holding Neville by the hair and presses her wand to his throat with an evil smile, prompting Harry to place the glowing prophecy into Lucius' hand, which grows dark. Lucius holds it up in triumph but is distracted by a flash of bright light and turns in surprise as Sirius punches him, causing him to drop the sphere, which shatters. The Death Eaters release their captives, and Bellatrix disappears as flashes of light bring reinforcements, including Nymphadora Tonks, Kingsley, and Lupin. A Death Eater advances, but Sirius fends him off and pulls Harry to safety, while Nymphadora helps Luna and Hermione. Lucius draws a wand from his stick and aims at Harry, joined by another Death Eater. Shoulder-to-shoulder, Sirius and Harry fight Lucius and the Death Eater in front of the stone archway as Death Eaters swoop above their heads, trailing black smoke. One heads for Moody, who taps his stick and hurls the Death Eater away backwards. Sirius congratulates Harry and disarms Lucius, sending him hurling backwards as Bellatrix attacks, causing Sirius to stagger. He gives Harry a faint smile before being drawn away through the stone archway and gradually disappearing into the swirling, misty vapor beyond, leaving Sirius gone. Distraught, Harry tries to follow.",
    "712": "They hurry through a door to a gymnasium. Jack places his hand on Rose's cheek, and Rose places her gloved hand over his. She steps outside, and Jack watches her leave through a wavy window glass, then gazes downward. Later, in the first-class lounge, Ruth, Rose, the Countess, and another woman drink tea. Rose gazes toward another table where a woman pulls a slouching young girl upright, and Rose watches the girl place a napkin on her lap with her small gloved hands. Jack leans on a railing for balance and stares into the sea as wind ruffles his hair. Rose steps across the deck toward him, and he turns and faces her; Jack smiles, and Rose walks toward him and reaches out. They hold hands, and Jack gently pulls her toward himself. Rose closes her eyes, and grasping her hand, Jack helps Rose onto the bow, rail platform. They both step onto the lowest rung of the railing, and then she holds her arms out like wings as the wind blows her shawl back on her outstretched arms. He places his hands around her waist as she opens her eyes. Black smoke trails from the ship's funnels as Jack and Rose stand at the rail high above the water. Jack reaches out and grasps Rose's hands and leans his face close to hers. Jack folds Rose's arms around her waist, and she turns his face to him, and they kiss. Rose places her hand on the back of Jack's neck. The sunken Titanic sits on the bottom of the ocean as the elderly Rose turns from a monitor and addresses the crew of the salvage vessel. Rose gazes back at the monitor, which shows the underwater image of the fireplace in her former suite. The room transforms into its former state as young Rose and Jack step inside. Jack rushes toward a painting, and Rose opens the safe. Rose hands the Heart of the Ocean necklace to Jack, who shakes his head as he examines the faceted blue diamond, and then Jack turns to Rose. Later, Rose removes the butterfly comb from her hair and shakes out her hair, which falls to her shoulders. Jack drags a settee to the center of the room and places one pillow atop another. Sitting in a chair near the settee, Jack opens a canvas bag, removes a knife and a thin stick of charcoal which he sharpens, and looks up as Rose steps into the room. Holding a kimono close with one hand, Rose lifts a sash and twirls it. Jack smiles as Rose steps toward him, and he sits back as she tosses a dime to him. Rose steps backward, then slips the kimono from her shoulders, and the kimono slides to the floor. Naked, Rose runs her fingertips over her own thigh.",
    "852": "They pass a sign. The back window shatters as Gabriel lands on the roof, ripping the lights off and punching the roof with his fists. Jeep shoots up at it, and Gabriel falls but clings onto the back. Jeep shoots at Gabriel, and the car swerves, causing Gabriel to knock over his hand, making the flare go off in the car. Gabriel tries to hold himself in the back window, grabs Audrey's arm, and punches her. He grabs Jeep's gun arm, and Jeep tries to fight him off. Charlie keeps hold of her baby while Gabriel clamps his hand over Jeep's eyes. Jeep puts his foot down, and the car swerves all over the road. Audrey grabs Gabriel around the throat as the speedometer creeps past 90 and hits 110. Jeep slams on the brakes, and Gabriel hurtles out of the front window, tumbling onto the road. The car leaves the road, hits a hump, and rolls into a ditch, landing on its roof. Jeep is upside down in his seat with his head pressed against the roof while Charlie manages to get out. Jeep struggles to get out of the car and stands up next to Charlie, who shakes her head and supports him. Jeep and Charlie, holding the baby, climb up a steep hill, struggling for handholds as the gradient increases. Jeep looks up in the sky as Gabriel swoops down out of the light sky and lands just in front of Jeep, knocking him cold with a single punch. Charlie tries to run but finds herself on the edge of a cliff top as Gabriel turns to her and holds his hand out. She looks at the baby and shakes her head while Gabriel eyes her steadily. Jeep leaps on Gabriel's back and they fall over the cliff, landing on the ground below. Gabriel tosses Jeep aside and draws a knife as he advances on him. Jeep stares up at Gabriel, who towers over him with the knife ready. As Gabriel raises the knife to strike, Michael descends from the heavens in a dazzling ray of light. Gabriel looks down, then his face contorts in anger, and he lunges at Michael with the knife. Michael hacks him with his sword, causing Gabriel to drop the knife and fall to his knees as gouts of blood drip off Michael's sword. Jeep sits up as Michael steps over to Gabriel, placing the tip of his sword on Gabriel's chin. Michael stares at Gabriel but doesn't move, then shakes his head, lowers the sword, and steps away. Gabriel gets to his feet, looks down, spreads his wings, and takes off. Michael turns to Jeep, who gets up.",
    "90": "He reaches for his wallet and forces a laugh. The policeman thoughtfully pats the fifty into the bill-fold and hands it back into the car. Carl's nervous smile fades as there is a whimpering sound. The policeman hesitates and leans forward into the car, listening. Grimsrud reaches across Carl, grabs the trooper by the hair, and slams his head down onto the car door. With his free hand, Grimsrud pops the glove compartment, brings a gun out, and reaches across Carl, shooting at the back of the trooper's head. Jean screams as he releases the policeman, whose head slides out the window and whose body flops back onto the street. Carl looks out at the cop in the road, gets out, and leans down to hoist up the body. Headlights appear: an oncoming car that Grimsrud notices as the car approaches, slowing. Carl, with the trooper's body hoisted halfway up, is frozen in the headlights. The car carries the silhouettes of two occupants in front as Grimsrud slides into the driver's seat. The car accelerates, roars past, and away. Grimsrud squeals into a U-turn, the driver's door slamming shut with his spin. He takes the cigarette from his mouth and stubs it in his ashtray. Small red tail lights fishtail up ahead as Jean starts screaming in the back seat. The red tail lights ahead start to turn, and with a distant crunching sound, they disappear. The headlights now show only empty road, starting to turn the car. Grimsrud is not gaining on the tail lights, so he frowns and slows. The wrecked car's headlights shine off into a snowfield abutting the highway as Grimsrud applies brakes. Jean slides off the back seat and thumps into the leg-well. His headlights show the car up ahead off the road, crumpled around a telephone pole, having failed to hold a turn. Grimsrud sweeps his gun off the front seat, opens his door, and gets out. A young man in a down parka is limping across the snowfield, away from the wrecked car. Grimsrud strides calmly out after the injured boy, raises his gun, and fires. With a poof of feathers, a hole opens up in the boy's back, and he pitches into the snow. Grimsrud walks up to the wreck and peers in its half-open door, where a young woman is trapped inside the twisted wreckage, injured. Grimsrud raises his gun and fires. A blue-winged teal in flight over a swampy marshland. The room in which it hangs is dark, and the continuing track reveals a couple in bed, sleeping. The man, fortyish, pajama-clad, is big and big-bellied with his mouth agape. He snores while his arms are flung over a woman in her thirties, wearing a nightie, mouth also open, not snoring.",
    "994": "Nick grins as Gatsby heads up the steps to the house, and then Nick starts to walk away. Nick turns to Gatsby, who nods, and Nick smiles thoughtfully as Gatsby carries on up the grand staircase. Nick then turns to go, as Gatsby stops at the top of the steps and looks up at the mansion thoughtfully. With a servant on either side, Gatsby walks on to the house. In his doctor's office, Nick sits at a typewriter when a female member of staff brings breakfast on a tray for him, while photographers crowd around a car. Gatsby and Daisy make love and lie in bed together in the dark, with curtains billowing in the open windows, as photographers continue to stake out the mansion. Gatsby and Daisy lie next to each other in bed, then stand at the end of the dock looking across the bay. Gatsby looks around and sees Herzog nearby, and Nick looks unsure as Gatsby looks around again to see Herzog lurking in the shadows. Herzog turns and walks off while Nick is lost in his thoughts, as Tom lights a cigar and Gatsby and Daisy look apprehensive. Servants attend to them at the Buchanan's, where Tom, Gatsby, Daisy, Nick, and Jordan sit around a dining table, and Gatsby wears a pale-pink suit. Tom paces as the bay is calm, and Gatsby frowns heavily while Tom glances at Gatsby, who points, and Daisy looks nervous. Gatsby gets up as Tom looks out, and Gatsby looks down at Daisy, who looks increasingly anxious, while Tom squints at the green light, which flashes at the top of wooden posts. Gatsby moves his hand towards Daisy's on the white tablecloth, but she pulls away abruptly, and attempting to light a cigarette, Daisy fumbles with the lighter and drops it. Gatsby picks it up for her as Jordan, Nick, and Tom watch, and he lights the cigarette while Daisy cups her hand around his. Gatsby regards Daisy earnestly, and Daisy looks at him with tears brimming in her eyes. Glowering, Tom steps closer, and Nick listens with interest as Tom stubs out his cigar. Daisy marches off down the hall with Jordan following, and Tom looks at Gatsby and then walks off. In the drive, Gatsby's yellow Deusenberg is driven up along with Tom's smaller blue coupe. Tom drives ahead with Nick and Jordan beside him while Gatsby and Daisy follow in the coupe, speeding along country roads. Tom drives recklessly at speed, narrowly missing one car and overtaking several others, as ahead a truck has spilled its load of crates of fruit and vegetables. Tom veers around, squashing watermelons, and nearly hits an oncoming car, as they drive on to the filthy gray Valley of Ashes where the oculist's holding a pair of eyes framed by rusty spectacles stares down unnervingly. They head to Wilson's garage, where Wilson looks ill, and Myrtle watches from an upstairs window.",

Later, elegantly dressed on the porch, Charlotte tries to eavesdrop on Stuart and Skeeter as she waters her plants. He starts walking away. Skeeter, glancing back towards the house, frowns speculatively. She strides past her smiling date. In a diner, shirt sleeves rolled up, he's ordered oysters. They clink oyster and cracker. He reaches across and takes her hand. She responds with a smile. Outside the diner, Stuart grabs her hand. He steps towards her and kisses her on the lips. Mae Mobley is sitting on Aibileen's knee with a picture book. Hilly comes out of her house grimacing. She pushes aside a press photographer. Toilets are scattered on the yard. She cradles her Yard of the Month sign and carries it inside to the amusement of the onlookers. Mae Mobley, with her knickers down, proudly sits on one of the many toilets scattered across the lawn. Elizabeth drags her off. Tenderly carrying Mae Mobley in her arms, Aibileen sets her down on the lawn surrounded by a dozen toilets. She kneels in front of her. Taking hold of her hands, she looks deeply into the child's moon face. They hug each other. Elizabeth, watching coldly from the front door, goes inside. At the Phelan's, Skeeter, Josefo, and Pascagoula are watching civil rights activist Medgar Evers on TV. Charlotte turns off the TV. The servants scoot away. Charlotte grabs Skeeter by the hand. Skeeter pulls away and goes. On a bus on her way home, Aibileen is napping. Henry, sitting nearby, looks up from his book. The bus stops. The driver switches on the inside lights and faces the passengers. Aibileen and Henry, who have been sitting at the back of the bus, hurriedly get out and walk off down the dark street. He goes. Seeing Henry disappear around the corner, Aibileen starts to run. Civil rights activist Roy Wilkins comments. Aibileen trips and falls. Minnie's children leave the kitchen. The three younger ones pile into one bed. The two friends put their arms around each other. With a somber expression, Skeeter flips back to the front cover of the LIFE magazine, which shows the distraught widow comforting her young son. At the foot mansion, Minnie is hoovering down a stuffed standing grizzly bear on a corner dice. She looks towards the fad and steps down from the platform.

    "1349": "The boys gather their wits with lights flashing hauntingly. Joe moves to the locked bulletproof glass door and tries the handle, but it's not going to open. On the other side of the glass, Nelec, momentarily disoriented and breathing heavily, moves away from the bus door to the locked glass separating him from the kids; he tries the handle, but it won't open for him either. Joe and Nelec are face-to-face, and Joe sees the fear in Nelec's eyes, understanding that this is his fate. Somehow, Nelec takes a moment to look into Joe's face to silently repent. Instantly, Joe knows he's about to watch this man's life end. Nelec turns as the creature is busting the bus door, smashing at it to make it bigger so it can get inside. Joe hits again, as does the creature, while Nelec runs out of ammo. Joe hits again, and crash — the window shatters! Glass chunks rain down on the boys, who cover their faces, as Cary sees the creature. With all the boys helping, Joe pulls himself up outside the bus, peeking out to see the creature just fifteen feet away, focused on the door. Joe strains to climb onto the top-side of the bus terrifyingly down the aisle toward him. As the creature descends upon him, in the silence before the final lunge, Nelec eerily and quietly expresses his terror. Standing is hard for heartsick Louis with his hurt legs — suddenly Jack is there, acting the role of Air Force. As the two Soldiers head off, Jack wraps Louis' arm over his shoulders and heads off in the other direction, with Louis looking over at him, confused. On Louis' face is a surprised glimmer of hope. Moments later, tight on a pocket, Joe pulls out his mother's necklace, having taken it from Overmyer's dead body. Cary holds up his backpack. They turn to see a car coming fast, and Joe studies the oncoming car behind him. The car arrives — it's Donny. He gets out of his car, wild- and red-eyed, incredibly happy to see them. Donny looks at Joe, as if it hurts to think. Joe drives while Donny is asleep, with the other boys in the back. Joe quickly turns left into a driveway, but from the direction they just came, more tanks and military vehicles approach, and Joe's eyes go wide — they're stuck. Gunfire continues as Joe and the boys get out of the car fast and run across the street, zig-zagging between the enormous military vehicles.",
    "557": "The study is cluttered with books, and Professor Henry Jones is absorbed at his desk, studying a very ancient parchment volume that lies open on the desk. The page shows a beautifully illuminated picture of what might be a stained-glass window, incorporating a series of Roman numerals. The Professor is not just studying it; he is copying it into his own notebook, sketching with his hand and holding up one finger. The study door is just closing, Indy closing it behind him, just as Herman comes through the front door, still playing the trumpet. Indy reaches for the trumpet, pulling it from Herman's mouth, but Herman continues to spit right into Indy's face. Herman means the sheriff, who now enters the house. Indy shows the Cross, more or less handing it to the sheriff to make his point, and the sheriff takes it casually. Fedora enters the house, followed by Roscoe, Rough Rider, and Halfbreed, and politely removes his hat, holding it in his hand. The sheriff and Fedora are in cahoots, and the sheriff hands the Cross to Fedora. Roscoe reaches in, takes it from Fedora, and runs out the door. Fedora remains behind for a moment, turning and speaking to Indy in an ironic man-to-man way. He holds the hat by the crown and puts it on Indy's head, a show of respect and admiration for the boy. The hat blocks Indy's face, and the brim fills the screen. As the brim tilts up, we see the face of a full-grown Indiana Jones, who is punched in the face while his arms are pinned behind his back. The Man in the Panama Hat, years older now, removes the Cross of Coronado from Indy's belt. It's night, and rain pours down in the middle of a violent storm at sea, with thirty-foot waves crashing across the deck. The two Portuguese sailors, who have Indy's arms pinned behind his back, propel Indy across the deck toward the rail. As they pass a bundle of fuel drums, Indy uses the sailors as leverage to kick up his feet and break open the clamp on the metal bands that hold the drums together. Indy jabs his elbows into the sailors' stomachs and rushes toward the Man in the Panama Hat, who sees Indy coming and hurries toward the ladder that leads up to the bridge. Indy withstands the force of waves crashing on the deck and makes his way to where Panama Hat is climbing the ladder. Indy takes the cross back from Panama Hat, but a sailor delivers a powerful blow to Indy's face, sending the cross flying out of his grip and skittering across the deck.",
    "898": "They glance curiously at the car then resume their conversation. In the backseat, the hulking escapee's chest heaves as he stares fixedly at the red light. Dillinger licks his lips, his head bowed slightly. He reaches his left hand toward the gun nestled in his waistband. The light changes to green and Dillinger puts the car in gear. He glances over his shoulder as he turns on to another street. The escapee looks behind them. With a smirk, Dillinger shifts gears. The Ford speeds away from town as Youngblood keeps watch out the rear windshield. Now, the car cruises beside a field. Dillinger looks at the mechanic. He shakes his head light-heartedly. The befuddled mechanic shakes his head. During an interview, elsewhere, Hoover listens on the radio. He pinches the bridge of his nose. Now at her apartment, Billie sits in a chair, her hands fidgeting anxiously. She rushes to the telephone and leans against a wall as she holds the receiver to her ear. At the telephone exchange, Baum listens. Billie clutches the phone despondently. She lowers her sad, resigned eyes. Dillinger stands inside a phone booth with a faint, tender smile. Billie removes the receiver from her ear and clutches it against the base of her neck, resting her chin on her knuckles. Outside her apartment, two men watch from inside a car concealed underneath a bridge. Later, Purvis sits in a car outside the apartment. Baum climbs into the passenger seat and hands him a file with a transcript from Dillinger's phone call to Billie. Behind them, an el train glides across a bridge, its interior lights glowing in the darkness. A tan car pulls to a stop and Dillinger and Red climb out. As Dillinger heads around the corner, down an icy walkway, Sport steps out of the safe house. Red perches on the side of the car, his gun raised. Marty emerges from the house, behind Sport. Dillinger narrows his eyes and tilts his head. He pulls out his machine gun. Inside, a man waits by the doorway with a gun at the ready. Outside, Red aims his gun at the house. Later, Dillinger and Red burst into a cigar shop. Red grabs two customers. Gilbert stands behind one of the counters. Dillinger gives Gilbert a hard look. Gilbert leads Dillinger and Red upstairs to a dimly lit room. Dillinger takes in the chalkboard-covered walls and the rows of men at desks chattering on telephones. Small overhead lights with green lampshades hang from above next to dangling clusters of phone wires. D'Andrea sits on the corner of the desk. He looks at Gilbert. A blonde man gestures for Dillinger to raise his arms. Dillinger lifts his hands.",
    "727": "They drop onto the deck below. Meanwhile, inside the ship, tables and chairs batter swimming passengers. As the water rises, some are carried up the staircase while others are trapped against the ceiling of the room below. The ornately carved wall clock at the top of the staircase sinks beneath the churning water. As sea water pours into the openings passengers back into the sinking ship. Wearing a life vest, Fabrizio swims past one of the broken window suction slams against the side of the ship, but he braces himself against the windowed frame. He reaches up for a railing but slips. He turns and swims toward open water. Meanwhile, Rose drops onto a lower deck. The ship's baker helps her up. Jack and Rose reunite in the crowd. In one of the lifeboats Cal beats off panicked passengers with an oar. Several cables holding a funnel snap and flail against water like whips. Cal's eyes widen as the huge funnel tips over. Swimming in the water with several others, Fabrizio looks up as the giant funnel falls onto him. It's a wave which washes away several people. A man climbs into Cal's lifeboat but Cal pushes him back into the ocean. Jack and Rose continue to fight their way through the crowd which slowly funnels up another staircase. Inside people cling to columns at the top of the grand staircase. Water surges up an empty corridor, splintering furniture and knocking doors off. Some people in a lifeboat behind the Titanic row furiously as the ship's enormous propellers rise out of the water. Some passengers leap off from the back of Titanic which is now tilted up several stories above the ocean surface. Gripping Rose's hand, Jack leaps through the crowd. They move to a railing and watch as several passengers plunge overboard. Jack and Rose continue on, pressing passed a group of people kneeling around a priest. A few dozen people tread water near the propeller. Jack pulls up towards deck which is now slanted at a forty-five degree angle. They grab onto the railing at the exact spot they first met. Water streams down the exposed propellers as they continue to tilt upward. Kneeling people grab one of the priest's hands as he holds onto a cab stand or rotating shaft with his other hand. Beside Jack and Rose a woman hugs a young boy to her chest. Shivering, Rose clings to Jack as she looks down at the sinking ship. Her breath smokes in the cold air. Rose smiles. Jack hugs her tight and kisses her forehead. Inside a submerged portion of the ship, a woman's lifeless body drifts beneath a large chandelier, her gauzy dress billowing in the water.",
    "1315": "He tries to turn it off, but his fingers are still clotted with sleep. In a series of frustrated grunts and groans, he becomes more and more aggravated until, finally, one final scream and it's out of his system. He finds one last bottle in his hand, half-full with a cigarette butt floating in it. He downs the beer and steps into the adjoining bathroom to brush his teeth. Willie’s walk brings him to a fancy eatery at lunchtime. As he passes, he casually snatches a handful of car keys from the parking valet key-box and moves on. As he rounds the corner into the lot, he pushes on the various key fobs, identifying various cars when their alarms chirp. He seems dissatisfied until a brand new Cadillac chirps. Willie gets in and drives off. Willie drives. He reaches over into the glove compartment and pulls out the registration. He focuses on the car owner's address. In long shot, through the open door of an extravagant marble bathroom, we see Willie sitting on the toilet, leafing through a magazine, beer bottle on the counter next to him, pants around his ankles. Willie, standing by the toilet, finishes buckling his belt and flips the flush lever. Willie, looking down into the toilet, gives the lever a couple more clanking tries and then grabs his beer and ambles off. Sucking on his beer, Willie paces the periphery of the room, methodically knocking painting after painting off the walls. Willie arrives in the bedroom still knocking down paintings until, finally, he exposes a wall safe. A smile, and he pulls out a stethoscope. The safe door swings open to reveal stacks of cash. Willie scratches a lottery ticket. He's now wearing a Rolex and some gaudy ring. As she exits, he activates the machine. Willie skips to the next message. Through the heat ripples rising off the pavement, two mirage-like figures cross the infinite asphalt of the Saguaro Square Mall parking lot—Willie and Marcus in Santa and Elf regalia, sweating and panting in the heat. Willie polishes off a pint of Smirnoff's and flips it towards a nearby trash can. He pulls some Tic Tacs out of his pocket. Harrison stomps away and right toward Marcus and Willie as they enter the store. Willie and Marcus stop in their tracks and watch the burly man storm out. Bob Chipeska watches with them. A Beautiful Girl wearing skin-tight pants walks by, catching Willie’s eye. He stares wantonly at her ass, off in his own little world. Willie's reaction worries Marcus. Marcus pantomimes helpless laughter, noiselessly throwing his head back and holding his gut as it heaves with mirth. He is instantly composed.",
    "1282": "An object blasts out, raising clouds of leaves and knocking people off their feet as a child's buggy is blown away and a park bench is ripped from its mountings. An Apache attack helicopter heads into the cloud as a scientist chopper lands in a park, and soldiers file out with weapons raised and torches blazing, followed by scientists wearing hazmat protective suits with glass-fronted helmets covering their heads. They move cautiously through the trees towards the glowing vapor-shrouded object, with torches mounted on rifles cutting shafts of light through the dense gloom, and Helen advances with the others through the mist as the object casts an eerie green glow in the haze. She stands still, concentrating, as lights swirl in the fog cutting brightly through the dissipating mists, and the gathered crowds stare up at the pulsating sphere which is hundreds of feet high. Helen gapes with her mouth open behind her visor as an intense beam of white light sweeps across the ground, and she looks around in alarm as the military arrives in Hummers with heavy machine guns, while police vehicles draw up in convoy and soldiers fan out to firing positions. A soldier arms his .50 caliber heavy machine gun and points it at the sphere as floodlights illuminate the site and police snipers take positions overlooking the park. The Apache circles the sphere as lights blaze out from the interior, then concentrate at the base of the towering object with such power that Helen has to look away and raises an arm to shield her eyes. Police and soldiers stand tensely with their weapons raised as a figure moves in the white blaze of light, and Helen moves towards the hazy figure. As the soldiers prepare to fire, Helen keeps moving slowly forward and approaches the figure near the base of the sphere, hesitating before the figure holds out a human-like hand, which Helen goes to take. Red blood sprays Helen's visor as the figure falls into her arms, and she looks down at the humanoid shape with a featureless face as personnel hurry to help. More lights blaze within the sphere, and everybody looks up, staring, as a humanoid robot some 50 feet high emerges from the sphere with a light shining out from an eye slit in its head. Every weapon becomes inoperable and all the lights go out, as people cringe and fall to the ground in pain from the noise emitted by the robot. It strides forward and looms over Helen, who's still holding the wounded visitor, and it bends its head down towards her, stretching out a vast hand, then withdraws its hand, raises its head, and stands with its arms by its sides as the light in the eye slit goes out. Finally, all the lights, power, and weapons systems are restored.",
    "997": "Nick reacts with a perplexed frown. At the cottage, Nick stands in the shadows, deep in thought. He looks across to Gatsby's mansion and sees the yellow Duesenberg drive up. Nick walks over and finds Gatsby washing Myrtle's blood off the front of the car. The right fender is dented and the windscreen is cracked. Kneeling with a rag and bucket, Gatsby looks around. They cover the car. He points at Herzog, who goes back into the house. With an emphatic gesture and a sharp nod, Gatsby opens the door to the house. He stops and glances around. He looks at Nick and points at the sky. With a cautious frown, Nick walks into the house with Gatsby. The sky lightens. They stand on the dock. Gatsby looks out across the bay. At the garage, Wilson throws Myrtle's pills into a drawer, holds up a revolver and stares at it. He looks into the eyes on the Dr. Eckleburg billboard. A golden sun rises. The bay is calm. Gatsby and Nick sit on the terrace. Gatsby steps out into the sunlight. Gatsby and Nick walk down steps and across the ornamental terrace, towards the pool. Gatsby walks between two tall, stone urns and down some more steps. Nick stays at the top. Gatsby turns to Nick. Gatsby smiles. Nick opens a low, metal gate. He stops and turns to Gatsby. They both smile. Nick looks at him thoughtfully. Nick leaves Gatsby resting on the gate. Gatsby looks up at the sky. Nick heads off along the gravel path beneath the terrace, leading through the ornamental garden. He stops and looks up at Gatsby. Gatsby smiles fondly. Nick smiles back. They wave to each other. Nick sits looking sleepy as others work around him. Gatsby stands by the pool. Wearing a swimming costume, Gatsby dives into the round, azure pool. At home, Daisy sits near a telephone, looking pale and distant. Gatsby swims deep into the pool. Shadowed against a wall, Wilson stalks through the grounds, holding his revolver. Daisy walks towards the telephone and lifts the receiver. Gatsby surfaces as his phone rings. A faint, hopeful smile spreads across Gatsby's lips as he climbs up the steps at the side of the pool. He looks across the bay, to the Buchanan mansion. Herzog answers the phone. Wilson approaches on the side of the pool behind Gatsby. Wilson shoots Gatsby in the back. His body flinches. Herzog looks round. Gatsby touches his chest and looks at his finger. Heavy-browed, his deep blue eyes staring wildly, Gatsby looks again across the Bay of Consequence to the Buchanan's mansion. Gatsby's mouth hangs open. His eyes glaze as the life drains from him. His eyelids droop.",
    "730": "Ice crystals sparkle in Jack's hair as he takes her hand and kisses the back of her hand. Jack smiles, then closes his eyes and winces, while Rose closes her eyes and leans her head against their entwined hands. As one lifeboat returns to the site of the wreck, the dark-haired crewman shines his flashlight over the debris-strewn water, where frozen bodies float amid pieces of furniture, barrels, and other wreckage. Using an oar, the crewman prods several stiff corpses, and leaning over the front of the boat, a sailor pushes bodies out of their path as they row forward slowly. The crewman's flashlight beam illuminates a dead woman and infant floating in the water. Elsewhere in the debris field, Rose lies on her back atop a floating wooden panel, while Jack floats in the sea beside her, his head and arms propped above water. Rose sings to herself as she gazes up at the starry night sky, her hair and eyebrows caked with ice, turning her head as a distant light illuminates the side of her face. The lifeboat passes several yards away from her as she shakes Jack's hand, smiling and rubbing his arm, and sits up. Jack floats motionless with his eyes closed, and Rose shakes him harder, then gazes toward the lifeboat. Between them, the dead crewman floats with the whistle still in his mouth. Rose's smile fades as she stares at Jack and shakes him again; a tear trickles down her nose. Furrowing her brow, Rose chokes back tears as she strokes Jack's hand, while the lifeboat rows further away. Rose trembles as she watches it recede, then lays down her head and closes her eyes. The light of the rescuers' flashlight grows dimmer as they move on, and Rose's eyes pop open as she sits up and pries her hand out of Jack's grip. She kisses his hand, then releases him as Jack sinks in the icy water and vanishes in the gloom. Rose slides on her stomach to the edge of the platform, then rolls into the water, her breath steaming out in clouds, and swims to the frozen crewman to pull the whistle from his lips. Rose continues to blow into the whistle as the rescuers shine their lights on her. On the research ship, the now older Rose opens her eyes as tears stream down Lizzy's face. As dawn breaks over the ocean, Ismay sits silently in a lifeboat with other survivors, while in another boat, a man takes a drink from a flask, then passes it to Cal. Elsewhere, Ruth huddles against Molly, who stares out to sea with a blank expression. Wrapped in a blanket, her face pales as she looks up and is dazed in green light.",
    "962": "David watches her with a mesmerized expression, as Elise wraps her arms around a male dancer's necks and he lifts her. As they rotate together, Elise spreads her legs gracefully. The dancer sets her down, then lifts her by the waist. Two others join him, taking Elise's hands as the center dancer lowers her, then raises her again. Thompson steps up behind David. Turning, David glares at him. David gives him a sidelong look. Thompson's eyes remain on the dancers. David glances at the stage. David's brow creases. He looks squarely at Thompson, but the adjustment officer's gaze remains on the performance. David returns his eyes to the stage, where a dancer tosses Elise into the arms of another. She extends her arms and legs as he spins her. Thompson steps away, his eyes still focused on the dancers. With a puzzled frown, David watches the adjustment officer stop in the studio's doorway. Thompson gazes at the performance, and David follows his eyes back to the stage. Elise bends forward, sweeping her legs straight up into the air behind her. As a male dancer tosses her, Thompson gives a nod and Elise falls. Her face contorts in pain. As David rushes toward the stage, a male dancer picks Elise up and carries her off the platform. He scurries out of the studio with David jogging after them. Thompson turns away from the scene, his face pinched, and strolls through a doorway. Later, Elise rests her head on David's shoulder as they ride in the back of a cab. They pull up to a hospital, and David carries Elise inside. Now still in costume, Elise wears a protective lead apron around her waist as she lies on an X-ray table. An X-ray machine hovers above her feet, aligning a cross-haired light pattern with her ankle. Meanwhile, David sits in a waiting room, his head bowed and his eyes closed. He massages the bridge of his nose with his fingers. Thompson appears in front of him. David punches him in the face. As Thompson stumbles back, two men in the waiting room rise, their eyes on David. Thompson straightens his fedora. Meanwhile, a doctor checks X-rays. With a stern look, Thompson turns away. As he leaves, he tips his hat at one of the men in the waiting room. David stares after him, his chest heaving. He lowers himself back into his chair and bows his head. Later, he stands beside Elise's bed in the emergency room. He touches her bandaged ankle, which rests on two pillows. He wraps his arms around her, squeezing his eyes shut as they hug. With a woeful expression, he opens his eyes and shifts them thoughtfully.",
    "429": "The applause grows louder as the balls keep spinning toward the pockets. Eddie beams with pride and excitement as he accepts the acclamation of the sharks at Ames. He slaps down the chalk and returns to his seat. Fats draws himself slowly out of his chair and hands the money to Charlie. It is almost four o'clock. Fats hesitates for a moment, then reaches in his pocket for some bills. They stand up, remove their jackets, and prepare to play again. As Preacher opens the door to the back room, clutching a paper bag filled with bottles to his chest, we see six men seated around a table, playing poker. Preacher approaches one of them and whispers something hurriedly in his ear. The man is Bert Gordon. Except for his dark glasses, he might pass for a conservative businessman out for an evening with the boys, sipping milk instead of alcohol to soothe an ulcer. He nods to Preacher who then leaves. Bert appears thoughtful for a moment. He rises. Bert sips his milk. A floor full of cigarette butts surround Charlie's chair. Charlie crushes out another on the floor and immediately reaches for more. Eddie drains the last drips from his bottle of bourbon, then looks jauntily at Bert, who now sits quietly in a chair, watching them both. He misses. Eddie squirms out of his seat, eager to play, eager to go on winning. Bert sighs. The shot goes in. Fats opens a fresh bottle of whisky. The game goes on. The shot goes in. The hands of the clock on the wall spin around toward eight in the morning. Only the voice of Sausage is heard, signaling the end of a game. Ames is empty now, except for the players and the employees. As Fats bends over to shoot, Henry draws the Venetian blinds. Bert holds a hand to his temple, unnerved by Fats' discomposure. There is a break in the action. Fats and Eddie eye each other coldly, Fats with his glass in his hand, Eddie with his bottle. Eddie takes a swig and returns to the game. Bert reaches forward to hand Charlie more money. Bert replaces the billfold in his coat pocket. Eddie, weary now, his hands resting on the table, looks up at the cool, impassive face of Bert Gordon. Bert rises, moves his chair about six inches, and sits down again. It sinks. Eddie goes over to the water cooler for a drink while Fats doles out his losings on the table. He stands before Fats and Bert Gordon, waiting for an answer. Fats and Bert exchange glances but nothing is said. Still no reply, no sign of giving in. Eddie starts to go back to his chair, suddenly turns, a weary, clowning smile on his face.",
    "1372": "He leaves the house and heads towards the light while the old man is wandering up to the house carrying a lit torch. He opens the front door, and inside it is just as dark. He begins climbing the stairs, hearing whispers and hushed voices coming from upstairs. The old man waits outside the room where the conversation is taking place and listens on as a snake slithers past him into the room. Wormtail stands in the doorway and looks at the old man, who looks terrified. A loud spell is cast and Harry wakes up in a flash of panic, flustered and still panicking. Hermione goes over to Ron's bed and they shake hands, then walk up the hill. The camera homes in on a boot on top of the hillside and everyone is in a circle, putting their hands on the boot. Harry rushes over and puts his hand on the boot, and there's a white flash, suddenly sending them all flying through the air. Everyone cheers as Harry, Hermione, and the young Weasleys crash to the ground with a thump while Arthur, Amos, and Cedric come down more gracefully. Cedric helps Harry to his feet, and they walk across the field, seeing a massive crowd gathered and cheering, with tents set up all over. They walk into the crowd, taking in the sights and approach a small tent, where Amos and Cedric separate and walk off. They enter the tent, which is many times bigger on the inside than the outside. They take their feet off the table and put them back on as soon as Arthur has walked past. The scene pans up the hillside onto a large stadium with a huge number of floors where the Weasleys and Harry are finding their seats as Lucius Malfoy and Draco walk below them. The ceremonies begin with balloons flying and fireworks going off. Five green and white figures fly through the air on their brooms leaving a colored trail behind them as a glittering leprechaun appears in the sky and starts dancing, making everyone excited. Five red figures appear this time, with one performing a stunt on a broom and another one appearing on the large screen. Viktor Krum waves to the crowd, and Harry joins in. Suddenly, the crowd is panicked and rushing all over, and Harry is trampled unconscious. The crowds have all gone, and a man walks through the rubble kicking at things. He casts a spell that causes a bright flash, and a large ghostly skull forms in the sky with a snake crawling from it. The man grins evilly, clearly demented, as Harry stirs and witnesses him standing there, leading Harry to run. They look at the monstrous thing in the sky as Harry holds his head in pain.",
    "623": "In her immaculate house, Vanessa is sitting alone at the dining room table, sipping a glass of red wine. Mark comes downstairs, approaches her, and pulls up a chair with a faintly smug smile flickering across his face. Mark opens the front door and catches sight of Juno driving off; at his feet, he finds the note she left. Vanessa grabs it from him, and they both read it. Juno parks the Previa in the street outside the family's wooden slatted house, where the porch light illuminates a straw heart hanging on the door knocker. She gets out of the vehicle looking emotionally and physically exhausted. In the front garden, she stops to pick a crocus and solemnly traces a circle across her tummy with its petal. Her mustachioed dad, his bald head gleaming in the bright kitchen light, is busy fixing something at the kitchen table as she comes in. She flops down at the table, and he stares at her belly. Juno nods wryly, then her expression brightens as Mac smiles to himself and continues tinkering. Through the slats, on Bleeker's upstairs window blinds, Juno and Leah can be seen scurrying to the Previa. The next morning, as the track team runs past his house, Bleeker comes out of the front door, opens the mailbox, and a cascade of orange Tic Tac packs fall onto his feet, making him grin in delight. The running team sprints around the track as Bleeker breaks off on spotting Juno coming towards him past a lineup of cheerleaders rehearsing their routine. Smiling, he jogs to meet her, and she takes his hand, placing it on her tummy and clasping it with hers. Their eyes lock, and he smiles. With his hands in the pockets of his brown sweatshirt over his skimpy yellow shorts, he kisses her. Standing on tiptoes, Juno cups his face, while her secret admirer watches sullenly and Leah, doing stretching exercises, grins. Juno gives her the finger, keeping her lips firmly stuck to Bleeker's. Later, she drives a matchbox police car up over the crest of her enormous belly, the little car slips from her grasp, and she rolls her eyes. Mac, Juno, and Bren come hurtling out of the front door with Liberty Bell in her ballet outfit. In the hospital, Leah jokingly steers Juno's wheelchair into a gown trolley. In the birthing suite, Bren, Leah, and the midwife keep their eyes fixed firmly on Juno and the squawking baby attached to his umbilical cord. Juno takes a long look at him, then closes her eyes. Bleeker breaks the tape, looks around for her, runs up the steps of the stand, and away. In the hospital room, Mac gently strokes Juno's hair as she lies on her side in bed.",
    "238": "The friend watches the customer intently as he drops the coins one by one onto the marble. He drops them, puts his ear close, and listens. Two or three coins he discards, but he smiles when others make a pure tone and keeps them. Szpilman exchanges looks with a pretty whore, who makes eyes at him. Satisfied, the customer beams, nods his thanks to Szpilman, who resumes his piano playing. Szpilman is walking. He passes emaciated children and beggars and steps over the corpses lying on the sidewalk. The wall runs the length of the street, dividing it in half and narrowing it, with buildings on one side and the wall on the other. Szpilman walks along. A piercing whistle comes from the Aryan side, causing Szpilman to stop. Two women appear from a doorway, approach the wall, and look up. Two or three packages come flying over from the Aryan side, which the women grab and then disappear. Szpilman walks on and sees a child appear through a hole at ground level. The child wriggles through, then turns, pulls a package after him, and runs. As Szpilman walks on, he hears a noise and looks back to see a second child trying to wriggle through the same hole but is stuck. Angry German voices come from the Aryan side. Szpilman goes to him, pulls him with all his might, but the boy is jammed in the hole. From the other side of the wall, the sound of an angry German voice and of a boot stamping violently on the boy is heard, and the boy screams in agony. Szpilman continues to try to pull the boy through. The sound of the German voice swearing and the dull, crunching noise made by the boot smashing into the boy continues, and with every thud, the boy screams in terrible pain. Szpilman struggles to help the boy whose screams are becoming weaker yet increasingly desperate. Szpilman pulls his arms and finally manages to get him through. The boy lies moaning, his head lolls, and his jaw sags; he is dead. Szpilman stands quickly and hurries away. Szpilman approaches the house through a shabby yard, hearing the noise of a mimeograph machine. A huge, cheerful man with a perpetual cigarette in his mouth laughs and coughs, starts looking through papers. His room is piled from floor to ceiling with old papers and stuff, dark, shabby, and run-down. One of his sons, Symche, is operating the mimeograph machine while the other, Dolek, is sorting the sheets as they come off the roller. Mrs. Zyskind, holding a toddler, is cooking at a small stove. A distinctive knock on the door makes Szpilman tense, but Jehuda beams and gestures to one of his boys, saying \"Symche.\" The boy opens the door to admit a short, neat man, Majorek.",
    "680": "Two webs lift a power cable as a shield, and the points of the pincer pierce the cable, causing an enormous surge of electricity to shoot up the limb to Octavius. Spider-Man struggles to pull out more cables but succeeds, and both men are hurled through the air. Spider-Man sees the severed cables, but the sphere keeps drawing metal objects to it. He stands before it with his hands apart as more and more pieces of the structure of the lab are sucked into the glowing sphere. Beyond the lab, on the streets of New York, lamp posts, taxis, and cars are drawn towards the building and the tritium. Octavius, sitting in the water, regains consciousness, and Spider-Man hears a water-logged limb, running over to Octavius, who looks puzzled. Spider-Man removes his mask, and Octavius watches as more metal is pulled into the sphere. A submerged limb rises, and Octavius' face changes as a limb places its pincer around Peter's neck. Octavius nods, and their pincers close, with the tips of the limbs looking like serpents' heads. Octavius' dark eyes glean, and he blinks, then raises an eyebrow as more debris is sucked in. The limbs watch Octavius and move threateningly towards his face as the pincer around Peter's neck loosens off, and a limb stops him. The unmasked Spider-Man watches as the four limbs raise Octavius aloft and carry him towards the golden orb floating in the fusion chamber. When they are almost upon it, the limbs stop, and Octavius turns, his face grim and somber. The two men stare long and hard at each other before Octavius about-turns and bounds towards the sphere. Spider-Man, still without the mask, spins round to see the incredulous look on MJ's face as she recognizes him, and her face breaks into a smile. Peter watches her fondly, then spots beams and a girder toppling as the whole side of the building crashes down towards her in one, prompting him to sprint to hold it up. MJ is lying on the floor as he stands above her, looking down intensely before bending under its weight. Meanwhile, Octavius is under the fusion chamber, looking up at the sphere, using the limbs to remove the support girders as the chamber and the lab start to sink. Peter struggles to hold up the side wall and nods as the chamber crashes down into the river beneath it, taking the sphere and Octavius with it. Peter exerts all his strength to throw the side wall after it, then reaches down to MJ, removing a wooden beam trapping her. They turn to see a revolving mass of metal speeding towards them. Holding MJ in his arms, he leaps up and uses a web to carry them away from the sinking laboratory.",
    "928": "Greene's car arrives in town, and they drive through quiet cobbled streets past a bubbling fountain. Bond is following his GPS tracker as Greene arrives at a large, very modern leisure complex where he and the German are wearing tuxedos. Crowds of people in evening dress are arriving by riverboat and milling in the foyer as Greene walks upstairs. A huge glitter ball and other equipment are being wheeled on trolleys, and a poster advertises Tosca. A man crosses the staging area and descends some stairs to the Kunslerangang, the artists' entrance, where in a dressing room, makeup is applied, and costumes are checked, including one actress having a wound painted on her forehead. Bond walks down a plain white corridor, opens a door, and steps inside as guests gather in a reception area in the form of a cube built over the theater entrance. Greene oozes charm as he shakes an older man's hand while his German companion drifts off. The performers are getting changed, and a well-muscled actor checks two wardrobes but can't find his clothes. Bond joins the theatergoers wearing a tuxedo as Greene's crony carries a bag. Bond looks down at the revelers from a balcony and spots Greene and his friend sipping champagne and talking to two elegant women. He watches as white-shirted hostesses give out gift bags to guests and follows the guests with a gift bag into the toilets. The crowds move into the auditorium as Greene and his friend, carrying their gift bags, are welcomed into a private box. Bond empties the bag into a basin, picks up a small pin in the shape of a letter Q, then opens up a box and takes out a small earpiece. Greene does the same, settling in his chair, while the guest Bond followed in is slumped in the corner. He steps out of the toilet and rips off the door handle as the singer is raised up the set on a decorator's cradle. Bond is backstage behind the set featuring a huge moving eye and climbs up a walkway. Greene is watching from his box as Bond climbs flight after flight up metal stairs. Greene's friend looks around and smiles weakly at a grim-faced man standing at the back of the box, who stares at him. From a high gantry, Bond looks out at the vast packed amphitheater as Greene's eyes widen, and all over the auditorium, men stand up and make their way out. Bond takes photos with his phone, intercepts the intruder, and takes him out with a fist and a knee before heading back downstairs. The speaker is Mr. White, and on stage, the dungeon lid is slammed. Upstairs, Greene clears out of his box as Bond emerges near the side of the stage, removes his earpiece, and walks out just yards away from where White is sitting.",
    "221": "As Pappy brushes by them, Junior wheedles, and Pappy slaps at the young man with his hat and waves it at the radio building as singers in faux hillbilly outfits with various musical instrument cases get out of the second car. Tommy sits in the background, playing and singing a slow blues while the three convicts, holding coffee cups, gaze into the fire. He stretches out, and Pete swishes his coffee as he stares into the blaze, giving his coffee a thoughtful swish and murmuring. The three men tense up as Pete shovels dirt onto the fire and Delmar and Everett scramble to peek over a low ridge. Their point-of-view shows a lone barn with their car parked to one side surrounded by various police vehicles that have pulled up facing the barn. Armed men, their backs to us, train guns on it, some taking cover on the near side of their parked cars. The man with the bullhorn continues, directing his comments at the distant barn, while the three convicts notice the sheriff who once again stands impassively next to the man with the bullhorn, holding a leash against which a bloodhound strains. The three men shuffle down the dusty road, losing their drift as all three turn, reacting to the sound of an approaching speeding car which comes into view cornering on two wheels. It crashes back onto all four, and as it speeds along, dollar bills snap and flutter out its windows. The car roars up to the three men as Delmar waggles a hopeful thumb and it screeches to a halt. The driver, a young man in a sharp suit with a round, babylike face, leans over to call through the passenger window as Delmar plucks a fluttering dollar bill out of the air, looks at it wonderingly, holds it stretched between two hands, brings the two sides together, then gives it an appraising pop. Like a child gazing at soap bubbles, Delmar looks around at the wafting currency and yanks another fluttering bill out of the air. The three men climb in, the car squeals out, and the driver shoots a glance up to the rearview mirror as the sirens grow louder, then gropes inside his coat. The man stops withdrawing the gun and appraises his passengers as Delmar reacts to the paper currency fluttering inside the car. He opens his door, steps onto the running board, giving Everett a casual gesture, and Everett slides over, startled. George Nelson, now fully outside and facing the pursuit vehicles, has one hand clamped on the car roof and waves to Delmar with the other while sending a spray of bullets back at the pursuit car. Nelson fires wildly as the pursuit cars gain on him, returning fire.",
    "530": "He leans over and kisses her. Mickey, his hands in his pockets, walks along the sidewalk, one person among many other pedestrians. He pulls his coat tighter around him as he walks. He glances inside and sees Holly, her jacket flung over her shoulders, looking at some records. Mickey walks through the revolving doors of Tower Records, up a few stairs to the selling floor proper, and stops right in front of Holly. Holly chuckles and turns to look at more records. She walks down the aisle, occasionally glancing at the bins of records. Mickey walks beside her. Mickey walks back onscreen to Holly. The two of them are partially obscured by a large white Jazz sign imprinted with a large red circle as they continue their conversation. Mickey pulls out a record and looks at it. Holly looks hopefully at Mickey. Holly laughs, embarrassed, as Mickey puts the record he's been looking at back in the bin. Holly chuckles, looking off for a moment. There is a brief pause and the movie cuts to the screen showing a chaise in Mickey's apartment; an ashtray on a stand sits nearby. The camera moves down the chaise, past several piles of books, to Mickey's coffee table. He sits, picking at his fingers and listening, on the edge of the table in front of Holly, who is sitting cross-legged on the floor, propped up with a pillow, reading her script aloud. Holly closes the script and looks up at Mickey. Mickey smiles and shrugs, not knowing what to say. Holly, thrilled with Mickey's overwhelming response, stands up, her hand on her head. Unable to contain herself, she begins to walk up and down the room, holding her script. The camera follows her; Mickey is now offscreen. Trees line the sidewalk. Holly and Mickey emerge from the door and walk up the street, revealing a whole row of similar apartment buildings. They pass a few other people as they walk. The film then moves to the outside of a charming glass and stained wood café. Through the window, Holly and Mickey can be seen having lunch. Holly is talking animatedly; Mickey takes a sip of coffee. Some people pass by. Next, the film cuts to an almost isolated path in Central Park, complete with old-fashioned streetlamps and scattered leaves. Holly and Mickey stroll into view, deep in conversation. The film abruptly cuts to Mickey's flashback, a visual counterpoint to the story he is telling Holly. A close-up of a nervous, perspiring, and panting Mickey alone in his apartment appears on the screen as his voice is heard. Mickey raises the barrel of a rifle to his forehead. He shuts his eyes tightly. The camera moves past the desperate Mickey to a mirror on the wall behind him.",
    "239": "He stops, seeing Szpilman, and Szpilman shrugs. Jehuda loves this too, but his laugh makes him cough appallingly. The family sits around the small table as Mother comes with a saucepan of soup and starts to serve. He laughs, and the others look at him. The family rushes to the windows as a Gestapo vehicle enters the street and screeches to a halt. Helmeted, jackbooted SS men, led by an NCO, pour out of the vehicle. The Szpilmans gather at their open window to watch, and Regina turns off the lights before joining them; they are all terrified. From the POV of the Szpilman apartment, they see the building opposite. The SS men are pouring into the building opposite, and the sound of jackboots on stairs is heard. Lights go on floor by floor. In an apartment directly opposite, a businessman, his wife, three young people, and an old man in a wheelchair sit at their dining table. The SS men burst in, machine pistols at the ready. The family is frozen with horror and remains seated as the NCO scans their faces. The family rises to their feet fast, except for the old man in the wheelchair. The NCO bears down on him, and the old man in the wheelchair grips the arms of the chair, trying desperately to stand, but he can't. Without warning, the SS men seize the chair with the old man in it, carry him out onto the balcony. Mother screams, Father shrinks back, Halina comforts him, and Regina comforts Mother. From Szpilman's and Henryk's POV, they see the apartment opposite where the SS men throw the old man in his wheelchair over the balcony. He seems to hang in the air for a second, then drops out of the chair and out of sight, followed by a terrible thud as his body hits the pavement and a clatter as the wheelchair follows him. Mother is sobbing, and the others are still horrified. Then, there's the sound of shots, slamming doors, screams, and shouts. From their POV, from a second window, they see the building opposite and the street where the SS men are herding a couple of dozen prisoners from the building opposite. People are watching from the windows but trying not to be seen. The headlights of the SS vehicle are switched on, and the SS men are forcing their prisoners to stand in the beam. The prisoners start to run, and the SS men open fire with a machine gun mounted on the vehicle. People in the building opposite begin to scream. The prisoners are being shot down, lifted into the air by the bullets, turning somersaults, and falling dead. One man escapes by running back in the opposite direction, out of the beam of light, and is lost to sight for a moment. The escaping man, a silhouette out of the light, runs with all his strength, putting distance between himself and the SS.",
    "1158": "He turns to go, and Snape turns back and raises his eyebrows. With determination, Umbridge raises her wand in the Forbidden Forest. Harry catches up with Hermione as the frayed end of Gwarp's rope lies on the ground. Umbridge is dirty and disheveled when shadowy creatures appear amongst the trees. Umbridge steps back nervously and wags a finger. They have bows and arrows, and she deflects an arrow. She points her wand, and a centaur falls, a strangling rope around its throat, as it writhes and thrashes. Hermione tries to release it, but Umbridge is lifted into the air by Gwarp. The centaurs charge, firing arrows, and pierced by arrows, Gwarp drops Umbridge. The centaurs grab her, and she is carried off. They run back through the forest towards Hogwarts, where Neville, Luna, Ginny, and Ron run to meet them. Harry faces his friends, and they, along with Hermione, Neville, Luna, Ginny, and Ron, soar above the pine forest astride the leathery back of a thestral. Harry holds on tightly and looks around at his companions, and flying close behind, Luna gives him a happy smile. The thestrals fly through the stormy night buffeted by strong winds, and at last, the familiar lights of Canary Wharf and the winding River Thames appear below them. They run through the deserted Ministry of Magic towards a long corridor lined with shiny black tiles. Harry moves forward cautiously, and the others follow him along the black corridor towards the blue door at the far end. Inside is a shadowy storeroom full of high, wooden shelves, and they hold up their lighted wands. Standing on the numbered shelves are thousands of cloudy glass spheres as the door behind them slides away. The rows of glass spheres fill the shelves, which stand close together and extend upwards high above their heads. By the light of his wand, Harry searches the long, dark passages between the shelves and stops to shine his wand down onto the empty floor. He turns to his friends, as Neville is reading a label on a shelf beneath one of the spheres. As Harry walks towards it, the sphere starts to glow, illuminating the swirling mist inside it, and Harry reaches out and lifts it down. Harry steps in front of his friends, and they move closer together as a masked Death Eater approaches slowly along the passage. Lucius Malfoy unmasks, and Harry holds Neville back as dark figures approach down the passageways. The masked figures draw closer, and the friends run for it, but Lucius appears in front of them, so they turn back. Luna is knocked down, but she raises her wand, and her attacker vanishes. Neville stuns a Death Eater, and Luna pulls him away as more Death Eaters appear to block the passages. Pursued, Hermione flicks her wand, and glass spheres smash down onto their pursuers.",
    "785": "Jane is accosted by a smartly dressed older lady, leaving her puzzled and unsure of what she just heard. Having downed Casey's drink, Jane heads for Tess and George, staring challengingly at Tess and stuffing a whole sausage roll into her mouth at once. Tess looks worried as Jane strides off, then turns and grins at her, but her face freezes as Jane looks her in the eye and picks up a folder from the table behind her, while Casey looks bored. Tess smiles at George, and cute baby pictures of the couple fill the screen, showing young George petting a goat, Tess dangling a cat by its hind legs, George in academic robes, cheerleader Tess flirting with footballers, George helping at a soup kitchen, bikini-wearing Tess getting soaked at a car wash, him at the United Nations, her in Europe with two guys, and George helping with an animal charity. Tess tucks into a helping of ribs, and George looks unhappy as slides show him with his proud parents, then Tess in a fight, grimacing at a baby, and being afraid of George's dog. Behind the now not-so-happy couple, Casey gets to her feet, and Jane looks miserable. Tess runs up, and Jane opens her mouth, but no sound comes out. She stands awkwardly, biting her lip, her eyes brimming with tears, as Casey feels her friend's pain while Jane hurries out of the restaurant. Kevin, lurking in the background, follows her out, and she looks at him with wide, tear-filled eyes. He waits for a reaction, turns to walk away, then stops and comes back again. He holds up a PDA phone with a ribbon on it, places it in her hand, gives her a lingering look, then walks away. Jane watches him go with a sad half smile, looks down at the gift in her hand, and chokes back more tears. She arrives back at her apartment, places her bag and keys on the hall table, and idly toys with a flower in one of the many vases occupying every available surface. Kevin is at his desk, staring gloomily into space as Maureen walks up, and he gives a rueful smile and sinks back thoughtfully into his chair. Jane is at her father's store, where Tess freezes upon noticing her. Jane can't meet Tess's furious gaze and is baffled, sitting with her shoulders hunched on the store counter, staring dejectedly at the floor. Back at her apartment, she is idly brushing her teeth when she wanders out of the bathroom and catches sight of the closet full of dresses. She throws open the closet, starts flinging the dresses out into the hall, and soon stuffs the last dress into one of several black plastic bean bags.",
    "863": "He lies on top of Fantine, and her lips tremble. Once finished, he gets off her and saunters away, leaving her on her back. She lies motionless, her head on a pillow. Her rouged face is grim and somber. Fantine looks miserable. She breathes quickly and swallows. Her shoulders heave. She sits up. Her once clear skin is blotchy and smeared with dirt. She strokes her short cropped hair. Her cheeks streaked with tears, Fantine glances behind her. Her expression is solemn. Night in the slum. A punter to a pimp. A smartly-dressed man takes off his hat and grabs Fantine's dress. He presses himself on her. She scratches his face. He pushes her away as Javert approaches. Fantine recognizes Valjean and moves away. She turns her back to him. She breathes rapidly. He recoils as she spits in his face. Javert raises a hand to hold back one of his men. He picks her up in his arms. Javert watches them go. Javert is handed a letter. Standing outside in the snow, Javert opens the letter and reads it. He glances up and screws up the letter. He stands in front of Valjean. His brow furrowed, Valjean gets to his feet. Valjean sits back down at his desk. Javert looks puzzled, then bows curtly and takes his leave. Valjean watches him go, then leans on his desk. In church, he kneels at an altar. He packs money and papers into a case. He takes a carriage to court. They stare at him as the court usher escorts him out. At the hospital, a nurse tends to Fantine, who lies on her back. The nurse dabs her semiconscious patient's forehead with a cloth, then rises and walks out of the room. Valjean enters. An image of the nine-year-old blonde girl. The image has vanished. Fantine becomes still, and her head lulls to one side. Valjean closes her lifeless eyes. He bends forward and kisses her on the temple. Javert draws his sword. Having fended Javert off with a baton torn from the wall, Valjean is disarmed. He but turns, rushes out of the door, and dives into the river below. Javert runs out, but there's no sign of Valjean. Fantine lies at peace in the hospital bed. Cosette, young and grubby, is at the inn. She looks out enviously at children playing in the snow. Cosette glares. A pretty little girl. At the inn, Thenardier hauls himself to his feet and wanders past his subtle clientele. He gives a staggering bloke a drink. A silver-haired gent. He takes the man's reading glasses. His wife messes a soldier's jacket. She gazes at the handsome man. Outside along on a crate by a mule.",
    "925": "The gantry turns, moving Bond away from the gun and pulling Mitchell off the scaffold. The rogue agent lands on a scaffold tower, as Bond pulls at the rope around his leg. He climbs for a gun on the scaffold while Bond tries to reach the one on the ground. Both scoop up the weapons, and Bond fires. The crowds are dispersing in the Town Square as a police car makes its way down a crowded street. Covered in dust, Bond strides through the crowds towards the wooden gate in the tunnel. Blood stains the cellar floor, but the prisoner, Mr. White, is gone. Bond stares dispassionately at the scene. It's raining when a black Range Rover arrives at a high-rise block of flats. M stands looking out from one of the balconies. Bond emerges from the Range Rover and enters through the building's glass door. Ignoring a stolid guard, Bond enters a flat, passes masked forensics officers, and joins M on the balcony. The boffin opens a door for M. Bond's eyes narrow as he is now wearing shades in the back of a taxi, driving down a dusty street. He gets out of the taxi opposite the faded sign and entrance to the Hotel Dessalines. In a dark polo shirt and light trousers, he enters the building and makes his way through the drab-tiled lobby, strung with washing lines. He moves down plain concrete corridors, arrives at a door, and positions himself to one side of it. He uses a tool to pick the lock and enters cautiously, peering around the door into the plainly furnished, empty living room. Closing the door behind him, he walks into the apartment when a switch-blade flicks open. A man leaps through glass doors, swinging the blade wildly. Bond slams him through the glass into the bedroom. The man recovers and swings again, but Bond attacks with the phone. He goes down and finds a pair of scissors. Bond slams him into a wall, gets head-butted, then hits him with a book. He parries the knife blows and grabs the guy's knife hand in a finger-breaking hold. They go through a window out onto a balcony. Bond has him by the throat and drives the scissors into the guy's neck and thigh. Bond's completely unmoved as the guy rolls his eyes in agony, then dies, blood pooling beneath his head. He goes to search the rooms, taking a shirt from a wardrobe and ripping it to make a bandage for a cut on his arm. He shrugs on a shirt and wipes blood from his nose. Barely glancing at the body, he grabs the door keys and heads downstairs. He turns to the young black woman at reception with a grim demeanor.",
    "385": "They seem very unhappy. The woman speaks to Dieter in German. She is apparently braless, and is teutonically pale with birthmarks on her face and arms. Notable is her camera-side leg, which ends in a bandage-swaddled foot. Dried rust-colored blood stains the tip of the bandage. Walter's eyes are on the road as he listens, driving, to the Dude, whose speech is occasionally punctuated by yaps from the back seat. He is looking off as the car slows. The Dude looks where Walter is looking. Walter's car pulls up the drive into the foreground and he and the Dude get out. Both are gaping off at the front lawn. BANG--the Dude and Walter push through the double doors into. His wheelchair hums as he spins it around. He is crossing to Lebowski. Walter reaches around from behind and hoists the big Lebowski out of the wheelchair by his armpits. He shoves the big Lebowski forward and he crumples to the floor, weeping. The Dude and Walter look. The dog yaps. Quintana is bellowing from the lip of the lane, and is restrained by O'Brien. Walter looks at him innocently. He makes hip-grinding coital motions as O'Brien leads him away. Walter, his head cocked, and the Dude, peeking over his shades, watch him go. Donny, Walter, and the Dude emerge from the alley, each holding his leatherette ball satchel. The men in black, stunned, confer amongst themselves in German. The Germans stop conferring. Walter ignores the Dude, addresses the Germans. The Germans confer again, in German. Donny is visibly frightened. Walter's eyes, burning with hatred, are locked on Dieter's. The Dude is digging into his pocket. Louder, to the Germans, as he looks in his wallet. With a ring of steel, Dieter produces a glinting saber. He hurls his leather satchel. The bowling ball thuds into his chest and lifts him off his feet. In a rage, Dieter charges. Watching Dieter's charge, is caught off-guard. Dieter drops it. He twists away as Dieter reaches him; grabs Dieter's head in both hands; draws Dieter's head up to his mouth, which closes on Dieter's ear. He rushes Franz but draws up short as Franz sends out karate kicks, his leather pants squeaking and popping. His jaw is still clamped on Dieter's ear. Awkwardly circling, evading Franz's kicks. Still worrying the ear. With a tearing sound, his head and Dieter's separate. Growling as Dieter screams, he worries his ear, waggling his head with his jaws clamped. Franz gives a loud cry with each kick; the Dude leans back, throwing his arms up, evading the kicks. The Dude, also panting, rises and trots over. Donny gasps for air. The Dude runs into the lanes. Walter lays a reassuring hand on Donny's shoulder.",
    "964": "Harry gives a shrug of his head, as David's lips part, his gaze thoughtful. The young politician blinks his deep-set eyes and shifts his heartbroken gaze, his expression wistful, as he stares across the warehouse. David presses his lips together. Later, they follow a covered outdoor walkway and stop at a door, where Harry takes hold of a side door's knob. Passing through the door, they enter a spacious white gallery with paintings on the walls. The human obeys, agog. In an upper gallery, a partial dinosaur skeleton hangs from the ceiling. Peter, on an upper level overlooking the dinosaur, Harry leads David to another door, and David puts his hand on the agent's shoulder. Harry leads him into a service tunnel with pipework along the walls, and David obeys, gawking at the jarring change in location, and follows his guide down the damp corridor. They follow an enormous insulated pipe then descend a short flight of steps, as Harry crosses the floor and climbs a steep flight of steps to a rust-eaten door. Turning the knob counterclockwise, he opens it. They glimpse a stoic figure and a fedora passing by as he shuts the door behind him, and David gazes after him. Now Elise arrives at the Cedar Lake Dance Studio and faces a receptionist. Harry returns to the pumping station with a briefcase and leads David to a service junction where a cinderblock worktable awaits them. He takes two ledgers from the briefcase, handing one to David. As they confer, we watch Elise dance. Elsie drops warily onto her buttocks and lies down, resting her hands on her abdomen. Harry smiles to himself and sets his plan book down, while David stares at him. Pursing his lips, he shifts his gaze and gives a stoic nod. His lips pressed tight, Harry takes a deep breath and nods, as David regards impensively. Elise steps from the dance studio into the night air and makes her way down the sidewalk. At dawn, a thick blanket of lead gray clouds passes over the city. As we peer out the side of the Adjustment Bureau high rise, raindrops plummet at us, and rain soaks Harry's bench in Madison Square Park. Now at the courthouse, Adrian faces a petite clerk. Clad in a flowing black halter dress, Elise arrives with a friend and stares blankly. In the pumping station, Harry and David reach a spiral staircase. Harry smiles and gives David his fedora. Under the officer's kind gaze, David sets the fedora on his head and takes a controlled breath. As he climbs the spiral stairway, Harry gazes after him. David bursts out a door with a brief stumble and dashes down a rainy alleyway, sprinting across a busy street where cars narrowly avoid hitting him.",
    "596": "Waves crash against the pinnacle and the imposing coastline in front of them, the same craggy cliff as on Tom Riddle's postcard, with dark clouds scattered behind them, spray and spume washed over them. Dumbledore's hair and beard are buffeted by the strong wind, but his eyes are affixed on an inverted v-shaped fissure in the cliff face as Harry and Dumbledore are inside a rocky cavern. Dumbledore sharpens a knife against a rock and pierces his right hand with it. Harry looks at the wound as Dumbledore smears his bloodied hand across the rock face, which starts to crumble, and he steps back beside Harry and they both watch. Using their wands as torches, they enter a previously-hidden tunnel and approach a lake, looking out across the water with their wands reflected in the dark surface. Dumbledore sends a ball of light across the lake; it rises and falls over the surface of the water, then flares up, illuminating a tiny island in the distance. Dumbledore sets a foot on a half-submerged crystalline rock and stretches out his left hand over the water as the lake at his feet bubbles and churns. Something moves amidst the frothing waters, and a length of chain leaps up into Dumbledore's hands. He passes the end of the chain to Harry, who starts to pull on it as they watch the chain lift something out of the water, revealing the carved prow of a small boat rising in front of them. Harry tugs with greater vigor, hauling the boat towards them, and the boat slowly carries them across the still water towards the island. Reaching it, they scramble out onto the translucent rock where a dip in a rock pedestal forms a crystal basin filled with liquid. Dumbledore passes his hand over the shimmering surface, looks up with a start, uses a large shell as a cup, fills it with the liquid, and drinks. His eyes closed, he drains the shell, then opens his eyes and shudders, stepping back from the basin and sitting down with difficulty, covering his ear with his blackened right hand. Harry picks up the shell, steps over to the basin, scoops up more liquid, returns to Dumbledore, and helps him drink, filling the shell again, returning again and again, forcing the liquid into Dumbledore's mouth until the basin is almost empty. Dumbledore, his eyes half closed, presses his lips together, then reluctantly opens his mouth. He opens his mouth, Harry steps back, and Dumbledore raises his head and opens his eyes wide while Harry still holds the empty shell. Dumbledore smacks his lips, and Harry returns to the basin, picking up a locket and chain lying at the bottom, as he raises his wand.",
    "541": "By now, half the boat has been chopped up into matchwood, and the blades are getting closer; the wind of the blades is on their necks. Indy grabs Kazim just in time and jumps into the motorboat driven by Elsa, which gets alongside in the nick of time. Kazim pulls back his shirt to reveal a birthmark, or is it a tattoo? Whatever it is, it's a cruciform sword, a Christian cross that tapers down like the blades of a broadsword. The boat is close to the edge of the canal as Kazim steps ashore and walks away. Close on the water-soaked paper impression: the rubbing taken from the shield of the Grail Knight. Brody is giving it careful study while he dabs the lump on the back of his head with an ice pack. Indy, wearing a bathrobe, leans over to study the impression. Brody lowers the ice pack from his head and looks at Indy, picks up the Grail Diary which covers two pages of the Diary, and Brody's finger moves across it. Indy closes the Grail Diary and puts it into the pocket of his robe, opens the door, and finds his bedroom has been ransacked, with the mattress on the floor, the drawers turned out. Indy approaches another door (Elsa's bedroom) and knocks. He goes in and finds that Elsa's bedroom is in a similar ransacked state to his own. He is worried for her, knocks and calls out, steps into the room, and knocks upon the bathroom door. He opens the bathroom door, peering inside, where Elsa is standing before a mirror, wearing a silk bathrobe. She gasps, startled, as Indy enters, and he retreats back into her bedroom as she reaches up to turn off a record player sitting on a ledge above the bathtub. Elsa joins Indy, waiting in the ransacked room, looking around in shock. She looks to Indy, who pulls the Grail Diary from his pocket. She comes closer to him, stomps her foot angrily, and starts to walk away, but Indy grabs her. He pulls her to him and kisses her. Now Elsa reaches for Indy and kisses him, and he embraces her, and Elsa begins to nibble at his ear. Indy smiles slyly as they fall to the bed. A gondolier sings as he steers his gondola carrying two passengers past Indy's window. Indy lies on top of Elsa, kissing her. He stops for a moment as he hears the gondolier singing. Elsa reaches up and pulls him back down to her. A Mercedes-Benz glides through the sharp mountain curves, superimposed over a map that charts their course from Venice across Austria toward Salzburg as storm clouds darken the skies.",
    "953": "At 12:02 PM, Joe sits in his bedroom painting a model monster. Joe and his friends have gathered on a grassy bank, and the yellow Coupe that had pulled up outside the house for the wake draws up, driven by a teenage blonde girl, Alice. Jack looks slightly disoriented by Joe's reply and considers how to respond, while Joe gives Jack a cool, unconvinced look before returning his attention to the pamphlet featuring pictures of boys having a fantastic time playing baseball. Jack notices Joe holding a locket in his left hand. Alice turns away moodily and shakes her head, glaring at him and considering. Joe grins and offers Alice a candy, delighted when she takes it. She glances at him in the rearview mirror, causing his smile to slip. The car pulls up outside an isolated railway station, and the kids get out. Joe does Alice's makeup, gently sponging it on. She ties her hair back from her face, and Joe continues applying the makeup. He stops and stares at her, uncertain of how to respond when she dabs makeup onto her eyelids. Cary's fireworks go off, and Alice's eyes fill with un-shed tears, spellbinding Joe with her performance. Playing the detective, Martin stares at Alice, who slips out of character, causing Martin to wipe a tear. Charles runs across the station platform and looks at an approaching train while the boys break into a panic and scramble. The camera is loaded and, as the train approaches, they prepare to film. Joe and Preston smile until Joe sees a pickup pull onto the tracks ahead of the train. The vehicles collide, knocking the camera over as the freight train barrels through the station and derails. Alice stares at it as the tracks careen through the station building, smashing it to matchwood. Electrical explosions go off around the station, sending trucks hurtling through the air. The kids flee through the debris as explosions mushroom around them, with more trucks and carriages colliding. A tanker is thrown through the air and explodes upon hitting the ground. Joe runs past the flaming debris, a piece of which is flung into the air, but he sees a warning sign on it before a massive explosion erupts, throwing him to the ground. He looks up, gets to his feet, and looks at a carriage lying on its side, which is then racked by a series of explosions. Joe clasps the locket tightly in his left hand as he watches an explosion toss a chunk of the carriage high into the air.",
    "975": "Colored buttons fall into a large heap, forming the Warner Brothers' shield, and more buttons continue to fall. A gaunt, ashen-faced, old woman's sunken eyes flicker open wearily, then close. The woman, Daisy, lies in a hospital bed wearing a tight turban as 30-something Caroline goes to her bedside and clasps her hand. Daisy was scratching her chest, and a nurse rounds the bed to Daisy's IV drip, adjusting it as Daisy closes her eyes again. Dark-haired Caroline looks away pensively, then gently takes Daisy's hand in her own, hugs her, sits up, and strokes her mother's arm. Daisy's eyes open slightly and her brow furrows. A flashback reveals an enormous station with a grand colonnade and a watch smith's where Caroline listens intently. The watch smith wears dark glasses, is bald, and has a mustache. They see their son off at the station as Mrs. Gateau opens a letter at the dining table, looks across at her husband, who wipes his mouth and leaves the table. They stand on a platform as uniformed men unload a line of coffins from a steam train and then leave the grave. He fits a large brass cog as a crowd of spectators gathers on the spacious concourse of the train station, staring expectantly at Mr. Gateau, who stands atop a raised, wooden scaffold platform and unveils a huge, embossed, brass, wall-mounted clock with its long second hand starting to turn backwards. In reverse action, a fallen soldier stands and runs backward from an explosion as bespectacled President Roosevelt removes his trilby, watching soldiers run backward over mud. Their son climbs down from the train on which he departed as it reverses into the station while, on the concourse, the President hangs his head and then looks up again. Grainy footage shows Mr. Gateau rowing out to sea in a wooden boat. The nurse rises from her seat in the corner of the room and walks out past an empty neighboring bed, as pale Caroline stares off in thought, closes her eyes, goes to the sofa, and uncovers Daisy's suitcase, revealing a leather-bound book. Caroline sits with a book that contains a black-and-white wedding photo. Fireworks illuminate the streets filled with revelers waving American flags as 40-something Thomas Button sprints through the crowd and makes a beeline for a house on the corner, his trilby blowing off as he races to the front steps and lets himself in. A maid in the hallway closes the door as Thomas hurries to an upstairs bedroom to find his wife lying in a large bed under blood-stained sheets. Thomas removes his coat as a doctor approaches him, then turns to see a priest. Thomas strides to his wife's bedside and nods as the priest gives the last rites, and Thomas walks cautiously towards the baby's cot.",
    "436": "The attendant holds out a towel, and Don wipes his hands. He looks at Don’s lapel, mystified. Don tips the attendant with a fifty-cent piece. The attendant doesn’t get the joke but chuckles automatically and opens the door into the bar. Don walks from the washroom, slowly toward his table. Suddenly he stops and looks around. They are staring at Don. Near the little piano stand Don’s waiter, the head waiter, the piano player, and the lovers. In fact, he’s suddenly aware that he is the focus of every eye in the room. M. M.'s escort is right at him, grabbing him by the coat. He takes the bag out from under his coat and hands it to the lady. M. M.'s escort snatches it from his hand. Don holds out the bill and fishes what money he has left from his pocket. The waiter snaps it up. By this time, they’ve got Don to the door. The headwaiter gets Don’s hat from the checkroom girl’s hand, puts it on Don’s head, and the bouncer pulls him through the door. The bouncer, dragging Don from Harry's and Joe's, gives him one last shove down the street. Don comes to a stop and leans heavily against an iron railing, wiping his face with his hand. He straightens his hat, looks back. The doorman and the taxi drivers are staring after him. Don turns, straightens himself as best he can, and starts for home, shame weighing down every limb. There is a line of waiting taxis along the brilliantly lighted nightclub street. It is meanly lighted by the wall brackets. The newspaper, the bottle of milk, and Helen’s note are all as they were. Don drags himself up the last few steps, unlocks the door, and goes in, leaving the paper, bottle, and note untouched. Don has entered. Automatically he switches on the light in the corridor. In a stupor of shame and misery, he stumbles over to the living room couch, flings himself down on it, and lies covering his face with his arms. After a time, he brushes the tears from his eyes with his sleeve and, as he does so, catches sight of something which rivets his attention and brings a half-crazed smile to his lips. On the ceiling is the shadow of the bottle which he hid in the light fixture. With new strength, Don gets to his feet, nervous laughter shaking him. He pulls the coffee table under the light fixture, puts the chair on it, climbs up, and retrieves his bottle. He climbs down again, opening the bottle fiercely. Don opens his eyes slowly. Don gets up, steadying himself on the bedpost and holding the door frame, he slowly moves out of the bedroom.",
    "1207": "By its red glow, the mercenaries check their watches en masse. Lewis pulls a hood over his head. The team, including Rambo, make ready. His head covered by a black hat, School Boy stealthily climbs the wooden steps of the camp watch tower. He pulls out a vicious-looking knife with a serrated blade from a sheath. A guard in a rain poncho smokes a cigarette and sees the headlamps of the truck in the distance. He walks into the rain-soaked road as the truck approaches the camp. BN is at the wheel, dressed as a soldier. School Boy steals onto the watch tower platform where a lookout sits in a chair, oblivious to his presence. On the tower, School Boy clamps a hand over the guard's mouth and plunges the serrated blade into the soldier. He rests his rifle on the timbers of the watch tower. In the truck, Rambo's eye-line and bandana are reflected in BN's driving mirror. BN wears a frown of concentration as the camp nears the camp guard post. The guard waves them through, a cigarette ember glowing between his fingers. On the tower, School Boy checks his watch, nine minutes to two. In the still-moving truck, Rambo signals to Reese. Reese jumps off the truck, rolls, and hides. En-Joo jumps off, rounds the corner of a hut with his weapon raised, and takes cover. Rambo clamps Lewis on the shoulder and the hooded man jumps off, taking cover between the two huts. The troops enjoy the exotic dance show. Diaz leaps from the truck and rolls uncomfortably. As the truck passes over a low wooden bridge above a stream, Rambo jumps off, rolls in the mud, and takes position at the side of a hut. He looks through the wooden slats at the hut wall. A figure is inscribing a tattoo on another's back with black ink. Rambo hurries away. At the dance show, some of the watching soldiers rock drunkenly back and forth in time with the music. BN brings the truck to a halt and gets out of the cab. He pauses near the truck's bonnet. The dancing women are peasants. Their eyes are dull and uninterested. En-Joo nears a hut and peers inside. Someone sits in front of a nude female, his hands on her waist. En-Joo moves on. Reese approaches a hut and checks inside in the same way. Rambo checks the luminous dial of his analog watch, seven minutes to two. A man hangs crucified on a timber frame. Above him, the caged volunteers are blindfolded. One of the prisoners hears his approach. Pigs are tearing flesh from the crucified man's leg. Rambo draws his homemade machete and runs up to the cage.",
    "681": "The gum-chewing, bored-looking receptionist looks at the clock: three minutes past two. His face unflinching, Peter unties the two fasteners keeping the pizzas together, one after the other. He glances up at the receptionist, then walks back towards the janitor's cupboard he emerged from. The receptionist eyes Peter suspiciously as he turns to the elevators he just walked past. He presses a button, the doors open, and he steps into an elevator. He presses another button, gives the receptionist a friendly smile and a wave, and the doors close. Back at Joe's Pizza, with Mister Aziz, Mister Aziz stares at the eager, bright-eyed youth, steps up to him, and reaches for Peter's helmet. He rips the Joe's Pizza sticker from it. Later, at the Bugle, he hands over the chitty, and Miss Brant chucks Peter's chin and strolls away. Peter smiles self-consciously. The opposing columnated University building, pathways in front of it, Peter runs through the campus and collides with a student. He bends to pick up his book. One student stands on his books, the bags of others hit Peter. He rises as Doctor Connors takes a few paces past Peter, stops, then turns. The brow of the thin-faced Doctor Connors furrows as he walks away, the right sleeve of his coat is empty. Night, Peter on his moped, moves into the garden of a wooden, suburban hedge, he enters the house, takes off his helmet, satchel and jacket, and stares at Harry Osborn. Harry watches MJ go. Harry frowns at Peter, who stares back flatly. When Peter doesn't respond, Harry rises and walks away, stands, hands on hips, and looks at a framed photograph of his father with Peter. Peter puts his hand on Harry's shoulder. The lights go out, and Peter blows out the candles on his birthday cake. Later that night, Aunt May is asleep at the table, letters and papers by her. He walks around the table and takes hold of his aunt's hand. Aunt May reaches into her purse. Tears well in Peter's eyes. Aunt May kisses Peter on the cheek and walks away. Peter struggles to fight back the tears, takes the litter out into the backyard in a plastic bin bag, and strides to the bottom of the garden, not noticing MJ sitting on the steps of the house next door. MJ walks towards him. Peter gazes at her. She moves closer to him, leaning over the fence. He shakes his head, his eyes flitting from hers to her mouth. The two of them stand as if transfixed. Peter starts to speak. MJ stares at him expectantly. Again, he shakes his head and lowers his eyes. She keeps hers fixed on him. He looks up again and tries to smile.",
    "807": "The cars drive around the pair and stop, creating a cloud of dust that hangs in the air. Marwan, Hani, and the rest of the men get out of their cars, and Hani gestures for Marwan to open the door for Ferris to get out. Ferris watches Hani walk up to the kneeling figure and take off the hood, then dial a cell phone. Karami takes the phone, and Hani goes to Ferris. Karami hangs up, and Hani takes the phone back while Karami stares up at him. Karami stands, and Hani kisses his cheeks. One of the men gives Karami a bicycle, and he leaves. Hani strolls over to Ferris, who nods thoughtfully. Later, Ferris, walking back to his apartment, is on the phone and sees someone in his apartment. Two SUVs drive through gates and stop in front of the Jordanian General Intelligence Directorate, where Ferris and Hoffman get out of the vehicles and head along corridors to join Hani in the meeting room. Hoffman smiles tightly, sits, and puts a photograph on the table, staring at Hani, who glances at Ferris. In the SUV, Hoffman smokes a fat cigar and has a drink with Ferris on the balcony of his apartment, while kids play football on the patch of ground in front of the safe house. Skip stands amidst the market as Karami, dressed in dark trousers, a pale cream shirt, waistcoat, and skullcap, emerges from a doorway and walks through the market. Seeing him, Skip talks into an earpiece. Wearing shades, Karami walks purposefully through the marketplace with Skip following him. Karami takes off his shades and reads a newspaper as he walks down a narrow street with Skip on his tail. Further down the street, a van is reversing. Karami slows up, glances down at his paper, and looks round at Skip, who throws out his hands. Karami darts between the van and a building, running down side streets as the van blocks Skip's way. Two men jump out, and Skip bangs on the door before the van moves forward. Skip squeezes through the gap and runs down the street, but Karami is gone. Ferris sits on the bed in a treatment room at the health clinic when Aisha the nurse walks in, jabs a needle in his stomach, and walks out. He follows her, passing densely packed concrete buildings with ramshackle flat roofs. Hordes of people swarm on the street, where traders sell produce from barrows. Ferris walks along the street with Aisha, who wears a headscarf, and they are photographed. At a clinic, Ferris sits in a waiting room with a group of women and children; some women look at him curiously and smile. Emerging from her room, Aisha smiles at Ferris.",
    "842": "The redhead grabs Sandy's suitcase and unzips it, discovering some clothes and a toiletry bag. Outside, a blue and yellow taxi arrives, and Sandy exits the back holding the pink slip. A huge sweat stain runs down the front of his shirt as he pays the driver and eyes the house before proceeding in a stealthy jog along the side, with an even larger sweat stain covering his back. Looking around, he cautiously enters the back gate and, through a window, spots the redhead rummaging through his toiletries, aggressively rubbing his deodorant onto her armpits as he creeps into the room. He pulls out handcuffs, and she complies, but then she punches his throat. He grabs her leg, knocking her down, and she grabs and slaps his face. Standing, she backs him into the counter and throws him over a chair. As she bolts, Sandy hurls a small appliance and whacks her with a guitar. A bunch of IDs are scattered as two thugs stand at the door and a gunshot blasts off the door knob. Sandy and Diana bolt as the woman bursts in with her male partner wielding a short gun. Diana pierces two of their tires with a knife and hurries into Sandy's car. Sandy reverses over her mailbox and into the neighbor's yard, knocking over a sign as he cuffs their hands together. The female thug rips the knife from the tire as Sandy speeds off. She picks the lock, frees herself, and reaches into her shirt as Sandy pulls over. She hitchhikes, and Diana glares and bolts, but Sandy easily catches up to the overweight woman. Diana snatches his keys and runs, slowly running and flashing her middle finger. Sandy jogs in front of her as Diana stumbles to a stop, and he rolls his eyes and crosses his fingers. Diana stares in his eyes, then limps toward the car as Sandy follows her. Sandy retrieves the keys from the middle of the highway and hurries back to the car. In an auto garage, a muscular tattooed mechanic works as the female thug watches him nearby and lifts her phone. Meanwhile, an aging man sits in a jail cell, and Julian furrows his brow as the prisoner pays the guard. In Sandy's car, Diana, with her lips pursed, faces him with wide eyes and dances in her seat, while Sandy changes the station and glares as she mimes playing instruments. They speed over a bridge spanning a small river. Elsewhere, a roughneck man with weathered skin and a gray goatee approaches a van. In his brand new van, the aging man arrives at the strip mall, stops outside the salon, and peers inside. Entering, he finds a young brunette stylist sweeping the floor, and the stylist nods and smiles as he eyes the salon.",
    "1275": "The snake locks begin to move, and the heavy, circular, stone door of the Chamber of Secrets swings open. Meanwhile, the protective shield and the burning wooden ground stones at the Quidditch Pitch illuminate the dark hillside, as illusions continue to pound against the shield. Neville stands on a covered wooden bridge, looking out across the landscape, and he sees an army of Snatchers, led by Scabior, racing towards the school. Neville recoils as two Snatchers run ahead, hit the shield, and disintegrate, while Scabior steadies his men and stares at Neville, who is guarding the entrance up ahead. In the Chamber of Secrets, Ron approaches the skeleton of the Basilisk and wrenches a fang from its jaw. Hermione takes the two-handled gold cup from her bottomless bag, and Ron hands her the fang. He kneels down and places the golden cup on the ground between them. Hermione sinks to her knees, hesitating as she stares at the cup. Harry budges his way through students, as Ron raises his eyes to Hermione. She draws back her arm and plunges the fang into the cup. Voldemort roars as the cup spins across the floor, and Harry gasps and reels back as water bursts into the chamber, prompting Hermione and Ron to run from it. Immediately, the Dark Lord appears in the swelling torrent and breathes deeply, while gasping, Harry leans back against a pillar. Ron and Hermione, with the receding waters behind them, turn to each other and kiss hungrily, standing as if on a bridge with the waters on either side, before they break apart. On the outcrop, Voldemort, with Nagini coiled beside him, unleashes a powerful blast of light toward the shield from the Elder Wand. Professor McGonagall and Ginny stare upwards as parts of the shield start to burn. Remus reaches out to Nymphadora, and their fingers almost touch. Holding the Elder Wand, Voldemort suddenly recoils and looks down as energy crackles through the nut-nutted wand. He gazes at the smoldering shield, which now resembles a burning dome of flame. Harry seems to regain his strength and moves with determination through the fleeing students as the disintegrating shield fills the skies with burning debris. Scabior catches one of the flaming embers on the tip of his wand, open-mouthed, and scowls at Neville, who remains on guard on the wooden bridge. Scabior takes a very slow and tentative step forward, grins, and Neville backs away while the Snatchers race behind Scabior and make for the bridge. They haul fireballs at Neville, who dodges them, and a spell from Neville's wand ignites charges in the joints of the bridge supports, causing them to start to explode. As Scabior runs faster, the bridge collapses behind him while Ginny and the others watch as Neville sprints towards them, and a huge explosion rips the bridge apart.",
    "93": "His features are broad, friendly, Asian-American. A waitress meets them at the table. Again she glances about. He is sliding out of his side of the booth and easing in next to Marge. Marge clinks it. The reverse shows a disappearing waiter and the backs of many, many people sitting at tables between us and the very distant stage. Jose Feliciano, very small, performs on a spotlit stool. The acoustics are poor. Carl grimaces. Carl is humping the escort. The escort is grabbed and flung out of bed. Shep slaps him hard, forehand, backhand. He hauls him up. After hitting him several times, Shep yanks Carl's belt out of his dangling pants and strangles him with it. Carl gurgles. Shep knees Carl repeatedly, then dumps him onto the floor and starts whipping him with the buckle end of the belt. His face is deeply bruised and cut. Finally, through the phone, Jerry is at the kitchen phone. Through the door to the dining room we see Wade picking up an extension. The line goes dead. A door slams off-screen. Wade, briefcase in hand, gets into his Cadillac, slams the door and peels out. Thunk! - his first boot goes on. He mumbles to himself as he drives. He pulls out a gun and fires into Wade's gut. Jerry pulls to a halt next to Wade's idling Cadillac. Jerry approaches in the Cadillac. The wooden gate barring the exit has been broken away. The booth is empty. Jerry eases toward the street, looking over at the booth as he passes. Inside the booth we see the awkwardly angled leg of a prostrate body. The car pulls into the driveway. Jerry enters and sits on the foyer chair to take off his galoshes. In his car, now parked, one hand holding the rag pressed to his mangled jaw. He is staring down at something in the front seat next to him. It has money inside - a lot of money. Carl unfreezes, takes out one of the bank-wrapped wads and looks at it. Marge drives, gazing out at the road. She leans out of her open window and yells at the order panel. She sits in the lot, eating a breakfast sandwich. Jerry is at his desk using a blunt pencil to enter numbers onto a form. Beneath the form is a piece of carbon paper and beneath that another form copy, which Jerry periodically checks. The carbon-copy form shows thick smudgy, illegible entries. She starts to enter. Jerry looks up and freezes, mouth hanging open, brow knit with worry. But she is already sitting into the chair opposite with a sigh of relieved weight. There is a silent beat. He trails off into silence.",
    "1364": "Mike sighs, deciding to level with her, and just then, the waitress walks up. He stands up, and Abby looks out at the dance floor, seeing that even the worst dancers are great. Mike grabs her hand and leads her onto the dance floor, and they make their way onto the crowded dance floor. They give a longer kiss, and Mike starts out of the elevator, then returns, grabbing Abby, and suddenly, they're all over each other. In the midst of this, the elevators try to close, but their furious groping blocks it, until a shrill buzzing begins. They abruptly step apart, staring at each other, and Mike backs out of the elevator, looking shell-shocked as the doors close. Abby is flushed and stunned, then sinks down onto her bed, wearing the same expression. She leaps up, smooths her hair, checks her reflection, and goes to the door, opening it with a smile to find Colin standing there, bottle of red wine in hand. He walks in the room, holding up the wine, while Mike approaches Abby's door. Mike reels, trying to cover his shock as Abby appears behind Colin. He turns and goes, with Mike walking down the hall, freaked out and perturbed, as Abby runs to catch up with him. He keeps walking as she tries to keep up, then stops and looks at her. They hold eye contact for a very long moment before Mike looks away, shrugs, and walks off. Abby enters the room where Colin stands shirtless, and she takes the glass and drinks, and keeps drinking. Abby finishes the glass and looks at him, smiles, pleased, then he continues, but her smile fades. Abby looks at him, nodding, then she looks around, feeling hurt and stunned, but overcomes it with fierce and abiding hatred. Abby and Joy walk through the waiting area, which is filled with Mike Alexander replacement hopefuls of all different shapes and sizes, and Abby points at candidates while Joy makes notes on a clipboard, looking a little worried. Stuart sits in the control room next to Cliff as Jack Magnum does his intro, now standing in a balloon basket. Mike looks over to see live footage from the Balloon Fiesta on TV as Jack Magnum continues to alienate his audience. Jack Magnum is tackled and pushed out of the balloon basket, and after a moment, a frazzled Abby pops up in his place. Stuart and Cliff watch from the control room in shock, and Stuart picks up, then blanches. Abby stands in the basket, still nervous but flying on adrenaline, and Mike stares at Abby on TV for a second, then grabs his keys and races out as Jonah calls after him.",
    "752": "A high door swings open, and a caped figure stands in the entrance of a warehouse. He looks around as silver-grey light from the rows of small windows glows on strange objects. To his left, beyond a set of stairs, two looming shapes appear and become recognizable as the ends of two train carriages, slightly bent and twisted. The man walks to the nearer of the two, not badly damaged at the back. As he looks up at the length of it, however, he sees that the sides have been smashed open. The little remaining glass is cracked and shattered, and seats lean drunkenly, having been torn from their mountings, their upholstery charred and blackened. Light catches the man's face as he stares up at the wrecked carriage. He stands quite still, looking up, grim-faced, for a long time, ignoring drops of water falling from his hood. In the dark, a man is crouching on a force. He rises onto his knees. As his head comes up, light falls on the face of David, aged about 20. He looks around, and the light is coming from a burning car, upside down behind him. He staggers towards it, stumbling on his knees, crawling. A young woman lies in the burning car, unconscious. Audrey is lying very still. David grasps the edge of the car door with both hands and pulls. He bends down and checks the door catch, which doesn't move. Audrey's arm is hanging out of the window. David grabs the edge of the door again and heaves. Beyond him, flames rise up into the night sky. He rips the door from its hinges, bends down, and releases Audrey's seat belt. David drags Audrey from the car, cradles her in his arms, and lays her down gently some yards away. He looks over his shoulder and sees the lights of a pickup truck coming slowly around the bend. He waves frantically. When he looks back, Audrey's eyes are open. He holds her head, tenderly. The truck driver runs to them. David looks into the man's concerned face, and back at Audrey. Very slowly, he lifts his head, the flames still flickering behind him. He has a thoughtful expression on his face and doesn't meet the man's eyes. Elijah rolls his wheelchair along a darkened corridor, his right leg still sticking straight out with its two long rows of shiny bolts protruding from the metal frame around it. He picks up the phone. Elijah looks straight ahead, past the rows of shelving, displaying a huge collection of comics. David is standing at the top of the stairs above the concourse of Philadelphia Train Station. On either side of him, tall classical stone pillars.",
    "1016": "Mike is hiding in the bushes as she turns to go, and Colin grabs her arm, pulls her close, and gives her a lingering kiss while Mike stares, open-mouthed. Colin smiles at Abby, and they go to their apartments, which are opposite each other. Abby waves a giant foam hand that she picked up at the game as Colin goes into his apartment. Abby runs along the path to Mike and gives him a hug, then runs joyfully to her apartment as Mike walks off. On the show, he is wearing a gorilla suit, and a video screen behind Larry and Georgia shows monkeys having sex while Abby and Joy watch a monitor. Mike’s nephew, Joe, is present, and the gorilla suit is mentioned. Abby jumps up and down, grinning, as she steps out of her apartment. On the doormat is a gift bag, which Abby picks up and looks around, frowning. She takes an envelope out of the gift bag and goes back inside, opening the card and taking a box from the gift bag. Inside the box is a pair of remote-controlled, vibrating briefs. Abby stands in front of the mirror, applies lipstick, perches on the arm of a chair, sips a glass of white wine, and glances at the vibrating briefs, considering for a moment. She reaches under her white dress, pulls down her briefs, and as she does so, D'Artagnan the cat trots past and climbs onto a chair. Abby picks up the black, lacy vibrating briefs and puts them on, pulls up the briefs, and straightens out her dress while D'Artagnan the cat stares at her. She picks up the small, cylindrical remote control unit, puts her briefs and the box for the vibrating briefs behind a cushion, stuffs the remote control in her handbag, and opens the door. Mike and Stuart are there, and she smiles bitterly. In Stuart's car, executives are gathered in a restaurant, and Mike puts his arms around the bikini babes as they sit around a table with the executives. Abby kicks Mike, knocking over her bag and causing the remote control to fall out. A kid finds the remote control unit for the vibrating briefs on the floor and picks it up, switching it on and causing Abby to squirm. Abby and Mike look under the table as the boy shakes it, making Abby stiffen. Abby squirms, crosses her legs, and points at her feet. Mike sees the boy with the remote and she glares at him while he winks. Mike grabs the remote from the boy, and Abby grabs it back. They lean on a railing, glance at the rest of the group, and Mike's gaze is fixed on Abby and Colin as they go. Stuart comes over, and a country road lined with lush, green trees, dappled with sunlight, is seen.",
    "688": "Peter is at a bank where Aunt May kicks the bank clerk and holds up a newspaper cutting, studying it, while the bank clerk smiles, stands, and limps away. On the other side of the banking hall, Octavius, wearing a long coat and a triveil, is standing in front of the steel vault door and tosses it across the hall, leaving Aunt May's mouth hanging open as Peter runs off around the corner. Octavius uses his mechanical limbs to bypass the guards, with one pincer bending around to take off his hat, then starts picking up bulging sacks of money from the vault and stuffing them into yellow bags. One of the pincers detects something, prompting Octavius to glance around as Spider-Man flies in. Octavius throws bags at Spider-Man, who swings up to the ceiling, catching a bag in a web and hitting Octavius, who spins around and tosses more. Spider-Man lands on a wall without his web, and a bag of coins hits him. A gold coin rolls over to the bank clerk, who is about to pocket it when Aunt May smacks him. Octavius' metal limbs pick Spider-Man up, with the other two pincers grabbing his head and starting to squeeze; Spider-Man fires a web and raises his arms at the desk and display case, causing the limbs to smash the desk. The display case hits Octavius and propels him out of the bank onto a yellow cab, where he gets to his feet and the limbs approach Spider-Man, hurling him back into the bank. Two police cars screech to a halt, and one of the mechanical limbs grabs Aunt May as cover. Octavius lumbers off with Aunt May. Inside an office, a girl on the phone lays down the receiver and crosses to the window as a limb pokes through the wall, with Octavius hammering up the outside of the office building, three limbs doing the work, the fourth holding Aunt May. Spider-Man appears above him, and high up the building, Octavius drops Aunt May, but a web from Spider-Man catches her, and she springs back up. Below her, Octavius crashes Spider-Man against the building, but Spider-Man still has a battle on his hands. He punches free of Octavius and scoots up the building, only to be grabbed by one of the mechanical limbs. Aunt May sees Spider-Man hauled down by Octavius, and the two men trade blows and spring off the building, falling towards the ground with one of the limbs securing a hold.",
    "754": "David follows the man as he pushes his wheelie bin around a corner and along a dimly lit corridor. A couple of people are lounging listlessly against the wall. David stands gazing at the door, seeing shadows of people passing back and forth inside through frosted glass panels. The door opens and the maintenance man reappears, wearing a cap and with a bag slung across his body. The man walks at a steady pace along a dark street lined with cars, and up a long stairway lit by tall bright lamps on alternate sides. David follows him with the hood of his cape up against the teeming rain. At the top of the stairs, he waits and watches. The man continues up a street on a gentle incline, where large houses are set back from the road, and turns and walks up the path to a detached house with a mature tree in the front garden. He stops in the porch, looks up and down the street, takes something from beside the porch, and disappears into the shadows around the side of the house. David drops his head, staring down at the ground. The shadow from his hood obscures all his face but a triangle from his nose to his mouth. He lifts his head and looks towards the house. Two strips of light appear and very slowly widen as a door opens. The spreading light falls on mail scattered over a tiled floor, and on clothes strewn on the floor further inside. Water drips from a cape onto a pair of shoes. David stands silhouetted in the doorway. Lights are on inside the house. Beyond three open doorways, David can see a staircase. He stops in the doorway, and slowly turns back. He takes a step back into a dark lobby, looking to his left, and reaches forward to open another door. He looks around and switches on a light. The house owner is lying head down on the basement steps, and David sees again the maintenance man's violent entry into the house. David closes the door and moves slowly into the next room, which has half paneled walls. He passes a chair at the end of a table, which suggests it's the dining room. The next room has easy chairs, a sitting room. Light from a television flickers and he glances towards it. He stops before moving into the hallway. David's shadow grows larger on the wall at the top of the stairs as he climbs them. He peers through the crack of a partly open door. Frowning, he steps forward and pushes it open wider, and flicks on the light. He steps into a child's bedroom with pop posters on the wall.",
    "941": "Irene turns her head and faces him, swallows deeply, and then he turns away from her. Irene gets to her feet, staggers away, leaning on other tables as she passes them, while he coolly sips his tea and stares ahead icily. Holmes sits in the Savoy's restaurant with his back to the entrance and turns on hearing a woman's laugh, furrowing his brow. He checks his watch, which rests on the table, noting it's eight minutes past nine. His left eye is bruised, and he is cleaned up but isn't clean-shaven. He glances around and tucks his napkin down the front of his shirt as pages turn. The title appears over a black-and-white illustration, which becomes a skyline of London with terraced houses, chimney pots, and slate tile. Underground-railway construction work is carried out on Baker Street. Dr. John Watson, the man seated at the typewriter, limps along the pavement with a cane in his right hand and holds the lead for a bulldog in his left. He has a hand-knitted scarf draped around his neck, opens the front door, and he and the dog enter the house. He bends to unfasten the lead, and the dog scampers upstairs. Watson opens the door and is immediately assailed by the fronds of a palm tree, grins, and walks in. The room is filled with tropical plants, and he spots a turkey and sees a motionless Holmes by the window. A dart hits Watson in the shoulder; he turns and sees a goat, then sits by the mannequin of Holmes. Another dart lands as Holmes is revealed to be wearing a two-colored garment and a brown hood that melds perfectly with the furniture. He pulls off the hood, and Watson glowers at him. Holmes leans over Watson and unveils four mice before leaving, with her stepping forward as Holmes disappears behind closed curtains. Watson opens the curtains and looks into his old office, seeing one wall filled with a map of the world, newspaper articles, and photographs, with lines of red ribbon covering the wall. The man in the restaurant drinks his brandy while Holmes drinks his formaldehyde, and Gladstone keels over while the dog jumps up and runs off. He has a false beard as they ride in an early car, attracting stares from people as it goes by. Holmes removes his enormous false beard and stares at Watson as they pull up. Watson shakes his head, gets out, and Holmes follows, with Watson kicking one of the car's tires to shaking hands. In a nightclub, two girls swing upside down from a trapeze as men throng the club, chatting and drinking. Holmes and Watson sit at a table, where a waitress and a waiter spread a tablecloth for them. Holmes downs his drink, and Watson grabs the cigar from Holmes' mouth and marches off.",

A wire birdcage hangs close to the shade, silhouetted with a canary on the perch. The CHILDREN enter, backs to us, and stop, looking with window light on their faces as the song ends. He vanishes beyond the trees, his singing growing more distant, and then wakes her. He vanishes again as children scuttle in hay and dogs quiet while his song dies. Hand in hand, they hurry out of the barn and, as we pan, along its side towards the river. JOHN steers through turbulent, moonlit water beneath a low moon. On blank, calm water, the skiff enters, passing full length below us with the children asleep in it, as blank water returns and the fox barks again. The skiff nears a sand-bar and the prow softly grates against the sand. Tilting upward, distant sounds include medium and near roosters crowing o.s. He looks to PEARL, who is picking daisies. Beyond the fence, a woman, RACHEL COOPER, appears carrying a berry-basket on her arm. JOHN scrambles up, grabs an oar, and holds it defensively while PEARL freezes. They hesitate and still hesitate as RACHEL breaks off a switch and comes for them, squishing through the mud. She surrounds them and drives them like geese up the bank as they move across the meadow like a nursery frieze with her tweaking with her switch. As she goes near PEARL's calves, JOHN turns to see three crouching figures picking tomatoes beyond a low white fence with Rachel's house in the background. RUBY, thirteen, pops her head up like a rifle-target, followed by Clary, eleven, and Mary, four. She has JOHN and PEARL by their napes while the three girls enter, their backs to us, carrying baskets of tomatoes. She holds JOHN and PEARL very firmly, inspecting baskets across the gate of the fence. She opens the gate, pushes the Harper children through, shuts the gate, and walks between them, her back to us. The children hesitate as she turns to them and stops, looking them up and down. If we saw her face, her lips would be pursed and working with anger. His eyes go down to her feet, and he, and we, start to examine her from foot to head, as this is our heroine at last from JOHN’S eye-level, tilting slowly up her height. She wears man's shoes, heavy with mud, a rough skirt, and a shapeless sweater hanging over her shoulders; she is in her middle sixties and wears a man's old hat. Her face says, for no reason at all, he feels he has come home. RACHEL mercilessly scrubs JOHN, who doesn't like it, while RUBY washes PEARL with a cloth, both hating the scrubbing. JOHN breaks away and dodges behind a bush with RACHEL in hot pursuit.",
    "320": "He smiles at Frodo as Frodo sits up, looking at Gandalf questioningly, troubled, and his eyes drift away. Saruman stands over Gandalf, gloating. With the power of his staff, Saruman raises Gandalf from the ground, then sends him crashing to the floor. Suddenly, Gandalf lurches to his feet and throws himself off the tower. Saruman watches Gandalf fly away from Isengard on the back of a giant eagle. Gwaihir the Eagle soars majestically over the mountains, carrying Gandalf towards the dawn. Frodo raises himself up and looks at Gandalf as Sam runs to Frodo's bedside, overjoyed to find Frodo awake. Sam looks past Frodo smiling at a bent figure sitting alone on a bench in the sun. Frodo turns, following Sam's gaze to Bilbo Baggins, breaking into a broad grin as Frodo rushes forward to embrace him. Bilbo has aged significantly since last seen. Frodo turns the neatly inscribed title page of a red leather bound journal, looking at page after page of beautiful handwriting, with intricate maps and drawings. He is sitting with Frodo on a terrace overlooking a waterfall. Frodo turns a page and finds a map of the Shire, as Bilbo smiles proudly. Sam busily tries to stuff more things into his already full pack, pots and pans, blankets, cooking utensils, provisions, clothes, and then looks up, startled. Gandalf and Elrond watch Frodo and Sam from Elrond's balcony before Elrond turns and walks away and Gandalf turns to look out the window. With the broken sword, Isildur slices off Sauron's finger as Elrond reacts and Isildur turns and walks away. Strider watches from the shadows as Boromir strolls through the darkened gallery, his eyes drawn to an old fresco on the wall depicting Isildur defeating Sauron. Boromir looks with wonderment at Narsil, the broken blade of Elendil, lying on a cloth-covered plinth, and sensing Strider's presence, looks from the blade to Strider, as if sensing a connection. Night falls upon the beautiful valley of Rivendell, still and quiet, as Strider and Arwen stand upon a stone bridge, the Evenstar at Arwen's breast shining in the moonlight. Arwen looks into Strider's eyes, closes Strider's fingers around the jewel, and leans towards him, gently kissing him. Elrond addresses the council where Frodo sits amongst a council of free peoples of Middle-earth, with Elrond, Gandalf, Strider, Legolas, and 20 other elves, dwarves, and men. Frodo steps forward, moves towards a stone plinth, places the ring on the plinth, and returns to his seat. Strider says nothing as Boromir turns away dismissively, then sharply as Legolas stands and Frodo looks at Strider questioningly.",
    "616": "The sun shines on Sydney's red brick building. He's in the kitchen making a fry-up. Alison comes in wearing his oversized pajamas. Rubbing her neck, she looks at the black and white photo Richard was inspecting. He turns back to the stove and continues to cook. Alison sits at the table. She looks at the bacon, sausage, egg, tomatoes, beans, and toast. She runs off with a hand over her mouth. Sydney plumps a cushion on his leather sofa and takes his father's book from the coffee table. In doing so, he knocks Alison's handbag to the floor. The contents tumble out and he scrabbles to collect them. He picks up Alison's red notebook. It's embossed with a gold image of a butterfly. He glances about furtively, then opens it and starts to read. He looks up again to find Alison watching him. She shrugs and takes a seat. She starts to gather her things from the coffee table. The soundtrack to Le Dolce Vita. Holding the record, she looks up with a smile. He takes the battered record sleeve from her. She closes her eyes and smiles as he puts the record on. Wearing a wry smile, Sydney starts to dance. He turns and offers Alison his hand. They dance. Sydney's pretty mother seems to watch from the photograph on the shelving unit, as Alison cracks a smile and dances a cheeky little jive with Sydney. He takes her by the hand and raises it above his head. Nestled between lush green trees and other crumbling apartment blocks. Sydney's building is dwarfed by the skyscrapers on the horizon. Alison sits at her desk as Ingrid goes through dresses with another model. Sydney listens at the door. Hearing Alison cross the office, he darts for a fire exit, setting off the alarm. He closes the door and turns back. A crowd of office workers convenes and turns back. He taps the sign on the door. He takes a wildlife book from a shelf. The crowd disperses but Alison remains. She watches him head off. Into his bathroom mirror. He sticks some fake fangs in. He wrinkles his nose. With white face paint, fangs, and a cape, he carries a glass of wine as he finds Elena dressed as Marlene Dietrich. She stands chatting. Sydney walks away. A person with an Elvis Presley costume kisses a nun. He heads over to Alison, who wears a black wig and holds a cigarette in a long holder. He removes the fangs. Lawrence gives her a glass of champagne, then kisses her on the cheek and walks away. Sydney shifts uncomfortably. He shakes his head. They sip their drinks and stare straight ahead. Sydney looks at Alison and sighs.",
    "489": "Sam stares at her, frowns in concern over her very real anxiety, goes to the phone, dials operator, and starts for the door, followed by Lila into the store. He pauses halfway down, turns, puts his hands on her arms. The silhouette of Norman is seen; he is still. Norman then turns slowly until, in silhouette, we see his profile, his chin lowered furtively as he looks over his shoulder in the direction of the house. The store is in darkness, only the glow from the back room spilling in. With the camera placed with its back to the street door, we see the distant tiny figure of Lila seated and waiting in the back room beyond. The tiny figure jumps up and runs all the way from the back room down the aisle of hardware and comes into a big head. From her viewpoint, we see Sam alighting from his truck and coming toward the door of the store. He enters, and he and Lila exchange quiet glances. She feels his pause, turns, and for a moment they share at each other across the darkened room. She hands the receiver to the Sheriff, who takes it reluctantly and listens to the dim sound of ringing on the other end. Sam and Lila stare at the Sheriff, who stares back at them, and when he finally speaks there is an almost inaudible tone of irony in his voice. Norman sits in the dim, one-lamp light, the phone next to him, his hand still near it as if he had not been able to move his hand after hanging up, staring at the shrike-like bird perched on the lamp shade. Suddenly, he rises, starts quickly out of the room, tries to switch off the lamp as he goes, and in so doing, succeeds only in knocking the bird off the shade. He then puts out the lamp, goes out, crosses the darkened office, and goes outside, coming off the porch. He walks to the path, directly up to the house, opens the door, and goes in. Norman goes up, pauses one moment outside his mother's door, then opens it and goes in, leaving the door open. He moves away and the others follow. She smiles brightly, as if having invited them over to discuss this year's charity fandango, takes the Sheriff's arm, and starts away. The Sheriff nods as he goes. Sam and Lila are alone now at the curb before the deserted chapel. As the truck drives off, Sam takes Lila's arm and starts with her toward the path that leads to the old house. The camera pans with them, and as they turn around the office corner, they see Norman coming down the path toward them.",
    "1190": "The street lights are reflected in the puddles on the damp pavements. At last, he slows down and looks around him. Ahead is a small patch of worn grass in a children's playground. He's alone. He sits wearily on the edge of the pavement, hunching his shoulders against the cold and damp. He looks up as the streetlight above his head flickers and goes out. In the playground, the empty swings begin to move. The roundabout turns and a seesaw clumps down onto the grass. In front of him, a huge black dog looms out of the bushes. Harry slowly rises to his feet. Harry pulls out his wand and stumbles backwards onto the pavement. A bright light approaches. A purple triple-decker bus draws up. The conductor reads from a dirty piece of card. Putting the card in his pocket, he looks down at Harry. Harry stares nervously at the bushes. Stan picks up the trunk, and Harry steps inside the bus. On the lower deck is a row of beds, one of which is occupied. Above his head, Harry sees galleries and a chandelier hanging from the roof. Stan Shunpike turns the handle of his machine and gives Harry a bus ticket. Stan knocks on the driver's window. The Rastafarian shrunken head, hanging above the driver, laughs. Ernie starts the bus. Harry falls backwards onto a bed. Ernie peers through thick glasses and drives erratically. The bus screeches to a halt. Harry's face hits the window. An old lady with a walking frame shuffles in front of the bus. Harry sees a picture in Stan's newspaper. Two London buses drive straight at them. Ernie pulls a lever. The bus and its occupants become narrow enough to squeeze between them. The bus hurdles off again down a narrow street. Harry hits the window again. They bump a parked car. Tom, the hunchback innkeeper, grins at Harry. The purple bus disappears into the night. Harry follows Tom into the Leaky Cauldron. Inside the gloomy public house, a man sits reading a book while a spoon stirs itself around a cup. Chairs turn themselves upside down onto the tables. In a room upstairs, Harry finds his snowy owl and the Minister for Magic, Mr. Fudge. As Tom hauls him up, Harry calls his owl. Harry gazes down at the busy marketplace below his window. A high-level train rattles past. Harry goes to the pile of books on the low table by the fire. One of the books is growling. He looks at its hairy cover, staring, glassy eyes and sharp, pointed teeth. Suddenly, the book goes berserk, snapping its covers. It leaps out of his hands and starts to snap at his feet.",
    "229": "Szpilman makes a record in a ledger of the tools each worker takes out on the site. A worker puts his head into the store. The Jewish workers start to assemble on the site in haphazard ranks as an SS Captain strides in. The SS Captain, with much jollity and jokes, hops up on the scaffolding and stands, beaming broadly, surveying the workers. A glance occurs between Szpilman and Majorek. The SS Captain beams, but there is no reaction from the workers. He rubs his thumb and forefinger and leers, still receiving no reaction, and his smile vanishes. Snow. Majorek pulls a barrow by a rope attached to its shaft across the site. On the barrow, there are five sacks. Majorek pulls the barrow to where Szpilman waits, and Majorek is instantly awake. Majorek takes the paper but says nothing. He turns over and goes back to sleep, while Szpilman returns to his bunk. Szpilman has unloaded the sacks of potatoes into the corner and is kneeling, about to untie the string on the smallest sack, when a sound alerts him. He looks around and sees an SS Lieutenant entering the stores, sucking on his finger, which is bleeding. Szpilman immediately hurries to a cupboard, finds a First Aid tin, removes a plaster, and gives it to the SS Lieutenant. The lieutenant indicates the sacks with his chin. Szpilman tries to untie the string but is too terrified to manage it. The SS Lieutenant shoves him out of the way, takes a dagger from his belt, and cuts the string. The lieutenant reaches in and withdraws a handful of long yellow beans, glowers at Szpilman, reaches in again, and produces a handful of oatmeal. He throws the oatmeal in Szpilman's face, kicks him viciously, and marches away. Szpilman catches his breath, then quickly reaches into the bottom of the sack and finds a pistol and ammunition, which he hides under his clothes. Freezing cold, the Jewish workers, with their bundles of potatoes and bread, march back toward the ghetto gates escorted by two Polish policemen. Zick-Zack takes a swig of vodka and comes face to face with Szpilman, staring at him directly with glassy eyes. Szpilman is terrified, trying as surreptitiously as possible to cover his hidden package with his hands, and there is a moment of danger. Zick-Zack grabs Szpilman by the collar, finding this hilarious along with his comrade, and they recover from their laughter. The column starts to march, and after a brief silence, a solo voice from the back starts to sing, \"Children of Warsaw will go to fight!\" Szpilman glances back and sees that Majorek is singing. Szpilman smiles, Majorek nods, and Szpilman joins in. Now, so do the others, and they march on, singing lustily. Szpilman lies in a steaming bath, eyes closed, as though in a trance.",
    "1345": "Louis sees her, tries to stop, but can't, and his car slams. Alice gasps, stops pedaling, looks back at her father's car, wide-eyed and terrified, unsure if she should go back. Louis is bleeding, badly hurt. He adjusts himself painfully and looks into the cracked-glass rear view. Alice is still looking back at the car and doesn't see the shape coming behind her. Just as she decides not to go back, she turns to begin riding on. Louis tries to get out of the car, but it's painful, and his door is jammed shut, so he goes for the passenger door. When Louis finally gets out, he runs from his car, stumbling drunk and bleeding, screaming, shredding his voice. A distant factory, even more distant mountains, and an ominous plume of smoke are seen, while a far-off siren is heard. Joe stands at the counter with Charles, who is in a bad mood. Donny returns with a developed film envelope and gives Charles his change. Charles heads off, and Joe follows. As Charles rides off with the film, Joe follows, and they boom up along the water tower as they go. As they continue booming up, they arrive at the top of the water tower, where the cube has affixed itself to the side, unseen from the street. Joe and Charles ride their bikes up to his house. Frustrated beyond belief, Charles goes inside, and Joe follows. Charles threads the film into the projector, and suddenly on the poster board pinned to the closet, there she is: Alice, from the night of the train crash. The scene plays as they filmed it. The filmed scene continues as Joe and Charles argue. Joe's mind spins; he doesn't know how to respond to this. They watch for a moment as the train crash happens, but it's so sudden, so fast, the camera picks up almost nothing. Within a moment, the camera is on its side, filming the settling debris. Charles moves forward, so the film is now partially being projected on him. Joe moves forward, and part of the film is projected on him, too. But Joe has seen something on the screen, sotto. Joe has slapped Charles' arm, his eyes locked to the screen. Charles looks too, and now they see it through the train car wreckage: something too big, mostly out of frame, its shape and flesh too bizarre, with only the legs visible as it clears the frame. On film, then from outside, an air raid siren ramps, whining through the town.",
    "637": "Graham's station wagon returns to the farm and pulls up outside Merrill's converted barn. Merrill and Graham undo their seat belts and turn towards the buzzing noise from the back. Morgan picks up a pale blue radio receiver from beside him on the seat, while Bo sits next to him in a child's car seat. She watches Morgan as he puts the receiver to his ear and points to the sky. Merrill sighs and turns away. Graham watches his brother, ponders, and then turns back to Morgan, reaching back for the receiver. Morgan gives it to him, and Graham and Merrill stare at each other and listen. Merrill sits back exasperated as Graham gets out, followed by the rest of the family. Bo freezes in shock, and Merrill looks down at Morgan and considers. Graham leans back down into the car as Merrill looks uneasy. Graham slowly stands while Merrill reaches out his hand. Together, Merrill and Graham hold the receiver across the car roof. Morgan climbs onto the roof, crawls towards Graham and Merrill, and takes the receiver. Bo runs around to the bonnet and clambers up, but Graham sits on the bonnet to prevent her from getting any further. Merrill gets onto the roof with Morgan and holds him steady as Morgan points the receiver up to the sky. Bo struggles to get onto the roof, and Merrill takes hold of her hand as Morgan slowly lowers the receiver and looks at it. Bo slides back down into Graham's lap. Carrying a metal dish of dog food for Isabel in one hand, Graham steps out of the farmhouse through a screen door into the dark, walking steadily across the lawn to where the Alsatian is chained to its kennel. Agitated, Isabel shifts and jumps about, pulling at the chain and barking into the quivering field of maize. Graham stops just short of the dog and looks out into the darkened field, slowly turning his body to face the crop. Isabel lunges at Graham, who recoils, then stares in surprise at the dog before turning back to the gently rustling field. Isabel remains agitated. Graham opens a battered metal toolbox resting on a picnic bench and lifts out a large torch. Inching cautiously forward and holding out his free hand, he directs the circular torch beam onto the edge of the crop. Graham walks slowly up to the wall of maize and steps inside the tall dense corn, venturing on at an even pace and moving down a narrow channel between two rows of rigid stalks. The white torchlight angled low illuminates the limp straggly green leaves, which bend back as he pushes through them.",
    "1117": "She waves her wand. Harry blinks as his glasses repair themselves. She takes him to a bookshop where the Weasley family are standing near the counter. A queue of excited customers are waiting to get their book signed. A blond man with a blue suit and matching cloak appears. He smiles smugly. Posing for the camera, Lockhart spots Harry's grubby face in the crowd. The photographer pulls Harry forward. Ron pulls a face. They head for the door. A boy with very fair hair tears a page from a book. He steps in front of Harry. A man with long fair hair touches Harry's forehead with his snake-topped cane. The Grangers are chatting to Mr. Weasley. He looks at Ron. He takes a book from Jenny's cauldron. He slips two books back into Jenny's cauldron. Mr. Weasley smiles reassuringly at his children. Lucius turns on his heel. Draco glares at Ron and Harry. At King's Cross and Pancras Station, Harry and Louisa hurry along Platform 10 with loaded trolleys. The twins and Percy push their trolleys straight towards the brick wall between the two platforms. They disappear through it one after the other. Jenny follows. Mr. and Mrs. Weasley head for the wall. On Platform 10, Harry heads for the wall with Ron close behind. They hit solid brick. They collapse in a heap of trolleys and luggage. Hedwig flaps her wings. A porter comes over. Ron looks thoughtful. Outside the station, the blue Ford Anglia rises unsteadily into the air. A taxi driver looks up in amazement. Ron presses a button on the dashboard. High above London, the car disappears. Thick cloud gradually clears, revealing low green hills far below. The car suddenly reappears. Ron changes gear and steers the car down towards the railway line. They skim above the track over a magnificent stone viaduct. They look back with horror. The Hogwarts Express is right behind them. Ron jacks the wheel to the left. The car swerves away from the track and swoops under the viaduct. It tumbles between the stone arches, turning over and over. The car door flies open and Harry falls out. Harry has managed to grab the door handle. He hangs on precariously above the train. Ron stretches down towards him. Harry reaches desperately for his hand. Harry grabs Ron's outstretched hand and manages to scramble back inside the car. Ron turns the wheel. The train thunders on beneath a plume of white smoke. As darkness falls, the car headlights pick out the towers of Hogwarts School. Ron glances at Harry. Harry's smile of delight fades as the car engine falters. Ron struggles with the wheel as the car swoops out of control, zooming close to the brightly lit windows of the Great Hall.",
    "103": "Forrest runs across a cobble-stone bridge with the Rocky Mountains in the distance, and split rail fences line the road as he runs through some meadowland. Meanwhile, three men in the barber shop watch the news on television, and Jenny fills customer's coffee cups. Forrest continues running as a young man runs up to him and jogs behind him, as Forrest runs up a slope on a high mountain road with a group of people jogging behind him. The large group follows Forrest across the desert road, through a small town, where a man runs up and talks to him, while a hippie stops to ponder a profound thought. A truck with a bumper sticker drives into an intersection and collides with a car. Forrest runs, followed by his group, as another man runs up to him. Forrest wipes his face on a towel and hands it back to the man, who looks at the T-shirt. Forrest runs with a group that follows behind him until he stops, and the group stops behind him. Forrest stands and looks as the group waits expectantly, then he turns and looks, walks toward the group, which parts for him as he walks down the middle of the road. A television shows President Reagan and his staff reacting to gunshots in front of a limo, while Forrest sits eating a sandwich, watching the news of the assassination attempt. Forrest takes a letter out of his pocket, which an elderly woman looks at, then hastily grabs his suitcase and letter as he stands. A truck honks its horn as Forrest runs across the street past the truck, and the elderly woman shouts from the bus stop bench as Jenny opens and then shuts the door. Forrest looks around and hands Jenny the box of chocolates. Jenny picks up a scrapbook and turns the pages as there is a knock at the door, Lynn Marie enters as she opens it, and Jenny grabs a young boy. The little boy runs into another room and picks up the TV remote control as Forrest continues to stare at Forrest Jr., then looks frightened and starts to back away. Jenny turns and looks at Forrest Jr. in the other room as Forrest breathes deep, looks at Jenny, then at Forrest Jr., walks into the room, and sits down next to Forrest Jr. Jenny walks out of the house, and Forrest walks over to greet her. She wears a white dress and walks up to Forrest, adjusting his necktie. Lt. Dan walks across the lawn using a cane, accompanied by a woman, as Jenny walks over to Forrest and Lt. Dan.",
    "286": "She seems to be trying to figure out what to do or where to go, and she nervously looks at a couple of men passersby. He quickly raises his long-focus camera to his eye, and we are now given a waist-high shot as the focus is adjusted by Jeff. The figure is that of Miss Lonely Hearts. Getting no reaction, she crosses the street and seats herself at an empty table in front of the cafe, where she orders a drink. She is suddenly blotted out by a figure of a man who enters the picture from the left side. It is Thorwald, carrying a lightweight cardboard box under his arm. The camera pans him over to the right until he is lost behind the building. He is much nearer the lens because he is on this side of the street, and he is, therefore, slightly out of focus. He lowers the lens, and we see Jeff's eyes travel across the screen as he imagines Thorwald's progression. Then sharpening his look, he picks up the long-focus lens, and easing himself back cautiously, begins watching Thorwald. Thorwald comes up the corridor and stands unlocking his door. As he hesitates, we can see the cardboard box he is carrying has the name of a laundry on it. He enters the apartment and turns on the living room lights. He proceeds to the bedroom, and the lights go on there. A number of suits and top coats are lying in an orderly pile on the bed. He takes the laundry out of the box and puts it on the bed next to the suits. Then he goes to the dresser, and instead of putting the laundry away, he proceeds to take out the contents of the drawers--pajamas, shirts, socks, etc. He piles these on the bed. Jeff lowers the camera quickly. He picks up the phone and dials a number, still keeping his eyes on Thorwald. The phone buzzes on filter, then is picked up and answered by a woman. For a moment, Jeff looks desperate. As he talks thoughtfully, he takes some jewelry from the handbag -- a couple of rings, diamond wristwatch, brooch, pearls, etc. He discusses each piece, apparently trying to make some decision. Jeff lowers his camera lens and edges his chair forward in an effort to hear what Thorwald is saying. The first four of the songwriter's guests come through the door, admitted by the songwriter's girlfriend. The songwriter dashes off a loud vamp of greeting on the piano, then gets up to offer drinks. Jeff turns his attention back to Thorwald but gives up any attempt at listening. He lifts the long-focus lens up to his eyes again.",
    "704": "The brownhead girl smiles, holds out her hand, and places a locket in Flint's huge palm. He clenches his fist around it. A red flashing light spills into the room, and Flint strides over to the window, climbing out onto the fire escape. Emma, Penny's mother, watches him go with a worn, cynical expression. Peter is riding along a quiet street in the dark. He parks outside Aunt May's apartment. Aunt May looks down, her eyes glistening with tears, and sweeps back a lock of her white hair. She takes off her ring. Peter takes the ring and gazes gratefully at his aunt, who smiles back at him warmly. He leans forward, and they hug, holding each other in a warm embrace. After dark, Peter, wearing a dopey smile, rides along a city street. A masked figure in dark green swoops down on a hoverboard and carries him up onto the rooftops. The masked attacker headbutts Peter and clamps a hand across his mouth. Jagged blades spring from his forearms, and he slashes at Peter's stomach. Peter jumps free of the hoverboard and shoots a web thread to the top of a skyscraper. Swinging from the thread, he shoots webbing balls. The attacker ducks to avoid them and slices through Peter's thread. Peter falls, and his dark green mystery attacker smashes him into a wall high above the ground. Stuck in the wall, Peter looks up in a daze as the figure in dark green hovers down towards him and slides his visor back. Peter dodges a huge punch. Harry prises out the section of the wall Peter is clinging to. Peter hangs on as it plummets towards the street below, but Harry swoops down after him, smashing the chunk of wall into fragments. Peter swings away on a thread, but Harry flies at him, thumping him into the air like a ball on elastic. Peter falls. Harry grabs him, dragging and thumping him against the high walls as he flies, then hurling him through a corner of a window. As Peter floats out of the other shattered window, he sees Aunt May's ring spinning through the air in front of him. He then tries to snatch at it. Harry grabs him from behind. Both men balance on the narrow, sweeping hoverboard, the Sky Stick, as they fight. Peter throws Harry off the Sky Stick and fires a couple of web threads, using them to catapult himself down after the falling ring. The Sky Stick automatically zooms down to collect the falling Harry. Peter swings down and is just grabbing the ring when Harry strikes him again, sending him sprawling onto a rooftop. Peter opens his fist and looks down at the ring nestled in his palm, then turns and runs as Harry swoops down.",
    "486": "Norman looks at a picture hanging on the far end of the wall he is leaning against, reaches it, touches it, and reluctantly lifts the small frame off the wall. A tiny circle of light hits Norman's face from the hole in the wall behind the picture. This end of the room is very dim, allowing us to see clearly the light striking Norman's face. We move close to Norman, extremely close, until his profile fills the screen, and the tiny spot of light hits his eye. We see the small hole through which the light comes, and Norman peeps through. Through the hole, we look into Mary's cabin and see Mary undressing; she is in her bra and half-slip. She stoops over a bit, places her hands behind her upper back, and begins to unhook her bra. Norman watches as Mary removes her bra, and we see his eye run up and down the unseen figure of Mary. Mary is just slipping into a robe, covering her complete nudity. Norman turns from the hole, faces us for a moment, continues turning until he can look out the small parlor window. Quickly and precisely, he rehangs the picture over the hole in the wall, turns, and starts out of the parlor. We see him go through the office and out onto the porch, not even bothering to close the door behind him. Norman walks along the porch, in the direction of the big house. Once on the path, he pauses, looks up at the light in the bedroom window, then pulls himself up, squares his shoulders, and strides manfully up the path. He opens the door of the house and enters. We see him pause at the foot of the stairway and look up at the bedroom door just at the head of the stair. He bypasses the stairs and slowly makes his way to the kitchen at the far end of the hall. He enters the kitchen and drops wearily into a chair. Meanwhile, Mary is seated at a small desk, engrossed in figuring in a small notebook. After a moment, she tears the page out of the notebook and, rising, begins to rip it into small pieces. She goes into the bathroom, drops the pieces into the toilet bowl, and flushes the toilet. Then she drops her robe, steps into the tub, and turns the shower on. For a moment, we watch Mary as she washes and soaps herself. We then see the bathroom door being pushed slowly open and the shadow of a woman fall across the shower curtain. Mary's back is turned to the curtain. Suddenly, a hand reaches up, grasps the shower curtain, and rips it aside, causing a look of pure horror to erupt on her face.",
    "835": "In an office, a handsome, well-groomed man checks his cell phone and answers. On a cell phone, in the food court, a plump redhead smiles and pumps her fist. Now, in a cluttered house, she wipes her hair dry and punches numbers into a keypad. Along a mirror, fake IDs with the redhead's photo hang from a string. A machine spits out a credit card with Sandy's name on it. The redhead adds it to a stack of fake cards and walks off with a determined expression. Now, at a hip bar, she enters wide-eyed and approaches the bartender. She eyes two men doing shots. She hands him Sandy's credit card. She downs a shot with the guys. Now, the redhead chugs a bottle of green liqueur. She finishes it off and raises her arms. The bartender adds drinks to her tab, totaling over $2,000. Standing on a table, she throws a bottle. She leaps for the chandelier and lands flat on the floor. The bar patrons watch her lie motionless. As a few of them reach down and poke her, she springs up. The frustrated bartender makes his way over as she high-fives patrons. She punches him in the throat. He collapses. Now, a police car pulls up to the bar. Later, two officers escort her out. She breathes into a tube and spews green vomit on the officer. As he shakes it off, she turns to the other officer. At the police station, the plump identity thief stands in front of a height chart. Now, the real Sandy sits in front of a birthday cake, surrounded by his beautiful wife and two young daughters. She gives him a paper tie. He picks her up. He puts her face in the cake. She straddles Sandy's lap and looks him in the eyes. He pulls her close and kisses her tenderly. She raises her brow. He carries her out of the room. Daytime. Sandy slowly drives down a congested highway. Later, carrying a briefcase, the well-groomed businessman walks through an enclosed courtyard and enters an office building. Now, Sandy steps off an elevator and walks to his office. A co-worker wearing a suit approaches. Sandy puts down a file and follows Cornish's assistant. He peeks into an office, where Cornish beckons him to enter. Cornish gestures to an earphone. He keeps Sandy from sitting. Cornish shuts the door. Now, Sandy inputs a code into a keypad and enters the records room. He makes his way to a computer station behind a cage wall. He holds up a small packet that lists the partners with substantial bonuses by their names. The bottom name reads Harold Cornish $1.2 million. On the computer, he types Cornish's name onto a check, then answers his cell phone.",
    "1162": "A dark narrow corridor, dimly lit and festooned with cobwebs, leads to the scene where the patterned tiles underfoot are cracked and dirty. Harry hesitates, but Moody pushes past him impatiently, followed by the others moving toward an open door at the end of the gloomy passage. Nymphadora turns and winks at Harry, but she trips over an umbrella stand. Through the open door, Harry spots Mr. Weasley, Sirius, and Lupin, and as she comes out closing the door, she hugs him warmly and looks at him closely. A house elf emerges onto the landing dragging a wooden box. It has skinny arms, a long pointed nose and ears, and wears a ragged vest, glaring spitefully at Harry. The elf stands on the box and polishes a picture frame. Harry opens a door and is nearly knocked off his feet by Hermione, with Ron standing behind her. Harry looks around the bedroom and his eyes widen as the Weasley twins dangle a magic ear over the banisters. Hermione's cat, Crookshanks, sees the ear and grabs at it with his paw, then runs off with it, chased by Fred and George. Harry embraces his godfather Sirius, who holds him close. Harry's photograph is underneath, and Sirius looks directly at Harry and winks at him. Ron sleeps peacefully, but Harry's sleep is disturbed by dreams. The scene shifts to a down escalator on the London Underground where Mr. Weasley stands stiffly holding both handrails. Nearing the bottom, he braces himself and steps off unsteadily as Harry follows him. At the barrier, Mr. Weasley copies other passengers by placing his palm on the automatic ticket reader pad, but the gate remains shut. Harry puts a ticket in the slot, and with Mr. Weasley leaning back against the gates, they open and he slips through backwards looking delighted. On street level, they find a red telephone box and step inside, as the inside of the box sinks below the surface of the pavement like a lift, with a replacement interior sliding down to fill the empty space as the box comes to a halt. Mr. Weasley opens the door and they step out into a cavernous tiled hall lined on either side with enormous fireplaces, as the telephone box lift disappears above their heads. People appear from the fireplaces in flashes of green smoke, carrying briefcases and bundles of papers, joining the throngs of other witches and wizards hurrying to work through the great underground hall. Harry follows Mr. Weasley past a fountain with huge golden statues, looking up at a gigantic silken banner floating above with a moving image of the Minister of Magic, Cornelius Fudge. They crowd into a Victorian lift with metal gates, as paper airplanes swoop around their heads. Kingsley pushes into the lift and whispers to Mr. Weasley, the gates close, and the lift moves backwards before dropping downwards.",
    "48": "He opens another drawer and pulls out various sandwiches wrapped in wax paper, a salt and pepper shaker, a tube of mustard, a bottle of red wine, and two Dixie cups. He uncorks the wine, fills a cup, and begins eating. He hands her a sandwich and fills a wine-cup for her. He reaches back into the drawer and pulls out a glass which he gives her. FOUR MEN, all in army uniform, sit behind a table. The glass is held over the first, magnifying the face. It's a photo of a young CHARLES LAMPERT. The glass and CAMERA move to the fourth face -- a young. REGGIE nods. He writes something on a pad of paper and tears it off, handing it to her. A ROAR from the CHILDREN. REGGIE and PETER turn toward the stage. PUNCH and JUDY are arguing loudly. PUNCH and JUDY are batting each other on the head. Finally, JUDY knocks Punch out of sight and a PUPPET wearing a three-cornered hat appears. Wearing a hat, he stands off in the background, watching. JUDY and the POLICEMAN are batting one another. PUNCH's head appears on the other side of the stage, says something, then ducks out. Charles was mixed up in something terrible. JUDY has gotten the upper hand and is now batting the POLICEMAN's brains out. CLOSE SHOT -- GRANDPIERRE as he winces. He stands on the dance floor in front of a five-piece Latin dance band, a spotlight on him, wearing his professional smile as he speaks into a mike. At their table, REGGIE is dressed in a lovely Givenchy dress. As REGGIE hauls off and kicks GIDEON full in the shin, he stiffens as the pain registers. Instead of shouting, he merely closes his eyes. Including REGGIE and GIDEON and PETER standing by, as well as some spectators. PETER comes quickly forward. REGGIE realizes that GIDEON no longer offers any resistance. She steps back, leaving GIDEON holding the orange, foolishly, under his chin, his eyes still closed. REGGIE stares at him for a moment. Slowly, his eyes open, and tears stream from them, rolling down his cheeks. He speaks while holding the orange. GIDEON turns to the woman behind him and the game resumes. She realizes she has not pushed the button which takes her coin and allows the party at the other end to hear her voice. TEX takes a book of matches from his pocket. He strikes a match and lights his cigarette, holding the burning match in his hand afterward. TEX, without a word, throws the still-lit match into the booth, onto REGGIE's lap. She beats it out frantically. He lights another match and reaches out toward her hair with it.",
    "78": "From RACHEL's viewpoint, through a screen, she sees PREACHER's face twitch with emotion, and he breaks out into great thankful sobs. As RUBY minces off around the side of the house, PREACHER watches her and wipes off his tears with the heel of his left hand. He holds up his right hand as all the CHILDREN enter around the corner of the house. As they move in, RACHEL replies, and by now, JOHN is on the top step beside her, one of his hands holding on to her skirt as if pulling her towards him, his eyes never leaving hers. All the CHILDREN freeze, with PEARL on the ground just beyond JOHN. He looks up at RACHEL, and JOHN looks deep into her eyes, wanting the situation clarified. She takes this in, realizing JOHN has sold her, then looks to PREACHER o.s., who gets to his feet with an open knife in his hand. As they see it, a gun-barrel twitches. PREACHER backs away towards his horse, bouncing the knife lightly in his hand, and as he mounts his horse, the scene shifts. RACHEL sits in profile with a gun across her knees in a big bed, while RUBY sits up listening to a song o.s. We pan to PREACHER outside, seen through the window as he sits hunched on a stump. After a moment, as RACHEL opens her mouth, either to comfort herself or to drown out PREACHER's voice, she joins in the hymn. A descending candle moves past a window as RACHEL and PREACHER sing o.s., and over the back of RACHEL's head, the song ends. RUBY enters the shot carrying a candle, which blacks out the window-glass. RACHEL looks up and blows out the candle; through the window, PREACHER has gone. She stands up as RUBY leaves the shot, and RACHEL moves towards the window, looks up, and sees the CHILDREN looking at her with complete trust. She turns around and walks back to her chair, with the CHILDREN's eyes always on her, her eyes glittering as she turns to look towards us. As the clock starts striking three, RACHEL looks to the sound o.s. In the mirror, a shadow ducks. RACHEL gets up, gun at port, and faces into the darkness. Eyes on the darkness, she bends low to the CHILDREN, who scatter out of the shot; RUBY lingers, then obeys in a trance. RACHEL, gun at the ready, looks into the darkness as PREACHER's satanic face and his hand lifting the open knife rise swiftly from the floor. She fires off her gun, and PREACHER staggers out, runs yelping with pain into the barn. The CHILDREN huddle on the stairs in reverent silence while RACHEL, her gun slung sportily under one arm, talks into the wall phone, which hangs just within the box stairway. RACHEL sits on the screened porch, awake, with a gun on her knees, as JOHN sits on the floor asleep, his head leaning against her.",
    "892": "He mops his sweaty brow with a handkerchief and closes his book. Lizzie comes in defiantly and goes to stand closer to her father, giving her hysterical mother a wry smile. Outside, Lydia and Kitty are heading out and they all look back at the house as Charlotte heads towards the house. Charlotte pauses for a moment, lost in thought, and inside, Mr. Collins is packing. He bows, and Charlotte follows him out. A lady's hand is at work on a delicate piece of floral embroidery as Lydia and Kitty hurry excitedly over to their house, Longbourn, and burst through the front door. Jane sets down her embroidery as Lizzie slumps into a chair opposite. The housekeeper comes in and hands a letter to Jane, curtsies, and then leaves the room. Trunks and boxes are being ferried out of Netherfield, and in their cloaks and bonnets, Kitty, Lydia, and Lizzie make their way through the busy town. As Denny takes Lydia's arm and Kitty is escorted away by Carter, Wickham smiles hopefully at Lizzie, who beams back at him. The pair walk through the town together. Later, Mrs. Bennet emerges from Longbourn, engrossed in conversation with Denny, and as the three girls follow their mother and the officers outside, Lizzie catches Wickham's eye with a smile. He nods politely towards her mother, then the three officers leave. Just as the girls are heading back inside, Lydia chases after them, reaches up, and whispers something to him. He strides off with Carter and Wickham. Inside, the tea things are being cleared away in the drawing room, where Mr. Bennet, Mary, and Jane are sitting. Mrs. Bennet bustles in, and the girls laugh as Mr. Bennet walks out. Jane is washing her hands in a basin in her room. Drying her hands, Jane sits at the top of the four-poster bed, Lizzie's at the bottom, and with a look of concern, Lizzie moves and sits next to Jane, looking at her and smiling. A carriage, drawn by four white horses, pulls into the drive at Longbourn, and as Mrs. Bennet comes running out of the house followed by Mr. Bennet and their daughters, a portly gentleman, Edward Gardiner, and his wife emerge from the carriage. Charlotte Lucas enters followed by Jane, and as they make their way across the crowded room, a girl with red hair eyes them curiously. They pass Lizzie, who's engaged in a conversation with Wickham. Mrs. Bennet sits with Mrs. Phillips and Mrs. Gardiner as Lizzie approaches with Wickham. Mrs. Bennet purses her lips, exchanges a glance with her sister, and haughtily walks off. Lizzie takes Wickham's hand and leads him to the dance floor, passing the girl with red hair who gives Wickham a shy smile.",
    "319": "Frodo's trembling hand extends forward as if by the pull of the ring, and he slides to the ground, unable to pull his hand away. The witch king snarls and springs forward, stabbing at Frodo with a wicked dagger; Frodo winces as the tip of the dagger sinks into his shoulder. Suddenly, Strider charges at the Ringwraiths, wielding his sword in one hand and a flaming torch in the other, moving in slow motion, visible through a sea of mist. Frodo sinks to the ground, and with draining strength, he manages to pull the ring off his finger. Appearing back in the real world, Sam rushes over to him as the distant cry of a Ringwraith carries through the air, and Frodo gasps in sudden pain. Sam and Strider desperately search the dark forest floor for the Athelas plant, and Strider drops to one knee, carefully pulling a small, white flowered plant from the ground. Strider slowly looks up as Frodo is breathing hard, desperately ill. Frodo's half-conscious point of view shows a surreal impression of a shimmering figure in white leaping off a horse, revealing an ethereal vision of Arwen, who now appears in her earthbound form, a young Elven woman with tousled hair, dressed in mud-splattered riding clothes. Strider finds it hard to let her go as Arwen mounts her horse, Asfaloth, looks down at Strider, and supports Frodo with one hand. Asfaloth springs away, bearing Arwen and Frodo into the night, through the forest from the back of the white horse. An aerial view shows Arwen's white horse emerging from the trees and galloping across the open land as the sun rises; Frodo lifts his head weakly. The white horse charges through a pine forest as the horse's head bobs and trees slide by, with moonlight flickering through the trees. Suddenly, two galloping Ringwraiths emerge from the trees behind, and two more Ringwraiths slide in from different directions to join the chase. The white horse speeds out of the pine trees with the four Ringwraiths close behind, as two more Ringwraiths gallop down the hillside. An aerial shot shows three more Ringwraiths entering the frame from different directions, making a total of nine Ringwraiths now pursuing Frodo and Arwen. Arwen grits her teeth and urges the white horse to greater speed. The witch king screeches angrily, draws his sword, and leads the Ringwraiths across the Ford. Arwen gathers the small Hobbit in her arms, feeling his life slip away as a bright light suddenly flares. Frodo squeezes his eyes shut, gasping. Frodo's eyes flicker open to find he is lying in bed next to an open window with dappled sunlight playing on richly carved timbers. The sound of a nearby waterfall drifts through the vista of fir trees, and Gandalf softly puffs on his pipe.",
    "335": "Saruman stands over the Palantir, his hands cupping the massive eye, then is seated as his Orc Overseer approaches while Gandalf lies unconscious on a cold obsidian floor. Gandalf stands as the camera pulls back to reveal him stranded on the summit of Orthanc, marooned on the tiny, flat peak, surrounded on all sides by a sheer 500-foot drop. Another whispering wail rends the air as Gandalf crosses quickly to the edge and peers down: POV: One of the beautiful Isengard trees is being ripped from the ground by the Orcs, and Gandalf looks on in horror as Orcs hack into the trunk with axes. Saruman stands in the rain looking out into the dark night as the Orc overseer sidles up to him, axe in hand, sweating with exertion, and more and more trees are hauled down and killed as Gandalf looks on in helpless despair. Meanwhile, the rugged countryside shows the hobbits journeying on, led by Strider, who stops before a distant hill topped by an ancient ruin. Frodo, Merry, and Pippin collapse into a small hollow halfway up Weathertop, muddy and exhausted, as Strider drops four small swords at the hobbits' feet. Frodo's eyes flicker open, and he suddenly sits up, sniffing the air while Sam, Merry, and Pippin huddle over a small fire with sausages and bacon sizzling in a hot frying pan. Five Ringwraiths on foot are running up the steep slope unnaturally fast, prompting Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin to clamber desperately towards the summit, clutching their swords. They race into a ring of broken stones on the summit of Weathertop, the ruined base of an ancient tower, and stand back-to-back in the centre of the ring, waiting for the first assault. One by one, the five Ringwraiths appear, brandishing gleaming swords, moving slowly towards the hobbits, with their leader, the Witch King, in the center. Sam rushes forward with a cry and swings his sword at the Witch King, who blocks the blow with his own sword, causing Sam's blade to shatter as the Witch King lashes out with his fist, sending Sam flying. Merry and Pippin, overcome with terror, throw themselves flat on the ground. In slow motion, Frodo's hand goes into his pocket and pulls out the ring as the Ringwraiths close in on Frodo, with a venomous whisper dancing in his head. The five Ringwraiths utter a chilling screech of excitement as Frodo is unable to resist any longer, falls to his knees, and slips on the ring, disappearing. Frodo finds himself in the weird twilight world, where he looks upon the Ringwraiths, now visible in their true appearance as five ghouls dressed in long grey robes with white hair and pallid, ruthless faces, as the Witch King extends a haggard hand towards Frodo, reaching for the ring on his finger.",
    "1240": "Brian's sons, Nigel and Simon, scribble on pads of paper at Brian's desk as Brian eyes the players from his office doorway, looking apprehensive as he watches the team warm up and keeps his wary eye fixed on the players. Jimmy and Brian stroll towards the team milling about on the training pitch, where the Leeds players, in purple team tracksuits with their surnames on their backs, form a semicircle facing Brian with stout redhead Bremner who dived for the penalty in the Derby Cup clash beside lanky Giles. The players swap disgruntled looks as Brian rounds on Bremner and nods emphatically. Jimmy tosses a ball at Brian, who keeps it up with his feet and head, then turns for goal and volleys it in as Brian plays with the team. Giles floors Brian, and Jimmy helps him up while Bremner leers, laughing. Brian listens outside the dressing room and later sits beside Peter on the team bus as it pulls into the Elland Road car park with his team in their dressing room, where Brian and Peter embrace as they follow the teams up the tunnel. Don is interviewed on TV, which Brian and Peter watch. In training, Brian and Peter watch Don and the Leeds team get off their bus. Peter marches into the Derby home dressing room, where the Derby players tuck the white shirts of their home kit into their shorts and sit on benches as Brian strolls in, standing at one end of the dressing room with his arms folded, casting an eye over the players sat on benches lining the walls. He strolls to the far end of the dressing room, kneels before a heavy-featured, sandy-haired lad, looks him in the eye, and the young man smiles bashfully and hangs his head as Brian rises to his feet, looks around the other players, and his eyes meet Dave Mackay's with whom he exchanges a respectful, knowing nod. Straightening his tie as he turns and walks across the dressing room, Brian sits beside a dark-haired, fresh-faced guy who's rubbing his thighs in agitation, apes a scared face, and then beams at the rest of the team. Brian nudges his shoulder against the young players, stands before the team, and a smile spreads across his face as he looks around the players. The Derby players leap to their feet and roar, red-faced, then run out of the dressing room, down the gloomy corridor, and up the tunnel into the daylight on the pitch. As play gets underway, the Leeds players, in their away kit of blue shirts and yellow shorts, pass the ball wide, while in his dingy office, Brian smokes as he watches the clock with sunlight streaming in from the terraces through the narrow windows set high in the stark walls.",
    "122": "Phyllis smiles faintly and covers the anklet with her dress. She rises and walks up and down, paying less and less attention. He consults the policies he is holding. Phyllis stops in her walk and sits down again, in the same position as before. His eyes fall on the anklet again. Neff takes his hat and briefcase, and they both move toward the archway. He walks out, handing her his hat and briefcase, and continues right on to a door lettered. Neff grins as he opens the door and goes into a minor executive office, not too tidy, with a large desk across one corner, good carpet, several chairs, a filing cabinet against one wall, and a dictaphone on the corner of the desk. On the other side of the desk sits Sam Gorlopis, a big, dumb bruiser, six feet three inches tall, wearing a dirty work shirt and corduroy pants, with rough, untidy hair, a broad face, and small piggish eyes. He holds a sweat-soaked hat on his knee with a hairy hand and sees Neff standing inside the door. He looks cautiously sideways at Keyes, pounds the pit of his stomach, and Gorlopis cringes under the impact. He puts a blank form in front of him and points; Gorlopis hesitates, then signs laboriously. He goes out, closing the door after him. Keyes takes his cigar stub from his mouth and turns it slowly in the flame of a lighted match, then turns to Neff. Neff walks out, still grinning, comes out of Keyes' office, and walks back along the balcony, past the activity of secretaries going in and out of doors, etc. Neff enters his own office, where Anderson, a salesman, sits at one of the desks, filling out a report. Neff goes to his own desk, looks down at some mail, reads it, sits down, and leafs through his desk calendar. The camera pans with Phyllis Dietrichson's feet and ankles as she comes down the stairs, her high heels clicking on the tiles. The anklet glistens on her leg as she moves, and the camera pans on. Phyllis reaches the entrance hall, and as she walks toward the front door her whole body becomes visible. She wears a gay print dress with a wide sash over her hips and opens the door. Outside is Neff, wearing a sport coat and flannel slacks. He takes his hat off and stands there with a little smile. He comes in as she leads him toward the living room. Phyllis and Neff come through the archway, she heads toward a low tea table which stands in front of the davenport, with tall glasses, ice cubes, lemon, a pot of tea, etc., and she pours herself a glass of tea.",

In the background, the ghost starts walking toward her. The shape moves forward. Laurie is sitting on the couch knitting. Laurie crosses to answer the phone. Lynda holds the phone to her ear. The ghost walks up slowly behind her. Laurie answers the telephone. He raises his hands to grab her. Lynda hears Laurie's hello as the ghost grabs the phone. He takes the telephone cord and wraps it around her neck. She squirms and writhes. He wraps the cord around her neck. Laurie hears squeals and rustling sounds across the phone. Laurie continues to hear weird sounds. He pulls tight. Lynda tries to fight off the ghost. Lynda gasps and tries to scream. The man pulls the cord tighter. She opens her mouth, trying to get air, then slowly slumps forward and remains motionless. Lynda reaches up and pulls on the sheet. It slides off the man, to reveal the grotesque Halloween mask. The shape picks up the receiver and puts it to his ear. Suddenly the phone goes dead. Laurie stares at the receiver, then hangs up. She crosses to the window and looks out toward the Wallace house. The street is quiet, dark, and windy. Bob's car is parked in front of the Wallace house. She stares at the house, puzzled. Laurie moves from the window back to the telephone and dials Annie's number. Laurie finally hangs up the phone. She stands for a moment considering it, then turns and walks upstairs. The kids are asleep. Tommy and Lindsey are sound asleep on the bed. She looks at them a moment, then closes the door behind her. Loomis sits in silence behind the hedge watching the Myers house. For a moment he glances back at the Myers house, then starts down the quiet residential street. He turns away from the street. It is empty except for a station wagon parked several blocks away. Then a thought strikes him. He looks again. Frustrated, he gets up and walks to the street. Slowly Loomis starts walking down the street toward the station wagon. Tracking shot with Loomis as he walks up the street. The station wagon moves closer. He recognizes it and races forward. Camera tracks in to the station wagon, right up to the state emblem emblazoned on the side. Loomis stands by his car glancing up and down the empty street. Finally, he makes up his mind and starts moving down the street, almost running, looking back and forth at the rows of houses on either side for something out of place.",
    "406": "He looks out the gap where the window should be and sees Dil in the lift. She passes by a gap in the wall and blows a kiss at him. Fergus walks out of the room and around the scaffolding. Dil sees him and waves, sits on some bricks, opens the hamper, and takes out a thermos to pour him some tea. Fergus smiles in spite of himself. She lowers her head, and he removes her glasses to look at her moist eyes. Fergus stands up suddenly, and Deveroux stares, suddenly chilled. Fergus looks down to Dil and holds out his arm. Dil gathers up her things and takes it, her face wreathed in a smile. Fergus walks her down the scaffolding ramp, and they descend from the site in the lift, which stops with a thud. She leans forward and kisses him. Fergus hears a wail of catcalls behind him and watches Dil go as the lift takes him back up to the site. Fergus stands outside the hair salon, as Dil, inside, throws off her smock and walks toward him with all the girls smiling. Fergus looks from Dil to the girls as they approach, and she takes his arm as they walk off. Fergus hears a car following them and turns around to look. They reach her door, and the car stops. Fergus kisses her and looks at her open lips as if in disbelief at himself. She goes inside, and Fergus walks into the room, turning on a small desk-light. Then he hears a voice and sees Jude sitting in the corner with her hair now dark brown. He stares at her, says nothing as she walks around the room, lies down on the bed beside him, takes off a black leather glove, and puts her hand on his crotch. He takes her hand away, and she looks at him hard. He leaps up from the bed, and she brings her lips close to his so they touch. He grabs her hair and pulls her head back, but she pulls a gun and sticks it between his teeth. Fergus stares at her, then says quietly. She kisses him briefly with the gun at his temple and then goes, leaving Fergus standing in the darkness. Fergus, walking toward the hair salon with flowers in his hand, stands outside watching with the flowers behind his back. Then the chair turns, and we see it is Jude. Fergus freezes, seeing Jude looking at him, smiling brightly, then talking back to Dil. Jude, turning in the chair, smiles brightly at something behind Fergus. He turns and sees Jude is there. Fergus stands suddenly, throws some money on the table, grabs her arm, and frog-marches her out.",
    "808": "They sit outside a cafe, while men watch them, and they smile. A waiter brings tea, and the old man eyes them stonily. Aisha looks at Ferris anxiously, then looks down. He leans to her, and she smiles slightly. They walk off as Marwan, dark-suited and imposing, approaches. Ferris pulls away from Marwan, and Aisha watches, concerned, as Marwan bundles Ferris into an SUV, which drives away with another SUV following. Aisha walks off. Ferris' brow is pinched as he is driven past the market square where a crowd watches a safe house burn, with golden flames bursting from the windows and rising from the roof. The SUV heads down a dark street, turns a corner, and stops near the burning safe house as a fire crew hoses the flames. Marwan and Ferris get out of the SUV, and Ferris steps closer to the blaze, holding his hand against his forehead. He squats down for a moment, then straightens up and turns to Marwan, who cocks his head back towards the SUV. The SUVs drive to waste-ground and park by a number of other vehicles with their headlights on, where men in dark suits stand around. Marwan shoves Ferris down a rubbish-strewn slope towards Hani, where one of Hani's agents, holding a gun, stands beside a figure kneeling with his head covered in a black hood and his wrists bound behind his back. Ferris and Hani face each other, and Ferris nods. Ferris watches Hani and his men, then looks at Skip with disdain, steps over, and leans down to him. Ferris punches and kicks Skip, who tumbles down the slope. Ferris spits at him and walks off, heading up the slope. Skip's hands remain tied behind his back. The white dome of the Capitol building rises up amongst the ordered grid of streets. Ferris sits alone at a cafe by a lake, drinking from a take-away coffee cup, as Hoffman walks over. Ferris kicks his chair over and Hoffman peers over his glasses at Ferris. A black SUV drives along a track through a forest and stops outside a house with two communications towers nearby. Ferris gets out of the SUV as a casually dressed, bespectacled man with light-brown hair walks up, smoking a cigarette. Ferris shakes hands with him and they smile, as Garland leads Ferris into the house while munching a strawberry. He leads Ferris through the large, cluttered living room where several computers are laid out on a table, and a parrot sits on a perch. Garland points at a screen and looks at photographs, then wrinkles his brow at Ferris. In a city of skyscrapers, cranes stand beside buildings under construction, which, without their glass cladding, resemble towering honeycombs. In a hotel room, Ferris rubs a towel over his wet hair then brushes on a foamy white solution.",
    "902": "One man sits splotch on, his head long back, trailing blood from two holes. Purvis stares, stunned, then opens a rear door. It's the G-men and gangster skirmishing. Homer runs the length of the barroom to a far window. John hustles downstairs, carrying two Tommy guns, hands one to Baby Face, and joins him at the barroom windows. Liquor bottles on the barroom wall explode. Upstairs Red and Johnny duck aside of their shattered windows and re-open fire. Agent Winstead takes his shots, and the wall chips above a guest room mirror. Purvis fires from behind the disabled car and peppers the plaster walls of Dillinger's room. We crouch between the gangsters in the second-story guest room, and our jerky view pivots from right to Dillinger. Outside FBI gunfire sprays a balcony. An adjacent window shows a gangster taking aim as the G-men resume firing. Agent Rice takes a shot in the leg. As Red delivers covering fire, Dillinger hustles to a guest room next door and butts a window with his gun. Dillinger and Red escape onto a rooftop and hop down to a dark yard at the other side of the launch. Now, in the barroom, a jerky close-up follows Baby Face, who backs up to a side door. Outside it opens and Baby Face fires towards the car. His shots send up clouds of dirt, but Purvis returns fire through the dust, splintering through the door. Inside, Baby Face flees past Homer and leaps through a bay window! As he runs off, Agent Pleg sees the criminal escaping. Purvis eyes Baum, who heads off. As Purvis shoots the side door, Homer fires back. Now, Baum dashes past Agents Clegg and Madala on his way to intercept the fugitive. Elsewhere, Dillinger and Red make their own escape through the woods. Winstead spots them, but they fail to notice him. Winstead and his partner move out in pursuit, now racing along a forested hillside with Red staying close behind Dillinger. A cloth sack dangles from Red's grip as both men hurry past a narrowed outcropping. Winstead and Hurt appear on the trail. As Dillinger and Red pass a misty overlook, the agents reach a stand of twin trees and split up, with Hurt taking to higher ground while Winstead advances on the trail. A view through the leafy canopy shows the criminals scurrying off. Winstead pitches his hat, sights the man, and fires. Dillinger retaliates. As Winstead dives into a roll, Dillinger's gun empties. Winstead kneels and opens fire. Red takes cover behind a tree, and Dillinger does the same. Winstead's shots clobber the trunk shielding Dillinger, who calmly reloads. His breath mists in the cold, night air as he leans out and fires.",
    "551": "Another Soldier leaps from the truck onto the tank and raises his knife as he grabs Indy. They struggle and fall. Indy sits up to see Vogel standing over him, who wraps a chain around Indy's neck. Indy appears at the entrance, the chain still wrapped about his neck and held by Vogel. Vogel pulls Indy from the tank entrance, yanking on the chain wrapped around his neck. A Nazi Soldier approaches, and Indy hits him, knocking him onto the tank tread. The Nazi Soldier screams as he is dragged under the rolling tank. Now Indy and Vogel struggle with one another, the chain still wrapped around Indy's neck. We see Indy and Vogel struggling atop the tank, and Indy lifts his feet, lunging toward the periscope and pulling Vogel with him. Indy's face is pressed up against the lens of the periscope. The Nazi Soldier looking through the periscope pulls away from it, smiles, then turns back to it. Indy's face, still pressed against the lens, is visible. Vogel pulls Indy from the periscope, and the Nazi Soldier pulls away from the periscope again. A troop truck pulls near the tank, and Henry fires the tank gun at the troop truck. Soldiers fly into the air, and the troop truck flips over and explodes. The explosion knocks Indy off the tank and onto the tread. He grabs onto the shredded gun protruding from the side of the tank. Vogel looks down at Indy and smiles smugly. The tank is approaching a cliff wall. As Indy tries to secure footing, Vogel steps on his hands. Brody looks at Henry. Vogel now swings a shovel at Indy, smashing at his hands. Brody climbs up out of the tank, followed by Henry. A Nazi Soldier appears and pulls Henry down. Vogel raises the shovel above his head and brings it crashing down on Indy, still hanging from the protruding gun. Indy loses his grip and now hangs from the gun suspended only by the strap of his leather pouch. He screams as the gun scrapes against the cliff wall, sending stones tumbling down over him. The Nazi Soldier knocks Henry into a pile of boxes, then punches him in the face. As the Soldier raises the gun to Henry's face, Brody hits him over the head with a canister. The Soldier falls, discharging the gun into the air. The bullet ricochets around the tank, past the Tank Driver who is manipulating levers at the control panel. Sparks fly; then the bullet pings against the window and ricochets once more, this time passing through the Tank Driver's hat. Blood flows from under the hat as the Tank Driver slumps forward, his body depressing the levers. Indy still hangs from the strap of his leather pouch as the tank swerves, barely missing the rocks and causing Vogel to fall.",
    "801": "He walks into Aisha's apartment and looks around, his face aglow with sweat. He goes into the living room. The TV is on. He tests the temperature of a pot of tea. Holding his gun, Ferris walks along the hall and goes into the kitchen. He sees a streak of blood on the side of a worktop and touches it. Ferris rubs the dark, sticky substance between his fingers. He walks out onto the balcony and makes a phone call. Marwan sits alone in a restaurant. Ferris walks up and two bodyguards stop him. Marwan goes to Hani. Hani leaves his attractive female companion and walks off with Ferris. They stand facing each other. Edgy, Ferris steps right up to Hani. Hani walks off. Marwan stops Ferris' firing. At an airport, a hangar door opens. Holding Aisha's phone, Ferris runs over to a small jet. Hoffman gets off with a bag slung on his shoulder. A message appears on the phone. There's a long phone number. Ferris makes the call. Ferris is dropped off in a village. A van rolls up. The driver gets out and opens the back. Ferris climbs in beneath the back seats and lies in the storage area. The driver, with thick stubble and cap, puts on a tape as he drives off. A bright golden sun shines across the desert. The van follows a line of cars and slows up. A soldier stands with an Alsatian. Another sits in the turret of a tank. A soldier waves the van over. The driver glances behind him. The soldier checks the driver's papers. Dar'a, Syria. The van drives through the desert, passing nomads with two camels. A golden sun hangs above mountains in the distance. The van travels across the barren and scorched land leaving a trail of dust. Viewed from the surveillance camera, the van is a dot on an expanse of light brown earth. The van stops. The driver opens the back. Sunlight floods in. Ferris hauls himself out. The driver beckons to him. The driver gets in the van and leaves. Ferris paces. Flat, golden, dusty earth dotted with small bushes stretches for miles. Clutching Aisha's phone, Ferris squats down and looks up into the clear blue sky. He runs his hand across his sweaty face. Hoffman is in the surveillance room, viewing Ferris from above. Ferris wanders across the dirt. Four SUVs appear and drive towards him. He stares at them. Ferris looks at the sky and puts his hands up. The team watch the surveillance screen. The SUVs drive in a circle around Ferris churning up a dust cloud, obscuring them. Men get out of the SUVs and go up to Ferris.",
    "1269": "Neville swings the sword of Gryffindor as a cloud of black smoke rises, cradling Hermione in the rubble, while the power fades in the Elder Wand. In the courtyard, Voldemort reels, and Harry turns to face him, prompting the Dark Lord's face to fill with fury. Red and green blasts meet in a brilliant white and orange glow as Harry presses forward, forcing Voldemort back as the energy from the Elder Wand dissipates and dies. Harry flicks his wand, sending the Elder Wand cartwheeling through the air across the courtyard, causing Voldemort to fall forwards as pieces of his skull break away. With his mouth gaping in horror, he looks up as his body and clothes disintegrate into thousands of tiny pieces that float upwards, and the morning sun shimmers through the mountains and Voldemort as they drift like ashes from a paper fire. Inside, exhausted students sit on the stairs, with Neville still holding the sword of Gryffindor, smiling as Luna sits down coyly beside him. Harry, holding a mug, wanders aimlessly through the Great Hall, congealed blood under his right nostril and bottom lip, and smiles when he sees the Weasley family together. He walks past chattering students, receives a weak smile from Cho Chang, and sees Aberforth chatting to Dean and Seamus. Harry stops in front of Hagrid, who hugs him and then studies him, causing Harry to grin as Hagrid turns and walks away. Filch makes a vain attempt to sweep up a mountain of rubble as Hermione and Ron walk into the Hall, causing Harry to smile when he notices they are holding hands and Hermione glances down coyly. Outside in brilliant sunshine, the three friends stroll aimlessly along the ruined bridge, and Harry steps up onto a broken stone support to look out, nodding to himself with the Elder Wand in his right hand. As Harry toys with it and studies it closely, he holds it horizontally in both hands. Hermione glances at Ron, and they exchange a look as Harry snaps the wand in two and flings both parts off the bridge into the chasm below. He nods to himself again and turns to the others before jumping down onto the bridge and walking away from them, with Hermione and Ron turning to watch him. He glances back at them, and Hermione strides up to Harry and takes his hand, looking at him admiringly, while Ron follows her and stands on her other side. She looks down and takes Ron's hand, and they stand on the rubble-strewn bridge with the ruined school behind them, gazing ahead. At St. Pancras Hotel, a grand building with a clock tower, inside nearby King's Cross Station, a dark-haired boy of 11 wearing a striped shirt wheels a trolley piled with luggage and an animal cage along a platform.",
    "644": "Jamal gulps his drink down quickly as the inspector makes to leave the room. Outside Javed's luxurious house, Jamal sees through the windows that much of the furniture has been removed and bangs his head on the door in frustration as the inspector leaves. Jamal looks down at the ground, exhausted. On TV, a news report shows, and Salim and Latika glance at each other and then back at the TV, where a livid scar is revealed along Latika's cheekbone. In the room with Jamal are a number of girls, thugs, and Javed, and Latika sees Jamal on the TV. Javed snatches the remote control and changes the channel, gesturing for the girls to dance. Latika leaves the room and Salim notices she's gone as scantily clad girls flood in with the thugs. A girl tries to dance with Javed while he's on the phone, but he bats her away and moves to a quieter room. Salim watches the girls cavorting with no interest, leaves, and joins Latika next door. Latika wipes tears from her face as Salim walks over and holds out a set of keys, which she takes. He shakes his head, takes out his phone, dials a number, then closes the phone and hands it to her, gently stroking her cheek near the scar. He holds the door open for her and closes it behind her as she dashes towards his car. Salim walks back to the main room where Javed is still on the phone. Latika starts the car as Srinivas throws water on a dozing Jamal. Latika drives at a high speed on packed roads as crowds cheer outside the studio where Jamal arrives in a police van with cameras flashing. Latika slows down as she hits major traffic jams in a gridlocked road while studio lights come on as technicians assemble equipment. An old woman sees Jamal in the van as the crowd begins to gather and people start to cheer, with people all over the country gathering in front of TVs to watch. Latika sits in her car in traffic as crowds stand outside electrical goods shops watching the show on TVs in the windows and an entire family has gathered to have supper in front of the TV. The main room at the Excel Five Call Center is virtually empty as a manager walks in, seeing the TV room packed with staff watching Jamal appear on the screen. In the studio, as the host leads Jamal to his chair, Latika decides to dump the car and walk. Latika stops outside the electronics shop and joins the crowd watching Jamal on the screen, as Jamal smiles, recollecting his teacher beating him with the book and sheltering from the rain as a child, saying she could be the third musketeer.",
    "388": "Quintana looks at Walter, and Jesus walks away as Walter nods sadly. We are looking down at the Dude who is prone on the rug, his eyes closed, wearing a Walkman headset. The Dude absently licks his lips as we faintly hear a hall rumbling down the lane. In his outflung hand lies a cassette case labeled VENICE. On its impact with the pins, the Dude opens his eyes, and a blonde woman looms over him. Next to her, a young man in paint-spattered denims stoops and swings something towards the carrier as a million stars explode against a field of black. The Dude is flying over the city, his arms thrown out in front of him, the wind whipping his hair and billowing his bowling shirt. Ahead, the mysterious blonde woman wings away, riding on the Dude's rug like a sheik on a magic carpet. She is outpacing us, growing smaller, and he looks up. The Dude does a couple of lazy crawl strokes and then notices that a bowling ball has materialized in his forward hand. His bemusement turns to concern over the aerodynamic implications just as the ball seems to suddenly assume its weight, abruptly snapping his arm down, and him after it. He is falling, and from a high angle, we see the Dude hurtling down toward the city, dragged by the ball. A reverse looking up shows the Dude hurtling toward us out of the inky sky, his eyes wide with horror. Led by the bowling ball, he zooms past the camera leaving us in black as dull reflections materialize in the darkness. They are glints off the shiny surface of an oncoming bowling ball. We pull back to reveal that the blackness was the inside of a ball return, and the gleaming bowling ball is being regurgitated up at us, overtaking us. The Dude looks up, up, up at the looming ball, its mass rolling a huge shadow across his face. The gleaming ball shows three dead black holes rolling toward us--finger holes--and the largest--thumb--hole rolls directly over us, engulfing us once again in black. The black rolls away and we are spinning--spinning down a bowling lane--our point of view that of someone trapped in the thumbhole of the rolling ball. We see the receding bowler spinning away; it is the blonde woman, performing her follow-through. Floor spins up at us and then away; ceiling spins up and away; the length of the alley with pins at the end; floor; ceiling; approaching pins; again and again. We hit the pins and clatter into blackness as we see pins spin, hit each other, and drop. They come from the Dude's Walkman, the headset of which is now askew, with one arm off his ear.",
    "815": "Rebecca notices a loose thread on her jacket and tears the sleeve. Alicia approaches Alette, while Rebecca, with her hair crimped, runs to a side table and tries to hide the tear using a canapé. As two women emerge from the powder room, Rebecca dives for the door, but her jacket catches on it, and beads tumble to the floor, causing her to fall into the arms of one of the women drinking champagne, who loses her balance. The jacket is pulled off Rebecca, who then assists the woman to her seat. Later, Rebecca is in the kitchen and, wearing a dress that resembles a waitress uniform, is pushed into the ballroom with a tray of food. Trying to return to the kitchen, a stern manager hisses at her, causing her to face Alette's table. She twirls around, bumps into a waiter, and sends fish flying. Luke stands up, takes Rebecca's trays, and Alicia purses her lips while Alette giggles. Later, on a romantically lit rooftop, Luke places his tuxedo around Rebecca's shoulders, gives her an enigmatic sideways glance, and they kiss. The next morning, Rebecca arrives at work in a red dress, with a fluffy orange shrug and swinging a matching orange bag, smiling softly as she rides the escalator. A man in a gray coat is on a lower escalator. She walks away coolly, bursts into a run, dives into a lift, and a black briefcase blocks the closing doors as Derek Smeath enters. Standing on the other side of the lift, she surreptitiously observes him: dark hair, pale complexion, glasses, gray raincoat. The lift stops at the Dantay-West Publications floor, a number of people exit, and Smeath glances at her, as more people board. She looks at his sturdy black briefcase, takes out her phone, and scrolls past Bergdorf, Bloomingdale's, and Chanel to Derek Smeath. She phones him, flashes a smile at a man entering the lift, but quickly cancels the call and puts the phone back in her bag. In horror, she rummages in her bag as the lift reaches Trout and Bass on the fifth floor, and she flees, glancing back as Smeath looks up and their eyes meet. He smiles slowly and smugly, and she dashes for the stairs, running through an office door as Smeath exits the lift. Rebecca freezes as Smeath is forcibly removed, and she watches him disappear, her tense smile relaxing. Finally, Alette's chauffeur-driven car arrives at a store.",
    "440": "He picks up a bottle. There is murder in his eyes. The proprietor is completely under the spell of that terrible glance. He hands over the bottle. Don takes it and walks out. Don enters, looks around the apartment, which is still in utter disorder. The electric lights, burning on heedlessly, offend him and he snaps off the light switch. Don, not noticing, walks to his big chair. On the small table next to it stand the three empty bottles. He takes the new bottle from his pocket and, sinking into the big chair, starts opening it. On the desk behind him, the telephone starts ringing. He sweeps them to the floor. Without winking an eyelash, he pours his glass half full, lifts it so that glass and hand obscure his face. In the dark sits Don, passed out. He opens his eyes, still in a half-stupor, stares straight before him. The bottle next to him is four-fifths empty. Out of the corner of one eye he sees something and slowly and with difficulty turns his head. In the wall above the couch, close to the door, there is a hole in the plaster, as if left by a large nail carelessly withdrawn so that some of the plaster went with it. Out of the hole peers a small mouse. At first Don draws back, repelled, but the mouse is such a friendly, harmless creature that after a moment his face relaxes and he half smiles at it. Just as he does so, from the direction of the window there whirs past him a strange winged thing. It is a bat, swooping in slow loops around the room. Don crouches into the back of his chair, staring in wild distaste. The top of the bat's hooked wing nicks his forehead as it speeds in swift but fluttering flight straight at the mouse. Don stiffens against the back of his chair. The bat has made another swoop and spread its wings over the mouse. Beneath those black wings some hideous pygmy struggle is going on. Apparently the bat has seized the mouse in its claws. Don gives a cry of horror. Now from behind the struggling wings comes a spurt of blood. Don cries out so hard his throat seems to burst apart, buries his horrified eyes in the back of his chair. She must have been listening from Don's first scream. Sophie, standing beside her, is barking wildly. From downstairs comes the barking of Mrs. Deveridge's dog. Beyond her, the door to her apartment is open. Don still cowers in his chair, his face hidden in his arms, his breathing heavy with terror. From outside comes the sound of footsteps racing upstairs toward his door, then the doorbell: short, short, long short.",
    "295": "Thorwald is at the door, unlocking it with his key. Lisa dashes back into the bedroom just in time to avoid being seen by Thorwald as he opens the door and enters the apartment. Stella is staring out, tense and frightened, while a policeman on the phone repeats with irritation. Her expression changes sharply as she glances slightly to the left. The first policeman indicates that Lisa is to come with him and pauses momentarily to tell the second policeman to take a statement from Thorwald about the attempted burglary. The second policeman reaches for the jewelry in Thorwald’s hand and takes it for examination. During a brief pause while the two policemen speak, Lisa starts waving her left hand behind her back. Jeff is looking through his camera, and Lisa stops waving and holds her fingers spread out, pointing to the wedding ring on her left hand. The lens pans upward and across, bringing Thorwald's profile into view as he looks down at Lisa's hands. He then slowly turns his head and looks directly into the lens, suddenly realizing that Lisa is signaling someone who is watching him. Jeff drops the camera into his lap as Stella hurries from the window, turning off lights, while Jeff backs his chair into the room. As Thorwald's attention is drawn back to the second policeman to answer further questions, the first policeman takes Lisa by the arm and leads her out of the apartment. Jeff points to a drawer in the wall cabinets, and Stella moves to get it. She finds a billfold and hands it to Jeff, who takes it, extracts some bills, and begins counting the money. He looks up sharply at Stella, then returns to counting as she comments. Jeff does, as Stella gets her purse. Thorwald leaves his apartment and proceeds down the corridor. Stella goes up to the door, and Jeff grabs it, picking it up. Stella pauses, and he hangs up just as Jeff looks toward Thorwald's apartment, puzzled by what he sees. Thorwald's apartment is completely dark, but Thorwald steps to the top of the stairs and is somewhat visible. Jeff still doesn't speak and moves forward a couple of steps. He grips the flash holder more tightly, lifting it slightly as if prepared to use it. Thorwald advances to the middle of the room, eyes on Jeff and hands clenching as he tries to control his anger.",
    "177": "The POV moves from the Jack-O-Lantern down to another window and peers inside, where the boyfriend grabs the sister and kisses her. Into the bedroom comes the sister, 18, very pretty, as Alan, 18, wearing a Halloween mask and a costume, enters. She giggles as the boyfriend jumps into the room. The boyfriend rips off his mask, revealing a handsome young man underneath, and they kiss again with more passion as she responds to him. The POV swings away from the window, pacing restlessly and agitated, and then springs back from the window, quickly stalking down the side of the house, past the Jack-O-Lantern, to a door, which is quickly opened as the POV moves inside. The POV glides silently through the house into the kitchen, up to a drawer, which is opened, and a large butcher knife is withdrawn. The POV swings around and moves to the kitchen door, looking down a hallway to the front door. The boyfriend is seen stepping out of the bedroom door, buttoning his shirt. Slowly, the POV moves into the room, focusing on the discarded Halloween mask on the floor, bending down to pick it up, then suddenly covering the POV with the mask through the eye-holes. The POV moves slowly down the hall to the bedroom door, peering inside where the sister sits at her night-table brushing her hair, still completely nude. The POV moves up behind the sister, and sensing a presence, she spins around, staring at the POV and covering her breasts quickly. Suddenly, the POV lunges forward as the sister continues to stare incredulously, and there is a rapid blur as the POV drives the butcher knife into the sister's chest and out again almost before it's seen. In a wild paroxysm, the butcher knife blurs in and out of frame, slashing the sister mercilessly as she begins to scream, tries to fend off the blows with her hands, then suddenly falls out of frame to the floor. The POV moves back away from the sister's lifeless body, spins around, and careens out of the bedroom at top speed, racing through the darkened house to the front door, out the door, down the steps, and rapidly up the street. The camera careens along in frenzied flight, up the sidewalk, up a small side alley, down someone's backyard, then comes to a sudden, abrupt halt in front of Mother and Father just coming out of a neighbor's house. The father's hand reaches up and rips off the Halloween mask, revealing Michael, 6, underneath, a bright-eyed boy with a calm, quiet smile on his face.",
    "1090": "Tuvia's hardened eyes flicker as he looks up at Aron and the people he has brought, some of whom are biting hungrily on mounds of hard bread, while Zus stands nearby looking uneasy and beckons to his older brother to join him out of earshot of the others. Tuvia sets off, leaving Zus looking unconvinced. In a dimly lit cottage, Tuvia pours out two vodkas as a dark-haired Russian sits down at his table, places a gun on the table, and Tuvia takes it, glancing at the wife's hostile face, pocketing the bullets, and tucking the gun into his belt. The wife is chopping meat while the men clink glasses, pour some away, and down the rest. Tuvia bites into a piece of bread, and the wife ignores him as Tuvia cracks a smile. A beam of light shines through the window as Tuvia dives out of the back door, and the wife quickly removes the glasses from the table. Tuvia climbs up into Koscik's barn, where half a dozen people are already hiding, as an official car draws up with its headlights blazing. Outside, Koscik is holding the vodka bottle. Koscik hands over the bottle, gulps back some vodka, and someone coughs in the barn as Bernicki passes the bottle to a colleague. In the barn, Tuvia takes out the gun and gulps back some more vodka. Bielski's eyes bulge, and he holds a finger at Koscik's head like a pistol, pats Koscik on the cheek, and goes. Bernicki and the two young men with him return to their car as Tuvia, in the barn, sighs with relief. Outside, Koscik hands out clothing to the Jews who were hiding, and Tuvia watches uneasily as Koscik gives him a bottle and a loaf of rye bread, looking at Tuvia with compassion and nodding. The two friends shake hands, and Tuvia strides past the little group of Jews who watch him uncertainly, he glances over his shoulder without slowing down, and they hurry after him in the forest. Early the next morning, one of the Jews comes up behind Tuvia, and a guy in a smart hat and coat leans against a tree to get his breath back. Later, the extended group is having a meal as a girl bites into a piece of fruit and passes it to her neighbor, and the woman in the beret takes a ladle full of soup and passes the pot to Shimon, the school teacher, who takes a ladle full and passes it to Aron who sits next to Asael. Zus is chopping at a tree as Tuvia, standing nearby, sees the old man burying his daughter. Zus ties some rope and goes, while Tuvia walks up a leafy slope towards the old man filling the grave with earth.",
    "461": "The Kid looks the same, pale and weak, but maybe he's gripping the sheets a little too tightly with his hands. His Grandfather says nothing, just waits. We're back in the boat. Buttercup is treading water. And we're back where we were at the last moment we saw her, Buttercup frozen, the Shrieking Eel, jaws wide, about to clamp down as we see a giant arm pounding the Eel unconscious in one move, then easily lifting Buttercup. The boat and Fezzik, with Buttercup being deposited on the deck. Inigo points behind them. Vizzini ties Buttercup's hands. The boat at dawn is being followed closely by the black sailboat, which we can see for the first time is being sailed by a Man in Black, and his boat almost seems to be flying. And once he's said the name, they rise straight up, sheer from the water, impossibly high, in a wild race for the Cliffs, and the Man in Black is closing faster than ever, but not fast enough, the lead was too great to overcome, and as Inigo sails with great precision straight at the Cliffs, Fezzik reaches up along the cliff face, grabs a jutting rock, reaches behind it. Suddenly there is a thick rope in his hands. He drops back to the boat, gives the rope a freeing swing, and the rope goes all the way to the top. He straps a harness to him, then lifts Buttercup and Vizzini in the harness. Finally, he himself gets in the harness. All three are strapped to Fezzik like papooses, and he starts to ascend the rope, carrying them all along with him as he goes. The Man in Black is sailing in toward the Cliffs of Insanity, watching as Fezzik rises swiftly through the first moments of dawn. Fezzik's group is only faintly visible far below. This is the first time we've gotten the real vertigo feeling, and it's a gasper. Fezzik climbing on. Buttercup is almost out of her mind with fear. Fezzik is moving right along; however high they are, he's already over a third of the way done. The Man in Black leaps from his ship to the rope, starting to climb. He's impossibly far behind, but the way he goes you'd think he didn't know that because he is flying up the rope, hand over hand like lightning. He prods Fezzik, who nods, and increases his pace. The Man in Black is roaring up the rope, cutting deeply into Fezzik's lead, and his arms begin moving much more slowly. Vizzini and the others are getting too close now. The Man in Black is less than a hundred feet behind them. Vizzini leaps off, takes out a knife, and begins to cut the rope, which is tied around a great rock, while Inigo helps the Princess to her feet and Fezzik just stands around, waiting for someone to tell him to do something.",

Xenophilius moves from the window and finds a piece of paper. He takes a pen and draws a vertical straight line. He looks up, brushing back his long, straggly hair. Next, he draws a circle which contains the bottom half of the wand. Finally, he draws a triangle, surrounding the wand and the stone. Harry nods. Hermione looks anxious. He examines the teapot. He scuttles down the spiral staircase. Ron picks up his rucksack. They find Xenophilius by a window, muttering to himself. He rushes to the front door. He holds it shut. Looking desperate, he turns and faces them. They stare at him blankly. His hand over his heart, Xenophilius approaches Harry. He pushes the hair back from Harry's forehead, revealing the jagged scar. He fixes his eyes on Harry. Death eaters hurtle through the sky towards the house. Harry, Hermione, and Ron throw themselves to the floor. Flashes ricochet off the building as Xenophilius runs outside. Xenophilius is hit and falls to the ground. In the house, the three friends clasp hands and disapparate. The house is destroyed. They apparate in a forest. Ron walks past Hermione. He stops as a man stands up in front of him. Three others appear. Scabior, the Snatcher who smelled Hermione's perfume, leans against a tree. She turns and runs. Leaving their bags behind, Ron and Harry follow her. Half a dozen Snatchers set off in pursuit. Scabior joins the chase. The Snatchers fire with their wands and start gaining on them. Harry glances behind, trips, and falls. He scrambles to his feet. Scabior is chasing Hermione. A Snatcher aims his wand at Ron. It extends with a chain which winds itself around Ron's legs, tripping him up and binding his ankles together. A young Snatcher is in close pursuit of Harry. Harry ducks under a fallen tree. A Snatcher leaps down in front of him. Harry stumbles. He recovers and runs on. A chain loops around a tree close to Hermione. She fires an explosive from her wand, sending a Snatcher to the forest floor. Another appears in front of her. She turns and aims her wand at Harry. He falls heavily. The young thief.

    "749": "She moves away from the door with a slow, unhurried pace and bursts through the bathroom door, finding Celia sitting in a pool of blood. Hastily picking up the fallen towel rack, Minnie calmly takes in the situation, pulls the counterpane over Celia who is laying down in her bed, and presses a wet cloth to Celia's neck. Minnie's encouraging expression fades as Celia's face crumples in a tearful grimace. Outside in her garden, Celia has dug a hole in the lawn, places a small square cardboard box into the hole, and starts to fill it with earth. Just in front of her, there are two rose bushes, each in its own brick-lined flower bed, and with the hole almost filled, she reaches for a third rose bush and places it into the hole. Out on the street, the yellow and green bus doors open and a stream of maids stepped down, with the last to emerge being Yule Mae and Aibileen. A police officer handcuffs Yule Mae, and Aibileen is pushed back against the side of the bus as Yule Mae is strung armed away, her face pushed down onto the bonnet of a police car, one of the men cautions her. Aibileen witnesses white mothers and their children turned away with studded indifference, and Hilly sits in her car with her son, her face impassive. Skeeter is at the counter in the diner as Hilly comes in, parks her son in one of the booths, and Henry, behind the counter, leans into Skeeter with his wise dark eyes peering at her through his owl-like glasses. She rushes over to Aibileen, finding the living room full of maids who all turn to look at her with their somber smooth-skinned faces as Aibileen beckons to her. Her eyes brimming with tears, she steps into the center of the room as a white-haired woman tells her story. Miss Tine, having lunch with two male colleagues in a swanky restaurant, is on the phone to Skeeter. An orange cruiser pulls into Elizabeth drive where the bridge launches in full swing as Mary Beth takes Skeeter's place at Hilly's table. Celia, wearing a low-cut fitted plum top over a tight pink skirt, sachets up the garden path carrying a pie. Elizabeth glances towards the door and Hilly's jaw drops, but Hilly takes control and ducks out of sight. At the front of the house, Celia sees a gap in the curtains and gives a cheery smile, which Hilly sees, causing Celia's friendly smile to fade. She retreats, taking her pie with her as Aibileen watches her humiliation from the doorway to the kitchen. On the way to her car, Celia fights back her tears, and back at home, Minnie looks at her like a mother talking to a small child who's just been bullied.",
    "658": "He's nowhere to be seen as they all troop into his room. Norman comes further in. Peter's clinging to the ceiling. Still in costume, he notices blood trickling down his arm, ready to drop. The others leave Norman in Peter's room. As he turns to walk out, the drop of blood falls to the floor. Norman's enhanced hearing picks up the sound of the drop hitting the floor. He looks around, spots the blood, then raises his eyes to the ceiling. Peter has gone. Norman screws up his eyes and heads for the open window. Norman leans over the balcony and looks down and up. Later, out of costume, Peter walks through the front door. Norman is sitting at the head of the table and Peter opposite MJ and Harry. Aunt May set an enormous turkey in front of Norman. Norman's picking at the sweet potatoes. Norman licks his fingers and looks malevolently at the white haired Aunt May. He picks up the carving knife and begins to sharpen it, a sneer on his face. Aunt May notices blood seeping through Peter's shirt. Norman glares at him. Norman is holding the carving knife, blade pointing at Peter. He lays it down and rises from the table. Harry races out after his father. Everyone has heard the conversation through the open door. MJ lowers her head. Peter glances at her as a dejected Harry comes back into the room. Norman's in his living room. He talks to the Goblin mask. Aunt May's in her bedroom. The explosion rips out the wall. The Green Goblin glides in. Aunt May is lying on the floor, leaning against her bed. Later, Peter rushes into the hospital. He runs to her room. Peter is pushed out of the room. He leans against the corridor wall, deep in thought. Peter's bright blue eyes twitch nervously. He looks one way down the corridor, and then turns to look the other way. Now he sits by his aunt's bedside. She's sedated. The young man takes his aunt's hand in his and gently strokes it with his thumb. On the bedside cabinet is a framed photograph of her, Uncle Ben, and Peter. Peter studies it grimly. He shifts his gaze back onto his aunt and swallows, before speaking. The next day, MJ comes to visit. There's flowers. The young red-head looks down at the peaceful figure on the bed. The two are sitting opposite each other. He's staring straight into her eyes. She smiles a little. Peter averts his gaze, nods his head, then looks down at the floor. Unknown to them, Aunt May's eyes are open. She's overheard. She smiles, then closes her eyes again. MJ reaches out and gently takes hold of Peter's hand.",
    "330": "Gandalf rises to his full height, his eyes flash, his shadow suddenly seems to fill the room. Bilbo lifts his knapsack and heads for the front door. Bilbo pulls out the ring and stares at it in his palm. With all his willpower, Bilbo allows the ring to slowly slide off his palm and drop to the floor. The tiny ring lands with a heavy thud on the wooden floor. Bilbo staggers out of Bag End and braces himself in the night air, pale and trembling, as if his loss of the ring has weakened him. Gandalf steps up behind. The ring is glinting on the floor, and Gandalf circles around it, a puzzled look on his face. Gandalf slowly reaches for the ring. Gandalf is sitting in front of the fire with his pipe, staring into the flickering flames. Frodo rushes into Bag End and stops to pick up the ring at his feet. Gandalf continues staring into the fire, as if locked in thought. Gandalf turns, his eyes locking onto the ring in Frodo's fingers. Gandalf holds out the envelope and Frodo drops the ring into it. Gandalf seals the envelope with wax and hands it to Frodo. Gandalf is already at the door and turns to Frodo. Gandalf hurries out the door, leaving Frodo standing alone in Bag End. The camera pushes in, and the hum of the ring comes up on the soundtrack. The camera pushes through the white paper to the ring, beneath which the whispered murmur of Black Speech can be heard. The huge dark tower of Barad-dûr is being rebuilt. Thousands of orcs crawl over the surface, hauling stone and iron up the towering heights, which grows and spreads across the red-streaked sky, casting a shadowy pall over the nightmarish landscape. Nine Black Riders burst out of Minas Morgul and charge toward the camera. A lone horseman gallops to the crest of a hill on the west road. On the main highway south to Minas Tirith, he looks toward the saw-toothed mountains of Mordor. He is seeping out across the blood-red sky, his face grave. He spurs his horse on, making his way down into the lower depths of the citadel. Pages flip as Gandalf searches ancient scrolls and books placed high on a wooden table. His eyes settle on one old parchment. He murmurs hurriedly to himself, reading. Farmer Maggot is chopping wood in his garden. Snorting horse nostrils as the shadow of a black rider looms over a Hobbit house. Terrified, Farmer Maggot cowers in his doorway, and Fang, his dog, whimpers and backs away. The black rider gallops away at speed. Frodo farewells Sam outside Bag End and heads towards the front door. A creepy point of view from inside Bag End shows Frodo coming up the path. Frodo enters Bag End and immediately pauses, sensing that something is amiss.",
    "1176": "They sheath their swords and join the black chess pieces. Ron climbs onto the stone horse of the black knight and looks across the board as a white pawn moves itself forward. Hermione looks at Ron anxiously, and obeying Ron's instructions, a black pawn moves forward and is sliced off by the white pawn. The game gets underway; a white bishop explodes, a white knight hits the dust, and a black pawn is destroyed. A white bishop and a white knight explode, and the white queen attacks a black castle, which explodes in a shower of stone fragments and collapses in a pile of rubble. The queen turns triumphantly. Ron contemplates his next move, and watching the merciless white queen, Harry suddenly understands the game that Ron is playing and nods. Taking a deep breath, Ron clutches the horse's reins, closes his eyes, and the black horse starts to move across the board between the remains of the shattered stone chess pieces. Ron looks nervously at the white king, who wears a silver helmet, clasping a powerful sword with his hands encased in metal armor. Ron braces himself as the white queen slowly turns and moves steadily across the board, heading straight towards Ron's black horse. He clings onto the reins, shaking with fear, as the queen gets closer and closer, gliding over the smooth marble floor. She stabs the black horse, causing Ron to fall off, and the horse crashes beside him. Hermione steps hurriedly back onto her square and looks anxiously towards Ron, who is lying unconscious. Harry moves into the winning position and confidently looks up at the white king, whose huge sword falls from his hands and lies on the marble floor at Harry's feet. He and Hermione run to Ron and kneel beside him. Harry gets to his feet, and still kneeling beside Ron, Hermione watches him go. Outside the chess room, Harry walks cautiously down a flight of white dimly lit stone steps. As he descends the stairs, he touches the scar on his forehead and sees a figure wearing a turban looking into the Mirror of Erised, Professor Quirrell. Harry touches his scar as Quirrell stares into it and stretches out his hand, drawing Harry reluctantly towards him. Harry looks into the Mirror of Erised and stares at his reflection, which stares back at him, then puts its hand in its pocket, takes out a red stone, winks at Harry, shows him the stone, and puts it back in its pocket. Secretly, Harry feels in his own pocket and finds something there. Quirrell looks impatient as Harry backs away, standing with his back to the mirror, and Quirrell unwinds the turban from his head.",
    "1276": "They stare in horror at the gaping drop ahead of them as a hand tosses up a wand, then a second hand appears, and finally, Neville's head, as he pulls himself up. An army of Dementors, Death Eaters, and Giants make their way towards the school from the other side. Flitwick backs away between ranks of the Stone Army as a Giant approaches, but vines strip up the giant and pin him to the ground. Death Eaters swoop down, aiming blasts of green light at the Stone Warriors, while two bold giants swing between pronged weapons and knock people flying, plowing through the Stone Army in pursuit of the tinny Professor Flitwick. An explosion rips through the courtyard, and people run for cover as parts of the school are ablaze. Death Eaters burst into a tower, and Arthur Weasley fends one of them off while Kingsley Shacklebolt suspends another in midair, then sends him flying back out of the window. Hurrying down the stairs, Harry turns and propels a third Death Eater before continuing down the stairs. Neville sprints off, and amidst the mayhem, Ginny and Harry kiss before she runs upstairs. Draco grabs two cronies and frog marches Blaise and Goyle away. Harry runs along a corridor where the roof is collapsing, avoiding the falling rubble, and stops suddenly as he reaches a black stone wall—the entrance to the Room of Requirement. He concentrates as Ron studies the Marauder's Map, looks up from the map, and stares ahead wide-eyed. Draco sees the entrance door to the Room of Requirement, turns to his cronies, and as they run towards the door, it disappears and becomes a blank wall again. Inside, Harry sees a cavernous storeroom stacked high with furniture and junk, making his way deeper into the room along the aisles between the stacks, roving around as he continues searching the vast space, passing books, statues, gold, and silver ornaments, striding at a breathtaking pace. A winged blue Pixie watches him from high up on the top of a gold picture frame and flutters lower to get a closer look. Harry stops and listens, turns around, and gazes back the way he came. He walks very slowly and deliberately, drawn towards a clothed table piled high with bric-a-brac, moving a coil silk rope aside to find a plain wooden casket. He pulls the casket forward, unfastens it, and opens the lid to reveal the diadem, a silver tiara in the shape of a raven with a huge blue stone in its center, and another stone hanging from it in the shape of a tear. Blaise glances across at Goyle, and the spells collide, with the diadem thrown into the air.",
    "866": "The letter is addressed to Marius, and Eponine opens it, reads it, and looks distressed. Rain pours down, soaking the cobbled street as Eponine slowly walks through the darkness, soaked to the skin. Student protesters and townspeople line a street by the Place de la Bastille, while Gavroche and the urchins are in the elephant. Soldiers march down the street followed by cavalry, with the large black hearse for General Lamarque behind them. Enjolras waves a red flag and climbs onto the street, joined by Marius and the others. Javert is in the crowd as the cavalry face the protesters, who are grouped around the hearse. Enjolras and Marius cock pistols as soldiers raise their swords and aim their muskets. A soldier shoots into the crowd, hitting a woman who collapses. Cavalry charges, and men exchange fire with the soldiers. Enjolras shoots as one of the students, Courfeyrac, is knocked down, but Javert, dressed as a civilian, helps him up. Marius rides down the street as a cart is overturned and furniture is thrown from windows to build the barricade. A cannon is pulled into place, and students shoot from behind the barricade. People with guns chase the cavalry down the street, and protesters run through the streets. Marius finds a canoodling couple as a table is taken, and he beams with excitement while Courfeyrac calls out. Tables and pianos are thrown from windows. In a cafe, Javert steals a rosette and pins it to his dark jacket. A couch and a cart form the barricade, which blocks the street, and an old woman is kissed as her chair is taken. Javert takes a pistol. A red flag is thrown to Marius, and Enjolras climbs onto the top of the barricade and waves the flag while people wave tricolors from their windows. Javert returns, and they raise their weapons. Javert throws off the men holding him and lays a few punches, but the students overwhelm him as Enjolras knocks him out with a club. Enjolras and Marius look around with concern, grab their weapons, and head to the barricade with the group. A woman closes her shutters, and the students man the barricade and aim their weapons. A platoon of soldiers marches up the street to face them as light flickers on Enjolras's face and sparking gunpowder lights up the street. Students return fire as soldiers climb up the barricade and shoot through it, leaving a soldier dead on top. Marius grabs a barrel of gunpowder, which flames up, and Gavroche calls out. Eponine is behind the barricade and grabs a musket aimed at Marius, getting shot in the process. Marius has a torch and lowers the flaming torch towards the gunpowder. The officer turns to his men, who back away. Breathless, Enjolras takes the torch from Marius.",
    "1189": "Buckbeak lifts his head, opens his beak, and grabs a bat. The bats fly out into the open and swoop low over Harry and Hermione's heads, and they look back towards the hippogriff. In the distance, they see again the dog and the werewolf fighting by the willow tree, and Harry and Hermione run through the undergrowth. Ahead of them, the werewolf flings the dog against the rock, and Harry sees himself throwing a stone and the werewolf turning and advancing on him. Hermione howls as they race back the way they came through the moonlit forest, stumbling over the uneven ground. Close behind, the savage werewolf lopes easily after them, and Harry trips over a tree root, but Hermione helps him up. Eventually, they stop to catch their breath, hiding behind the gnarled trunk of a huge tree. The werewolf sniffs the ground and then disappears around the other side of the tree, and they look around cautiously before creeping away nervously. The vicious creature appears behind them; it moves forward and rears up, about to strike. Flapping his huge wings, Buckbeak attacks, claws the werewolf with his talons, and it slinks away. Hermione hides her face on Harry's shoulder as a blast of air scatters the dry leaves at their feet. They look up to see a swarm of Dementors moving ominously across the sky, and holding Hermione's hand, Harry leads the way towards the lake. On the stony shore at the far side, he sees himself and Sirius lying unconscious beside him, while the hooded Dementors fly low over the frozen lake and swoop down again and again as they attack the two helpless figures. The Dementors hover above Sirius as Harry runs out from the trees. Standing at the edge of the lake, he points his wand, summoning all his strength, and the wand pulsates with energy and a silver mist comes from it, forcing the Dementors back. The light from the wand glows even more strongly, forming a bright protective shield which spreads to the other side of the lake. The Dementors swirl angrily above his head, still trying to reach the figures on the opposite shore, but Harry concentrates even harder, and they retreat. He sees himself staring from the other side of the lake, then falling unconscious beside Sirius, as the light from Harry's wand fades. Buckbeak flies Harry and Hermione back to the school, swooping over Hogwarts Castle, and the hippogriff glides down towards the dark tower where Sirius is imprisoned. Hermione opens the barred door of his cell, and Buckbeak carries Hermione, Sirius, and Harry away from the dark tower. Beating its huge wings, the hippogriff swoops down towards the ground, and Sirius lays his hand on Harry's heart before climbing onto Buckbeak's back and smiling at Hermione.",
    "771": "While Kate tends to Tenzen, she turns and realizes Noah is nowhere to be seen and finds his jacket before submerging herself under the water. Meanwhile, Noah swims away, and underwater, Jackson swims using a torch for illumination, spotting something. Jackson surfaces, then dives back underwater as the ark floats towards Everest. Adriane turns on the monitor, showing Jackson in the chamber struggling to free Tenzen's power drill. Jackson looks up and sees a light and Noah, and Noah joins his father underwater, where his torch beam shows the drill wrapped around the gears. Father and son surface while Kate gapes and stares into the blackness as Tenzen addresses his family and shakes his head. The water level rises, and Nina glances up, seeing a giraffe beyond the grill in the ceiling. Jackson is underwater as the ark thumps into a glacier, attempting to pry the power drill free while the ark scrapes against the mountain. Laura and Lily are buffeted by the shake, and as the ark approaches Everest, the fume from the hydraulic chamber is cut. Jackson wrenches the cable free, the gears start to turn, and the gate starts to close. He releases the drill, and part of the mountain breaks in pieces as the ark moves ever closer to a collision. It strikes Everest, and those on the bridge see an avalanche of snow descend, but the ark continues on its voyage away from Everest. Noah surfaces on the hydraulics chamber in front of Kate, and mother and son duck under the water, then resurface. Those on the bridge and in the zoological bay listen, hanging on the pipes, and look into the darkness. A torchlight beam shines underwater, and Jackson surfaces. Kate and Noah hug, and Anheuser looks around at the people on the bridge cheering and hugging one another. Scotty embraces Professor West, and with Kate and Noah still hugging, Jackson glances across to Nina and Tenzen and gets a thumbs up, to which Jackson nods. The group is still treading water as the ark continues on its voyage away from the world's highest mountain. Adriane works on a laptop in his quarters with Laura sitting behind him reading a book. Adriane takes off his glasses and smiles, Laura closes the book and smiles, and they are both on their feet. He walks over to her, and they get so close to kiss before he makes to move away. She puts her arms around his neck and kisses him more intensely. Meanwhile, Lily spots little Caesar, and Alec Karpov hands Lily the dog. Jackson approaches Kate as the massive door opens, and hundreds of people stand staring out as daylight starts to flood the interior. Lily, holding Caesar, and Noah, clutching his mom's hand, stand beside Kate with Jackson directly behind her.",
    "1331": "In response to that, Charlie does the only thing someone can do when told such a thing: she laughs. At this, Charlie goes white, the realization hitting her, and Michael nods. Charlie sways on her feet, and Jeep rests a hand on her shoulder, steadying her. With a clank, Michael re-arms his weapon and turns to the group with finality, while Percy looks at him skeptically. Kyle looks at Percy with fear in his eyes, then turns back to the darkness and the evil that surrounds them. Bob plays with his trusty zippo with one hand and grills up some steaks with the other, pausing to take a slug from a can of beer. Sandra sits at the counter across from him, staring at a prescription bottle tipped in front of her, pills spread around. Bob glances over, sees the devastation in her eyes, pulls another can of beer from underneath the counter, pops it, and places it in front of her. She looks up at him, smiles weakly, and takes a sip. The moment the words leave her mouth, the grief hits her again. Meanwhile, in a booth across the diner, Audrey is fiddling with Percy's old radio. At the front of the diner, Jeep silently helps Michael nail broken table planks across the shattered window, eyeing the strange tattoos running down Michael's arms and the two jagged wounds visible above his shirt line. Michael considers the question a beat, then drives the last nail into place, securing the window. He pauses a beat as if unsure how much to say, then heads for the roof, leaving Jeep to stare after him, deep in thought. The faintest glint of sunlight shines through the dark red dusty haze as Michael searches the horizon in front of the diner for movement. On the other side of the roof, Bob keeps watch, struggling to stay awake as his eyes droop closed. Sandra awakens with a start, spins around, and searches for who is calling her name. She turns to face the back door, which is blocked by a desk, and slowly approaches it. Sandra is stricken and notices the transom window above the door. She climbs onto the desk and stretches up until she can see out, finding Howard, her husband, there. His skin is covered with horrible black boils that are breathing, and Sandra goes slack with horror. She struggles against him, throwing a wild elbow that tags Kyle in the face, causing Kyle to go down just as Sandra is about to open the door when Audrey pounces on her. Percy springs up as Howard is nailed to the upside-down cross below, and Audrey rushes into the room to stop her mother, Sandra, who then slaps Audrey hard, causing Audrey to stumble over Kyle and hit the floor.",
    "1212": "He sees the cloth with the twine wrapped around it. He picks up the cloth, revealing the triggered bomb mechanism beneath. The claymore ignites the Tall Boy Missile, which erupts into a mushroom cloud of smoke and flame. The blast tears through trees and shrubs and spreads out like a concentric wave of destruction from its epicenter, throwing up dirt and leaves and knocking over soldiers. Sarah and School Boy watch. From the river, the tall boat captain notes the grey smoke from the explosion on land and signals with his hand. The boat moves off. Sarah and School Boy keep running. The patrol boat zips along the river. Sarah and School Boy run down a leafy path. He motions her to stop. They crouch. He rests his rifle on a tree and uses the site as a telescope. She looks. The escapees are being kicked and beaten by soldiers. School Boy lifts his rifle off the tree and searches the area using the sight. In his cross-hairs is the commander's truck with its machine gun operator. Sarah and School Boy are on a hill overlooking the harbor. Soldiers kick and stomp on the mercenaries and missionaries, who cover their heads with their hands. Some of the troops use the butts of their rifles to inflict blows. The commander supervises. The commander beats them with a stick. The commander whips them with his stick. Reese's lips move, as if in silent prayer. The commander jabs his stick into Lewis' shredded leg. The group are dragged to their knees and lined up in front of the troops, who raise their rifles execution-style. Michael stares hopelessly ahead. From above, Sarah and School Boy look distraught. The troops take aim. The group have their hands on their heads. En-Joo spits on the ground. The gunner on the Jeep watches intently, not seeing Rambo rise behind him. Rambo cuts off his head with a machete. He shoots the Jeep driver with the machine gun. He turns the gun around on its turntable and begins picking off the Burmese troops. From his vantage point, School Boy lines off troops in his sights. A single shot from School Boy rips through two soldiers in tandem. Sarah covers her ears and shots arise. The remains of the Jeep driver tumble off the vehicle. A group of soldiers are cut in two. A soldier's leg is severed at the knee, and he falls over. En-Joo finds a weapon and starts shooting. Lewis grabs a soldier by the leg and pulls him over, head-butts him unconscious, and spits on him contemptuously. Reese pulls a knife from his boot and stabs a trooper. Lewis finds a weapon and dishes out mayhem of his own.",
    "648": "He moves carefully with the spoon over to the table and opens Arvind's eyelids to pour in the liquid as Salim can watch no more and kneels to vomit. Maman watches impassively as the bearded man binds Arvind's eyes with the bandage and pats his head, then Maman looks at Salim and nods. The bearded man prepares another spoon of liquid, and shock registers on Salim's face as he is rooted to the spot with Maman drawing closer to him. Maman crouches in front of Salim and gestures for Punnoose to follow him, while Jamal starts to dance. Salim appears, and they shake hands as Jamal follows Salim back to Maman with Punnoose following behind. Salim leads Jamal towards Maman and his bearded henchman followed closely by Punnoose, as Latika spies on the scene. Maman and his henchmen look at Jamal astounded while Latika snickers as she watches Jamal pocket the 50 rupee note. Punnoose gestures to Salim to pick up the cloth and the chloroform bottle, then Salim takes the bottle and suddenly throws the contents at Punnoose's face. Salim, Jamal, and Latika run through a forest chased by Maman, Punnoose, and the bearded henchmen until they come to a railway siding where they chase a departing train. Salim is in front and manages to grab hold of the last carriage of the train, and Jamal then reaches out and grabs a hand hold on the train. The men close in on Latika who is still chasing the back of the train while Salim stretches out his hand and Latika touches his fingers when Salim suddenly pulls back. Latika is left standing on the tracks as Maman reaches her and scoops her up while Jamal looks stunned. Jamal looks around the dark railway carriage where men are lying down watching them while Punnoose holds Latika as Maman watches the train. On the game show, the host stares at Jamal, and then Jamal is seen in the police station. Young Salim and Jamal sit on the roof of the moving train, with Salim staring at a pensive Jamal, then wrapping an arm around him as the boys start selling fruit, nuts, even balloons to passengers on the train. Salim counts their earnings while Jamal daydreams and remembers a young Latika standing on the tracks as the train pulls away, sitting on the buffers between two carriages chatting with Salim as the train winds its way through lush forests and across wide expanses of Indian countryside. Salim and Jamal sell trinkets to passengers as the two brothers sleep in sacks of vegetables, but the guard rouses them and throws them off the train, with Salim later sounding on the roof of a train, hauling Jamal up on a rope. As the train speeds through the countryside, the two brothers doze on the roof, gripping each other's hands.",
    "1044": "Enrique takes the gun from his holster and checks the magazine, then he cocks the gun. His arms, face, and hair are wet with sweat as he steps out from behind a pillar and looks along the road, glaring. Suddenly, the story rewinds to Enrique cocking the gun, being hit by the first car, seeing Veronica in the ambulance, Holden aiming his gun at him, the explosion, being tackled by Barnes and the man Veronica was with, and the clock reaches twelve noon. In the enclosed Plaza Mayor, a seething crowd watches a helicopter overhead. The man in the checked shirt, Howard Lewis, is videoing. He records the upper windows and one of the many arches in the plaza while kids shout hello from some of the balconies. Howard walks away from the kids and resumes videoing. The timer on his LCD screen reads nearly two hours and two minutes as he strolls deeper into the crowd, his camera focused above their heads. He pans his camera around, and on the LCD screen he sees Veronica by the pillar with the young man Enrique saw her with. He zooms in as she places something in his hand and clutches his palm, then lowers his gaze and stops filming as their heads move closer. Howard films some more until a short man approaches him, and a little girl bumps him with her ice cream. Sam leaves, and the little girl sobs. Howard bends down and asks her name, but Anna is dragged off by her mother, glancing back. Alerted by applause, Howard goes into record mode as President Ashton steps up onto the podium and shakes the Mayor's hand. Howard moves forward as the Mayor walks to the lectern, his eyes fixed on the LCD screen, grinning. Howard's camera pans to take in Barnes looking upward and speaking into his cuff mic. Howard wheels around and focuses on the moving curtain, looks up from the screen, and sees a shadow behind the curtain, keeping his camera focused on the shadowy figure. He then turns as the President is shot. Howard keeps the tape running as Holden and Matthews race to the President, and the crowds peel back from the podium. Howard spins back to the now open window, then to the podium as Enrique leaps onto it. The video captures Barnes tackling Enrique, and despite the chaos around them, Howard continues to videotape the events in front of him. Howard tapes Veronica tossing her bag under the podium and fleeing, while the crowds grow more restless upon hearing the distant explosion. Anna has lost hold of her mother's hand, and panicking people flee and stand on those who have stumbled. Howard uses his cell phone.",
    "1175": "They rush up to her desk and slowly turn and leave. Outside in the corridor, he stares hard at Harry as Snape stalks away along the corridor, his black cloak billowing behind him. The school is silhouetted against moonlit clouds. Harry, Ron, and Hermione creep downstairs into the common room, where they spot Neville's toad. Neville gets up from a chair, freezes, and falls over backwards. Leaving Neville, they all huddle under the invisibility cloak as Hermione unlocks the door on the third floor. A harp is playing by itself, and they take off the cloak to see the three-headed dog is asleep. They take hold of it and between them, they push the dog's huge paw off the trapdoor. The dog breathes out, and they stagger back, lifting the wooden cover to stare down into the black hole beneath. Dog dribble hits Ron as the dog opens its three mouths. They throw themselves into the hole as the dog destroys the trapdoor. They have landed on something soft, but the plant begins to move, slithering tentacles snake over them, twisting around their arms and legs, and twining around their necks. The boys struggle to free themselves as Hermione suddenly slithers out of sight, and Harry slithers after her. She points her wand and a flash of light dissolves the plant, allowing Ron to fall through to join them. Harry frowns at him, and they go through a door into a room with solid stone pillars. Small winged objects flit above their heads, and a shabby broomstick is hanging in the air. Ron tries the locked door as Harry looks at the broomstick, nods, puts out his hand, and takes hold of it. At once, the hundreds of metal keys swarm dangerously around his head. Harry climbs onto the broomstick and steers it upwards, suddenly spotting the key with a broken wing as it zooms upwards out of his reach. He points the broom after the key as it flies towards a high window. It turns back and Harry grabs it, throwing it to Hermione who quickly puts it into the lock. The flying keys go mad and chase after Harry like a swarm of bees as Hermione and Ron push open the door and Harry zooms inside. The door closes after him, and unable to stop, the keys herd into it. A room full of strange shadows, with huge broken stone statues lying about the floor. Ron, Harry, and Hermione come into the gloomy room and walk slowly between the piles of shattered figures as Ron looks around the room. Torches flare up showing a floor of huge black and white squares, and great stone chess pieces face each other across the enormous marble chessboard with fierce warriors barring their way with drawn swords. The white pawns.",
    "899": "As the blonde man draws closer, Dillinger grabs him in a chokehold and aims a gun at Gilbert. He cocks his head. D'Andrea looks at Gilbert whose hand rests on his gun. He turns to Dillinger and Red. Dillinger tosses the blonde man away. D'Andrea sits calmly on the edge of a desk. Dillinger holsters his gun. Dillinger knits his brow thoughtfully then meets D'Andrea's gaze. D'Andrea shrugs. Dillinger glares at D'Andrea, his lips curved into a frown. The mustached gangster leans in closer. Dillinger tilts his head, his eyes narrowing as he meets D'Andrea's gaze. He turns away. Dillinger and Red exit. Now, Hoover and Purvis walk down a hall. Outside, Hoover turns from Purvis and heads over to a group of well-dressed boys standing in two lines. They shake hands. Hoover faces the press. In a movie theatre, the event plays on a newsreel. Dillinger talks to the rugged gangster. Dillinger nods his head at Shouse. A photo of Dillinger appears onscreen. Dillinger subtly covers his face. Shouse stands and Red yanks him back into his seat. Homer looks away nervously. As Dillinger sits with a worried look, his face tilted down, the overhead light turns on, bathing the audience member's faces. The audience turns, peering at the people to the right. The audience turns again. As the audience members settle their eyes back toward the front, the lights fade down and a new story begins. Tommy turns to Dillinger. Dillinger rubs his lips thoughtfully as he looks at Tommy and nods. He exchanges a glance with Red and they rise, grabbing their coats. A few rows ahead, Homer puts on his hat and steps into the aisle behind them. As they exit the theater, Red moves closer to Dillinger. People mill around a town square. A stiff wind flutters the awnings of a storefront. On the far side of the square, a policeman pulls up on a motorcycle. Inside a bank, Baby Face stands on a table and fires his gun through a window at the policeman. He fires at the ceiling. Outside, Homer grabs a man and holds him hostage. Inside, Dillinger and Tommy exchange an exasperated look. From inside a vault, Dillinger tosses a bag to Tommy. He guides the bank president by the shoulder. A woman joins the bank president. The gangsters shield themselves with the hostages as they exit the bank. They pass Homer, who waits outside by their car with his own hostage. Baby Face fires wildly into the town square. Two men dive to the ground. From a window across the street, a man aims a gun. Dillinger lurches forward, his eyes wide. He drops to a seated position, his gun still raised, then notices Tommy who lies on his stomach in a pool of blood.",
    "536": "Holly, excited, runs over to April, who is busy taking the Stroganoff out of the oven, and April, wearing the same uniform as Holly—a black skirt, white shirt, and black bowtie—holding the Stroganoff, dashes out of the kitchen to serve the party guests. Holly calls after her, offscreen, as David walks past the hurrying April into the kitchen and walks over to Holly, who is busy at the pot-and-pan-covered stove. As Holly carries the quiche outside to the party, April comes back into the kitchen from another doorway, walks past David to a counter where she begins to fold napkins, and David leans back against the sink. They shake hands, and April walks offscreen to another area of the kitchen. Holly picks up a napkin from the crowded table, and David walks around the table, putting the plate of clams down on the already crowded surface. Holly follows him, chuckling, throwing her napkin into an offscreen garbage can as David stops at a small television set near the doorway. Guests in the other room can be seen chatting together in clusters, while canned laughter and miscellaneous chatter are heard from the television set. David watches the set, still munching on a clam, while Holly and April reassure him offscreen. David checks his wristwatch as Holly walks over to him, chuckles as David, listening to April, impressed, walks over to her, as she is standing by the table. April chuckles as Holly walks back onscreen, busy preparing another tray of hors d'oeuvres, and the three exchange glances. Holly shrugs, and a contemporary red building, designed by David, is seen, squeezed in between two older buildings. Holly, April, and David talk offscreen, and the film moves down from the buildings to reveal the trio sitting in David's Jaguar across the street, with David and April in the front seat and Holly scrunched up in back, her head slightly forward. David turns and briefly glances at Holly, then turns back to April. The screen, which has been exploring the rococo building's facade, now shows the equally elegant building alongside it. The film moves from the two elegant facades to show an ugly, ultra-modern structure covered with tiny, diamond-shaped motifs, then moves from the ugly facade to the building's equally ugly entrance, where a large car is parked right in front of the building. The group is now seen walking down the canopied entrance stairs of an apartment house on the other side of the street, where they'd been gazing at both the lovely and ugly facades across the way, with David in the lead, and the women follow, Holly slightly behind April. David leans over the roof of the car, looking at the women, waiting for their decision.",
    "1133": "A bus and a lorry approach as Hagrid rides upside down on the tunnel roof, with Harry hanging out of the sidecar, running over the bus, and dropping back in when the bike returns to the road. Hagrid slumps forward, hit by a bolt from a death eater, and Harry grabs the handlebars, forcing the motorbike up into the air. Hedwig flies towards them and attacks the chasing death eater, but as the owl swoops to attack again, she is hit by a bolt of green light and tumbles earthwards. The death eater pulls back, and Harry suddenly cries out in pain, his face contorting as another ominous, dark figure closes in. Harry slumps forward, his jagged scar illuminated by the bike's headlight. As they speed between two lines of electric pylons, Harry's wand lights of its own accord. The dark figure draws level, and the power flowing from Harry's wand connects with an equal force of pulsating energy. The swirling vortex of light travels up Voldemort's wand, illuminating his face, and an explosion rocks the bike. Harry presses the control button, and the bike zooms away, spewing out flames that propel Voldemort backwards as the electric pylons collapse. Harry, Hagrid, and the bike soar upwards beyond the clouds, and Hagrid comes to and takes control of the bike. As Harry settles back into the sidecar, the engine fails, and they hurdle downwards. Molly Weasley hears them break through the protective shield around their house as they plummet towards the ground, making a bumpy landing in a reed bed. They slow to a halt near the Weasley's home, and the bike throws up a spume of water, soaking both rider and passenger. Harry and Hagrid exchange a look and trudge towards the house, where Ginny follows her mother out, with Lupin supporting George, whose left ear is covered in blood. George is carried inside and laid on a sofa as Lupin grabs Harry by the collar, pinning him against the fireplace before lowering his wand and letting Harry go. Lupin steps back, and Harry nods. Lupin races out as Kingsley and Hermione return, and the two men point their wands at each other before Kingsley lowers his wand and turns to Harry. A thestral lands, carrying Bill and Fleur, while Nymphadora Tonks approaches with another Harry lookalike, who changes back into Ron as Hermione rushes to hug him. Lupin embraces Nymphadora, and Harry runs to embrace Hermione and Ron. Mr. Weasley returns with Fred, who runs indoors as Mr. Weasley follows anxiously. Mrs. Weasley strokes George's brow as Fred kneels down beside his twin. The others gather around, with Ron looking anxious. Fred leans towards George, who has a large wound in his ear and points to it. Bill steps forward, his face grim, and stunned, everyone looks at each other in shock.",
    "1078": "They stand next to each other guiltily, as Nullah climbs down from the tree. Sarah stares at him curiously, as he moves pensively away from her. She looks shocked. He eyes her steadily. He draws near her, and she looks up at him. She smiles and looks down at the ground. He gives a tight smile and walks off. She hesitates, then wanders through the long grass. In daylight, a steer lies dead next to a watering hole. Magarri checks the water. Drover, Sarah, and Nullah ride up. Magarri looks thoughtful. It's a great sandy desert. Nullah rides up as they stand glumly at the watering hole. Sarah stares at a solitary figure approaching across the dusty plain. King George is standing on one leg, propped against his spear, staring at them through the swirling dust. They approach him. King George sings, jumps and dances with his spears against the flaming sky of sunset. The cattle move agitatedly through the dust storm which engulfs the drove. King George continues his singing. Nullah dreams his grandfather finds water and catches a fish. In the middle of the twilight desert, King George holds up a fish on a pole. He stands chanting, his long hair, beard, and body caked in dust. Carney offers a pen to the captain. Fletcher hangs up the phone in the cattle pen as the captain pauses over a purchase agreement. The women in the salon watch in wonder as a calf wanders past the window. The building starts to shake as the captain signs the agreement. Sweating in the oppressive Darwin heat, he looks up as the drove thunders into town. Carney frowns and the salon women stare in awe as the street fills with cattle. Carney peers through the slats of his sun-blinds as Sarah rides up. Carney glares at him. They turn their horses and gallop off. Carney dives for the phone. Fletcher stares in angry disbelief as the Drover jumps his horse into the holding yard. Drover rides through the yard, cracking his whip as Fletcher frantically tries to organize his team. The gates out of the pen are closed in front of Drover, and the gate to the wooden loading tunnel raised. Cattle stream into it as Sarah rides toward the docks at the head of her herd. Sarah's herd rumbles on as the laughing Carney men urge their charges into the loading tunnel which runs down the wharf. Drover thinks for a moment, then rides off. He jumps the fence around the yard, knocking out the top slat, and rides into the street outside the Territory Hotel. Fletcher glares at him. Drover looks across at the Carney herd being loaded. He rides towards the large cargo vessel at the end of the wharf.",
    "1109": "Ron's hair is turning red, and they turn and run out of the common room. Back in the girls' lavatory, Myrtle floats past. Still in uniform, Hermione has become a cat. Outside, the lightning flashes, and inside, Ron and Harry walk upstairs where they stop as they find a pool of water on the landing. They run through it, and in the girls' lavatory, all the taps are running. Harry and Ron look around at the overflowing sinks and spot Myrtle sitting high up on a curved stone windowsill. Ron flinches as she floats past, and Harry notices a book with a limp, black leather cover lying on the stone floor. He picks it up and shakes off the water, but the book is soaking wet. Later, he sits at his desk and flicks through the dried-out pages, which are all blank. He flicks through the book again and sees a name stamped in gold letters on the back. He puts the book down, picks up a quill, and dips it into the inkwell. As he goes to write on the first empty page, a drop of ink falls from the quill, hits the paper, and slowly disappears. Harry turns over the page, but the ink blot has vanished. He dips his quill again and starts to write. His words fade into the paper, but other words appear. Harry writes again, and the answer appears on the page. Harry leans back, disappointed, but more words appear. The blank pages turn themselves over quickly, and he picks up the book with both hands and stares at it. A bright light shines out of the pages, dazzling Harry. As he disappears, the book on his desk closes. Stepping back into the past, Harry reappears in a school corridor and warily approaches the foot of a wide staircase. A teenage boy in Hogwarts uniform is standing at the bend of the stairs, staring at the landing above. Harry slowly goes up the stairs towards him, follows his gaze, and sees four people carrying down a stretcher covered with a sheet. As they pass Harry, he sees a limp arm sticking out from under the sheet. A man with a long, brown beard appears at the top of the stairs, and Harry looks up in surprise as Dumbledore gives him a searching look. Riddle leaves, turns into a wide corridor licked by flaming torches, and hurries along until he reaches the top of a narrow flight of stone steps. Harry follows him down the steps into a gloomy corridor with rough stone walls. Riddle approaches a heavy wooden door, takes out his wand, and looks around warily before throwing open the door to reveal a shadowy figure bending over a large wooden box.",
    "1332": "Percy appears in the doorway as Sandra whips open the back door, and that's when the world hits slow motion; Howard is a few feet away and is alive as Sandra races toward him, with Percy just behind her. Then the speed accelerates to normal as Howard's body explodes, spraying streams of dark fluid toward Sandra. At that moment, Percy spins around her, shielding her from the spray, which hits him in the back. Percy pushes Sandra back into the diner, and the door slams closed behind them. Percy releases Sandra, letting her stumble hysterically into the room, where Kyle and Jeep grab her, forcing her to the ground. Charlie turns to look at Percy, still standing with his back to the door, breathing heavily. He takes a step forward, then falls to the ground, with the entire back side of his body burned away, and his body lies covered on the table. Bob stares ruefully at his dead friend, tears streaming down his face, as Jeep watches his father from the doorway. Kyle looks over at Charlie, feeling defeated, while she shakes her head, anger building. Charlie stands at the sink with a cigarette to her lips, water running, stealing a private moment, taking a deep drag, feeling the smoke filling her lungs, defiant. She catches a look at herself in the mirror, runs her hand along the curvature of her belly, and tears well up in her eyes as fear and anger overtake her. She stamps out the cigarette in frustration as Jeep sees the strain on her face. After a long beat, as Jeep considers her, she turns to him, bitterness overtaking her, and Jeep's face hardens. He gets up, looking hurt and frustrated from Charlie, and then walks away, leaving Charlie to stare after him, disturbed and surprised by his response. Outside, the invisible sun is sinking as Kyle and Audrey are bundled together on the roof, keeping watch, with Kyle showing her how to hold the MP5. Audrey points the gun out into the haze like she's been holding one all her life, prompting Kyle's surprised look. After a moment, Audrey switches the safety back on, hands the gun over to Kyle, and stares into the surrounding red nothingness, her expression growing distant, seeming to have aged years overnight. She smiles at this confession and leans in, as if something beyond sensual need has taken over. Just then, the spotlights illuminating the roof sign come to life, the gas pumps light up down below, the station's fluorescents flicker on, and Bob’s TV glows with bright rolling static. Meanwhile, Jeep and Michael move to look through the slats at the window, while Charlie gives Sandra some water through a straw.",
    "1356": "As Alice nervously drives, she shakes her head: no. Alice nods; if not quite relieved, at least grateful for Joe. But they all stare off for a long beat. CRANE DOWN as the Buick pulls up. The dusty boys pile out. They all kind of look at each other. Charles, who looks at Joe for a beat, holds up his defunct camera on the tripod. Joe nods. Alice finds something on the passenger seat and holds it out. Joe goes to the window. Alice holds it out: THE CUBE. He takes it with. It all continues as Joe has entered from the front door. Joe is moving toward the living room, where Charles sits on the sofa, eyes glued to the TV, a train crash being reported on the local news; helicopter shot of the wreck. Both stare at the train crash, stunned. And we push in on Charles, going from depressed and lost to. Joe and Charles ride their bikes into town, across a bridge, the massive steel mill in the background. Tilt down from the town's water tower -- Joe and Charles ride their bikes underneath it, crossing Main Street -- two large military trucks drive past, we may note the airman in the passenger seat scans the area with a handheld device. As Charles opens the camera, pulls out the film. Charles reacts; he's never smoked anything. Lower-lower-middle class house, set against woods. Joe with Alice at her front door. She seems unnerved. Joe watches Louis get out of the car -- the man who got arrested at his mother's wake -- carrying a small grocery bag. He sees Joe and darkens as he approaches. Joe steps back as Louis arrives; Louis seems to hate Joe, but at the same time, can barely look at him. Louis goes back inside. Alice follows, turns to Joe. Then, quietly, conflicted. She closes the door. Alone, despite it all, Joe is happy. Off his smile, we hear loud pops: BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM. Martin -- as Detective Hathaway -- fires a gun -- shooting Cary, dressed in a dirty suit, as a man turning into a zombie -- his eyes wide and glossy white -- and as he is hit by the bullets, he slams his hand onto his chest -- blood bursts all over him, and he falls painfully to the ground. We then find Charles, behind his camera, yelling out. Wide shot, rising past six bicycles, thrown to the ground in a typical kid jumble. Charles, Joe, and Preston, with Joe's dad's Kodak camera on a tripod, have been filming, their gear scattered. Keep moving over them, to Martin and Alice, who were on camera. Beyond them, in the valley, the train crash seems to go forever.",
    "1173": "In the classroom next door, Harry reappears as he takes off the invisibility cloak. The moonlight, filtering through the snow on the window panes, gives the empty classroom a mysterious air. Harry looks around curiously. Through a stone arch, he glimpses a large mirror and a carved frame that goes down a few steps into the room beyond. As he walks slowly towards the mirror, he sees his own reflection getting closer. He stops in front of it and tries to read the writing carved around the wooden frame, but the words are strange and unfamiliar. Harry stands still for a moment, gazing at himself, then takes a step forward towards his reflection. To his surprise, two shadowy figures gradually appear in the mirror, standing one on each side of him: a young man and young woman. Harry turns, but the room behind him is completely empty. He looks back at the pretty young woman and swallows nervously. She nods and smiles. Harry's kind-looking father beams at him. Harry stretches out a hand towards them, but his fingers only touch his reflection in the glass. As his mother puts her hand on the shoulder of his reflection in the mirror, Harry puts a hand on his own shoulder. His mother fondly smiles at him again. Harry looks at her sadly. Harry pulls the cover off Ron's bed. In the empty classroom, they take off the invisibility cloak. They run to the mirror. With his knees tucked under his chin, Harry sits alone on the stone floor of the empty classroom, gazing into the mirror. Professor Dumbledore appears by the window. Harry gets to his feet. Dressed in a warm black cloak and wearing his red and gold Gryffindor scarf, Harry crosses the snow-covered courtyard with his pet white owl perched on his arm. The beautiful bird stretches its wings. Harry lifts his arm, and the snowy owl balances for a moment, then launches itself into the air. Harry watches as it soars above his head, swooping around the courtyard, then up and over the grey stone towers of the school, flying higher and higher until it disappears into the snow-laden sky. Now, the white owl flies back towards Hogwarts. It passes the hoops of the Quidditch goal posts. The snow has melted, and green grass has reappeared. Fluffy white clouds float in the blue sky. In the library, Hermione gives Ron a withering look. She finds the right page. Hermione, Harry, and Ron hurry across the wet grass towards a stone cottage on the edge of the forest. He lets them in. Wearing oven gloves, Hagrid takes something out of a pot hanging there at the fire.",
    "521": "A jogger crosses in front of him. The film cuts abruptly to Mickey's flashback of his date with Holly, beginning with a rock club performance. Three punkers--a girl with pink hair, a girl with a spiked mohawk, and a guy with Stevie Wonder braids and sunglasses--watch and bop their heads to the sounds of the offscreen rock band, The 39 Steps. The camera moves to the stage, revealing a sleazy-looking rock band in the midst of their number. As the band loudly plays on, the camera moves across the spellbound audience, sitting at crowded, smoky, small tables, to reveal a stricken Mickey and a mesmerized Holly squeezed together at one of them. A nearby member of the audience swills beer from a bottle. Holly, beating time to the music and enjoying herself, takes a puff of her cigarette. She glances at Mickey impatiently. Holly turns back to the band, who are still in full swing. The camera moves down the body of the lead singer, singing into a microphone, from his longish, curly red hair, through his cut-off red shirt and sweaty torso, to his guitar. The camera moves back to Holly and the even more stricken-looking Mickey. They are crowded in with people. In the background, a waitress holds up a tray. A man drinks from a glass mug; people chatter indistinctly over the loud band. Holly glances at Mickey once again, this time unable to contain her annoyance. She opens a vial of cocaine. Holly holds a short metal straw of cocaine to her nose and sniffs it. While Mickey pleads with her, Holly puts her cocaine vial into her purse. She holds a finger against one nostril and sniffs. She then picks up her lit cigarette and continues to smoke. Mickey and Holly, almost in dark silhouette, are walking at a fast clip along the sidewalk, arguing. They pass some lighted clothing store windows; a few cars go by in the dark street. The audience at their tables watch him, some with smiles of pleasure. A man has his arm around a woman. Mickey and Holly sit at one of the tables; a candle burns in its holder on the tabletop. Holly takes a cigarette from her purse as she holds her hand to her nose, sniffing. Mickey keeps shooting glances at Holly; she can't sit still. Holly lights her cigarette, dropping her matchbook on the floor. She bends down to pick it up, then starts to fidget in her chair. She gulps her wine; she sniffs. Mickey tries to watch the offscreen Bobby Short; he crosses his arms across his chest. The film cuts back briefly to Bobby Short playing the piano. A taxi pulls away from the curb as Mickey and Holly walk out of the hotel through its revolving doors.",
    "1077": "In the movie, Nullah runs towards him, and Flynn is trampled by the panicked animals. Nullah winces at the sight and stands alone, facing the stampede on the cliff edge, as the stampede gets closer in slow motion. Drover and Sarah urge their horses on, while Fletcher grins cruelly. Nullah concentrates and stretches out his arms, and his grandfather chants with him. He stands right on the cliff edge as the herd slows and, just yards from him, comes to a stop. King George looks down on the scene, and as Sarah and Drover arrive, Nullah starts to cry. Sarah dismounts and grabs him just before he falls into the abyss, and Drover grabs them both, pulling them backward to safety. Nullah stares up at Sarah, then turns and nuzzles into her shoulder, while Drover stands awkwardly and backs away from the pair. King George smiles proudly. Drover gallops to Flynn, who lies twisted and bloody in the dust, placing his ear close to Flynn's mouth to hear him as his eyes flutter and close. Drover frowns, looks down at Flynn, picks up his hat from next to the dead man, and puts it on while holding Flynn's harmonica. Later, Nullah holds the harmonica as Sarah sits in the smoking remnants of their camp, holding out one of her hats, which she drops on the ground as her face creases with grief. She watches him as Drover walks up beside her, and they look with determination into each other's eyes. Under a blazing sun, with a blue sky flecked with high white clouds, the drove continues as Sarah rides confidently and brandishes the whip like an old-hand. Nullah rounds up a lone steer that strays off, and they head towards the golden glow of the sunset. Back at the cliff, Fletcher places a crocodile-skinned boot on the pile of rocks that is Flynn's grave, grabs a stone off the pile, and toys with it, looking thoughtfully into the abyss as his men ride up. A breeze blows Flynn's hat off the grave's wooden cross as Fletcher stares towards the herd, visible as a cloud of dust in the distance. Drover's team sets up camp by a river, and they all swig Poor Fella Rum from tin cups, except Drover, who swigs from the bottle. It's strong stuff, but Sing Song and Sarah hold out their cups for more, and the empty bottle drops to the ground at the feet of a startled wallaby, who sniffs at it. Sarah gets up and goes over to Drover, who's leaning against a tree. They stop laughing and look deeply into each other's eyes, and very slowly, their faces draw closer. Sarah closes her bright blue eyes, and very tenderly, they kiss.",
    "660": "He attaches a network of webs to the bridge, inside the dangling cable car. The web is struggling to hold MJ, Spider-Man, and the car. The Goblin sees a tugboat draw near, and hearing the sound of the glider, Spider-Man and MJ look up to see the Goblin on his way towards them. Part of the web gives way, and everything drops 20 feet. MJ clambers over Spider-Man and starts to climb down the cable. The Goblin flashes past Spider-Man, punching him. Like a gymnast on rings, Spider-Man's arms are stretched wide, one attached to the web supporting them all, the hand of the other still grasping the cable tightly. Another punch sends Spider-Man reeling and knocks the cable from his grasp, but he grabs the cable. MJ slips off it but clasps hold of the rail running around the cable car roof. The Green Goblin glides in for the kill as Spider-Man is lowering the cable car towards the barge. A blade shoots out, but the Goblin is hit by debris. Knocked off balance, the Goblin is kicked away by Spider-Man. The crowd on the bridge continues to throw debris. The cable car lands safely on the barge, MJ still clinging to it. MJ looks up at her hero and sees the Goblin closing in again. The Goblin throws a line around Spider-Man's waist and pulls him away behind the glider. Spider-Man crashes through the wall of an old ruin. He shoots out a web to steady himself and smashes through a pane of glass. Then a pumpkin bomb bounces towards him, and the fireball throws Spider-Man backwards. He's thrust through a brick wall and lands on the ground, half of his mask is burnt off. The Goblin reappears and punches Spider-Man in the chest and face, then kicks him and punches him again. A punch sends Spider-Man high into the air, and he lands heavily. The Goblin flips up and punches him again. Spider-Man shoots out a web and tries to pull himself clear, but the Goblin thwarts that. Spider-Man shoots more threads and builds a large web, which slows down the Green Goblin, but can't hold him. Spider-Man goes on the attack, but is beaten back. A kick to the head and a drop kick to the chest send Spider-Man reeling. He crashes into a brick wall and collapses on the ground. He raises his wrist, but the Goblin's boot comes down on it. Spider-Man's eyes flare and he grits his teeth. The Goblin lunges at Spider-Man with a multi-bladed spear, but Spider-Man stops it in front of his face. He pushes it back, then hurls the Goblin across the ruin. The Goblin scrabbles around, but webs wrap around the Goblin's ankles and Spider-Man yanks him down.",
    "223": "Everett, Pete, and Delmar take cover from the rain under the dripping eave of a barn, holding their coats pinched shut at the neck as they look forlornly at the weather. They walk along a red dirt road elevated through a bayou and later sit around a campfire where Everett, sitting on a stump, expressively tells a ghost story while Pete and Delmar gaze at him, wide-eyed and rapt. The three men continue their journey past a cotton field dotted with burst pods. Meanwhile, a sad-faced woman in a calico dress addresses the clerk and appears crestfallen. As a car approaches, Pete's door flies open before it stops, and he stumbles down the bank to the river, followed more casually by Everett and Delmar, with Everett chuckling. The unearthly singing they hear is from three beautiful women who sing while dunking clothes in the stream. Pete is all awkward smiles with deep, burning eyes, trying to speak to the laundresses. The women do not answer him but smile as they continue to sing. Pete tries again as she reaches into their laundry basket, and his eyes remain glued on the women as he hisses out of the corner of his mouth. Everett laughs lightly. None of the women respond, but as they continue to sing, one brings a jug marked with three Xs to Everett. Delmar stares horrified at a pile of clothes as a spot in the middle rises and falls rhythmically. As Everett joins Delmar to look, the rhythmic movement travels up the shirt, and a large yellow toad emerges from under the collar. Delmar keens, while Everett is bewildered, and the toad hops down the river bank. Delmar has the toad on his lap, whimpering as he pets it, with the frog croaking and Delmar continuing to whimper. Everett squints and shakes his head. Nearby, tables are formally laid with linen as Delmar and Everett sit at a table with a shoebox between them, deep in conversation, with Everett pointing a knife at the shoebox. We then see over the shoulder of a broad-shouldered man in a cream-colored suit with a shirt that has a powder-blue collar. He digs into a huge plateful of steak and eggs, but sensing something, he looks up, cocks his head, and slowly turns to look back, revealing a cream-colored eyepatch with powder-blue trim. His good eye is looking intently off at Everett and Delmar, who continue arguing, out of earshot, just as the waitress arrives for their order.",
    "1046": "Holden and Parson open fire from across the highway, prompting Howard to flee and then zoom the camera back on Enrique. The officer stoops over Enrique's body and gently lifts his head, seeing Anna step out onto the highway as a white car swerves to avoid her. An ambulance motors over the crest of the hill bridge, and Howard runs along the highway towards Anna. He freezes in the middle of the road as the speeding ambulance hurdles towards her, then makes a mad dash for her. The picture freezes and the events run in reverse, showing Enrique bouncing from the windscreen of a red sedan. Howard scoops Anna in his arms as the fiery explosion shrinks into nothing, into blackness. Marksmen watch from the rooftops of tall buildings as the President's motorcade proceeds towards the plaza. President Ashton is on a car phone with Cavic and another agent sitting opposite him. The motorcade halts in the shadows beneath a bridge where another dark-suited man, Ted Heinkin, climbs into the President's car and lowers the phone. Heinkin hangs up the phone and narrows his eyes, removing two flags from the bonnet of the President's limousine and putting a document in a folder before slamming it shut. Ashton stares gravely out of the window as a seething crowd fills the Plaza Mayor. The double's motorcade passes beneath the watchful snipers while the crowd of protesters waves placards at the roadside. The President's limo drives into the hotel's underground car park where government agents stand watch outside the glass wall of the Hotel Vesta. The President gets out of his limo in a bright, empty parking lot dotted with armed agents, followed by Heinkin and silver-haired Phil McCullough into an elevator. A besuited agent runs a swipe card through a machine and talks into a radio. An inflatable skull and two skeleton hands are waved by protesters outside the Plaza Mayor as Matthews and Holden cross to the limousine, and Matthews opens the door for the Ashton double. In the elevator, Ashton reads through a folder of large photographs, while a guilty McCullough looks awkward and then looks away. Ashton stares at McCullough, then steps out of the elevator, and Heinkin raises an eyebrow as they follow Ashton down a corridor. At the plaza, the crowd waves Spanish flags as the Secret Service agents escort Ashton's double to the podium. In his hotel room, Ashton opens the curtains and gazes out of the window of the Plaza Mayor where the Secret Service agents take positions around the President on the red-carpeted podium. De Soto stands at the lectern. Ashton sees his double on TV and then his double is shot. McCullough grabs the phone as Barnes floors Enrique, and Ashton watches live footage of Barnes pinning Enrique down. Ashton is transfixed and then turns.",
    "134": "The camera races with the train along the river's edge, the reflected sun glimmering on the windows. The sun is high and the train is stopped by the river. We see an English clergyman from the Second Class coaches, dipping a toe cautiously into the water, children of some British enlisted soldiers wading, splashing, faces alight with fun. Across the river down from the Third Class coaches, a small group of Indian women is squatted by the river's edge, washing clothes. Some carry infants on their backs, and some small children stand near them. Their ritual of washing goes on, but they are all watching the passengers of the train. Gandhi stands with Ba and Charlie among the Third Class passengers. Charlie, his trousers rolled up, plays a tentative splashing game with a skinny little Indian boy. Gandhi is holding a large white head cloth which he is soaking in the water, but his eyes have been arrested by the sight of the women across the river. Their bodies are skin and bone. The clothes they wear, which looked normal from the distance, are rags - literally, shredded rags, one hung on another. Gandhi stares for a moment, a long beat. Climbing green hills - a totally different terrain - and again we intercut, this time the train climbing: a boy and buffalo running a huge, crude grinding wheel, train climbing; farmers in terraced fields, train climbing faster and faster. Gandhi is leaning out of a window in a Third Class coach. Ahead of him, other passengers are looking too; some have jumped down. As they come clear, they can see that a military train of an engine and two cars has been derailed ahead of them. A small troop of cavalry is coming slowly along the line of Gandhi's train toward them. They are British, and their troop leader is viciously angry. Nehru takes an iced drink from a servant, and Nehru shakes his head wistfully. The train passes the camera to the Third Class section, which seems besieged by humanity. People cling to the outside of each door and many more are seated on the central wooden planks on the roofs of the two coaches. Gandhi and Charlie are riding on the outside of the coach, hanging on through the door, and both enjoying it immensely. Ba, inside the jammed coach, finds it very unfunny. She has a grip on one of Gandhi's arms. The camera has been moving in; now it jumps to Jinnah in close shot and intercuts with the impact of his fervid delivery on the audience. And the audience cheers him. Newspaper cameramen crowded around the platform photograph him. Patel comes forward from the back of the platform, clapping.",
    "33": "Rick sits down at the table; as they talk, Captain Tonelli and Lieutenant Casselle walk by toward the entrance of the cafe. It intermittently sheds its light on Rick's face. Casselle talks non-stop, and Tonelli tries. They both stop, salute Renault, and walk into the cafe. Rick laughs. Rick and Renault look up when they hear the BUZZ of a plane taking off from the adjacent airfield. The plane flies directly over their heads. Rick still looks in the direction of the airport; his look isn't a happy one. The three men enter the cafe and pass Sam at the piano. Rick pats Sam on the shoulder. Rick's eyes react, and involuntarily, they glance toward the gambling room. Renault catches the look. They start upstairs to Rick's office, passing Casselle who is still haranguing Tonelli. They go inside the office, and Rick opens up the safe in a small, dark room just off the office. Only Rick's shadow can be seen getting the money out. Rick moves out of the shadows and into view, giving the money to Emil, who departs. Rick closes the door to the office, then goes over to close the safe. Renault watches Rick's reaction, and they sit down to discuss the matter in earnest. Rick makes a face. Renault stands up but stops short as his AIDE enters. Renault starts to leave and hurries away. Rick smiles cynically. Renault walks up to Carl, then over to one of his officers. The officer salutes and goes off to speak to the guards. Renault walks over to Strasser's table as Rick comes down the stairs. Renault sits down. Ugarte stands at the roulette table. Two gendarmes approach him from behind, and the officer nods. They follow Ugarte to the cashier's window, where Ugarte puts his chips through the window to the CASHIER and looks around. We move to Strasser's table, who has witnessed the event. Guards and gendarmes rush in and grab Ugarte. Rick stands impassively as they drag Ugarte off. Back to Rick, still standing where he was, as a CUSTOMER walks by. An air of tense expectancy pervades the room. Rick comes out to the middle of the floor and speaks in a very calm voice. A few customers are on the point of leaving. Rick glances toward Sam, who nods and begins to play. Renault, Strasser, and Heinze sit calmly at their table after witnessing the arrest. Rick walks by, stops, and comes over to their table. Rick nods to Strasser and Heinze and sits down with them. Major Strasser is one of the reasons the Third Reich enjoys the reputation it has today. Strasser takes a little black book from his pocket and turns to a certain page.",
    "895": "A balding undercover officer knocks on the cellblock door. In his cell, Dillinger flips through a magazine and looks up as the balding officer leads Purvis into the cellblock, where other lawmen observe from a side table. Wearing a crisp suit, Purvis faces Dillinger's cell. The gang leader sets down his magazine, stands, and ambles toward the bars. The two men size each other up, with Dillinger curiously cocking his head and Purvis staring calmly. The other officers and agents watch closely. Dillinger's eyes flick up and down the stoic G-man, and he shakes his head with his brow knit. Blinking furtively, Purvis allows a faint smile. Dillinger straightens to his full height, chewing gum and giving a cocky smile. Purvis pauses on his way out, facing Dillinger as sunlight outlines his clean-shaven face, and Dillinger follows Purvis from inside his cell. Both men walk with their hands in pockets, and Purvis barely slows his leisurely stride while inspecting Dillinger, then leaves with his agents. The balding officer stays behind as Dillinger chews his gum. A three-propeller plane cruises through the sky with its curved, boxy underbelly hanging below thick wings, a chevron-shaped windshield jutting behind the nose, and six windows serving as skylights over the cockpit. Later, the plane descends toward a rainy airfield, and on board, Dillinger jostles in his seat as the plane touches down. Outside, the plane taxies past distant hangars, and near one, a man lights a flare, illuminating a vast crowd as two journalists crank movie cameras. A black-and-white view through one camera shows a police officer waiting as Dillinger's plane approaches. Other journalists wait with flashbulb cameras, and three lawmen hold rifles at the ready, gleaming in the flare's light. The plane taxies to a stop as lawmen debark from a car, and another flare goes up. Wind whips two trench-coated lawmen as they escort a shackled Dillinger across the tarmac, with flashbulbs popping. Wearing a button-down shirt and open vest, Dillinger stumbles forward, jostled by his retinue of armed men, his wet bangs dangling over his face. A plume of smoke from a glowing flare billows crookedly in the wind as another view through a movie camera shows the lawmen leading Dillinger through the haze. More flashbulbs pop as the men reach a sedan with a sleek bird-winged hood ornament, and Dillinger gets shoved into the back seat. A jerky hand-held view shows a gunman climbing in next to him. In front, two policemen stand on a car's running boards as it starts off, accompanied by officers on motorbikes. Inside the prisoner's car, Dillinger slouches, his head bobbing while passing lights gleam on the car's polished black hood. Seated between two of his captors, Dillinger keeps his pensive gaze aimed downward.",
    "419": "The game is over. Bert is already in the front room, sitting at a table with a drink, and he watches Eddie pass him by on the way to the bar. Eddie looks at Bert. Amused, Bert gets up and joins Eddie at the bar, laughs, and signals the bartender for another round. He starts to go, and Eddie exits. The sound of a ship's horn is heard as Eddie walks past the piers and warehouses toward a small waterfront bar called Arthur's Pool Hall. The atmosphere at Arthur's is stifling and oppressive, with a few lonely drinkers, dock workers, sitting stooped over their beer bottles at the bar. In the back is a pool table where, as Eddie enters, two burly men with cue sticks in hand are watching a pale, skinny young man line up his shot. They exchange glances, sizing each other up, and then the young man shoots. Eddie goes to the rack and takes a cue, while one of the other players puts away his cue. The young man makes his break shot, slamming the nine into the pocket, and grins snidely at Eddie. The other two men, the losers, stand around, mutely following the play. Eddie tosses a coin on the table and collects it while the young man racks up the balls. Preparing to break, Eddie chalks his cue, rams the cue ball into the pack, and the nine drops in. Everyone, especially the young man, is stunned. Eddie has lost control of himself, shooting like he did at Ames, rapping in shots with perfect control, completely oblivious to the glowering faces of a group of men gathered around the table. Eddie makes a tough shot, and the men exchange uneasy glances as Eddie continues to make more tough shots and tricky combinations. He finishes with another combination shot, and the young man nervously digs into his jacket for the money. All eyes are on Eddie as the young man, sensing what is about to happen, pays up, puts down his cue, drops the cash on the table, and leaves quickly. Then one of the other men, a thick-fleshed, obscene-looking man named Turk, steps forward with a mock smile. As Eddie looks at the circle of silent, glaring men, his fury gives way to fear. He wipes his mouth with his sleeve, nervously backs away, tries to back off but finds nowhere to go, and makes a casual movement toward the table. Turk takes the bills from the table and stuffs them into Eddie's breast pocket. They drag Eddie into the men's room and shove him up against the ground-glass partition.",
    "1288": "The glow of the dawn sky and the lights of three approaching helicopters illuminate the scene as Helen rushes indoors, shocked. She kisses him on the cheek and rushes off, joining Klaatu and Jacob as they leave the house and run for the car through the rain. They abandon the car and run into the dense surrounding woodland, with Klaatu leading the way, Helen struggling to keep up while holding Jacob's hand. They run through the woods as fast as they can as the helicopters thunder overhead. Jacob breaks away from Helen's grasp, and a soldier drops down a rope to snatch Helen. As the two remaining helicopters hover above, Klaatu strides past the stunned Jacob into a clearing and attracts the targeting lasers to the palms of his hands. As they fire, Klaatu reverses the energy flow, causing the pilots to clutch their helmets in agony as the helicopters go out of control, smash into each other, and plunge to the ground, erupting in a huge fireball. Jacob turns and runs back into the woods, with Klaatu following at a leisurely pace. The boy comes to a narrow wooden bridge over a river and, terrified, steps onto the wet planks. As he backs away from the advancing alien, a rocking board breaks under him, but Klaatu reaches out and stops him from falling. Frowning, Klaatu studies Jacob, who looks hopefully up at him. They stare at one another, and then Klaatu strides off, with Jacob hesitating but then following him. Meanwhile, an operative in a protective suit enters the chamber with GORT to repair the drill mechanism, as the agent and ops room staff watch through the window. The chipped drill bit is removed and replaced with a new one. Deep in the minute cracks of the damaged drill, tiny black bugs flutter and multiply by dividing in two. Klaatu glances at the operative, who tightens up the new drill bit and is about to leave when he notices the old drill bit being eaten away. He drops it and hurriedly makes to leave the chamber, but his suit, air canister, and body are being eaten away. The massive steel bands holding GORT are also being eaten, and as the agent watches, the window glass is attacked. A massive jet of flame roars up the chamber, and the operations room staff squint in the intense glare. Flames and smoke clear, but GORT remains, his eyes still glowing. The agent stares in fear as GORT raises his massive hands to show he's free and dissolves into a cloud of bugs filling the flash chamber. The agent bolts for the door, but his pass won't work, while the officer in charge watches grimly as the swirling cloud attacks the windows.",
    "809": "He looks at himself in a mirror. Ferris's hair has light-brown highlights. In an office on a construction site, he speaks to a bald agent posing as a construction worker. Sadiki walks in. As Sadiki and Al-Masri shake hands, Tony takes photographs from a car. Ferris takes the room key from the clerk. He heads upstairs and along a corridor. Ferris lets himself into a hotel room. He walks through the room and out onto the balcony. He climbs over the wall, steps along a ledge, and climbs onto the balcony of the next room. He peers in through the French windows, pushing a long curtain aside. Ferris heads to a laptop on the dressing table. He pushes a device into the socket at the back of the computer. He opens it up. He switches it on and presses some keys. A photo of Sadiki with his family appears on the screen. Ferris dials his cell phone. Garland's at a computer. A number of files appear on the laptop in front of Ferris. In the hotel lobby, Sadiki walks up to the desk and gets his room key. Sadiki walks upstairs to his room. Hearing the door, Ferris quickly shuts the laptop and turns off the desk light. He runs out of the French windows and climbs across to the next balcony. Sadiki walks into the room and gets some money from a bag. He pockets the money. He adjusts the chair in front of the dressing table. He notices the French windows are open and goes to have a look.

    "764": "David turns slowly and looks after her while Elijah is still talking to Audrey. In the stadium, David stands motionless in the center of the walkway, turns slowly, frowning, not really looking at the crowds, and a young man in a bright, blue anorak bumps into him. In the toilets, another young man in a red and blue anorak, wrapped half of his shoulders, washes his hands, turns away from the basin, looks towards the door, and he is alone. He reaches inside a waste bin, extracts a small package, slips it into his trouser pocket, and, hitching up his anorak, walks slowly out. In the walkway, David watches the man in the bright blue anorak join a queue for tickets and approaches him. The man looks at David and slowly turns to face him. The man lifts his arms, and David pats his clothes, puts a hand into one anorak pocket, rummaging around, but comes out with nothing, and steps back. The man looks at him wearily, and David swallows and nods. The man turns away, and David watches him, sighs, and turns to walk in the other direction. David pulls out his walkie-talkie, frowns, and looks back at the man in the anorak, who is also watching him, and the man quickly looks away. Joseph's eyes are on David, who's sitting opposite a white-haired woman at a table. Next to Joseph, sits a boy with a thermometer in his mouth, and Joseph nods, looks pityingly at the other boy. David shakes his head, and shakes his head again, and yet again, and then he swallows, his eyes fixed on the woman, and stares. He and Joseph are outside, humbling through the playground across the colored markings for hopscotch, and Joseph shakes his head as dusk falls outside their house. In the kitchen, David is at the sink, washing up, puts down a pan, and stops, staring at Joseph, who's sitting at a table with David's gun in front of him. Joseph picks up the gun, holds it in both hands, pointing it at David, and the gun lands on the table. David grabs it and quickly removes the bullets while Audrey collapses, leaning on the table, head in hands. David bangs the unloaded gun on the cooker, slides down the wall, and sits slumped against it, while Audrey collapses onto the floor. In the limited edition gallery, he stares down at the carpet in the silver-grey room. Street and shop lights glare in the grey evening as people wait to cross a busy junction. In a shop, Elijah is motionless, glowering and sullen in his wheelchair, and the walls are covered with comics individually wrapped in plastic covers which reflect the light.",
    "273": "As the two men move toward the couch, Ed hesitantly pipes up and she wrinkles her nose apologetically. He is looking at the baby while Gale, Evelle, and Hi look up at Ed, dumbstruck. After a beat, she looks at Hi, and Gale leans in close to Hi, with a look of sincere concern on his face, and says something under his breath. There is an awkward silence as she leaves and slams the bedroom door. Gale is carefully studying his thumbnail while Evelle stares fixedly at the ceiling, and still looking at his thumb, they continue. Sometime later, as Hi tiptoes in, Ed lies in bed facing the wall; we see only the back of her head. Hi sits gingerly on the edge of the bed and, smiling, sticks a finger through the bars of the crib to play with the baby. The sound of the TV set in the living room filters faintly in, and Hi is momentarily startled, then goes on playing with the baby. Ed finally turns to face him, and Hi turns to face her. Looking straight down at Hi, asleep in bed, we are craning down. For a brief moment, we see a wall of flames and hear it roar, still craning down. The wall of flames continues with a deafening roar as we are craning down. The faint National Anthem ends, and we hear the WEEEEEEEE of a test pattern, amidst the roaring. At the cut: WHOOOOOSH! A huge low-rider motorcycle bursts through the flames, its engine roaring even louder than the fire. Its driver is a huge leather-clad hellion, and the chains worn by the Biker clank ominously as he rides. The Biker roars out of frame, and as he roars into frame, his rear tire lays down a wake of fire as he roars along a ribbon of desert highway. Tracking with and also in on the Biker from behind as he roars along a strip of highway, he is reaching for the two sawed-off shotguns which are strapped crisscross across his back. Pulling the Biker from a distance as he levels the two shotguns, the tracking camera pulls back further to reveal a running jack-rabbit keeping pace with us in the foreground. CRACK - as the first shotgun spurts orange, the foreground rabbit keels over. The Biker slues the other gun around, and on a rock in the foreground, a desert lizard suns himself. The Biker is approaching in the distant background, and CRACK - from afar, the foreground lizard is blown away. Of the empty desert road stretching away, in the foreground, a lone desert flower blooms. The Biker roars into frame and as he roars away, the foreground flower bends with his draft and then bursts into flame. From behind, booming down as we track, we are approaching the crest of a rise.",
    "471": "The pretty soprano Katherina Cavalieri, around twenty-four years old, dressed in an elaborate mythological Persian costume, sings on stage, near the end of a very florid aria by Salieri, which prompts the audience to applaud wildly. Slyly, he plays the opening measure of Mozart's Eine Kleine Nachtmusik, and the priest nods, smiling and humming along. Meanwhile, the six-year-old Mozart, also blindfolded, is seated in a gilded chair on a pile of books, playing the harpsichord for the Pope and a suite of Cardinals and other churchmen, with his father Leopold standing beside him, smirking with pride. The piece finishes, and Leopold lowers the lid of the harpsichord and lifts up his little son to stand on it, allowing Mozart to remove the blindfold and reveal his pale little face with staring eyes. Elsewhere, the twelve-year-old Salieri sits between his plump and placid parents in the congregation, listening in rapture, while his father, a heavy-looking, self-approving man, remains obviously indifferent to the music. A large and austere Christ on the cross hangs over the altar. A close-up reveals a large cooked fish on a thick china plate as the camera pulls back to show the Salieri family at dinner; Father Salieri sits at the head of the table with a napkin tucked into his chin as Mother Salieri serves the fish into portions and hands them around. Father Salieri receives his fish plate and starts to eat greedily, but suddenly gasps and chokes violently on a fish bone. All the women get up and crowd around him, thumping and pummeling him, but it is in vain. In a grand room crowded with guests, a small group of Gypsy musicians plays in the background, while thirteen members of the Archbishop's orchestra, all wind players complete with 18th-century wind instruments and wearing their employer's livery, lay out music on stands at one end of the room. Salieri, age thirty-one, a neat, carefully groomed man in decent black clothes and clean white linen, walks among the guests as we follow him until a servant with a large tray of cakes and pastries passes by. Instantly captivated by the sight, Salieri follows the servant out of the Grand Salon, with the man marching along bearing his tray of pastries aloft. Salieri continues to follow him to where several tables, covered to the floor with cloths, are loaded with plates of confectionery. It is, in fact, Salieri's idea of paradise! The servant places his tray on one of the tables and withdraws from the room. Salieri turns away to avoid being noticed by the servant and, as soon as the man disappears, sneaks into the buffet room.",
    "880": "Zoe lies on her bed, her back to Kate. Zoe turns and sits up a little. Aunt and niece stare at one another. Kate looks down, then turns and starts to walk out of the room. Kate gives a faint smile. At the restaurant, Zoe is peeling asparagus spears with three black truffles sitting on one side of her chopping board. Kate puts a plate down beside her and grates a small amount of one of the truffles over her roast quail, then hands the plate to a colleague. Zoe picks up the asparagus trimmings and drops them into a bin, then picks up a truffle, sniffs it, and, screwing her face up in disgust, drops it and the other two into the bin. Kate comes back with a second plate, looks around for the missing truffles, finds them in the bin, and retrieves them. She takes out a yellow lockbox and opens it, revealing even more truffles, and Zoe watches bemused as Kate puts the truffles into it. Watching, Nick smiles to himself and chats to Zoe as he chops onions. Holding a large stainless steel bowl, Zoe kneels down in front of a box of potatoes. Nick picks a couple up and shows them to her; then, while chatting on the phone in the office, Zoe fills the bowls with potatoes and walks off with it. Later, Nick holds a spoonful of sauce out to Zoe; she tastes it and nods her approval. Zoe teaches Nick some dance moves; they punch their arms in the air and point. In the restaurant, Nick dishes out pasta, and the staff tuck in hungrily. Zoe passes a plate to Kate, who tries to pass it on, but her colleague already has a plate, so Kate hands it back to Zoe. Zoe stares at Kate, taps her on the shoulder, and holds the plate out to her. Kate takes it, somewhat reluctantly, and begins to eat. Kate nods and smiles at him warmly. Zoe and Kate are in a park, where Zoe, who's been walking along park benches next to Kate, stops and leans across to whisper in Kate's ear. Zoe jumps down and walks ahead. In the restaurant, Nick heads into the kitchen, donning his white apron. Later, Kate draws back a curtain to look down at Zoe, who is pacing on the wintry street outside the apartment. Kate smiles and goes down. Zoe stands on a stool in the bathroom, plaiting her hair, then runs to the apartment door, flings it open, and heads downstairs. Nick checks Kate's cupboards, Kate takes a box from his bag, and Zoe ushers Kate out of the kitchen. Nick shows Zoe how to make a pizza base.",
    "77": "Rachel's head bobs up and down above the bush as we hear the unmistakable sound of a female hand on a child's bottom; all carry baskets as Rachel charges along at the head of the procession, while a cattle dealer strolls the other way. She keeps walking as they walk in silence. The waitress hurries away as Rachel dodges past a car, following the waitress and then the lovers in the car with her eyes. She takes in the lovers and sighs, angry at all women, herself included, and turns away. At the grocery store, the grocer is on his doorstep as she starts into the store with him; Rachel and the grocer come up to the counter where she stands with her market basket, reacting to wolf whistles off-screen, seeking the world. Ruby gestures Rachel’s nearness and nods as he turns and goes; Ruby, with an eye to the first loafer, turns and follows. John has entered in the background where Pearl holds the doll to her, and John moves in quietly to her side, standing together as they have often done before. As he turns around, she continues, puts aside the book, and takes up her mending, mending for a few moments as John crosses behind her and off towards the door. He approaches with two apples, gives her an apple, makes a move, and slowly and tenderly reaches out his hand, laying his fingers on her knuckles. Our heroine would like to thank the Lord openly but knows she must not show her feelings, so she speaks gruffly. Maybe we see, though John does not, the thanksgiving in her eyes as her head and shoulders from behind appear walking down the neon-lighted street, with the drugstore and loafers in the background and jazz music off-screen. Our two loafers lounge on a bench as Ruby approaches; he gets up and starts walking towards Ruby, catching his eye. She turns to a magazine stand and fingers a magazine, awaiting the loafer who approaches in the background; they are lurid, tawdry fan and pin-up magazines. The preacher enters between Ruby and the loafer and turns to Ruby into a close two-shot as the loafer pauses in the background. She looks up at him admiringly, then to the loafers, back to Ruby finishing her soda, which is a familiar clue to the preacher, who then nods. It slides into his knife pocket as she looks after him, clasping the magazine under her chin, her hero strides away into darkness, gazing after him. Ruby collapses facedown over Rachel's lap and sobs as they weep together. She starts making up Ruby's hair like that of a young woman as Ruby nods and shrugs. Seeing the preacher, she drops two eggs. He tethers his horse and, as we pan and track on behind him, walks to the bottom of the steps as Ruby moves into the side of the shot; beyond the preacher, Rachel stands behind her screen door, hands folded under her apron.",
    "245": "Zed continues his silent sing-song with his finger moving left to right, then it stops. After a beat, the camera moves to the right, zeroing in on Marsellus. Zed stands up, grabs Marsellus' chair, and drags him into Russell's old room. As Marsellus is dragged away, he locks eyes with Butch before disappearing behind the door of Russell's old room. Butch looks at The Gimp, who giggles from underneath the mask as if this were the funniest moment in the history of comedy. Zed's hand inches toward the weapon, while Butch grips the sword tighter. Zed studies Butch, who looks hard at Zed. Butch steps aside, revealing Marsellus standing behind him, holding Maynard's pump-action shotgun. Zed is blasted in the groin and goes down screaming in agony. Marsellus, looking down at his whimpering rapist, ejects the used shotgun shell. Butch lowers the sword and hangs back, then leaves Russell's old room through the red curtains. Fabienne slowly approaches the two-wheel demon as Butch looks at her. Fabienne starts to cry, and Butch turns off the engine and reaches out, taking her hand. Fabienne climbs on, and Butch starts her up. With that, the two lovebirds peel away. Meanwhile, we're in the bathroom of the Hollywood apartment we were in earlier with the Fourth Man, who is pacing around the small room, listening hard to what's being said on the other side of the door, clutching his huge silver .357 Magnum. The Fourth Man freaks out, throws himself against the back wall with the gun outstretched in front of him, a look of fear on his face, ready to blow in half anybody fool enough to stick their head through that door, then listens to them talk. Bursting out the door and blowing them all away while they're fooling around is the way to go. The bathroom door bursts open, and the Fourth Man charges out, silver Magnum raised, firing six booming shots from his hand cannon. Jules rises, moving toward Vincent as Vincent prepares to leave. Jules is behind the wheel, Vincent in the passenger seat, and Marvin in the back. Vincent turns to the backseat with the .45 casually in his grip. Vincent's .45 goes bang, and Marvin is hit in the upper chest, below the throat. He gurgles blood and shakes. Later, Jules is bent over a sink, washing his bloody hands, while Vincent stands behind him. Jules rises and dries his hands, and Vincent takes his place at the sink. Vincent finishes, dries his hands on a white towel, and when he is finished, the towel is stained with red. Three men are standing in Jimmie's kitchen, each with a mug of coffee.",
    "164": "She fights loose, but one of the constables takes her firmly. The sergeant turns from the commotion to see that Gandhi, his head oozing blood, has crawled to his knees again and is picking up another card. The crowd watches. The newspaper reporter watches. Ba stares in anguish. Gandhi lifts the card. The sergeant stares at him, angry but his emotions somewhat in control after the first blow. An instant of hesitation, then Gandhi drops the card into the basket. The sergeant almost stops, but he strikes again. A quiver of distaste at his own act crosses his face as Gandhi sags. Ba's anguished face is wet with tears. The newspaper reporter stares without making notes. Khan, at the paddy wagon, watches in wonder. Gandhi, his head bleeding badly now, rises to his knees -- a breath and he gropes around the ground for another card. His fingers finally clutch one. The sergeant stares, his face wracked with uncertainty and confusion. Gandhi lifts the card and painfully holds it over the fire, then drops it in the basket. The sergeant slams the billy club down again -- firmly, but with a manifest reluctance. The crowd watches breathlessly, the newspaper reporter stares. The sergeant draws a breath, grasping the club, but he bites his lip as he sees Gandhi lift his head feebly, his shaking hands, stained with his own blood, groping for another card. Ba is gently removing Gandhi's suit coat, staring fearfully at a bandage on his head, another along the side of his face. The room is gas lit, over furnished in the Victorian manner. Gandhi sits carefully on the bed, where some newspapers are spread out, English-language ones among them. Ba reaches forth, gently touching the bandages on his head. Before Gandhi can retort there is a knock on the door. A small, round ayah (an Indian nursemaid) pushes open the door and proudly admits her charges, Gandhi's sons: Harilal (ten), Manilal (six), and Ramdas (two). They are all dressed in European suits, ties, and stiff collars. They step forward, one by one, making the pranam (the Hindu gesture of greeting), then bending and touching the hands and lips to Gandhi's feet in the traditional obeisance of child to father. Gandhi smiles. And Ramdas runs to him and Gandhi bends to kiss him as Ramdas puts his arms around his neck. The boys bow and leave like boys used to household discipline. The ayah closes the door and we hear their chatter as they go down the hall. Gandhi is stretching out on the bed, taking up another paper. Ba comes and sits down on the bed beside him, maneuvering so that she can get at the bandage.",
    "462": "Nearby are some stone ruins that once might have been a fort but now kind of resemble Stonehenge. The Man in Black is 75 feet from the top, maybe less—maybe only 50—and his pace is as dazzling as before. Vizzini cuts through the last of the rope, which slithers across the ground and out of sight toward the Channel like some great serpent at last going home. Fezzik stands with Inigo and Buttercup by the cliff edge. The Man in Black hangs suspended hundreds of feet in the air, holding to the jagged rocks, desperately trying to cling to life. Vizzini, stunned, turns to the others, looking down at the Man in Black, who very slowly picks his way upwards, sometimes a foot at a time, sometimes an inch. The group at the top is staring down, and Inigo nods. The Man in Black continues to creep his way upward. Fezzik goes to Inigo, nods, and hurries after Vizzini. Inigo watches them depart, then turns, peers down over the cliffs, watches a moment, and then paces, shaking his hands loose. He practices a few of his honed fencing skills, as he is a taut and nervous fellow who has never been one for waiting around. The Man in Black climbs on, and he must be six inches closer to the top than when last seen. Inigo is watching, then walking away. Finally, he goes back to the cliff edge and starts to talk. It's instant death if the Man in Black falls, but neither gives that possibility much credence. This is our two heroes meeting. The Man in Black glances up, kind of grunts, as Inigo steps away, draws his sword, and loosens up with a few perfect thrusts, then re-sheathes and looks eagerly over the edge again. The Man in Black just hangs there in space, resting, gathering his strength. On these words, the camera zooms into a close-up on Inigo, who raises his right hand high, his eyes blazing, and his voice takes on a tone not heard before. Then, quietly, he dashes to the giant rock the rope was originally tied to. The Man in Black loosens his grip a moment, trying to cling to the side of the cliff. Inigo, now with a small coil of rope, hurries back to the edge and hurls it over. It hangs close to the Man in Black, who releases the rocks, grabs the rope, hangs helplessly in space a moment, then looks up at Inigo. Inigo strains, forcing his body away from the cliff edge, as the Man in Black rises through the early morning light, slowly, steadily, and as the cliff top at last comes within reach, Inigo is watching as the Man in Black crawls to safety, then looks to Inigo.",
    "679": "Looking scared, Harry hauls back a hinged portrait, dials a combination, and opens the safe behind it. Inside is a huge orb. A limb bundles Harry out of the way. Octavius strides up to the safe, removes his dark specs, and stares at the tritium. Harry fixes his eyes on Spider-Man. He spins round. Octavius has taken the tritium sphere and leaves via the balcony. Harry, a dark and brooding look on his face, picks up a heavy ornamental dagger from the desk beside him. He holds the dagger to his chest and moves towards the unconscious Spider-Man, lying on his back on the couch, his arms and hands bound in front of him. He raises the dagger as Spider-Man stares. He hauls off the mask, then recoils and drops the dagger. Peter flexes and breaks the bonds. He gets to his feet and approaches Harry. Harry shakes his head. There are tears in the seated Harry's eyes as he stares up at Peter. In the reconstructed lab, down by the pier, Octavius stands in the fusion chamber, studying the tritium. MJ, in chains, is tied to a pillar. Octavius lowers his dark glasses and taps on a keyboard. In the fusion chamber, beams of light appear. The tritium glows brightly, illuminating the way for Spider-Man to creep across a beam. Sensing something, Octavius grins. Spider-Man stops above MJ. MJ looks up, smiles, and her smile fades when she turns to face Octavius. A limb punches into the pillar. Spider-Man climbs away. Spider-Man jumps over Octavius and his limbs, but they catch him and fling him up through the ceiling and out into the night sky. Spider-Man shoots a web onto the building and swings back in through a huge oil window, landing on Octavius. They crash through the floorboards into the water below and trade blows. The tritium sphere begins to attract metals to it, including MJ's chains. She hangs in the air, the chains on her leg drawn to the sphere. The pillar to which she's tied buckles and the ropes become free. MJ is pulled towards the sphere. Spider-Man attaches a web to the rope and struggles to pull MJ back from the glowing tritium. The chains on her legs break free and she catapults back to Spider-Man. Octavius is back on the rampage. He tosses Spider-Man against a metal beam. He crashes to the floor, and MJ watches as rubble falls on top of him. Octavius strides over, and one of the limbs lifts Spider-Man and suspends him in mid-air. MJ picks up a piece of timber, sneaks up on Octavius, and is about to hit him when she's punched away. One pincer flicks out a blade.",
    "1226": "The Beast is now gleaming as she approaches with an unconvinced smile. Emily reaches for the switch, and her eyes widen as she looks at Ben in awe as the fly wheels turn. Emily presses down a lever, and the piston arms pump, picking up paper, setting it on the platen, and printing on it. Emily watches in amazement, then wraps her arms around Ben's neck and hugs him tight. Ben gradually responds to her touch, rests his head on her shoulder, closes his eyes, and lays his hands on her back. A tearful Emily nuzzles into him, and Ben stands back, gently drawing her to him and planting a lingering kiss on her lips. Emily brushes her fingers against Ben's cheek as they continue kissing passionately. They break off and stand with their foreheads together. Ben pulls back a little and kisses her fingertips. Ben hurries out of the workshop, steps over the low picket fence, goes to unlock his car, and takes out the gift. His brother, Ben, now Tim, goes to his car and reaches in for the ID, which he hands to his brother, Ben. Tim, who has put his gift back in the car, looks sheepish while the real Ben considers uneasily for a moment. Tim reaches into his jeans' pocket and hands them over, then walks briskly back towards the house, breaking into a jog. He steps back over the picket fence and returns to the workshop, where Emily sits in a sultry pose, waiting for him. Emily stands, and shuffling uneasily, Tim reluctantly moves away from Emily's touch. Ever-persistent, she draws his face to her and kisses his cheek. Tim calms a little and lets her kiss his cheek several more times. Cupping his face in her hands, Emily kisses Tim on the lips, and Tim remains motionless with his eyes closed but gradually begins to kiss her back as tears roll down his cheeks. The couple wrap their arms tightly around each other as they continue to kiss with mounting passion. Emily's arms are around Tim's neck as he lifts her legs and holds her in his arms. They kiss again, and Tim carries her out of the workshop. Tim and Emily, still kissing, fall back on gold satin pillows, and Tim kneels astride Emily, who helps him off with his polo shirt. She sees a long scar running from his side and back. In golden light, Emily slips off her delicate sandals and undoes the clasp on her halterneck dress. She and Tim move slowly into a tender kiss, and Tim lays a hand gently on a scar on Emily's naked breast and kisses it. Outside, rain streaks a window, making the image of the kissing couple inside hazy.",
    "472": "Salieri enters the room and looks about him cautiously. He is salivating with anticipation as he stares at the feast of sweet things. His attention is attracted in particular by a huge pile of dark chocolate balls arranged in the shape of a pineapple. He reaches out a hand to steal one of the balls, but at the same moment, he hears giggling coming toward him and ducks down behind the pastry table. A girl, Constanze, rushes into the room, runs straight across it, and hides herself behind one of the tables. After a beat of total silence, Mozart, age twenty-six, wearing a fine wig and a brilliant coat with the insignia of the Archbishop of Salzburg upon it, runs into the room, stops, and looks around, puzzled that Constanze has disappeared. Watched by an astonished Salieri, Mozart disappears under the cloth and obviously pounces upon Constanze. The throng is mostly seated; the musicians are in their places, holding their various exotic-looking wind instruments, and the candles are all lit. Immediately, Colloredo, Prince-Archbishop of Salzburg, enters. He is a small self-important figure of fifty in a wig, surmounted by a scarlet skullcap, and is followed by his Chamberlain, the Count Arco. Everyone stands as the Archbishop goes to his throne and sits. Instead, a wind musician gets up, approaches the Chamberlain, and whispers in his ear. They roll on the floor as he tries to drag her back under the table. The mood becomes suddenly softer as she kisses him, and they embrace. Shocked, she strikes at him, and he leaps up, disheveled and rumpled, and runs out of the room. Salieri watches in amazement and disgust. Mozart hastens towards the Grand Salon away from the buffet room, adjusting his dress as he goes. The opening of the Serenade is being tentatively conducted by the leader of the wind-musicians. Guests turn around as Mozart appears, bows to the Archbishop, and walks with an attempt at dignity to the dais where the wind band is playing. The leader yields his place to the composer, and Mozart smoothly takes over conducting. Constanze, deeply embarrassed, sneaks into the room and seats herself at the back. Salieri stands shocked from his inadvertent eavesdropping. Mozart is conducting the Adagio from his Serenade (K. 361), guiding the thirteen wind instrumentalists. Salieri appears at the door at the back of the salon and stares in disbelief at Mozart. The audience is clearly delighted, and Mozart bows to them, also delighted. He does it with a furious grace, then leaves the room. A group of people who have attended the concert, among them Constanze, are standing outside the private apartment. At sight of the composer, they break into sustained applause.",
    "130": "Gandhi starts to go down, and others around him, convinced by the authority of his voice, follow suit. The sense of the idea seizes Gandhi, and as the sound of the galloping horses nears, he turns and shouts too. The miners begin to go down, some face up, shielding their faces with their hands, some burying their faces in the earth and covering their heads with their hands. The sergeant's point of view shows a close fast traveling shot to the prone miners. Close on Gandhi, we see his arms crossed in front of his face, staring up, frightened but determined to bear it. The horses cannot bring themselves to gallop over the human carpet; they rear, plunge, and swerve. Gandhi turns to see the sergeant thrown off his horse, landing heavily, scrambling up, furious, and darting after it. Mounting again, the sergeant is enraged to hear laughter. Gandhi's command, angry in its own way but carrying all the weight of his influence, causes them to begin to go down again. The sergeant wheels his horse and rides at Gandhi. With a deliberate, almost fatalistic pace, Gandhi goes first to his knees and then sprawls down flat, his hands over the top of his head, awaiting the blow of the horse's hoof. A close shot of the horse's head shows its eyes rolling as it swerves again, while the sergeant, cursing, is unable to make it plunge down on the man. Surveying the whole procession sprawled on the ground, the sergeant, angrily wheeling his horse, sees his mounted police circling in front of them, unsure of what to do. He turns his horse angrily and gallops back toward the factories. Gandhi, Singh, and Tyeb Mohammed look off at the retreating horses. The car with the civilian has returned in the distance, and the sergeant wheels by it as his police turn their horses, lining up across the road again. Gandhi and the miners come on once more, chanting forcefully. Meanwhile, a congregation listens stiffly and unsympathetically to a clergyman who has given Charlie the use of his pulpit and sits beneath it, embarrassed but resolute. As Charlie struggles on, a few men in the congregation rise, escorting their families from the church, with more members rising and marching out, though a few pointedly do not. Gandhi threads his way in a line for soup, which winds through masses of prisoners, some with bowls, eating, some not yet in line. As Gandhi nears the two stone blocks holding the large barrels of soup, he sees that Khan is serving from one of them.",
    "1135": "The Minister's eyes flit from Harry to Ron, then to Hermione. The wedding reception is in full swing. A soft light spills out of the marquis. A group of men keep guard outside as Lupin strolls past them. Harry stands in the covered walkway, the Snitch hovering beside him, which he grasps and puts in his jacket pocket before entering the marquis. Fleur and Bill are dancing together between two lines of guests, with butterflies fluttering around them. Harry smiles as glasses magically fill with Champagne. Standing beside the table is tall, dark-haired Madame Maxime, and Hagrid looks up at her admiringly. A man with long white blonde hair dances theatrically with Luna Lovegood, and Ron stares while Hermione appears looking delightful in a sleeveless red dress. Harry spots Elphias Doge and heads towards him. Luna's father wears a pendant with a triangle containing a circle with a vertical line through it. Harry sits with Elphias, and an old woman scowls, prompting Harry to look puzzled. A bright white light appears in the sky, and Harry rises with his eyes fixed on the approaching light as the guests draw back. The light bursts into the marquis, and images and voices emerge from the hovering light, causing the guests to freeze. The images disappear, and Bill comforts Fleur as Elphias disapparates upon Death Eaters' arrival. They attack the guests, and Ron grabs Hermione while Harry heads for Ginny, only to be stopped by Lupin. Harry, Hermione, and Ron apparate in London, with Ron and Harry holding Hermione's hands as they follow her across Piccadilly Circus and down a crowded street to a dingy alley where they stand in a doorway. Hermione puts her hand into her small, bottomless handbag and pulls out clothes. They sit at a table in a cafe as a waitress comes over, wearing earphones, then struts off. Two men enter, and Hermione indicates her bag. The men fire wands, and in the kitchen, the waitress with the earphones sings to her music. One man is down as Hermione and Ron aim at the second behind the counter, who misses Hermione, and she then takes aim, causing him to fall. The waitress comes out of the kitchen and gapes, then scurries back. Ron uses the Deluminator to absorb the light from the lamps while Hermione uses her wand to lower shutters. He strokes her cheek, and Hermione moves slowly towards the dark-haired man in overalls lying on the floor, his body stiffened and unmoving. She points her wand with a shaking hand as her arm wavers and the tip glows, with Dolohov's eyes remaining open and starry. Later, they walk through a covered arcade until Hermione suddenly stops. In Grimmauld Place, they watch as Number 12, a tall terraced house, slides into position, and they enter the Black family home.",
    "150": "Irwin has listened and it's beginning to make a little sense, causing the principal secretary to blanch. Irwin looks at his ADC, paces a bit, and ponders it, and then after a moment of consideration, the general speaks. Irwin turns to him and this makes up his mind; he is concerned enough to be angry, but certain enough to be dogmatic. Suddenly, a mass of people hidden by the embankment appear at the top of the steps coming up from the river, followed by a long tendril of humanity stretching across the river to the distant outskirts of the city. Around the ashram, many fires are burning, people cook breakfast, some pack knapsacks for the journey, and others strew the path with leaves. It is quiet, with just the buzz of activity from outside the building. Gandhi grins at Mirabehn, who is massaging his legs, and smiles before turning back toward his bungalow. Ba and Mirabehn stand watching with Desai, and Gandhi holds their gaze a second before turning and starting forward. Pyarelal takes a position next to him, and the marchers follow. As they move along the path, a thinner crowd appears, while two police cars with several policemen, including a British officer, a British sergeant, and four Indian constables, are drawn up to one side. As Gandhi nears the police, Walker moves beside him, and some newspaper cameramen trot behind to capture Gandhi's arrest. Collins is among the newsmen, featuring Gandhi, Walker, and Pyarelal just behind, glancing at the police who are now quite near. Walker smiles uneasily as they near the police, and Gandhi nods amiably to them in passing. Walker turns to watch for a police move but begins to grasp that none may come; he hurries closer to Gandhi, keeping an eye on the police. Gandhi glances at Walker, who also wears a knapsack, and he nods politely to the British police officer at the end of the line. Walker stops, letting the procession pass, looks at the officer, and writes busily in his notebook, with Collins stopping by him. The scene shifts to a dusty approach to a dusty village, lined with peasants holding flower petals and leaves and gazing expectantly down the road. Behind them, the village is decorated with green, white, and saffron colors of Independence, and two large policemen stand arms-akimbo at the front, their postures imposing and threatening, though somewhat softened by the children skirting around them.",
    "638": "Graham halts, raises the torch, and peers into the tunnel of foliage ahead. He spins round, aiming the torch beam into the impenetrable jungle on one side but finding nothing, the light hardly passing beyond the first few rows of woody green stalks. He then lowers the flashlight to his side and begins to pick his way through the crop, one arm raised to shield his face from the leaves. Emerging in the first of the crop circles, Graham lowers his arm gently and comes to a gradual stop, viewing the area with renewed concern. A pale gray light fills the vast perfect circle of evenly flattened corn, and the leaves glow with a silvery sheen. Graham stands still, his torch shooting a slender shaft of light across the circle. His eyes dart about. Graham swallows and takes a steadying breath. He scans the circle apprehensively, then steps backwards towards the standing crop. Turning at the last moment, he cuts straight into the corn, struggling through the unbending forest until he stumbles out onto a pathway running between two areas of maize. Graham shines his torch along the path. It's clear. He then turns and points the beam the other way. Again, nothing. He stares into the crop. Whipping round, he drops the torch and the light goes out. Panting and keeping his eyes fixed intently on the maize, he crouches down warily and reaches for the torch. Locating the flashlight, he frantically slaps the lens and the beam returns, briefly illuminating his face. He shines the light down the path; a long thin bare leg slips silently into the corn. Graham scrabbles backwards, then leaps up and sprints off in the opposite direction. He plows into the corn and charges through it, the torch light dancing over the leaves as he runs. In the farmhouse, Morgan and Bo are washing up at the sink in the kitchen, which opens directly onto the lounge. Merrill sits at a table with his back to them, reading the army pamphlet he picked up in town and lazily chewing gum. Unnoticed by the other three, Graham pads softly into the kitchen and stops. He lowers himself gently into a seat at the table, his two children turning around to see their father staring at the floor. Morgan steps falteringly up to the table, leaving Bo at the sink. Merrill then peers casually over his shoulder and notices his downcast brother. Getting up, he heads into the kitchen, stopping just short of the table. Graham looks at Merrill, then sits up straight and sighs. On the screen, lights hover in a night sky. Graham and Merrill sit on the sofa while Morgan and Bo kneel close to the TV.",
    "420": "His cheek is pressed against the glass, with the foggy silhouettes of the others behind him. Eddie's mouth is open as he screams horribly. He screams again, and they let go of his arms, causing him to slump to the floor. The bartender turns and goes back to the bar in the front room as the ship's horn is heard again. There is a knock at the door. Sarah sits alone in the darkened room, dressed in her robe and slip, lost in a drunken half-sleep. She goes to the door and opens it, her eyes puffy and her face covered with perspiration. She looks up to see him leaning against the wall, his arms tucked into his chest, with one hand covering the other. Sarah is stunned and moves to him, taking him in her arms. He starts to cry, and she holds him. Sarah watches as Eddie, both hands encased in plaster casts, tries to sleep and moves his arms as if trying to defend himself. Sarah rises, joins him, and strokes his head. They are seated at the breakfast table, where Sarah pours him some coffee. He tries to bring the cup to his lips but cannot manage it, and in disgust, he drops the cup on the floor and gets up from the table. Sarah bends down and patiently wipes up the spilled coffee. The apartment is now clean and neat, and Sarah is sober. She is at her table typing, while Eddie stands at the window, trying to reach over his shoulder to scratch his back. He comes over to the table and picks a cigarette out of the pack with his mouth, looking quickly at her without asking directly for the match. She lights it, and as she does, he glances at the sheet in the typewriter. He starts to unbutton his shirt, but when Sarah immediately gets up to help, he holds her off. She watches him struggle with the button for a while, then spreads his arms in a gesture of helplessness. As she unbuttons his shirt for him, he takes her face in his hands and kisses her. Sarah and Eddie emerge from the doorway. It is a warm, beautiful day, and Sarah has a basket with her. Eddie seems happy to be out with her, almost as if he has forgotten the casts on his hands. They stop at a spot that overlooks the river and spread out a blanket. Eddie leans back on the grass and looks at Sarah, and they both seem easy and relaxed in the sunshine together. Eddie lowers his eyes and leans back, then just stares at her before he is about to knock on the door to Sarah's apartment.",
    "184": "The camera moves in on Laurie as a teacher drones away at the front of the room, and then it moves to a close-up of her. Laurie barely listens to the teacher as she doodles in her notebook and lets her gaze move to a window where she stares dreamily outside. From the window, she can see the street and a station wagon parked along the sidewalk, with the shape of a man standing behind it. Laurie turns away from the window and begins to doodle again before springing around from the window. She sneaks a glance back to the window, but the shape and the station wagon are gone. She turns back from the window to her notebook. Meanwhile, other boys form a circle around Tommy and taunt him. A car is parked in front of a small, closed-down gas station/diner by the side of the highway. The camera slowly tracks over to a phone booth where Loomis is inside on the telephone. Annie comes out of the side doors of the high school and calls after Laurie and Lynda, and the girls stop and wait for her. Laurie suddenly stops and looks back toward the school, then glances down the street where the station wagon slowly moves up toward them, with the shape not visible behind the windshield. Laurie stares at the station wagon as it moves past, looking directly at the shape inside, catching a quick glimpse of a strange pale face staring back. The shape is close to the camera, out of focus, staring at Laurie, then tromps on the accelerator, whizzing past them. Out the window, the three girls are seen on the sidewalk and up the street, the wagon suddenly stops, sitting there waiting. For a moment, the station wagon just sits there, then it takes off down the street and disappears around a corner. The girls start walking again and eventually stop in front of Lynda's house, a modest suburban home on a quiet, tree-lined street. Lynda strolls up to her house while Annie and Laurie start down the street. Up the sidewalk is a series of bushes lining the street, and the camera moves in to a close shot of Laurie's face as she stares ahead along the sidewalk where, partially hidden in the shadows of a bush, is the shape of a man watching them, barely visible and almost blending in with the dark foliage. The shape is gone, revealing just bushes. Annie walks right over to the bushes and kicks them hard while Laurie stands on the sidewalk several feet from the bushes, then slowly walks over and stares at the bush.",
    "219": "The four men sit about listening to a big box radio as Wash is whittling, Everett dips his comb into a pomade jar and carefully works on his hair, Pete is digging around with a toothpick, and Delmar dreamily waves one hand in time to the music. Everett clears his throat and screws the lid back on the pomade. They are sleeping in a hayloft, with Everett wearing a hairnet over his painstakingly arranged hair, when a spotlight plays over the hayloft ceiling and a voice booms, rousing the three men. From high, we see a foreshortened lawman holding a bullhorn surrounded by armed deputies, with a tin-starred sheriff watching impassively through mirrored sunglasses, a bloodhound drooling at his side. Pete screams down from the hayport as RAT-A-TAT-A-TAT- Everett pulls Pete down when a tommy gun spits lead into the hayloft. Enraged, Pete grabs a flaming faggot and hurls it down at the deputized congregation, but it lands harmlessly in some scattered straw. The drum of one starts spinning, flames lick up the outside of the van as - chinka-chinka-chinka - bullet holes walk across the body. Yelling men scurry away as the vehicle rocks and chatters under the force of the many tommy guns now firing inside, with tires popping, hissing, and settling, doors popping open, and glass shattering. Pete, Everett, and Delmar pile in, the doors slam shut, and the boy grinds into gear with wood blocks strapped to his feet to reach the accelerator, brake, and clutch, sitting on a Sears Roebuck catalogue to give him a view over the dash. The car speeds for the far wall, sheeted in flame, and bursts through. The little Hogwallop boy walks away in long shot down the middle of the empty road, his walk unsteady with the wood blocks still strapped to his feet. He turns to face us and hollers, as Pete enters in the foreground and throws a dirt clod at the boy, which lands shy as Pete yells. We pan Pete over to the shoulder where the car is stopped, its hood propped open, with Everett and Delmar looking at the engine. Everett pushes a small tin across the counter, stunned, and then picks up the tin. On a wooded hillside, they sit at a twig fire, roasting a small creature on a spit, and Everett stalks into frame, plopping disgustedly down by the fire, grimly shaking his head as he scrapes the last of it onto his comb and starts combing his hair. Everett fishes a gold watch from his pocket and tosses it to Pete, who looks at the watch, puzzled, pops the front, and reads the inscription.",
    "802": "On the screen, the vehicles and men are obscured by a large cloud of dust, and a robe is thrown at Ferris's feet before a black hood is put over his head. Barefoot, Ferris is manhandled into one of the vehicles, and the four SUVs drive off in different directions. They emerge from the cloud of dust, and Hoffman watches the vehicles go their separate ways as one of the SUVs speeds off down a road. An SUV stops in front of a stone building, where armed men open a large gate, and Ferris, still hooded, is dragged through the entrance. A man shines a torch into a dark cell, where Ferris is sitting on the floor with his ankles and wrists bound with cable ties. The man lifts Ferris's hood and holds a cup of water to his lips, tipping the cup so Ferris drinks. His ankles are bound to the chair legs by cable ties, and men escort Al-Saleem along dark passageways by torchlight. Ferris sits at a table with the black hood over his head, and his hands are secured to the tabletop with cable ties, palms down, while armed men stand guard. A harsh white light shines in the otherwise gloomy room, and on the wall behind Ferris is a black cloth with a gold disk and Arabic script on it. Al-Saleem walks in past a group of men, one of whom sits by a video camera focused on Ferris, and then Al-Saleem sits. The hood is pulled off Ferris's head, and he stares at Al-Saleem, who returns his gaze benignly and waves his finger before turning to the cameraman to say, \"Turn on the camera.\" Ferris sees Karami amongst the men observing and remembers Hani embracing Karami in the desert. Al-Saleem stands and picks up a hammer from a table of tools and hits Ferris' little finger, which snaps and spurts blood, causing Ferris to spit in Al-Saleem's face. Al-Saleem wipes it with his hand and hammers another finger before dropping the hammer and walking out. The men gather around Ferris, who hangs his head, and as Al-Saleem walks away down the gloomy corridors, he wipes his hands on a cloth. The executioner, a man wearing a black cloak and hat, yanks Ferris's head up by his hair, spits in his face, and slams Ferris’ face down on the table. Al-Saleem and one of his men head downstairs and through a market, while Ferris, with his nose and mouth bloody, heaves and shifts within his ties. Ferris' ties are cut, and the men pull him to the floor. He kicks and struggles as they lift him, and the camera keeps filming as Ferris is lifted onto the table, face down. Ferris is flipped onto his back and keeps struggling, but the men hold him spread-eagled on the table.",
    "361": "Gandalf stands quietly on a balcony that overlooks the great city as Pippin stares up at the vast night sky. Gandalf watches the young hobbit and then joins Pippin as they look towards the distant, jagged mountains of Mordor. Pippin, unnerved, looks up at Gandalf, who gives him a small self-deprecating smile. Together, Gandalf and Pippin share a quiet moment as they stare out towards the fiery sky over Mordor. Giant Mumakil carry armies upon their backs, and Corsair ships sail up the river. Almost talking to himself, like a man unable to prevent a sure disaster, Gandalf observes the battle-scarred city of Osgiliath, the last bastion between Minas Tirith and Mordor. Pippin desperately seeks reassurance, but Gandalf looks down at him without saying anything and stares into the distance as if seeing something in his mind's eye. A towering, hooded figure dressed in black is being armored by attendant orcs as Gandalf continues to stare intently as if facing his enemy in person. Pippin looks up at Gandalf, afraid to ask, while he recalls Frodo screaming as the Morgul blade is driven into his shoulder, and Pippin blanches at the memory. Meanwhile, Frodo and Sam clamber into a small gully beside a rough-hewn road as Gollum carefully peers over the lip of the gully. Minas Morgul, a massive dead city set upon a rocky knee at the head of the Morgul Valley, glows with a sickly luminous light like a corpse candle, and two huge, bestial stone statues guard the bridge leading to the city. Gollum, Frodo, and Sam hurry from their cover, scampering in the shadows towards Minas Morgul. Frodo looks up at the hideous statues, and he and Sam are aghast at the sight of a narrow, near-vertical staircase cut into the rock face directly in front of the Minas Morgul gates, leading higher and higher up the sheer western side of the Morgul Valley to the high peaks of the razor-like mountains of Mordor. Suddenly, Frodo staggers across the road as if some force other than his own will is at work, lurching toward the bridge and Minas Morgul. Sam runs after Frodo, catching him in his arms as he stumbles, and with Gollum's help, pulls Frodo from the bridge before Frodo falls to the ground. At that moment, the ground quivers, and a great rumbling noise rolls across and echoes in the mountains. The cold, dull Morgul Valley becomes violent and fierce as uprushing flames spring from Mount Doom. Minas Morgul responds with a flare of livid lightning, forks of blue flame springing up from the tower into the sullen cloud, and violent fiery flashes light the cloud above Mordor as sharp thunder rolls across 40 miles to Minas Tirith.",
    "622": "Juno, wearing the adapted jeans, comes down the school with her hands long in the pockets of her baggy tartan parker as her fellow students, staring at her belly, clear a path to let her pass. Mark is at home composing. In the school canteen, the two girls eat their lunch in an empty school awards booth while Leah gazes adoringly at the tubby bearded teacher. At his locker, Bleeker knocks back as Juno waddles up to him and looks him straight in the eye. Bleeker's eye shift as he glances in Katrina's direction, and his head drops miserably. Juno strides away with her canvas bag over her shoulder, leaving Bleeker standing by his locker, watching her glumly. Juno hoists herself up into her dad's Previa, puts on some lip balm, and starts the engine. Meanwhile, Mark, surfing on his PC, sees the blue van pull up outside as Juno follows him downstairs, and he leads her into a cluttered basement room. She reads a title and her hands grab his waist. He brings the up to his neck, and with his hands round her waist, her belly touching his, she closes her eyes and rests her head on his chest as they slowly sway together. Mark, with his chin brushing against her hair, seems unsettled as Juno looks up startled and stares at him in bewilderment. Vanessa, loaded down with shopping, comes into her pristine white kitchen while Mark lowers his gaze. Juno starts to go and bolts out of the door, clutching her belly as she waddles out to the Previa. Mark, in his rock T-shirt over a long-sleeved undershirt, looks coldly at Vanessa and goes back to his room, and Vanessa sinks down on the stairs and gazes unhappily into space. Beneath a cloudy sky, Juno drives under a road bridge, passing a freight train on one side. She pulls off the main carriageway onto the soft shoulder, next to a sward of dull green grass dotted with patches of spring snow, runs her hand over her own belly as she gives into tears, and crammed in behind the wheel, seems oblivious of the passing cars as she rubs her belly under her thick tartan coat, her eyes staring straight ahead, not looking at anything in particular, and she starts to calm down. The car lights flash, and she pulls back onto the road and drives off. Up in his room, Bleeker is playing his guitar after dark. On the bonnet of the van, with her head resting on the sloping front windscreen and her hands tucked behind her back, Juno stares up at the sky. She suddenly raises herself onto her elbows, climbs back into the van, rummages behind her to find a crumpled receipt, smoothes it out on the steering wheel of the van, and starts to write on it.",

Madison heads out, and as she opens the door, light streams across Jessica's face. The kids glance over at something, and some have stopped to stare. Outside, there's a red curtain set out in the middle of a yard with a crowd gathered around it. Jessica and her friends approach the curtain, it drops, and Robbie stands on a platform behind it.

    "425": "There is a drink in her hand, and a suitcase beside her on the bed. Bert enters her suite and confronts her. Sarah's voice is subdued, controlled. He stands over her, pulling a wad of bills from his pocket. He picks her up and tries to kiss her but she is cold and limp in his arms, so he lets go and she drops back on the bed. Then he turns and walks back into his room. She waits for a moment. Then she takes a cigarette out of a pack, gets up, and goes into his room. In the bathroom mirror, we see Bert asleep on his bed. The sheets are rumpled and tossed about. Then we see Sarah, in her slip, enter the bathroom and shut the door. Eddie is just getting back. He walks through the lobby, ignoring the uniformed policeman standing nearby, and stops at the desk. The concierge stares dumbly. The concierge hands it to him. Eddie walks quickly toward the elevators. He enters, sees the money on Sarah's bed, puts down his cue case, and turns to see a crowd in the adjoining room. Bert, laying in bed, talks to a plainclothesman who stands over him, taking notes. A photographer with a flash camera stands by the bathroom. Bert stops when he sees Eddie through the open door. A uniformed policeman bars Eddie's entrance. Eddie comes in. He looks at the detectives around Bert's bed. The photographer's bulb flashes as he takes a picture of the bathroom. Eddie pushes by the photographer, then stops as he sees Sarah's body laid out on the tiled floor. He drops to his knees beside her. Eddie reaches out to touch her, then pulls back his hand. Bert appears at the bathroom door behind him. Eyes closed, he writhes as he listens to Bert. Suddenly he uncoils and lunges at Bert, grasping him by the throat and pushing him back. A policeman untangles them, but Eddie breaks free. Minnesota Fats sits in his chair, engrossed in the afternoon paper. Big John is at a pool table, trying out a few shots. Bert, in dark glasses, stands near the cashier's cage, chucking dice into a leather shaker. The noise of the dice echoes in the slow, late afternoon gloom of Ames. When Bert sees Eddie push open the glass doors, he draws himself up fearfully like a turtle, and motions with his eyes to his men for protection. Eddie, his cue case tucked under his arm, walks straight toward him. He stops, stares at him for a moment, then turns and walks over to Minnesota Fats. Fats rises, ready to play. Eddie starts to screw his cue together. He turns to join Fats at the table.",
    "328": "Resting on a small rock rising out of the long, overgrown white flowers scattered among well-seeded grasses, an idyllic setting at the end of a long hot summer, the figure is reading a book. The figure in the grass sits up, looking straight at the camera, revealing a handsome young hobbit with dark curly hair and deep blue eyes. This is Frodo Baggins, his eyes alight with excitement. Tossing away the long stem of grass in his mouth, Frodo runs off. A cart rattles along a leafy lane, driven by a stooped figure in grey. The shambling old pony snorts and rears. Shire, 60 years later, camera tracks to a figure lying beneath the dappled sunlight of an old tree. Suddenly, Frodo appears on a bank above the cart. They look at each other a moment, then both start laughing as Frodo's face breaks into a smile, and he leaps onto the front seat of the cart. The cart rattles past a field lupin being tended by Gandalf, who looks down at Frodo with a twinkle in his eye. The cart rattles over a stone bridge towards a busy hobbit marketplace. Gandalf surveys the peaceful scene before him. Hobbits look up exclaiming in wonder and excitement as the cart bearing Gandalf and Frodo rolls past the Green Dragon Inn towards the party field, where scores of hobbits are busy preparing for the big night. Odo Proudfoot looks up as the cart passes by, deeply suspicious. As the cart rattles into the small village of Hobbiton, a quaint rustic settlement nestled amongst rolling green hills and large trees, excited children chase after the cart. Gandalf ignores the children's cries, but as they stand deflated, watching Gandalf disappear up the lane, spinning balls of bright color suddenly leap out of the cart, fizzing over the heads of the delighted children. Gandalf smiles to himself, well-pleased with his joke, and even Odo Proudfoot is unable to suppress a chuckle. Frodo stands up in the cart as Gandalf reins in the horse. The hobbits live in Hobbit holes: neat burrows dug into the grassy hillside, with round doors and cute front gardens. Gandalf's cart pulls up outside the gate to Bag End, a particularly fine example of a hobbit hole with a large round front door set into a grassy hillside. He raises his staff and raps on the front door, and a voice calls out. Suddenly, the door opens and Bilbo Baggins stands before him, a hobbit of indeterminate age with a mischievous twinkle in his eye. Wearing a dashing brocade waistcoat, he looks every inch the eccentric gentleman. Gandalf drops to his knee to embrace his old friend.",
    "864": "In the dark wood, the urchin-like Cosette is carrying a bucket when she sees Valjean approaching. She drops the bucket and runs to hide behind a tree, watching him fearfully as moonlight glows faintly on her young face. Cosette brightens, takes his arm, and he carries the bucket full of water through town, where Madame Thenardier walks up and takes the bucket. Thenardier opens his arms, but Cosette shakes her head at him. Thenardier beckons Cosette to him, but she doesn't go as Madame Thenardier gasps. Valjean grabs back his hat that Thenardier had taken and then takes Cosette, giving her a doll and carrying her away to the inn. Javert rides up and then rides away as Madame Thenardier shoves her husband, who leans in for a kiss, but she pushes him away. Valjean and Cosette ride through the night in a carriage, where she sleeps with her head resting on his lap, and Valjean strokes her hair while the moon shines through trees in the forest. He looks down fondly at the sleeping child, then sees Javert and stuffs the doll inside his coat. They get out of the carriage and run off hand in hand by the city wall as Javert, on horseback, sees them and gives chase. They run along a colonnade, and Valjean climbs over a stone balustrade, lifting Cosette over as Javert is forced to stop and turn back. Valjean pulls down a rope dangling from the side of a building, and now on foot, Javert marches along an alleyway. As Javert searches along dark alleyways, Valjean climbs to the top of a wall, struggling as Cosette watches fearfully. Using the rope, he hauls her up beside him, and they lie still along the top of the wall with Javert below them, who then walks off. Valjean lowers Cosette on the rope on the other side of the wall, climbs down himself, and carries Cosette as they peer into a chapel lit by the golden glow of candlelight, where a group of nuns is singing. Holding Cosette, Valjean turns and sees a man with a spade, who throws down his spade and takes off his hat. They go with Fauchelevant. High up on a tower, Javert stands facing an ornate cross, closes a Bible, and walks out to a ledge overlooking Paris, beside a huge stone eagle, as the tower rises up behind him to a spire with a cross on top. Standing in the corner of the wasteland where the Bastille stood is a giant elephant, a model Napoleon had constructed for a monument, now dowdy and decaying, from which a scruffy, ratty-haired urchin climbs out of a hole in the elephant's head.",
    "1329": "They consider the police car a moment more. Kyle hands the shotgun over to Bob. Charlie's face lights up when she sees the police car. The door of the police car opens as Charlie races from the diner. The three men see her moving toward the car. Jeep's face goes slack. The men begin to run toward her. While out of the police car steps. Charlie freezes a few feet from the car when she sees those piercing eyes already familiar to us. Michael looks at her, as if she were exactly who he expected to see. In moments Bob, Kyle, and Jeep form a protective shield in front of Charlie. Bob raises the shotgun. A long beat as Michael considers Bob. Michael stares at him blankly. Michael offers up a dangerous smile, revealing a not so well-kept but definitely normal set of teeth. Bob and the others ease slightly. Bob lowers the gun. Michael remains silent. Bob chuckles for a moment. When Michael doesn't respond in kind, Bob falls silent. He slowly raises the shotgun again. Michael sizes up this raggedy group. His gaze drifts over to the loosely wrapped body in front of the diner. The plastic table cloth flaps wildly in the wind. Turning back to Bob. Michael just shakes his head. Michael steps toward Charlie with a sense of purpose, but Bob blocks his path, brandishing the shotgun. That's when Kyle Michael something out in the direction of the road. Michael whips the gun away from Bob's head and thrusts it back into his hands. Bob looks down at the gun, speechless. Michael walks swiftly around to the trunk of the cruiser. Pops it, revealing a staggering arsenal of weaponry. Michael's eyes narrow, studying Jeep. Michael pulls out twin MP5s for himself. Boxes of shotgun shells. A flicker of light. And then flashlight beams cut through the darkness, coming to rest on Michael's pale face. Michael looks up at the ceiling. A hatch opens and out comes Michael followed by Bob, Percy, and Kyle. Michael is about to answer, when two headlights appear in the darkness. And sure enough, an ice cream truck rolls slowly toward the diner. It's too dark to see who's behind the wheel. The men quickly do as they're told. Kyle and Bob shoot quick anxious looks at Percy. Charlie and Audrey peer between the slats covering the windows. The ice cream truck's headlights fan across the diner. Audrey and Charlie back away from the windows. Charlie stops next to Jeep. Rests a hand on his arm. Howard smiles weakly at the familiar sound of the calliope. The ice cream truck pulls to a stop with its headlights facing the diner. Everyone aims their guns at the truck.",
    "397": "He turns and sees Dil walking toward him, a bottle in her hand, and he runs toward her. They are tussling in the darkness of the park, and he takes her arm. Fergus and Dil are on the stairs up to Dil's flat, where Fergus looks at her and shakes her, growing alarmed. He slaps her cheek, and she opens her eyes slowly. He walks in holding her, leans her against the wall, and then goes to the window to check the street outside. She takes a large slug from a bottle of whiskey and points weakly to a cabinet through the open door of the bathroom. He goes and gets the pills while she drinks from the whiskey bottle. She walks around the room drinking, then sits down and looks at Fergus. She stares straight ahead, the bottle clutched in her hands between her knees, as Fergus walks slowly toward the door. She looks at him, standing up, with something incredibly attractive about her, and he walks slowly toward her. He kisses her on the lips, and we see the photograph with the soldier's smiling face. She seems to be in a sweet narcotic haze as she reaches out her hand and strokes his. Fergus sits down on the bed as Dil lies back on it, still stroking his hand. Her voice is dreamily slurred, her eyes far away, and she smiles woozily. She woozily tries to hit him round the face and raises an unsteady hand to point at him. He strokes her cheek as she says something very slowly and sleepily, and her eyes close as she falls into a deep sleep. Fergus looks down at her almost fondly as they lie on the bed together, fully clothed. Dil wakes and rises very quietly, going to his coat thrown across a chair. She searches through the pockets and takes out the gun. Meanwhile, Jude is in bed as an alarm sounds, and she reaches to turn it off. Dil takes several silk stockings out of a drawer and ties them very securely to each corner of the brass bed. She ties them round both of Fergus's feet very gently so as not to wake him. Jude, in front of a mirror getting ready, is fully dressed. Dil ties the other stocking and is drawing it upward when Fergus wakes. She jerks the silk stocking so it is secure and speaks unnaturally quietly. Jude takes a gun from under the bed and slips it into her handbag. Dil crouches beside Fergus, his gun in her hand, and Fergus stares at her, trying to pull on the bindings. She stands up, still pointing the gun at Fergus, while Jude is on the street and Maguire's car pulls up rapidly and she gets inside. Fergus drags at his bindings as the figure of the judge appears in the window.",
    "781": "Inside, there's a photo of a couple kissing. Every week contains weddings. He closes the book and stares ahead. At her apartment, Jane is wrestling the evening's dresses into a closet filled to bursting with a colorful riot of party gowns. She squeezes in every last bit of rebellious fabric and pushes backward against the doors, forcing them closed. The doors spring back open. She grabs the papers and settles on the couch. Its glow makes a dark silhouette of the towering city skyline and sunbathes the buildings lining Central Park as rush hour begins. Kevin, carrying coffees, arrives at the offices of the New York Journal. Crossing a street, Jane meets Casey getting out of a cab. Casey proudly sports a man's white shirt. They walk into their office reception. Jane grins and heads for her cluttered desk. He shows her the filofax. She glares at him. Jane is with Casey looking at photo layouts. As Gina walks off, Jane looks exasperated. Casey pulls a face. Jane looks pained as ruggedly handsome George walks off. Casey stalks off, leaving Jane sorting out some unruly adhesive notes. Casey flashes Gina a false smile. Casey flounces off. A jumbo jet touches down, and in the airport, Jane smiles as cute blonde Tess arrives. The sisters arrive at Jane's apartment. Jane struggles with the luggage. At night, in one of thousands of taxis, Kevin reads Jane's filofax. Jane and Casey are at Gina's party in a busy, low-lit club. George saunters suavely over to them. Jane walks breathlessly over to where George is drinking beer and chatting with friends. Tess, in a shimmery dress, approaches from the other direction. George spots her and grins, then clocks Jane. As Jane approaches, her face falls, realizing that George and Tess are making a beeline for each other. They smile as Jane frowns. Jane fakes a smile as George catches her eye. As Tess and George leave, Kevin walks up. She looks stunned. She hands him her drink, then turns and walks out of the club through a side door. Kevin looks puzzled as she bashes a wall with her handbag. She's in full view of a sedate dinner party. Trying to regain her composure, she rejoins Kevin in the club, who's waiting, eyebrows raised. She stares after Tess and George. Later, a car drives past Jane's building. She rushes to the front door, peers through the peephole, then flings it open. She stomps back inside. Jane switches on the light in the living room, it's empty and she wanders anxiously up and down, then picks up a magazine from the couch, sits in a chair, thumbs through it distractedly. She glances towards the front door.",
    "40": "TEX takes the list, examines it, then folds it and puts it in his pocket. They finish with the items from the bag. She hangs up and turns to JEAN-LOUIS. REGGIE looks to where JEAN-LOUIS is pointing -- to the top of the high armoire. Taking one of the straight chairs to the armoire, she stands on it. Although she is still not high enough to see anything, by standing on tip-toes she is able to reach with her hand over the top and grope around blindly. REGGIE has finally managed to pull down the case -- a rectangular black bag about the size and shape of a trombone case. As he climbs off the chair, JEAN-LOUIS suddenly runs to the door, unbolts it and runs into the hall, CAMERA PANNING with him. As JEAN-LOUIS runs out into the hall, shouting, DYLE is the first one to appear, coming out of GIDEON's room. TEX has also appeared from REGGIE's room, followed by GIDEON. The THREE MEN rush by JEAN-LOUIS and squeeze simultaneously into SCOBIE's room. As DYLE, TEX, and GIDEON enter, REGGIE is placing the little straight black chair to its original position. As they stare at the case, surprised and just a little embarrassed, slowly TEX lowers the lid. The MEN avoid looking at one another, including REGGIE and JEAN-LOUIS by the door. The MEN look at one another. The THREE MEN hurry past REGGIE and JEAN-LOUIS and out of the door. DYLE, TEX, and GIDEON, followed by REGGIE and JEAN-LOUIS cross the hall to DYLE's room. DYLE turns the key which is still in the door. He enters, followed by the others. DYLE, TEX, and GIDEON stand in the center of the room, looking around. REGGIE and JEAN-LOUIS wait in the open doorway. The room looks like a cyclone hit the place, but there is no sign of SCOBIE. The sound of running water can be heard coming from behind the closed door to the bathroom and DYLE is the first to notice the water beginning to leak out from under the door. SCOBIE, still dressed in his raincoat, lies face up, his head submerged in the filled tub, the water now pouring over the edge. His face is distorted. DYLE's hand appears and turns off the water. DYLE, TEX, and GIDEON staring at CAMERA. CLOSE SHOT -- SCOBIE. CAMERA WHIRLS for a TIGHT CLOSE SHOT of a MAID, her eyes widening as the realization that the man is dead strikes her. Then she screams. CLOSE SHOT -- GRANDPIERRE. GRANDPIERRE raps for silence on his desk. During the pause, he looks into each face in turn. REGGIE and DYLE walking along the quai, next to the Seine. They have passed an ice-cream wagon on the corner of the Pont au Double.",
    "584": "Trina tumbles across the galley as the plane straightens out and the gauges drop. They head towards a church on an expanse of open land, and Whip steers the plane away from the church's steeple, but the wing grazes the top. The plane hits the ground, and debris glides past the cockpit as Whip bangs his head and passes out. Through blurred vision, Whip sees Ken leaning to the side in his seat as he is dragged out, while Margaret is slumped next to Trina's still body, her head crushed by a collapsed bulkhead. Smoke blocks Whip's vision as he is pulled away from the plane, with people in white robes helping the passengers. A fire engine arrives, and Whip looks up at a female EMT leaning over him, then turns towards the black smoke rising from the crash site. The broken-off spire from the church lies some distance away from an ambulance as rescue workers help survivors. In a hospital ward, Whip slowly opens his right eye, the other covered by a bandage, and sees a seated man on the TV gesturing as rescue workers push a stretcher behind him. A Channel 12 News field reporter comments live from the site as lights flicker in the background, and cell phone footage on TV shows the descent of the plane swerving and slicing off the church steeple, gliding overhead with both engines on fire, and slamming down on its side as people in white robes run for cover. Whip, his head wrapped in gauze, watches in a daze as the church folks stand and take in the scene from a distance, then slowly approach. Whip averts his gaze from the screen and notices a man in the room wearing a suit with the collar open, staring intently at his cell phone. Charlie turns and Whip smiles as a man in an NTSB jacket enters, followed by law officers, a nurse, and a doctor. The NTSB officer places a recorder on Whip's bed, and Whip nods weakly as the doctor leaves. Craig takes his recorder and leaves with the others, but Charlie stays back, smiles, reaches for a plastic bag, and then leaves. Whip puts his bandaged hand to his mouth as tears flow down his face, shakes his head, takes his cell phone from the plastic bag, and drops it on his stomach. A heavy man with a goatee enters the hospital, wearing Bermuda shorts and dark glasses with earphone wires hanging on each side of his head. He strides to the corridors carrying a bag in his hand and another slung over his shoulder, removes his earphones, and leans over the reception desk.",
    "469": "Joseph places the chain around his neck as the crowd claps. Salieri attempts to kiss Joseph's hand, but Joseph restrains him and moves on. Cavalieri smiles adoringly, gives Joseph a deep curtsey, and he raises her up. The crowd flocks to Salieri with cries and words of approval, all wanting to shake his hand, tugging and patting him. Salieri pays attention to only one man, looking around until he finds Mozart standing there. Eagerly, Salieri moves towards him, smiling. Later, there is explosive laughter as Mozart and Schikaneder enter an apartment with three actresses, looking pleased with themselves. The front door opens gingerly, and a still rather drunk Mozart sticks his head into the room, anxious not to make a noise. He sees strangers and smiles, then opens the door wide to admit Schikaneder and the girls. Mozart stares. On stage, the huge figure of the Commendatore, in robes and helmet, is seen extending his arms and pointing in accusation. A huge nailed fist crashes through a painted dining room wall on stage. The giant armored statue of the Commendatore enters, pointing his finger in accusation at Don Giovanni, who sits at the supper table, while his servant Leporello quakes with fear under the table. Salieri is standing alone in the back of a box in semi-darkness, unseen. The theatre is only half full as the scene on stage continues with the Commendatore addressing Giovanni. Don Giovanni is seized by the Statue's icy hand, and flames burst from obviously artificial rocks as demons appear, dragging him down to Hell. Salieri stares wide-eyed. Schikaneder sits at a table, drinking from a bottle of wine, and Michael Schlumberg enters from his salon. Mozart stands looking very unwell and bewildered, staring in panic, and suddenly springs up, clearly terrified, running out of the room into his workroom and shutting the door. Constanze, now a little scared, goes to the front door and opens it cautiously. Schikaneder, floridly dressed as usual, is standing there, while Lorl peeks out from the kitchen. Schikaneder sees the manuscript on the table and eagerly goes to it, picking up a page without waiting for a reply. Mozart opens the workroom door, appearing wild-eyed, extremely pale, and strange as Schikaneder sees him. Mozart giggles triumphantly, while Schikaneder stares at him. Mozart, with a bright and rather demented smile, presents his head to Schikaneder, who suddenly grabs Mozart's lapels. Lorl, frightened and tearful, sits before Salieri.",
    "1241": "The clock shows five past four. Pacing now, with his hands clasped together behind his head, a cigarette dangling between his lips, Brian looks alternately at his office floor, then at the clock. He looks up, awestruck, as silhouettes of fans leaping to their feet in celebration crowd the frosted windows. The clock ticks half-four. Brian sits with his head in his hands. He stands and once more peers up at the figures of the cheering Derby fans. He bows his head against the wall, then paces in the light streaming through the windows, his hands on his head. Brian puts on his jacket, straightens his tie and steps into the corridor. Outside his office door, he smooths both hands over his hair, then strides off down the gloomy, brick-walled passage. He stops in his tracks as he sees Jimmy and Peter turn the corner ahead. Jimmy strolls off, leaving Peter frowning at Brian. Peter's face softens into a grin. Beaming, Brian runs and embraces him. The team cheer in the dressing room. A Telex machine. Match footage. Brian in TV interview. Parkinson grins. Derby climb the table to the top. In interview again. Crowds welcome the Derby team bus back with the cup. Muhammad Ali on TV. Crowds flock down the mile to Wembley for the charity shield. Color TV footage from the time. Jimmy follows Brian into the Leeds dressing room. Brian takes a note from his blazer pocket. The team turn grudgingly. He grins and winks. Bremner shoots a dour glance at Giles. The teams come out. Bremner scratches his balls as he eyes Brown contemptuously, standing beside the team lined up for the national anthem. Don sings in the stands. On the pitch, Brian remains tight-lipped. Brian smirks wryly as he locks looks with Don, who looks away imperiously. Bremner salutes Don in the stands, who smiles back and touches his nose smugly. The Leeds team jig in a circle on the spot with their right arms raised to the fans. Liverpool on the edge of the Leeds area. Off the ball, Giles punches Keegan to the floor. Brian shuts his eyes. Commentators watch as Brian mutters furiously. Emlyn Hughes lifts the shield. Brian's patted consolingly on the shoulder. At an FA tribunal. The row of gray-haired men in blazers rise. Bremner trudges out after the officials, leaving Brian sitting alone, brooding. Brian's on the phone in his hotel suite. Peter listens. Brian swigs booze. Peter's eyes rove in anguish as his brows knit in a frown. He hangs up. Brian is left hunched over on his hotel bed, head in hand. By the dressing rooms. Brian nods sagely, then leans close.

    "1052": "Lizzie and the Gardiners are traveling through the rolling hills of the Peaks. Darcy is practicing his fencing. They shake hands and Baines leaves. Lizzie is picking her way across the rocks at the top of a hill, while the Gardiners are watching her from the bottom of the slope. Lizzie gazes at the countryside around her. That evening, the three of them are eating supper. Mrs. Gardiner looks at Lizzie, and Lizzie smiles. The next day, the open-topped carriage is making its way through the green countryside, towards Pemberley. It crosses a tiny, single-arched bridge over a stream. Lizzie and Mrs. Gardiner sit facing Mr. Gardiner. The carriage continues on its way, passing through woods in the bright sunshine. Then, the magnificent Pemberley appears, and Lizzie's breath is taken away by the sheer splendor of the classical, stately home. Lizzie nods with a broad smile. The carriage rolls beneath a grand, ornate arch leading to Pemberley. Inside, the housekeeper shows them a beautiful mahogany writing desk. They continue on, into the next room. The housekeeper turns to Lizzie, who walks over to the window and looks out at the lake, mirror-like, at the foot of the lawn. A portrait of Georgiana is seated and looking pensive, and there is a miniature portrait of a rather haughty young man. They head up a grand, white staircase. Outside, a white horse is cantering along a wooden path, with Darcy astride it, dressed elegantly in a top hat and frock coat. Bringing the horse to a halt, he stares from the hilltop, over at Pemberley, which can just be glimpsed through the trees. He breathes deeply, as if trying to come to a decision. Then suddenly, he sets the horse in motion again and gallops onward. Near a lake, he stops and quickly dismounts. He takes off his top hat and starts to undo his coat. Inside, the tour of Pemberley continues, and the housekeeper leads them into a magnificent long hall, lined with paintings on one side and windows on the other. She stops in front of one of the paintings, and Lizzie gazes up at the portrait of Darcy, staring proudly out at them. Outside, Darcy has now taken off his frock coat, lays it on the grass, sits on it, and undoes his cravat. His dark hair curls with sweat. Then he unbuttons his waistcoat and slips it off. Inside, Lizzie is still gazing up at his portrait. Darcy stands at the very edge of the lake, now in just his breeches and loose, white shirt. Steeling himself, he dives in, plunges down into the murky, green waters, then begins to swim with long, effortless strokes. Lizzie is now admiring the formal gardens.",
    "71": "A SMOKER steps in, and Dante manages to break his study of the O.C. oddity and searches for the smokes. The smoker glances at Randal and then at the O.C. oddity. The smoker looks at Randal. The odd man places a handkerchief over an egg on the floor and quickly whisks the handkerchief away to reveal the egg still sitting on the floor. Dante, Randal, and the smoker stare at the O.C. man. Then, a little girl comes into view, smiling and holding money. She can't be any more than five. A female customer pops items onto the counter and stands silently, awaiting something. Dante rings her up. Randal flips open the magazine's centerfold, revealing a graphic picture of a woman with her vaginal lips and anus spread wide open. Dante frantically apologizes to the rapidly exiting customer. Randal checks out the centerfold wistfully. A woman pulls out gallon after gallon, looking deep into the cooler for the perfect container of milk. A series of people address the camera, asking dumb questions, while others stand in various locations throughout the convenience store, asking truly dumb questions. Dante gives Randal a shove to shut him up. Veronica enters the store, carrying books and something covered with aluminum foil, and Dante is suddenly by her side, taking the books from under her arm. Randal makes loud slurping noises from O.C. and walks past the two, patting Veronica on the head as he exits. She exits too. Randal is recommending titles to potential customers and pops his head in to make the loud slurping noise again before hanging up. Randal joins Dante, then walks away, causing Dante to shake his head in frustration and pick up the phone again, rolling his eyes to the ceiling. Randal comes back. Tape is rolled around the top of a stick; an orange ball is slapped back and forth by a blade, and laces are pulled tightly. Randal enters, wearing his equipment as the hockey players fill the convenience store. Sanford skates up and skids to a halt, and on the roof, they jump off the ladder and skate around. From across the street, we get the full, odd perspective of a store with many men gliding around on the roof. Some sit on the floor or lean against the coolers, but all are either preparing or practicing. On the roof, Dante skates and passes with another player, while the players ascend a ladder adjacent to the door, one by one. Randal pulls his mask on and slaps his glove, urging a shot. Sanford skates in and takes a shot, which Randal blocks. Jay and Silent Bob deal to a player: he drops money over the ledge, and Jay throws up a dime bag.",

At her home, Charlotte shouts up the stairs, and Skeeter bursts excitedly through her door in her pajamas, almost slipping on the stairs. She opens the fly screen door of the kitchen and looks about her expectantly, with her hair in rollers. Skeeter stares at her smooth hair, and Charlotte watches her drive off in a pickup truck with a loaded trailer on the back. She speeds across a bridge towards a leafy suburb. At the Holbrooks', Hilly is checking her watch as Skeeter arrives looking disheveled. William and Stuart get to their feet, and the men swig their Coke humorously. At dinner, clean-cut pursuited Stuart downs his glass of bourbon and points imperiously at a waiter, looking perplexed. Hilly ushers her husband away from the table, leaving Skeeter alone with Stuart, who burps, and Skeeter rolls her eyes. Skeeter leaves the table and barges out, much to bourbon-drinking Stuart's amusement, as he winks tipsily at William, who shakes his head despairingly. In her yard, Celia brings a flapping chicken to a log where an ax is waiting to dispatch the bird, while Minnie, watching from a window, winces. A tin of Crisco lard is set aside as Celia smiles warmly. Minnie folds down the top of a brown paper bag and hands it to Celia. Later, Minnie sits down at a prettily laid table by a window in the kitchen to have her lunch, puts a napkin on her lap, and brings a fried chicken wing to her lips. Minnie gapes at Celia's determined expression and sits back down as Celia bites into a chicken leg and smiles contentedly. Minnie gives her a look. Minnie and Aibileen have been listening to the phone conversation in Aibileen's dimly lit house, and she brushes Minnie's hand away. Her face crumples with the pain of the recollection, and she gets up from the table and leaves the room. By the Holbrook swimming pool, Hilly is addressing the local ladies, and Elizabeth simpers. Elain spots the pamphlet peeking out of Skeeter's briefcase, theatrically shielding her eyes from the sun, and waits for Aibileen's reply. Aibileen looks across at Yule Mae, and their eyes meet. Later, Skeeter wanders into the Holbrook's kitchen and finds Yule Mae by the sink, who checks nobody is in near shot. Hilly comes in, carrying her little boy Billy, kisses Billy on the head, and hands him over to Yule Mae. Hilly's face hardens, her lip curling unpleasantly as she points a menacing finger. After dark, Skeeter is working in her room, puffing on a cigarette as she considers Hilly's text, and looks up at a shelf above her, gazing bitterly at a photograph of herself and Hilly when they were younger.",
    "107": "A police officer escorts Jenny to her grandmother's trailer, where Jenny's grandmother meets her outside and leads her toward the trailer. Jenny later climbs over a second-floor railing and enters the house, lying in bed next to young Forrest and hugging him. As teenagers, Forrest and Jenny walk along an oak-lined road until Forrest is suddenly hit in the back with a rock. They turn around to see a teenage boy throwing another rock, just as a pickup truck pulls up. Jenny turns and looks at Forrest, who drops his books and runs down the road. The teenage boy jumps into the back of the pickup truck with another boy as the truck speeds after Forrest, and Jenny steps left to get out of the way. Forrest leaps over a five-foot fence as the boys try to catch him and looks left while continuing to tell his life story. He runs along the road in front of the high school as the truck chases him and the boys pound on the roof. Forrest runs under the field goal post and through the end zone. The crowd roars with excitement as a football is kicked off and players run around the field. Forrest is seen in a University of Alabama football uniform, looking up into the cheering crowd as his teammate fields the kickoff and hands him the ball. The football coach, assistants, and Alabama players cheer for Forrest as he runs across the field, speeds past defending and opposing players. The football coach runs along the sidelines yelling, while Forrest cuts toward the sidelines, and two opposing players collide. The football coach, assistants, and players motion for Forrest to run toward the end zone. Forrest turns up the sidelines and runs toward the end zone as some opposing players fall down, trying to catch him. He runs into the end zone as an opposing player dives at his feet, and the referee signals a touchdown as the crowd cheers wildly. Forrest continues to run, smashing through band members, and makes his way toward the team tunnel. The football coach looks at an assistant coach as an anchorman named Chet Huntley appears on television. Forrest walks through a crowd of people and steps over to a young man as the crowd observes the demonstration. Forrest walks toward the schoolhouse as a football coach looks at a black and white television, where a newsman outside the schoolhouse speaks to the camera. The footage then cuts to Governor Wallace speaking to General Graham.",
    "1039": "Sam spots the elevator stuck on the seventh floor, while elsewhere, a sweaty Javier glares at Veronica then lowers the gun, only to raise it again as Veronica relaxes. Veronica shakes her head, and Javier relents, leaving her in the elevator and touching his stomach in the corridor, bringing his palm away bloody. Javier, dressed in a Spanish policeman's uniform, heads down the stairwell in the hotel. Outside, Sam sees Veronica leaving the elevator with a covered gurney, and rushes to help, wheeling it while Veronica tends the drip. The President is covered by a blue blanket. Javier leaves the annex and on the street checks his watch. Sam and Veronica wheel the President's gurney over to the ambulance as Luis runs up to them, climbs in, and Sam shuts the door. The ambulance pulls away from the chaos outside the hotel. In a speeding hatchback, Barnes answers his cell phone, shifts gear, and moves through traffic in the narrow street. On a different street, Sam weaves through traffic in the ambulance, and inside, Ashton, lying under the blanket, opens his eyes, lowers a sidebar, and, as the ambulance rounds a corner, falls to the floor. Taylor speeds along in a Spanish police car while Veronica smiles at Sam in the driver's seat. Then Enrique runs across the road in front of them and exchanges a stunned glance with Veronica. Sam looks shiftily across at Veronica as Veronica shoots Luis point blank while Ashton cowers on the floor by the gurney, then reaches out for the drip support, disconnects the metal bar, and holds it against his chest. Meanwhile, Javier approaches a couple getting into their car and pulls his gun, and a middle-aged man nervously offers his keys as Taylor drives down the street towards Javier, stopping as Javier slaps the bonnet of the Spanish police car. Barnes suddenly breaks, backs up, and spots Javier climbing into Taylor's police car, setting off in pursuit as Barnes wears a focused expression, drifting around corners and weaving through traffic right behind them, pulling out his cell phone. A taxi plows into the side of Barnes's hatchback, sending his small blue car into a spin along the road behind Taylor, but Barnes rights the vehicle with a determined frown. Taylor looks back as Barnes throws his car into gear and accelerates after Taylor, who power-slides around a corner with Barnes in hot pursuit. Taylor gets on the radio, while Sam glances anxiously across at Veronica who holds onto her seat belt. Barnes races past pavements full of panicking pedestrians, dodging traffic, as Javier fidgets anxiously in the police car's passenger seat. Policemen frantically direct scared members of the public away from the chase as both cars head through a junction.",

She tilts her head, glances at Sandy, kisses the back of his neck, and rubs his shoulder as she lies down behind him. Now, Sandy walks into the living room and sees his two young daughters sleeping on the couch. Diana sleeps on the floor beside the girls and holds Frannie's hand. The young father stands over the trio and flips off a table lamp. As he slowly leaves, our view moves down to Diana and Frannie's joined hands. Later, Sandy awakens and looks at the clock, buries his face in his pillow, opens his bedroom door, and goes down the hall. He discovers Frannie and Jessie decked out in Diana-style gaudy makeup. He looks around the corner, then back to his girls. Jessie gets up, retrieves a note, and hands him a folded slip of pink paper. Sandy unfolds the note and walks past men and women in suits, nodding curtly as he passes the receptionist desk. Giving someone else a weak wave, Sandy heads to his office and pauses and looks at his name placard on the glass door. He passes it and joins a conference-room meeting already in progress, where Daniel looks up and points behind Sandy. He turns and sees Diana through the walls of an all-glass office. Sandy takes a step and peers intently at the conversation. Diana sits across from the detective, while two officers stand and watch her. Sandy goes over, opens the door, and nods stiffly. The cops leave, Sandy shoots Diana a wide-eyed stare, and Diana leaves in handcuffs and her flowing black dress. The police escort her away, and Sandy comes out of the office. He watches the repentant woman as she turns and gives a teary smile. An officer holds her arm and leads her off. Sandy goes to Daniel, who walks off, leaving Sandy standing alone. Fade to black. Now, Trish carries a cake across the yard to a table where Sandy cradles their newborn. He checks his watch. Now, in a prison's visiting yard, she holds up an exam with an A-plus grade. She gives Franny a big hug, then reaches out for Jessie. Diana pulls a document out of a large, yellow envelope and inspects it, pats the birth certificate, then slides it over to Sandy. Diana rises from the picnic table and passes behind him, then abruptly turns and embraces him. He looks at her and smiles. Sandy gathers up the envelope and stands, glancing at the paperwork in his hands.",
    "341": "LEGOLAS fires an arrow at the KING OF THE DEAD, but it passes straight through, while ARAGORN keeps moving forward, his eyes locked on the spectre. The KING OF THE DEAD snarls and raises his deadly sword above ARAGORN'S head, sweeping it towards him with a terrifying shriek in slow motion as ARAGORN raises his sword in answer. There is a low whistle as it sweeps through the air, followed by a clang as the blade of Anduril clashes with the spectral sword, the sharp ring of metal reverberating through the caverns. The KING OF THE DEAD stares at ARAGORN in disbelief as ARAGORN grabs the shocked ghost by the neck and holds the sharp blade against the ghost's throat before releasing him. Ghostly faces stare hollow-eyed at ARAGORN as thousands of ORCS continue moving relentlessly forward towards the walls of MINAS TIRITH. A GUARD yells down from the parapet as the huge gate swings open, revealing FARAMIR'S badly wounded horse dragging FARAMIR behind; both are impaled with orc arrows. IORLAS and other soldiers arrive at the citadel with FARAMIR'S unconscious body on a stretcher, followed by PIPPIN. DENETHOR emerges from the tower hall towards his son and bends to the stretcher bearing his son, with PIPPIN devastated. GOTHMOG turns to his lieutenants, and at his orders, the great catapults fire. The orc catapults do not fire rocks, causing horror to sweep through the streets of MINAS TIRITH as the severed heads of FARAMIR'S horsemen land among the soldiers. DENETHOR looks down at FARAMIR'S unconscious body as PIPPIN bends towards him, and DENETHOR slowly turns away, reaching the edge of the courtyard and staring in shocked disbelief at the vista spread out below. From a high wide angle, 75,000 orcs are seen spread out across the PELENNOR FIELDS like a sea of black ants as trolls load the catapults with rocks, and battering rams and siege towers are hauled on chains. Thousands of flickering torches give the army the look of a moving city in the murky Mordor twilight as DENETHOR struggles to regain the power of speech. A huge boulder smashes into the wall of MINAS as boulders hurtle from catapults across the fields towards MINAS TIRITH, smashing into a balcony full of civilians, spreading confusion and panic among the soldiers. GANDALF'S staff smashes into the back of DENETHOR'S head as GANDALF grimly swings his staff again, clubbing DENETHOR to the ground, then GANDALF spins around and addresses the soldiers. GANDALF gallops down the winding labyrinthine streets on SHADOWFAX against the flow of fleeing soldiers and bounds up stairs onto the level one battlements.",
    "1103": "As she goes upstairs, the group of boys follows her. Walt goes over to Thao and sips his drink as Thao looks away. Walt matches off, leaving Thao looking dejected but thoughtful. Walt mows his front lawn with a push mower, and he looks up to see two of his Hmong neighbors bringing flowers to his house. The neighbors smile, and as they leave the flowers, Walt carries on mowing. He stops and looks back at them. Later, he opens his door to more neighbors bearing food, sniffs it, and waves the three women and their food inside, following them in. Later, he pulls onto his drive in his pickup and finds Sue, Thao, and their mother waiting for him; he shoos them away. He's on his porch drinking coffee and stands up as a sheepish-looking Thao approaches. Walt leaves him to it and wanders off towards his garage. Thao finds Walt watching his abatis border and looks thoughtful, then shrugs. Walt looks at a very dilapidated house across the street. Thao is up a ladder, fixing the old house, as Walt watches with a Hmong neighbor. Thao removes a louvered shutter from the roof, pulls up a dead tree in the garden, and loads rubble into a wheelbarrow. Walt, chewing tobacco, stands across the street with Daisy and watches as Thao fixes the house number onto a post on the porch. Walt smokes a cigarette and watches Thao scrape old paint off the clapboard exterior before giving it a coat of fresh paint. It's raining hard, and Walt stands on his porch watching Thao struggle with an old tree stump in the garden opposite as Walt smokes another cigarette. Thao digs the stump out in the rain, and exhausted, he sits down by the stump. An elder Hmong man and a young girl approach Walt as he sits on his front steps, and then they go. Smiling, Walt turns to Daisy, as a grinning Thao, rubbing his blistered hands together, walks up Walt's front steps. Walt is in his bathroom, spits blood into the sink, regards himself in the mirror for a moment, and then goes to the door as he considers. Thao's smile fades when he turns to go, but he turns back, and Walt's face softens a bit. Walt disappears inside and shuts the door, and Thao wanders down off the porch. Walt sits in a doctor's waiting room, glancing around at the other patients. An Indian woman sits beside him, and an Indian man and a black woman sit opposite him. A Muslim nurse appears wearing a headscarf, and Walt frowns. Irritated, Walt gets up as a female Oriental doctor checks his notes.",

Concerned, Ryan frowns. She nods stiffly. An American Airlines jet taxis. The silver jet with red, white, and blue liveries speeds along the runway and takes off. Rows of houses in suburbia. Kansas City. Ryan and Natalie walk into a large open-plan office which has already been cleared, apart from a few chairs and a couple of desks. The receptionist looks up at Natalie and Ryan tearfully. Natalie scans the bare office, looking slightly uncomfortable. Another flight. Tulsa. In a hotel lobby, Ryan stands waiting as Natalie talks on her phone. Ryan frowns and turns sharply to look in a mirror. Ryan and Natalie sit in separate offices with various employees who look at their strategy packets. Outside a hotel room with Alex, Ryan tries one of his cards in the door slot. It doesn't work, so he tosses it away. He tries another and opens the door. They go in. A jet takes off. On the flight, Ryan hands Natalie an American Airlines Priority Access application form and a pen. She tentatively takes them. A wide river runs through a city. Ryan and Natalie meet several employees. An old guy lets out a short breath. Ryan finds Natalie sitting in a room crammed full of office chairs. She gets up, holding her coat. They walk out past a car rental office. A few, small clouds float in the clear sky above Miami, set against the deep, blue ocean. A jet comes in to land. Ryan gives a motivational talk. Natalie stands at the back of the conference room, watching. He smiles thoughtfully. In a corridor, Ryan chats with a couple of delegates. Natalie looks up from her cell phone, shocked. Natalie looks over at Ryan. They sit facing each other on the Hilton shuttle bus.",
    "995": "Tom sees her as Gatsby approaches, causing Tom to panic. Tom throws money at Wilson and speeds off after Gatsby and Daisy, who are now ahead. Watching from the upstairs window, Myrtle looks desperate and tearful. Gatsby and Tom drive along the filthy road past heaps of trash and coal waste, heading across the Queensboro Bridge side-by-side. Gatsby looks at Tom to his left, puts his foot down, and the coupe edges ahead. Grinning, Daisy waves exuberantly as they pass a train and head into New York City. In a plush suite at the Plaza Hotel, Tom watches an employee chip away at a large block of ice with an ice pick, while windows are wide open and several fans are on. The others sit around drinking whiskey, and the ice is put on a tray. Sweat glows on their faces, and Tom presses ice against the back of his neck. Nick and Jordan pay close attention to their exchange as frowning, Gatsby nods at Tom and stands across the room from him. Nick glances about uncomfortably while Gatsby has a sip of whiskey and goes to stand at a window. Gatsby turns to face Tom who stands with his back to Gatsby, while Gatsby takes Daisy's hand. Silently seething, Tom turns to face Gatsby as Daisy slowly sits and Tom glowers. Daisy is tearful, shakes her head, and Tom looks unnerved as tears fill her eyes and her head droops forward. Gatsby smiles inquiringly, Tom points at Nick, and Gatsby drinks. Gatsby holds Tom by his shirt collar and looms over him with his fist raised. Tom rests his forehead against Gatsby's for a moment, then grins as if he's won some kind of game. Daisy holds her hands over her face fearfully, as does Jordan. Gatsby looks shocked, and his chest heaving, steps away from Tom. Daisy stares at Gatsby, tears brimming in her eyes, as he goes to her and tears flood from her eyes. Tom looks at his watch as Gatsby runs out, knocking over a lamp, and Tom pushes the door shut, causing the phone book to fall to the floor. He has a slug of whiskey, and frowning heavily, Nick goes to look out of a window as Tom unwraps another bottle of whiskey. Nick remains at the window, turns, and Tom glances away while Nick looks out of the window, across the Queensboro Bridge. Myrtle's forehead is cut as Wilson shakes the poles around her neck, and she hits him and runs. The bright yellow Deusenberg thunders through the Valley of Ashes, and seeing the car, Myrtle runs into the road. As another car approaches, Gatsby grips the wheel of the Deusenberg to try and swerve, but it's too late, and the Deusenberg hits Myrtle. She rolls up the bonnet, hits the windscreen, and is thrown in the air.",
    "1291": "The Previa cruises slowly into the Loring's fancy gated community, where Mark and Vanessa Loring have an impressive, though generic McMansion. The entire yard is unlandscaped soil, and Mac pulls over and parks on the curb. Both look mortified as they wait for someone to greet them, until Vanessa, a pretty, meticulous woman in her early thirties, opens the door and awkwardly leads them into her home. Juno takes off her hooded sweatshirt and thrusts it into Vanessa's arms, who sets it on a bench. Mark Loring, a boyishly attractive guy in his mid-thirties, appears next to Vanessa and glances sheepishly at her upon hearing the Penny Saver mention, then extends his hand to Mac and Juno. Mac seizes Mark's hand and pumps it heartily. Mark and Vanessa usher Juno and Mac into the austere, spacious living room, where a woman in a business suit sits on the couch with a briefcase in her lap. Vanessa is clearly ecstatic as Mark and Juno lock eyes, and Juno holds her wrist up to Mark's twitching nostrils, which he inhales. Juno is staring into a room with the door slightly ajar, revealing guitars mounted on the wall and the edges of posters. Meanwhile, Vanessa, Mac, and Gerta Rauss are waiting in awkward silence for Juno and Mark to return, and Mac notices a brand new Pilates machine sitting in its packaging in a corner of the room. Vanessa and Gerta have no response, and Vanessa looks to the ceiling, while Mark and Juno tool around on the guitars unplugged, playing little riffs. Mark seems visibly embarrassed by Vanessa's manic demeanor. Juno and Mac have put their coats on and are in the process of leaving, with Vanessa and Mark trailing behind as Mac stares at Juno gravely. Juno looks at Mark, and then she and Mac exit, with Mark shutting the door. The track team jogs in formation, leaving tracks in the snow, while Bleeker runs alone on the track. Bleeker's friend Vijay, a solemn, skinny boy much like Bleeker, jogs up alongside him, commenting that those bastards never stop running before jogging off. Bleeker stops and wipes away his sweat. We're then looking over Juno's now five-month pregnant belly to a school administrator filling out a slip, which Juno takes and turns around smiling all the way out. Juno exits the head office and bumps into Bleeker. Later, the monitor reveals the baby's head, and Juno, Leah, and Bren become immediately defensive, with Bren gesturing to the ultrasound monitor before the ultrasound tech exits in a huff. Juno lays in bed checking out the ultrasound printout. The Previa drives into the front gate of Mark and Vanessa's exclusive community, and Juno rings the doorbell, shifting her weight in the cold, until Mark, dressed in a t-shirt and jeans, answers the door.",
    "190": "Loomis makes it to the front porch and tentatively steps up to the door. He glances back to his friends in the street. The boy turns to open the door, then Loomis' POV moves back to Lonnie at the front door. He's scared out of his mind. Lonnie spins around and stares in horror at the talking hedge. Moving like the wind, Lonnie barrels off the porch and races back to his friends. The boys hurtle off down the street in utter terror. Loomis quietly stands up behind the hedge. He watches them race away, smiling to himself. Suddenly, two hands enter frame and grab Loomis' shoulders. Loomis jumps and spins around. Standing there is Brackett. Brackett turns and walks back to the street. A car pulls up in front of the house and parks. Its lights flick off. The sounds of laughter come from inside. Bob Simms, a good-looking 17-year-old, pops open a can of beer. Next to him, Lynda guzzles hers. The lights are all out. Bob opens the door and together they fall out onto the ground. The can of beer falls over onto the front seat. They embrace. Bob grabs Lynda and she starts giggling. Bob picks Lynda up and carries her up to the front door. Lynda squirms in Bob's arms. As he sets her down, her foot accidentally hits the front door and it swings open. Lynda and Bob both stop. Bob and Lynda enter the house. The living room is empty. The lights are off. Lynda and Bob enter the house and begin turning on the lights. Bob walks over to Lynda. They embrace. They kiss. Bob pulls Lynda over to the couch and turns out the light. A shadow comes over them. They continue kissing, unaware of the shape of a man on the stairway watching. The house is totally black inside. Then an orange light floats around the room. As it gets closer, we see that Laurie is carrying a Jack-O-Lantern, with a candle illuminating from the center of the pumpkin. Behind Laurie are Lyndsey and Tommy making scary noises. The procession continues through the house. The procession continues to the front window. Laurie places the Jack-O-Lantern on the window sill. She looks down the street toward the Wallaces. Laurie sees Bob's car parked in front of the house. Laurie sits down on the couch and sighs. Lindsey and Tommy cuddle up with her, one on either side. Laurie gets up to answer it. Lynda hangs up the phone and grins. Bob grins. Lynda grabs Bob's hand and stands up. Lynda pulls Bob up from the couch and they walk quickly up the stairs. She walks to the window and glances out.",
    "1280": "A screen shows the mass spreading out across the Eastern seaboard of the United States. New York City is completely deserted. The lights and advertisements of Times Square have no one to see them. Mike's SUV drives down the empty streets. Mike drives with Klaatu in the passenger seat, while in the back, Helen and Jacob look anxiously at each other. Mike glances at Klaatu then accelerates. They hurtle towards the military roadblock, and soldiers dive out of the way. They are pursued by hummers with machine guns. Mike looks tense, and Helen looks nervously out of the back window, while Klaatu seems calm. The pursuers fall back as they turn into leafy, wooded Central Park and drive across the grass towards the sphere. An explosion lifts the car, rolling it over several times before it comes to rest against the tree. Fighters streak overhead as the sphere is engulfed in a great fireball. Regina watches the attack on a monitor and closes her eyes in relief. As the smoke clears, the sphere is completely intact. Meanwhile, the swarm reaches the edge of Manhattan. In the car, Mike is dead. Helen frantically undoes her seat belt, looks at Mike, and notices the windscreen is being eaten. Klaatu pulls himself out of the car, then lifts out Jacob. Helen emerges and looks up to see the swarm swirling around the sphere as more gray clouds of bugs arrive, darkening the skies. Klaatu looks around, then grabbing Jacob's hand, he leads them in a sprint across the grass. Just ahead of the hedge, they run into a tunnel and the swarm stays outside. Klaatu frowns, thinking hard. Jacob's nose is bleeding. As Helen crouches to examine him, he collapses in her arms. She wipes her nose and finds blood on her finger. She looks at Klaatu pleadingly. Klaatu gently takes Jacob’s hand in Helen's, closes his eyes, and concentrates. Bugs begin to run up Klaatu's wrist, coming out through Helen and Jacob's skin and burrowing bloodily into him. Jacob wakes up, Klaatu opens his eyes, and the pair look at each other while Helen stares wide-eyed. Klaatu stands up and walks towards the mouth of the tunnel. He looks back at Helen comforting Jacob, and she stares back at him. Klaatu steps out into the raging swarm and walks slowly through the swirling gray cloud, hand raised, vainly trying to protect his face and head. Holes appear in his suit, and his hands and face are bloody. As he approaches the sphere, he slowly sinks to his knees. With a final effort, he stands, reaches up, and touches the sphere. Light blazes as he is absorbed into it, and the sphere emits a beaming pulse of energy, causing the swarms, millions of bugs, to begin falling like rain to the ground.",
    "468": "A faint light illuminates the screen, flickeringly revealing an eighteenth-century balustrade and a flight of stone stairs. We are looking down into the wall of the staircase from the point of view of the landing, where a branched candlestick held by Salieri's Valet ascends the stairs, accompanied by Salieri's Cook bearing a large dish of sugared cakes and biscuits. Both men are desperately worried: the Valet is thin and middle-aged; the Cook, plump and Italian, wearing shawls over their night-dresses and clogs on their feet, wheezing as they climb. The candles cast shadows on the peeling walls of the evidently old and decaying house. As they reach the salon door, a cat scuttles between their bare legs. The Valet tries the handle, and in horror, the two men stare at it as the door flies open, revealing Old Salieri lying on the floor in a pool of blood, an open razor in his hand. He has cut his throat but is still alive and gestures at them. They run to him, and we glimpse the room—an old chair, old tables piled with books, a forte-piano, a chamber-pot on the floor—as the Valet and the Cook struggle to lift their old Master and bind his bleeding throat with a napkin. The scene shifts to twenty-five dancing couples, fifty guests, ten servants, and a full orchestra at a Masquerade Ball, where music slows and reveals a crowded room of dancers executing the slow portion of a fashionable dance from the early 1820s. As the fast music returns, Old Salieri is carried out of his house on a stretcher by two attendants and placed in a horse-drawn wagon under the supervision of a middle-aged doctor in a tall hat. The driver whips up the horse, and the wagon dashes off through the still-falling snow, galloping through the snowy streets of the city. Inside, Old Salieri, wrapped in blankets and half-conscious, is held by the hospital attendants, with Doctor Gulden staring at him grimly. The wagon arrives outside the General Hospital of Vienna, and a wide, white-washed corridor is seen where Doctor Gulden walks down with Father Vogler, the hospital's Chaplain. Several patients, some visibly disturbed, wearing white linen smocks, are noted in the corridor as Doctor Gulden, in a dark frock-coat, and Vogler, in a cassock, walk. Salieri propels his wheelchair to the forte-piano and plays an unrecognizable melody, then another tune, and continues to play with growing enthusiasm.",
    "1258": "She starts to climb over. They walk backstage at a music venue. It's full of equipment. They round a corner and walk out on stage and look at the vast Hollywood Bowl amphitheater. Hand-in-hand, Carl and Allison wander beneath the domed archway that covers the stage. They smile in awe. Carl turns to Allison, who stares out at the seats, lost in thought. He gazes at her. She turns to him and they smile. They look out again. They turn towards each other. Allison looks up at him. Allison leans forward and plants a kiss on his lips. She draws back and smiles impishly. Carl leans down and kisses her passionately but tenderly. He puts his arms around her and presses her to him. She puts an arm on his shoulder and squeezes affectionately. They stay locked in an embrace and sink to the floor. They sit in the deserted amphitheater. He eyes her gravely. A fat security guard with a torch chases them. Carl hands out oranges. People queue outside his office door. Lee's smile fades. Norman's po-faced. A motorbike. He approves the loan. Carl and Norman go into an office. A mustachioed man stands. They shake hands. Wesley, Carl, and Norman sit down at the table in the big office. Carl smiles. Norman gawks. Frowning, Carl stares. Norman nods. Carl and Lucy look at bridal shower invitations. She slowly turns and looks at him sadly. Carl nods sympathetically. Soo-Mi grins. Carl holds up a clenched fist. A guy runs in. Carl joins the crowd. Standing on the street, Carl stares into the distance with a steely resolve. He bursts into the tall, red brick apartment building and runs up a central staircase. The desperate man is standing on a ledge outside the top floor. Carl bursts into an apartment. Carl goes into the cluttered living room and looks around. He leans out of an arched window and looks at the guy on the ledge. He's a casually dressed, portly guy with thick, black hair. He looks into the room and sees a guitar. Carl points at the guy and goes inside. On the street, Soo-Mi and Lucy are standing in the crowd, looking up anxiously. Carl tunes the guitar. Carl leans out of the window, guitar in hand. As the crowd sings along, a fire crew arrives. The guy edges towards the open window. Carl grabs him by his jacket and throws him inside. He lands on his back. In shock, the guy holds up his hands. Carl gets out of an airport shuttle bus. As he walks towards the terminal building, Stephanie grabs his arm. She's with Ted. Carl goes. Stephanie glances back as she walks off.",
    "775": "Gordon eyes the controls nervously as the fissure approaches, and Jackson lands Gordon's hands on the throttle. Gordon pulls the controls up and the plane takes off as the runway disintegrates beneath. Noah stares wide-eyed as a canyon opens up beneath them and buildings fall into it. Gordon pilots the plane between tumbling sections of the freeway, then rolls to the right, while people run helplessly over jacked sections of broken roads and pavements. He flies low over the devastated center of town and struggles for height as the street rises. Lilly sobs as people and cars are thrown into the doom below, and as the plane dips into the rising canyon, a train arcs overhead, hits a wall, and explodes. The plane clears the canyon, and up ahead, two high-rise towers fall down, forming an upside-down V shape. Gordon pilots the plane straight through the gap as the building shatters all around them, and debris fills the sky as the light plane rises, narrowly avoiding the falling tower behind them. Jackson gawps as the plane clears the city, which has been carved in two by the gigantic fissure, and they stare at the devastation below. Noah gives tearful Lilly a big hug, as Jackson and Kate follow Gordon's gaze out of the windscreen. Behind them, the kids stare out of a side window as the Californian coastline bears up slowly and slips into the sea with explosions blossoming in the street, and buildings collapse as the whole state breaks apart and slides beneath the water. On board the Genesis, he is given a drink, and Harry steps off stage to take the phone call in the galley. Scotty knocks on Adrian's office window, and Adrian gestures for another minute, then gets up and paces. Adrian frowns sadly as Harry hangs up. Harry stands up and stops a passing waiter, as Tony can see them from the dressing room. Kevin, the waiter, pours Harry the double, and Tony watches Harry drinking. A biplane buzzes over the research facility of Yellowstone Park, where a grazing doe watches as Gordon makes a tentative landing. Jackson leaps out and checks a petrol pump while Jackson starts the RV and Noah answers his phone. Lilly spots Charlie on the ridge, and Jackson stops near the ridge. Both men look around dubiously as a huge flock of birds takes to the sky, and Lilly joins the two men on the ridge. They look around again as the undulating mountain range stretching out beneath them rises ominously, the land sinking to lift itself upwards. Lilly backs away slowly as a funnel of steam breaks through a crack in the ground below, and Charlie beams as they run off past Charlie's motorbike. Gordon steps onto the runway and checks his watch, while the mountains of Yellowstone are wrapped in a blinding flash and fulminating an awe-struck Charlie on the ridge.",
    "1098": "In Walt's house, Sue goes to the mesh door of the basement, and then he runs out of the back door, with Sue following him. It's night as Walt walks up outside Smokie's house and looks up at it, his face partly hidden in shadow. One of the gangsters looks out of the window and spots Walt. Smokie and Spider come out to confront him, more gangsters appear, and Spider pulls a gun. Neighbors watch. Walt points his index finger gun-like at the gangsters and mimes shooting them. He holds up a cigarette, puts it in his mouth, and slowly reaches inside his jacket, then whips his hand out again. The gangsters open fire, bullets riddle Walt's body, and he collapses backward onto the ground. His hand falls open, revealing his 1st Cavalry lighter, as blood trickles down his sleeve into his palm and some runs from his mouth. The cigarette lies unlit beside Walt's dead body, which lies in a cruciform. The lights of a police car flash in the darkness. Walt's Gran Torino pulls up outside Smokie's house, and Thao and Sue step out of it. They hurry over to a police officer as Sue, Thao, and Father Janovich watch a body bag being loaded into an ambulance. Father Janovich looks over to a patch of grass where the police have the handcuffed gangsters on their knees, and Thao bites his lip as a police captain looms over them. Sue and Thao watch bitterly as an officer leads Spider in handcuffs to a squad car, while another officer leads Smokie to a cruiser. Smokie's face is still bruised from where Walt whacked him, and he glares defiantly at Sue and Thao as the officer shoves him into the car. Thao breathes hard, with emotion welling up inside him, and Walt's Silver Star is still pinned to his T-shirt. Thao, Sue, and their mother leave their house, with Sue and Thao wearing traditional Hmong dress of lavishly embroidered clothing, and Sue also wearing a turban-like headdress, and get in a taxi. Grandma remains on the porch and watches as the taxi drives away, looking over at Daisy, who lies forlornly on the porch at the top of the steps. At the church, a large number of mourners have gathered for the funeral service. Wearing his new suit, Walt lies in an open casket in front of the altar as Mitch and Karen take a seat in the front pew aside Steve. Mitch looks across the aisle at Sue and Thao as Father Janovich steps forward. Mitch glares across the aisle at Thao. The family are gathered for the reading of the will, and Mitch and his brother Steve exchange a look as Ashley smiles in anticipation.",
    "1380": "Black howls, then bitterly amused, while Lupin eyes him and then turns back. Lupin eyes Black again and nods as the wands fly from their hands. The others turn to find Snape standing in the doorway, smiling smugly. As Black approaches, Snape puts his wand to Black's neck, and Snape's eyes harden as he gestures to the door. As the others start to go, Harry glances at the table where Lupin has left Harry's wand, and in a flash, it's in his hand. Snape soars into the air, hits the wall with a thud, and slides down, while Ron and Hermione stare in shock. Harry looks a bit shocked himself, then turns to Black and, as Harry points at Black, Black laughs mirthlessly and points at Ron. Ron goes white with fear as Scabbers squirms violently. Lupin and Black turn to Ron, who holds Scabbers protectively. Sirius and Lupin exchange a glance, neither speaks, while Pettigrew's small, watery eyes dart toward the windows and door. Suddenly, he makes a break for it, but Sirius merely shoves him back. Pettigrew's nose twitches, his gaze finding Harry, and his hands flutter nervously, revealing a missing index finger. As Pettigrew emerges from the gap, he prattles desperately. Harry studies Pettigrew briefly, then looks away and turns to see Hermione staring at the full moon. His eyes shift to Lupin, who is a rigid silhouette, his fingers twitching. Lupin shakes his head as Pettigrew's eyes dart, taking in the situation, then slowly shift to note the wand trembling in Lupin's lengthening fist. As Lupin's wand drops, Pettigrew leaps. Harry looks into his glassy eyes, and Harry's Patronus blooms briefly and dies. Harry's eyes flutter as the Dementors twist madly in his vision, drawing closer, and Black gasps, silvery feathers of light tumble from his lips as if his very soul were leaving him. Then a light splinters the trees, and Harry squints to see a fiery stag appear, its body luminous, slashing through the trees, sowing light in the darkness. Still, the stag charges on as the light expands, with the forest blazing with it, and the remaining Dementors flee, drifting across the moon like ash. The light ebbs, the stag's luminous body flickers, and there is a bright flash and darkness returns, a single thread of light all that remains, spinning down to the size of a pearl in the palm of a man standing deep in the trees. Harry studies the strangely familiar silhouette, then it is gone out of Hermione's shadow, which ripples against the curtain that encircles Harry's bed. Ron lies opposite with his leg bandaged as Hermione paces, stops, and Dumbledore hands Harry and Hermione each a stick of chocolate, then starts to go, stops, smiles, and exits. Harry glances curiously at the chocolate, but Hermione doesn't reply, instead looping the pendant's long chain around Harry's neck as well as her own.",

MJ hangs up on him, and Harry, with a dressing on the side of his head, crosses to Peter but then looks away and shifts uncomfortably. Peter looks thoughtful. At the Osborn home, Norman is pouring himself a drink from a decanter, takes a large gulp, and, hearing a noise, turns and moves as if in a trance, looking uncertainly around the room. On a shelf by the wood-paneled wall are reaching masks, and Norman stares at them before spinning around to look into a mirror where his reflection is talking to him. Norman looks at his reflection, which chuckles. Hoffman is in the office already when a cigarette thrown out by Jameson is tossed back, and the Green Goblin bursts in and grabs the editor by the throat from outside the windows. Vapor seeps out from the back of the Green Goblin's gloves straight into the face of Spider-Man, who's hanging upside down; he goes limp and falls toward the ground. The Green Goblin, on his glider, catches the unconscious figure and takes him to a rooftop, leaps on his glider, and shoots off into the night. At night, MJ walks out of a door and tosses something in a bin as Peter runs up and gulps, and she raises an eyebrow and smiles gently at him. As lighting illuminates the buildings around them, she runs across Puddle Street road and turns a corner. Peter, the wind ruffling his hair, sees two youths giving her the once-over, and he makes his move as they start to follow her. The rain falls, and MJ quickens her step as the two youths approach, while Peter is up on the roof changing out of his everyday clothes. Two more youths join in the chase, and in the backstreet, MJ is trapped by the gang of four. One grabs her by the shoulder, but she lashes out with her bag and feet as one guy draws a switchblade. Webs appear from nowhere, and the four assailants are dragged away from MJ. Spider-Man, without his mask, is clinging to a wall and somersaults onto the ground, taking on the four men with his strength overpowering them. Two end up crashing into windows behind MJ, and still in the shadows, Spider-Man drops the final assailant to the ground before moving off down an alleyway as MJ comes closer to him. When she reaches it, he's disappeared, but then he slinks down a wall headfirst, mask on. She stares at her superhero, reaches her hands up to just under his chin, which is level with her face, and slowly starts to peel the mask, revealing first his neck, and his chin, and finally, his lips.",
    "674": "Peter turns his head and runs towards a blazing apartment building, holding up the curb and reaching for the neck of his shirt as if to tear it open. He stops to look up at the fire, then steps back before racing across the street and into the burning building. Inside, he ignores the flames and runs up the stairs as more timbers fall behind and around him. He takes stock, hears screams, and runs. Reaching a locked door, he cups his hands to his mouth, charges with a shoulder, and raises his foot to the door, which clatters to the floor as he enters the apartment. Burning timbers fall from the ceiling, and inside is the girl. A chunk falls out of the landing, and with his hand pressed on the girl's head and her in his other, he hoists her onto the landing. Her parents are outside, and the girl on her knees helps Peter up onto firm footing. He picks her up again, and they set off as more burning beams crash to the floor. Her anguished parents hear the crashes from inside, then see Peter emerge with their daughter. He hands her over to her bemused parents and walks away. The flames are now out, and Peter stands in the road with an oxygen mask as two firemen cross. Peter, wearing a somber expression, turns away and is lost in thought. He stands at his room window, the frames weather-worn and in need of paint. A door opens behind him, and a tall scrawny girl named Ursula with pigtails steps outside, comes back in, and then goes back out again. Later, she sits on the end of his bed, watching as he finishes eating. He lays his fork on his plate, and she rises to collect it from him. He hands her his empty glass, and they stand facing each other. On her way out, she stops and hands him a note, then takes the plates and glasses with her as she leaves. Peter's attention is firmly on the note. At Aunt May's house, Peter walks down the passageway to the back garden where Aunt May is packing. She looks up, sees him, and carries on with her work. Smiling, she walks up to him, puts her arms around Peter, and hugs him close, her eyes closed. He looks solemn as she releases her hold and stares at him. She nods and moves away, bending down to pick up a brown paper carrier bag and wipe a tear from her eye. Peter looks around the boxes sitting in the back garden, bewildered, as a boy sulks and Peter's eyes glaze over.",
    "378": "Football hero Edward leads his team to victory. On the sidelines, a pretty girl admits the name of her secret love, and the other girls squeal in agreement. Don Price looks over and glowers. Edward takes an impossible shot at the buzzer from the other end of the court and, naturally, makes it, winning the game. As the crowd goes wild for Edward, Don Price is the only teammate who doesn't mob him. Edward carries a dog out of a burning house, and a flash occurs. Pissed, Don Price throws his crappy lima bean plants in the trash. As two farmers shake their heads, we reverse to show a massive hole punched through the side of a barn, roughly the shape of a man, but no human could be that large. We still haven't seen the full stranger. A mob of about 50 have gathered, many of them with shotguns, and amid the crowd, we see Don Price. There is agreement from the crowd, and then everyone turns to see who said that. The crowd parts to reveal none other than Edward Bloom. Don Price glowers as Edward climbs up the last bit of the steep hillside, reaching the mouth of a cave. Outside, buzzards squabble over the remains of the giant's feast: broken barrels, bones picked clean. In his most serious voice, Edward calls out. From deep in a cave comes a thunderous voice, and the giant's voice has such force that it blows Edward's hair back. A beat passes, then we hear a rumble, like a train coming. Edward braces himself, fists ready for a fight if that's what it's going to take. As the rumble gets louder, the ground starts to shake, and Edward wonders just how big this guy is. Edward picks up a stone, ready to play David to Goliath. Karl the giant is bigger than any man you've ever seen, completely feral, with a beard to his elbow and skin scratched and blistered. What remains of his clothes are ragged and muddy. Karl leans over Edward, blocking the sun. Edward throws his rock, but it just bounces off. Edward ponders the best response, settling on closing his eyes, hands at his side, ready to be eaten. Karl just stares at him, not sure what to do. After a beat, Edward opens his eyes a tiny bit, just to see what the giant is doing, and is relieved to see he's not licking his chops. Karl sits down with a boom, dejected. Reaching up, Edward shoves his hand into Karl's mouth, but the giant spits it back out. And that's the sad truth. Karl is less a monster than a freak—a giant man, but in the end, just a man. Edward takes a seat beside him.",
    "1004": "Gatsby notices Nick watching him and checks himself, and at the sound of the organ, Gatsby smiles. Nick and Daisy smile as Gatsby gestures towards the ballroom where Klipspringer, a wild-haired young man with glasses, plays the organ. Gatsby reclines on cushions while Nick and Daisy dance in the ballroom lit by hundreds of candles. Daisy spins around to face Nick, and they shimmy back and forth. As Gatsby watches, he remembers some time before in uniform, dancing with Daisy and kissing her. He looks grave as he remembers being in battle, while rain pours down on the terrace and the narrow dock that juts out into the bay. Across the water, the green light gently pulses through the mist. Klipspringer sleeps on the organ keys as Nick sits on the stairs having a drink, and Daisy and Gatsby slow dance together. Nick walks over to them while they gently sway and then leaves them. Daisy gazes at Gatsby lovingly, and he kisses her and rests his cheek against hers, as Nick watches them with a grave, serious expression. Extravagantly dressed guests go wild at one of Gatsby's parties, where they drink, dance, and splash about in the ornamental pool, while Gatsby smiles politely and walks through the party with Nick. Gatsby takes Daisy's arm, and Tom walks with Nick. Later, they sit at tables in a raised area looking down at the party where Gatsby smiles, and Tom looks bored, considers for a moment, and looks at Gatsby slightly bemused. The butler, Herzog, comes over and leans down to Gatsby as Mr. Slagle, a hard-faced man in a sharp suit, arrives with his associates. As the band plays, Gatsby and Tom share a polite smile, and Gatsby gets up, gesturing towards the dance floor where Daisy looks round and Gatsby smiles. They stand, and Daisy slips the silver pencil into Tom's breast pocket. Gatsby takes her arm and leads her down to the dance floor as Tom scans about and sees the attractive actress Marlene Moon, raising his eyebrows and nodding to her. An older guy dances with a younger woman as Gatsby dances with Daisy. Gatsby sees Tom and Nick follow Marlene upstairs, and she smiles brightly at Gatsby. Tom and Nick watch them dance, and Tom sees Marlene looking at him as if she's waiting. He goes to join her and glances back at Nick, who halfheartedly raises his glass before turning back to watch the dancing. Gatsby whispers something to Daisy and leads her away through the slow-dancing couples, as Nick watches, frowning. Outside, Gatsby follows Daisy through a gate and nods to a couple of servants as they cross the terrace. Nick has come outside and stands by a drinks table with a cocktail fountain on it.",
    "1050": "An uneasy silence descends, during which Mrs. Bennet winks at Kitty and Lizzie, gesturing to Jane and Mr. Bingley. Kitty glances at Jane, then at her mother, in confusion. She nods to Mr. Bingley, then leaves the room, followed by Mary and Kitty. Once they have left, Mr. Bingley sits back down. Lizzie casually takes up her embroidery, turning slightly to afford Mr. Bingley and Jane some privacy. Lizzie puts down her embroidery, smiles at Mr. Bingley, then leaves the room. She gives Jane a warning glance as she leaves. Mr. Bingley looks nervously down at Jane, who eventually raises her eyes demurely to meet his. An anxious Mrs. Bennet and the rest of the girls are sitting in another room, waiting. Mrs. Bennet sits with a smug expression. Moments later, Lizzie is skipping quietly down the stairs. She treads silently up to the door of the parlor, then walks inside to find her sister and Mr. Bingley standing together at the mantelpiece. Mr. Bingley leans in and whispers something to Jane, then takes his leave. Lizzie immediately turns to her sister. She kisses her sister on the cheek, then leaves the room. When she's gone, Lizzie's broad smile turns to an expression of contented relief. A little later, Mr. Bennet and the rest of the family are seeing Mr. Bingley out. Mr. Bingley smiles briefly at Jane, then climbs up onto his white horse. Mrs. Bennet waves her handkerchief at him as Mr. Bingley sets off. Mr. Bennet stands next to Jane. As they all head inside, Jane hangs back for a moment and turns to Lizzie. They walk indoors together arm in arm. An elegant carriage is arriving at Longbourn, complete with four horses and liveried footmen. Seeing this, Kitty quickly runs over to the house. Lady Catherine de Bourgh and her daughter, Anne, are inside the carriage. She points over to the window and Lizzie and her mother quickly hurry over to see for themselves. As Lady Catherine steps inside, Lizzie, Kitty, and Mrs. Bennet all curtsy. With a haughty expression, she marches over to take a seat. Lizzie, Kitty, and Mrs. Bennet remain standing, looking at her with a certain amount of expectant unease. Lady Catherine heads out and Lizzie follows her, looking puzzled. Now, they're out in a less well-tended area of the garden, Lady Catherine striding ahead, with Lizzie a couple of paces behind her. She marches over to a clearing under a tree, bounded by two small stone benches, then turns to Lizzie. Relief floods Lady Catherine's face. She climbs into her carriage, leaving Lizzie breathless with anger. The carriage departs. Lizzie watches it go, her expression giving little away. She then turns indoors.",
    "266": "Ed's hand lingers on top of his, and Hi's other hand enters to rest on top of hers. Hi slips a ring off his own finger and slides it onto Ed's. The surly Mopping Con has now worked his way up to the foreground as Hi is being escorted past him to his cell. Halfway up the corridor, Hi points casually at the floor, and the Mopping Con turns to watch him recede. We begin to crane down to tighten on the absently staring Hi as Moses' voice is mixing down; we lose him from the frame. We are now very close on Hi, staring at the underside of the top bunk. A sudden flash whitens and fades to leave the image of Ed, smiling behind her camera, softly superimposed on the underside of the bunk. Hi wearily turns his head to profile on the pillow and shuts his eyes. Eyes closed, he is illuminated by a flash. Hi and the same three officers are in the familiar booking room, where Ed looks up from her camera, having just snapped a picture of another suspect against the hatched wall. Hi cocks a finger at the suspect. Ed nervously frets at her white bridal gown in front of a mirror, gazing earnestly into the camera. A congregation is seated behind her—the bride's side wearing police blues, and the groom's side, Hawaiian shirts—also staring into the camera. Over their shoulders stands the minister. The camera focuses on the newlyweds smiling at the camera and then on the newlyweds smiling at each other, profile to the camera, in the middle of a vast expanse of desert. Hi is working the drill press, wearing goggles and sweat-stained overalls. Next to him idly stands Bud, a veteran of the shop, with a grimy face and a pair of goggles pushed up on his forehead. Hi is scowling at his paycheck, while behind the barred window, a fat cashier grins. Hi sits in a lawn chair in front of the trailer. Both are wearing sunglasses, looking at the setting sun. The scene is suffused with a warm yellow light, which turns from yellow to amber as the sun sets. Hi and Ed watch, their heads following its slow downward arc. The amber turns to a more neutral dusky light as the sun sets, and Hi and Ed continue to stare at the point where it disappeared. The dusk slips away into darkness, and we are by now holding on pitch black. Crickets chirp from the darkness. Ed crosses off the last day on the calendar before a day circled in red as Hi wearily enters after a long day at work, clutching his lunch pail. Ed flies into frame and leaps into his arms, covering him with kisses.",
    "867": "She sits hunched and clutching her chest where she was shot. Marius squats down and puts his arm around her. Drops of rain glisten on her pale face. Her eyes close. She reaches out to touch his face. Marius gazes at Eponine. Her hand drops to her side. Young Gavroche watches, a tear rolling down his cheek. Marius gently kisses Eponine's brow. Enjolras is also watching, grave-faced. Enjolras squats down. Marius helps him pick Eponine up and carry her away. Marius stares at Cosette's letter with tear-filled eyes. Holding her letter, he goes over to Gavroche. Gavroche hurries up a dark stairway to Valjean and Cosette's lodgings. Gavroche pulls it back, and Valjean offers a coin. Gavroche stops. Gavroche goes. Valjean reads the letter, frowning. Valjean looks up to the heavens. Valjean looks around, thoughtfully. Outside, Valjean steals a dead soldier's jacket, peaked cap, and musket. Disguised as a soldier, he makes his way to the barricade where students keep watch. He takes off his cap. He's let in, and guns are aimed at him. Javert has a noose around his neck. Valjean looks up. Valjean shoots a soldier off a rooftop. Gavroche hands Valjean a pistol. Beaten and bloody, Javert stares at Valjean slacked faced. He kneels with his hands tied and the noose around his neck. Valjean pulls his head up to face him. They stare into each other's eyes for a moment. Valjean hauls Javert to his feet and marches him to a dark corner. Valjean holds up a dagger. They stand facing each other. Valjean cuts the ropes binding his wrists. Javert walks off and turns back. Valjean aims his pistol. Valjean walks towards him. Javert frowns incredulously. Javert walks off. Valjean aims the pistol. He fires into a wall. Javert stops and looks back then heads off into the dark. Valjean goes back to join the others. They sit around regarding him with serious expressions. Valjean nods. Enjolras addresses the group. Marius stops adjusting the barricade and sits with the others. The wine is passed round. Frowning, Valjean listens to Marius. Marius sits clutching Cosette's handkerchief. Standing nearby, Valjean wears a fraught serious expression. He leans in a doorway. Valjean looks at Marius. Valjean stands beside the sleeping Marius. Marius stares at Enjolras fearfully. Everyone looks thoughtful. Soldier shoots at Gavroche who has climbed through the barricade. Gavroche is hit. Gavroche is shot again and flops on his back, dead. One of the students goes to pick him up and carries him back behind the barricade. Marius gives him cover with his musket. An army officer watches. Behind the barricade, Gavroche is laid on the ground. Enjolras looks around heavy brown. As cannons are rolled forward, the students shoot down a few soldiers.",
    "565": "EDGAR shoves LAUREL out through the driver's door and follows behind her, still holding his weapon on her. Behind him, abandoned on the front seat of the cab, we finally see the front of the postcard he's been carrying around. Jay flips back the plastic cover and jams his finger down on the red flashing button. As the LTD rockets toward the traffic jam up ahead, it begins to evolve, its shape actually changing. It becomes a larger, wirier machine, held together by an elaborate series of mechanical muscles and metallic tendons. Kay's car hurtles toward certain death in the traffic jam, but at the last possible moment, it swerves off to the side, a sucking sound coming from underneath it. Instead of banging off the wall of the tunnel, the LTD actually clings to it. It swerves up, onto the wall and hangs there, racing by the traffic below. It keeps going, turning all the way over and driving upside down, wheels clinging to the roof of the tunnel. Jay falls from his seat with a clunk, onto the upside-down ceiling of the car. Balled up on the back of his neck, he peers out the window as they tear through the tunnel, zooming over the bottlenecked traffic underneath. He reels, momentarily losing his grip on her. She takes advantage of the moment and flings herself out, into the air. Edgar flails, but she is beyond his reach. She falls, tumbling through the air and lands in the branches of a tree. She hits hard, the branches rattling, and reaches out and hangs on for dear life, high above the ground. Above, Edgar just keeps climbing. Over at the fence, the LTD comes to a looooong, skidding stop at the fairgrounds. At the trunk, Jay and Kay flip open the trunk and scarf up whatever weapons look most dangerous. Kay grabs a black box, unsnaps a row of latches, and opens it, revealing the most wicked-looking shotgun on the planet—three feet long, triple-barreled, over and under and under, plus a pump action reloader on top of a storage clip for a dozen more shells. The shells themselves are solid, glistening like polished steel. Kay loads up the clip. But then, there is a vacuum whump, like all the air in the immediate area being sucked into a space the size of a dime, and a tremendous shock wave rolls out from the barrel of the guns. Jay and Kay are sucked to the ground by the bizarre force, thudding to their stomachs like magnets to a refrigerator. The shock waves wrinkle across the open space between them and the ship, then it hits the ship, and it too is sucked back down.",
    "1310": "Joseph turns back to his father and takes his hand, while David looks down at his son who waits patiently. David twists around and looks back at the barbell, counting up the black metal circles, then turns back to Joseph. David looks back at the weights as Joseph starts back to the barbell. Joseph is breathing hard again as he finishes with the weights and comes around to David. David lays back, takes hold of the bar, lifts it off the armrest, and brings it down. His arms are straining hard again as he raises it and lowers it two times, which takes a sizable effort, and the weights bang down onto the armrest. David sits up, turns completely around, and looks at the barbell, counting the black discs on the steel bar. He just stares at the black steel circles on the metal bar as they both stare at the weight. Joseph moves back to the bottom of the stairs leading up to the house and waits. After taking another deep breath, David heaves, the weight CLINKS as it comes off the armrest, and he is full-out straining now as he lowers and raises it. His arms tremble as he lifts it for the second time, looking at his son whose eyes are wide, seeing the enormous amount of black discs on the bar. David's hands grip the metal, and he talks to Joseph, who stands in position at the bottom of the stairs without looking at him. David takes one last breath, and CLINK! the weights come off the rest, with his arms trembling immediately. His face is locked in a grimace as he brings the bar down to his chest and back up again two times before dropping it onto the armrest. A set of two unopened MAB satin finish paint cans dangle by their metal handles on each side of the weights, and the four cans sway a little as the bar is heaved off David's chest, with his arms shaking hard. David sits up and turns back to the weights, his mouth moving as he calculates the discs and the cans until his lips stop moving. It takes a second for David to register the question as Elijah just keeps staring, his head nodding the slightest bit up and down, as the physician's words fade away and Elijah continues to gaze at an abstract point in the room. Meanwhile, a co-worker finds Audrey working with an elderly gentleman who's laboring on a stationary bike and takes Audrey's position by the elderly man as Audrey crosses the physical therapy center, walking up to him with a smile. Elijah's leg is immobilized by a metal brace and held straight.",
    "248": "The scene begins with going into Vincent's vein, followed by the heroin spurting back into the syringe, mixing with it, and then Vincent pushing down on the plunger. Vincent walks toward the house and pulls a note off the door before he enters, with video screens in the background and Mia's mouth coming toward a microphone. Vincent turns, walks, and finds the intercom on the wall. Vincent's Malibu then pulls up to a restaurant with a big sign featuring a neon figure of a cartoon surly cool cat jackrabbit in a red windbreaker towering over the establishment. Inside, Mia draws a square with her hands, causing dotted lines to appear on the screen, forming a square, which then disperse. Buddy exits as Vincent takes a look around the place, observing YUPPIES dancing, DINERS biting into big, juicy hamburgers, and icons playing their parts. He hands Mia a rolled smoke, which she takes and puts to her lips, and a Zippo lighter appears in Vincent's hand, which he uses to light it. He begins rolling one for himself as the sound of a subway car fills the diner, making everything shake and rattle, and Marilyn Monroe runs to a square vent in the floor, prompting the entire restaurant to applaud. Buddy returns with the drinks, and Mia wraps her lips around the straw of her shake while Vincent smiles, takes a sip, and slides the shake back. Mia powders her nose by doing a big line of coke off the bathroom sink, her head jerking up from the rush, as Vincent digs into his Douglas Sirk steak, scanning the Hellsapopinish restaurant with his eyes. Mia returns to the table, pointing at Marilyn in the white dress serving a table, and then at a blonde waitress in a tight sweater and capri pants taking an order from a bunch of film geeks, and Mia and Vincent smile. Vincent is slow to answer, and patrons cheer as Ed Sullivan stands with Marilyn Monroe holding a trophy. Marilyn holds the trophy as Mia holds her hand, and Vincent reacts. Vincent and Mia walk onto the dance floor toward Ed Sullivan, as patrons cheer again. They walk up to the microphone and make hand movements as they dance, before the front door flings open, and Mia and Vincent dance tango-style into the house. They finish their dance, laughing, and stand face to face looking at each other before Mia moves away to attend to both. Vincent hangs up his overcoat on a big bronze coat rack in the alcove, while Mia moves to her CD player, thumbs through a stack of CDs, and selects one: k.d., which blasts out of the speakers with a high-energy country number as Mia plays air-guitar, dances her way around the room, and finds herself wearing Vincent's overcoat.",
    "923": "The wooden gates open, and Bond heads down a long, straight brick tunnel. He stops, gets out, and opens the boot to reveal a man blinking up at him. Bond is elevated in a pool of light and fires a bullet in a super slow-mo burst of smoke, with the bullet-stream of smoke moving over the sand dunes. Light surrounds the sun, and a shadowy Bond aims his pistol, with Bond's shadow passing over the dunes. A red dot travels sideways as a naked woman is silhouetted by the sand, lying over the dunes in the half-light. Bond stands in the low light as fine sands flow like liquid, and a woman's naked body emerges from the flowing sand. Bond turns, aiming his gun, while a gloom-shaped hood of lights surrounds the scene. A naked woman stands in silhouette, and Bond falls into billowing sand. Sand and stars swirl amidst the gloom of light, and the grid flexes, turns, and walks as the sand billows against the starry darkness. A crowd of naked women pose in silhouette around the glaring sun, forming circles of bodies that animate into a flickering blur and dissolve away, floating through space. Sand swirls in the light while posing high-heels form a slowly turning pattern. Bond falls towards the expanding people in the eye, and sand engulfs a pistol as Bond falls in slow motion onto the sandy ground. He raises his pistol and fires in super slow-motion, with the bullet spinning slowly as it flies. The red dot travels sideways as the sun flares behind a pile of naked women, and the bullet lands in an explosion of sand. A red and yellow checked flag billows in the breeze as a procession of people in bright costumes parades around a square, watched by huge crowds. Bond dumps the man from the boot onto a chair in a cellar, where M and another agent watch. Bond gulps whiskey while near-tired horsemen enter the square, laid out as a racetrack. A chair is dragged across a stone floor, and Bond sits next to Mr. White, joined by M. Mitchell drops one agent, and as M goes down, the horse race starts. Bond leaps on the man, grabs the gun, and the prisoner is hit and goes down. Bond disarms Mitchell and kicks the gun away but then gets booted to the ground. Mitchell goes for the gun and runs off as the fast and furious Palio horse race thunders around Siena's main square. Mitchell pounds down spiral stairs and into water at the base of a tower, then dives through an iron gate. Bond ignores the stairs and takes a flying leap after him. In the race, a rider falls, and Bond chases his man down a watery tunnel, but a gate bars his way.",
    "837": "Sandy does a double-take. She smiles and waves, shifting her timid gaze on the way to the bar, while he smiles at Diana as he stands, and she fingers her necklace. Now, they sit at a table with a beautiful view of the Gateway Arch. Sandy sips champagne and nods, but her smile fades as he stares into her somber eyes. Diana sips champagne and wipes her eyes, while Sandy's gaze softens. He faces the table as she wipes her cheeks and looks down at her hands, and he offers a napkin. She takes another sip as Ken, the hotel manager, and several policemen enter behind Sandy. As the officers cuff them, Sandy shares a frightened look with Diana. An officer leads Sandy out while the others follow with Diana, and the restaurant patrons gawk from their tables. The group proceeds past the hostess and into the hall, where an elevator arrives. Wearing a nice suit and a sleek, black dress, Julian and Marisol enter as the doors close, standing in the front with their backs to everyone. Noticing them, Diana's eyes widen, and she glances between Sandy and the thugs. Sandy looks up as Marisol turns away, and stepping forward, he eyes Julian up and down. They exit into the lobby, and Julian glances back as Sandy and Diana share a concerned look on their way out, while the thugs head out in a different hallway. Now, in his prison cell, Paolo grabs his phone. The skiptracer shoots Julian in the leg, and Marisol holds her hands up as he shoots her in the foot. Now, the two thugs lie in a car's trunk. Outside, an officer escorts Diana around a squad car, and Sandy glances over as they both get into the back seat. Diana stares ahead, avoiding his gaze, while nearby, the skiptracer watches from the thugs' silver sedan. As the squad car leaves, he quickly follows. Now, they cruise down a construction-filled street with opposite lanes divided by orange traffic cones. Sandy stares straight ahead in the back seat, with a determined glare as the skiptracer follows close behind. Diana glances over at Sandy, then leans toward the grated divider separating them from the officers. She uncuffs a hand, and suddenly, she bangs her cuffed wrist against the back windshield, then kicks out the glass. The skiptracer swerves and then spins a 180, sliding into the squad car's side, as another car rear-ends them. They crawl out, and the skiptracer aims. The skiptracer drives forward, knocking several cars out of the way, and barrels through traffic dividers, into the opposite lane. They see a highway beneath them as the skiptracer steers through oncoming traffic. Following Diana, Sandy trips off the curb and lands in a closed-off lane, as the skiptracer crashes through the dividers, heading straight for him.",
    "1366": "Pete is on the toilet playing Scrabble on his iPad when she angrily grabs his iPad and walks out. Pete stands on stage speaking to a small crowd, and the crowd applauds as Graham Parker, in his 60s, leaps on stage. Pete and Debbie watch Graham sing a very moving song, but although the music is great, it's a little depressing and not working on Debbie, so she quickly gets bored. Later, Pete and Debbie are driving home when an ambulance drives by with sirens blaring. They walk in mid-argument to find Sadie listening to a song on her iPhone, and everyone laughs and dances. Pete turns the iPod off, starts dancing around like it is fun, then stops his music. The next morning, Pete sits with the kids to eat breakfast while Debbie scurries around to prep them for school. Charlotte runs away towards her room, and Sadie screams, prompting Debbie to cover Sadie's mouth. Another parent, Beth, and her adorable child walk over, and then Beth and Katie walk off. As they walk into class, the teacher pulls Debbie aside but walks away before Debbie can defend herself. As Debbie pulls out of the lot, she lights a cigarette. Meanwhile, Pete paces around his office on the phone and is with Ronnie and Cat, employees at his record label, watching an electronic press kit for Graham Parker, featuring a montage of his performances from the seventies to the present. There is a scene with Graham and a journalist wearing a yarmulke, and another with Pete, Cat, and Ronnie, before Graham walks up. Pete and Debbie talk while Debbie holds a list of changes she wants to make, and Pete picks up a guitar and starts playing with it. Later in bed, Debbie has a computer on her lap, watching security cam footage of the store, revealing Desi's boyfriend entering, sitting behind the counter, with her on his lap as they kiss. Desi seems to be popping up and down a little. Meanwhile, Pete farts several times, each longer, until Debbie hits him with a pillow and he farts again. Charlotte jumps around in front of Sadie's door as Sadie sits on her bed doing homework. Charlotte grabs her head as if being dragged away and plays air guitar. Pete tosses a packet of M&M's in the garbage, throws out all of his cupcakes except for one, and takes a bite, trying to throw it away but eventually takes another bite, holding it over the garbage before finishing what little remains. Finally, Pete runs on a treadmill while getting an electrocardiogram.",
    "1145": "Cedric has come in through another entrance, and as confused as Harry, he runs along the narrow paths between the neatly clipped hedges, stopping uncertain of which way to go, before choosing a path. As he moves forward, it crashes closed in front of him, and the hedges on either side grow together, hemming him in. He forces his way through the dense branches as they close in around him, lashing him across the face. Meanwhile, Viktor plods along in his steady boots, carrying his wand, and Harry spins around as he hears a sound behind him. Viktor's eyes are glazed over. Fleur runs frantically between the hedges, reaches a dead end, panics, runs back the way she came, and, with her face clammy with fear, she stares uncertainly down the misty pathway. Hearing something behind her, she turns, and Harry hears her scream. Viktor leans over Fleur, who lies on the ground, staring slightly, and looks up with his eyes cloudy. Sinuous roots creep towards Fleur from under the hedge. Harry runs in the direction of the scream, peers through the swirling mist, and spots Viktor. Harry draws back into the hedge as Viktor shines the lighted end of his wand straight into Harry's face, but, as Viktor's eyes are clouded over and he fails to see Harry, he passes by. Harry searches for Fleur, and as he reaches her, she vanishes from sight, drawn under the hedge by a tangle of sinuous roots. Harry points his wand upwards, and high above, red sparks explode in the evening sky. A howling wind lashes the branches, sending dust and leaves into the air. Harry starts to run as the hedges start to close together behind him, diving head first through a closing gap and landing on the ground. Harry sees a bright object in the distance, and heading towards it, he emerges onto a path between Cedric and Viktor. Harry drops as Cedric aims his wand at Viktor, knocking him unconscious, kicking Viktor's wand from his hand, and raising his own wand. Harry stops him, but Cedric pushes him off and starts to run, with Harry following. They jostle for position, grabbing each other by the shirt, pulling each other's back, fighting each other off, and they see the trophy. They sprint forward, Cedric slightly ahead, and the Triwizard Trophy gleams through the mist. The roots reach out and trip Cedric, and Harry surges past, then stops and looks back. Cedric is dragged backwards, tangled in the roots and branches of the hedge, struggling in vain to escape as the sinuous roots have twined around his neck, strangling him. Harry looks at the gleaming trophy and back at Cedric, and as he points his wand, the roots and branches loosen their hold.",
    "1369": "Pete takes a framed item off of his wall, and then Larry answers the door, where Pete stands with a framed drawing made by John Lennon and hands it to him. Meanwhile, Sadie and a bunch of other kids are building sets for a school play, and Sadie talks with a friend while Pete and Debbie watch from afar, sitting next to each other. Debbie tries to gently break the news, feeling totally deflated, and then she walks through the campus upset. She sees a kid, darts over to him, and encounters Joseph, the kid who insulted Sadie on her Facebook. Debbie becomes quieter, scarier, and more confrontational, causing Joseph to look upset, and then she storms off. Debbie pulls open the door to find Pete on the toilet playing on his iPad; she exits, and Pete flips her off after she's gone. Later, Debbie and Desi are talking as they walk down the stairs into a loud club, where they talk to a group of young men, one of whom takes a plate of his teeth out. Desi tries to put them in her mouth, and everyone laughs, as she looks insane and tries to kiss Debbie. Still laughing, she hands the teeth back to their owner, who pops them back in to cheers from the crowd. Elsewhere, Pete is on stage in a half-filled nightclub, watching Graham Parker perform with his band. The song resonates with Pete, reflecting the issues he is facing and prompting a strong emotional connection. Billie Joe Armstrong sits nearby, watching the show as Desi and Debbie dance with hockey players to a Nikki Minaj song, with Debbie letting loose and having the time of her life. Debbie talks to a hockey player named Jay, who is twenty-four and cute, making them both laugh. As Graham packs up, Pete approaches him, and Billie Joe comes over to congratulate Graham before they walk away. Pete sits in the car, crying while Debbie drops Desi off at her apartment, where Debbie looks shocked, and Desi nods. Pete is later on his iPad, lying in bed when Debbie comes in to talk, her shirt unbuttoned and topless. She exits into the bathroom, and after a silence, she returns dressed, prompting Pete to walk out of the room, with Debbie following. Charlotte plays piano in her room alone, overhearing Debbie and Pete fighting through the wall, leading Debbie to start walking away. The family then lays in bed watching Spongebob Squarepants, but the atmosphere is tense as Charlotte licks her fingers, pokes Sadie with her wet fingers, resulting in Sadie leaving and slamming the door. Charlotte writes a note at her desk, walks by Sadie's room, and puts the note on the door. Pete sits alone, listening to music.",
    "424": "Bert takes a seat. Findley has a mischievous look on his face as he brings out a cloth bag and pours out the three billiard balls on the table. Eddie shoots. His red ball ricochets off the shoulder and returns to kiss the third ball. Findley steps up to the bar, leaving Bert and Eddie alone. Findley points to a statue on a table behind the couch. It is a figure of Pan, with horns sticking up through his curly head, and the legs of a goat extending down below his waist. Findley completes a shot, then lays his cue gently on the table and goes to the bar. Eddie, his coat off, rubs his hand nervously. Bert turns his back on Eddie and joins Findley at the bar. Eddie stands helplessly for a moment. Findley pours a drink as Eddie approaches. He reaches in his pocket, then remembers that he gave his money to Sarah. He bounds up the stairs. He bursts into the room, goes past Sarah, stretched out on the bed, and takes the money out of her purse. She is facing away from him but her eyes are open. She listens to him as he shuts the door loudly on his way out. Eddie leaps down the stairs, two at a time. Bert eyes Eddie with controlled rage as the two get ready to play again. A game has just ended as Sarah quietly descends the stairs. She stands at the rail, listening. Bert sits with his shoes up on the couch. Eddie turns and sees her. His eyes are shut tight; his balled-up fists rub against his temples. A stunned Eddie moves to the billiard table. Defeated, Sarah turns and goes up the stairs. The men return to the table to continue their game. Bert, deeply satisfied, puts on his coat and sits to watch the action. A shaken Findley flops into a leather swivel chair. A bucket of iced champagne sits on the desk, ready to be emptied. Findley puffs on his cigarette as he looks at the impatient face of Bert, slouching in the chair across from him. Eddie leans against a wall nearby. He is quiet, morose. Eddie moves to leave. Findley and Bert watch him go. Eddie waits for Bert to come down the stairs. Eddie abruptly turns and walks out of the house. Bert watches him for a moment then follows. Bert enters his suite, removes his overcoat, then looks at the door that divides his room from Sarah's. He seems hesitant, unsure of himself. He pours himself a drink and downs it in one gulp, walks to the door, listens, and opens it himself without knocking. Sarah is there, seated primly on the bed.",
    "121": "He takes his lighted cigarette from the ashtray, puffs it two or three times, and kills it, then picks up the horn again. As he goes on speaking, the scene slowly dissolves to palm trees lining the street with middle-class houses, mostly in Spanish style. Some kids throw a baseball back and forth across a couple of front lawns, while an ice cream wagon dawdles along the block. Neff's coupe meets and passes the ice cream wagon and stops before one of the Spanish houses. Neff gets out, carrying a briefcase, with his hat a little on the back of his head, and his movements are easy and full of ginger. He inspects the house, checks the number, goes up on the front porch, and rings the bell, then pushes past her into the house. The style is Spanish throughout, with a wrought-iron staircase curving down from the second floor and a fringed Mexican shawl hanging down over the landing. A large tapestry hangs on the wall. Neff looks up to see Phyllis Dietrichson standing and looking down. She is in her early thirties, holding a large bath-towel around her torso, down to about two inches above her knees. She wears no stockings, no nothing. Neff looks up, takes his hat off, and she glances over her towel costume, then turns away as gracefully as one can with a towel for a wrapper. Neff watches Phyllis out of sight and speaks to the maid while still looking up, then goes through the archway as the maid goes off the other way. Neff comes into the room, throws his briefcase on the plush davenport, and tosses his hat on top of it. He looks around the room, moves over to a baby grand piano with a sleazy Spanish shawl dangling from one side, and two cabinet photographs standing in a staggered position on top, which he glances over: Mr. Dietrichson, about fifty-one, a big, blocky man with glasses and a Rotarian look, and Lola Dietrichson, age nineteen, wearing a filmy party dress and a yearning look in her pretty eyes. Neff walks away from the piano, takes a few steps back and forth across the rug, and his eyes fall on a wrinkled corner. His back is to the archway as he hears high heels clicking on the staircase. He turns and looks through the arch to see Phyllis Dietrichson coming downstairs, first her feet with pom-pom slippers and a gold anklet on her left ankle, and as the camera pulls back slowly while she descends, we see all of her in a pale blue summer dress. He crosses to the davenport to get the policies from his briefcase, as she turns away from the mirror and sits in a big chair with her legs drawn up sideways, the anklet now clearly visible.",
    "571": "The LTD pulls to a stop at the end of the driveway leading to Beatrice's farmhouse, where the alien ship landed, and the wrecked pickup truck is still there. Jay and Kay get out, appearing as very undercover cops, and Jay starts up the driveway while Kay pulls a black card from his wallet and extends it to Beatrice as she draws close. Beatrice looks much better than before, more nicely dressed, with a touch of makeup and a smile on her face. In the living room, Jay sips some of her lemonade and winces as a little giggle escapes her at the thought. Kay is in the hole where the ship landed, investigating with a pocket spectral analyzer over a section of scorched earth, and above him, Jay leans over, staring down as Kay looks up at him and the analyzer shifts colors from red to yellow, then purple, and green. It's Dr. Laurel Weaver, the woman who tried to speak to Jay before. Laurel signs his clipboard, gives him a dirty look, but he laughs and leaves. She goes to the stretcher, bends down, and gently pets Rosenberg's cat. She looks up to see Jay and Kay standing there, then goes to the Arquillian's body on a table under the lights, throws back a sheet revealing the fully dissected Arquillian, and begins to examine it. Jay and Laurel cross the room to where Rosenberg's corpse lies on another gurney, and she snaps her rubber gloves and reaches down, sinking her hands into the body as she moves things aside, which by Jay's expression, is very disgusting. From the other side of the room, Kay clears his throat, and Jay walks across the morgue to Kay, who is still examining the Arquillian. Jay turns and races across the room to rejoin her, leans down, and notices strange stitching around the base of Rosenberg's ear. He reaches out, touches the ear, turns it, and with a soft pull, the ear comes away from the head like a latch. Jay pulls again, and Rosenberg's entire face pushes out with a mechanical hum and hinges open, the whole face rotating away from the rest of the artificial skull. A tiny little green man, gravely wounded but not quite dead, staggers up out of a small control room inside Rosenberg's head, with gearshifts and viewing screens all around the inside of the skull. The Baltian nods vigorously, nods again, falls, and dies. Kay and Jay are not paying attention to Laurel when FLASH! Without even looking at her, Kay whips out his neuralyzer and blanks her out.",
    "1120": "They scuttle across the floor, up the wall, over the stone window sill, and out through a crack in the glass. They see something else on the floor. A pool of water reflects writing on the wall above. Harry sees something else. A cat, stiff as a board, is hanging by its tail from a lamp bracket. Students appear at each end of the corridor. Seeing the cat, they stare suspiciously at Harry, Ron, and Hermione. Colin prepares to take a photograph, but somebody stops him. Draco reads out the writing on the wall. Filch pushes his way through the gaping crowd. He sees his cat. He grabs Harry. Dumbledore sees the writing on the wall. He indicates Harry, Ron, and Hermione. Lockhart stares at the cat. Ron gives her a warning look. Snape looks unconvinced. Later, the staircases swing from side to side into different positions. As the children go upstairs, Hermione turns to Ron and Harry. A portrait on the wall nods in agreement. A classroom. A black and white bird becomes a glass goblet. Ron waves his wand. Scabbers becomes a goblet with a waving rat's tail. Professor McGonagall seems uncertain. She looks at the expectant students. Hermione is concerned. Ron turns to face a smug Draco. Outside the classroom. In the library, Hermione takes down a book from a shelf and shows it to Ron and Harry. Hung with heraldic designs, tall spectator towers surround the oval arena of the Quidditch pitch. The players swoop above the arena on their broomsticks, high over the heads of the excited crowd. The Slytherin captain hurls the Quaffle towards the goal, but the Gryffindor Keeper knocks it safely away. Ducking and diving, a Gryffindor grabs the Quaffle and flies with it. It's knocked away and passed high in the air to a Slytherin. Marking an opponent, Harry swoops around the back of a tower. He hovers watching as a well-aimed Slytherin pass sends the Quaffle flying straight through the goal. The Slytherin supporters are ecstatic as the points go up on the scoreboard. The professors applaud. The Slytherin captain encourages his team. They fly in formation, their green cloaks streaming behind them. Harry ducks as a wood bat narrowly misses his head. Lucius Malfoy and Snape are watching the match together, sitting in the professors' grandstand. Looking out for the Golden Snitch, Harry and Draco, the two Seekers, hover above the arena. A wooden Bludger almost hits Harry. His captain shouts a warning. The Bludger hurtles back. The Bludger smashes Wood's broomstick to smithereens. Then it turns and heads straight for Harry, chasing after him. Hagrid is following the game through a pair of binoculars. A new Bludger smashes through a tall tower.",
    "1286": "They sit with the windscreen wipers and headlights still on. He gets out of the car and walks towards a taxi from which an elderly Chinese man is emerging accompanied by a young man holding an umbrella. In the restaurant, the young man brings a cup to the old man. The old man and Klaatu sit facing each other. Helen and his grandson are at another table. She stares at him. Helen looks at the men, then lowers her eyes. Klaatu studies the old man expressionlessly. High metal panels are pushed into place forming a triangular wall around the robot. A lid is dropped in place on top. The Colonel grins nervously. Police cars speed down a street at night. Helen is driving towards the Highlands, New Jersey. In a wooded area, Klaatu gets out of the car. Jacob stares after him. Baffled, he looks out of the window. Watched by Jacob, she walks off following Klaatu. It's pitch-black. She moves slowly through the darkness. She cowers, covering her head, as insects swarm around her. She comes to a pond. The surface of the water begins to bubble and light shines up from beneath the surface. Hiding behind a tree, she watches as a sphere about 10 feet high rises to the surface of the pond. Lights and dark mists swirl within it. Fish and other animals are attracted to it. A frog and a lizard leap into the water heading towards it. It drifts towards the edge of the pond. Klaatu approaches it. Light flares beneath his hand and ripples across the surface as he touches it. Choppers circle the sphere in Central Park. Another sphere sits in the middle of a desert. A burst of light shoots across the surface. Desert creatures, scorpions and snakes, make their way towards it. A similar burst of light spreads out across the surface of a sphere in a jungle. A fishing boat sits on a calm sea. Behind it, a vast sphere similar to the one in New York breaks the surface. Klaatu stares into the pond sphere. Helen watches from a distance as he concentrates, his hand resting on the sphere's surface. She makes her way back to the car. She gets into the driver's seat and sits looking stunned. She stares straight ahead. Video footage shows people milling around a sphere in South America. A screen shows a sphere being blasted with a flamethrower, making the surface transparent. Creatures squirm inside. Helen and Jacob wait in the car in the woods. She gets out of the car and follows the boy as he heads into the darkness. They're bathed in a brilliant light. Both stare in amazement as the sphere from the pool, blazing with white light, rises slowly into the air.",
    "1300": "Graham comes down the stairs with his overcoat on, moves to the closet door, knocks on it before opening it, and starts down the hall. Merrill steps out of the closet for the first time. Meanwhile, Morgan pulls his eye away from the telescope set up on the window seat in his room, and Bo hugs Morgan tight, who then peels Bo's arms off of him. Graham unlocks the front door, looks down the hall shocked, and does not react but keeps staring. In another scene, Ray clutches the steering wheel tightly, turning his knuckles a yellow white, with two large bags overflowing with clothes in the truck. Graham glances at the backseat of the truck, his eyes gently move back to Ray, and drift down to the two blood-stained areas on his shirt. Tears start falling down Graham's face as Ray finally turns, his red face quivering as he talks. Ray looks at Graham, and the two men stare at each other for a beat before Ray looks away and puts the car in drive. Graham steps away as the truck moves forward and pulls down the driveway. Merrill's head is leaned against a bunch of winter coats with his eyes closed, which then open as he sits up in his chair. The chair in the closet creaks as Merrill leans forward a little towards the television screen as running is heard. Graham waits for a reply, but none comes, so he bends down where he stands and puts his head near the wood floor to try and look under the door. All he can see are the bottoms of a couple shelves in the corner of the pantry, as he's at too severe an angle. Graham sits up, only four feet away from the pantry door, looks around not knowing what to do, and his eyes fall on a bunch of kitchen knives that have spilled from a drawer onto the floor. He takes a butcher knife from the group, moves closer to the door, and uses the knife like a mirror to see under the door. Graham watches the soft reflection and then pulls the knife out. He sits there kneeling two feet from the door, takes a deep breath, and starts to lower his head under the slanted table but stops halfway down as he loses his nerve and sits up. Graham rises to his feet, places the butcher knife on the counter, starts walking across the kitchen, gets to the door, and stays like that for a long time. Then, Graham lets go of the doorknob, turns, and walks quickly across the kitchen, picks up the butcher knife, kneels down next to the pantry, ducks his head under the slanted kitchen table, places his cheek to the floor only inches from the bottom of the door, and looks into the pantry.",
    "1222": "More corpses of people and animals litter the dry muddy ground, and a man has his head partially blown away alongside a child skeleton. En-Joo looks moody and throws away a cigarette. BN leads them away but is suddenly alerted, and BN and the mercenaries take cover behind charred sticks of timber framework. They watch as a military lorry with a covered tail pulls into view and drives along the edge of the paddy field, where it stops. Soldiers push a group of five male peasants off the tailboard and into the dirt at gunpoint as School Boy looks across at Diaz. The soldiers toss primed grenades into the paddy field, and the peasants are lined up at the edge. Diaz frowns and glances at the hanging severed head while one of the troops points his rifle into the air. The peasants take the gunfire as the signal to begin a race across the paddy field, stumbling desperately through the water as BN watches horrified and the mercenaries wear grim expressions. In slow motion, the peasants' feet slosh through the water, but they all make it successfully to the other side of the field and slump on the bank. A soldier shouts angrily and kicks one of the peasants in the head, then raises his rifle, firing bullets that hit the ground near the peasants. The troops angrily gesture to the frightened men to cross the field again, but as a soldier raises his rifle, he gets an arrow in the back. Rambo runs through the trees, letting fly with arrows from his bow as School Boy looks astonished. A soldier gets an arrow in the back as he tries to escape, then one in the head, while another catches one in the leg and eye, falling into the paddy field onto a grenade. The peasants scramble towards BN and the mercenaries, and Rambo joins them and speaks to BN. Lewis turns his back on Rambo, who draws an arrow on Lewis and aims it at the bald man's right eye. The other mercenaries cover Rambo with their weapons, glancing at each other worriedly until Rambo lowers the bow and arrow from Lewis' face, making Lewis look relieved. They move as rain pelts down on the military camp at night, where the troop sits smoking and drinking beer in the mess hut, watching women perform an exotic dance routine on a stage. Sarah languishes in the pig sty with her hair untidy, clothes dirty, and dark bags under her eyes, looking up through gaps in the floorboards as the commander walks calmly back and forth. Meanwhile, the mercenaries have commandeered the soldiers' truck and are driven along a dirt track towards the camp, with Lewis holding a torch.",
    "1363": "Abby rolls her eyes with a smile and goes inside. As Mike is walking away, he turns back for a moment, then keeps walking. Abby looks away haughtily. Abby sits on the couch staring at a box of ELECTRIC. She opens the box, dumping out a pair of underwear and a REMOTE CONTROL. Abby checks herself out in the mirror. As Abby, Mike, and Colin walk into the bar, two buxom blonde twin JELLO GIRLS, BAMBI and CANDI, rush up to Mike. They slap him on the back, eyeing the twins. The group sits down at the table. Abby tries to kick Mike. As she does, she unwittingly knocks over her purse. The contents spill out, and the REMOTE for her vibrating underwear rolls away, stopping UNDER THE TABLE. A PRECOCIOUS KID, 8, sits with his parents. A small RED LIGHT turns on. As Harold and Bob laugh, Stuart slaps Mike on the back. Suddenly, her smile quickly changes to horror. She shifts in her seat, trying to control her NOW-VIBRATING. She leans down to grab her purse. She pokes her head under the table to see that the contents of her purse have spilled. Mike's head appears next to hers. Mike starts laughing. Stuart watches, worried, as Abby rises from underneath the table, clutching her head and looking around frantically, trying to figure out who has the remote. The kid has flicked up the speed on the remote even higher. Abby's eyes roll back. She starts to get up when Stuart stops her. Candi looks at Harold, intrigued by Abby's display. As Stuart frowns, concerned, Abby spasms, then rushes through it as fast as she can. She leaps to her feet. As they all walk out, Mike grabs the remote from the kid. Abby spots this and snatches the remote out of Mike's hand. She shoots him a look. Colin walks up. On set, Mike addresses the camera. NEARBY, a confused Joy looks at Abby. Georgia winks at him. Abby looks at the agent, confused. The CAB DRIVER looks at her. Mike walks out of the lobby, as Abby gets out of a cab, suitcase in hand. Abby glares at him, about to show her true feelings, but then quickly covers. Abby and Mike sit in the backseat. Abby looks down at her notes. Mike studies her. Abby sits there, fuming that he's right. Mike looks at her, surprised. The audience applauds as Mike takes a deep breath and heads on stage. Abby now sits in the audience, watching as Jay interviews Mike on stage. Abby talks on the phone. Abby's surprised, then suspicious. The waiter arrives with mojitos. Abby looks at him. Abby sips her mojito, studying Mike.",
    "123": "She fixes him a glass of tea while he is looking around, then hands him the tea. He picks up his hat and goes out, and she looks after him. Neff bangs the front door shut, walks quickly to his car, and drives away. Shooting past Neff sitting behind the wheel of his car, the car hop hangs a tray on the door and serves him a bottle of beer. Neff goes bowling and rolls the ball with an effort at concentration, but his mind is not really on the game. It is a six-story building in the Normandie-Wilshire district, with a basement garage. The camera pans up the front of the building to the top-floor windows as a little rain starts to fall. Neff stands by the window with his coat off and his tie loose, while raindrops strike against the glass. He turns away impatiently, paces up and down past a caddy bag with golf clubs in it, pulls one out at random, makes a couple of short swings, throws the club on the couch, and paces again. Neff goes to the door and opens it, and then just looks at her. She has nothing in her hands but her bag, and he looks down at her hands. She comes in, and he closes the door. Neff switches on the standing lamp, and she starts to take off her coat. He takes her coat and lays it across the back of a chair as Phyllis has moved over to the window and stares out through the wet window-pane. By this time, he has hold of her wrist, draws her to him slowly, and kisses her. Her arms tighten around him. After a moment, he pulls his head back, still holding her close. He lets her go and moves toward the dinette, which contains a small table and some chairs. A low glass-and-china cabinet is built between the dinette and kitchen, leaving a space like a doorway. The kitchen is the usual apartment house kitchen, with a stove, ice-box, sink, etc., and it is quite small. Neff goes to the ice-box and Phyllis drifts in after him. He points at the china closet and has taken a tray of ice cubes from the refrigerator, holding it under the hot-water faucet. Phyllis has the glasses now and hands them to him. He dumps some ice cubes into the glasses, reaches for the whiskey bottle on top of the china closet, and hands her a glass. They move back toward the living room, where Phyllis and Neff go toward the davenport and sit on it, fairly close together. He puts his arms around her, kisses her, and holds her tight, their heads touching side by side, as the camera slowly starts to recede.",
    "362": "Pippin looks on in frightened awe as Sam and Gollum lead Frodo to the stairs. Above Minas Morgul, the sky is bright with light as the city erupts. Faces of soldiers and civilians of Minas Tirith watch from the parapets of the city as Frodo and Sam sink to the ground, holding their hands against their ears, as out of the city comes a rending screech, shivering and rising swiftly to a piercing pitch beyond the range of hearing. The terrible cry ends, falling back through a long sickening wail to silence. Frodo squeezes his eyes shut, clutching at his shirt as if it's on fire. The cavernous gate of Minas Morgul swings open, and a huge army marches out—rank upon rank of armor-clad orcs moving swiftly and silently, passing close to Frodo and Sam in an endless stream of ragged columns. Seventy-five thousand orcs march to war, just below Frodo, while Frodo, Sam, and Gollum climb the stony stairs high above the marching army. Gandalf is thinking and calculating as he strides through the back streets of the city so determined and purposeful that Pippin has to run to keep up. Gandalf suddenly stops and looks down at Pippin, kneels down, and looks at Pippin earnestly, his hand on Pippin's shoulder, before watching as Pippin hurries away. An ancient stone bridge spans the ruins of east and west Osgiliath—a once mighty Gondorian city. Ithilien Rangers patrol the bridge, and the west Osgiliath has fallen into disrepair, but the desolation of east Osgiliath is more pronounced—it is held by the forces of Mordor. The camera tracks down beneath the bridge to the dark waters, catching a stealthy movement. Many boats carrying murderous-looking orcs are quietly tracking down the river, with several hunched figures on board steering with long oars. Faramir, Captain of Gondor, issues orders to his soldiers. The Ithilien Rangers take position; they are all weathered, hardened, professional soldiers, watchful, ready, and waiting. On the river, the boats quietly advance, and Faramir and his soldiers lie in wait. As the boats arrive, hundreds of orcs race ashore, and Faramir steps out, his sword drawn. A fierce battle ensues, but Faramir is unable to stop the advance as hundreds of orcs cross the wide bridge into west Osgiliath. A dizzying view looks down on Minas Tirith, 1000 feet below, as Pippin desperately scrambles up the rocky mountainside, clambers over a rocky ledge, and ducks behind a stone wall, panting heavily. An ancient stone ledge holds a great pile of firewood, secured in stacked bundles. Gandalf waits tensely below as Pippin stealthily manages to pour oil on the wood and set a flame to it. Within seconds, the great pyre is alight, and the guards look on in total surprise as the flames erupt into the twilight sky.",
    "175": "The Black Guy has his I.D. folder open as Ray Bones then walks off, and we see coming out a different gate, two big guys in sunglasses flanking one smaller, older guy. He looks over his shoulder to give the guy a smile. The agents glance at each other without giving any kind of sign. He straightens up as Chili exits the stairwell and walks up to him. Chili looks at him, the guy's either dumb or making conversation. The Bear keeps staring but doesn't say anything. The Bear looks at him. The Bear nods, closing and opening his eyes. Harry, his hair a mess from sleeping on it, looks up at the door as it opens to reveal Ray Bones standing there. He jerks upright. Harry wakes up quick, nearly wets himself as Bones then casually steps into the office. Scrambling now to play it the way Chili taught him, Harry quickly gestures to the red leather chair across the desk. As Ray Bones sits down, Harry moves to the blinds and opens them. Problem is, the sun's setting, so there's no glare at all. Ray indicates the nice red sunset. Harry just smiles, sits down at the desk, things already not going too well, about to get worse. Bo Catlett is behind a big wooden desk on the phone. The Bear, sort of half doubled over, sees three dark-shaded gentlemen step out of the car. Bo Catlett looks into the outer office as a car pulls into the garage. Bo Catlett hangs up, gets to his feet as the men all look into the office now. We can now see that one of the Latinos is older, the other two, younger, are his bodyguards. Mr. Escobar, the older, meaner one, steps into the office. As the two back doors of a limo slam shut, Bo Catlett sits in the back, wedged in between the two bodyguards, neither of whom has removed his shades. He faces Escobar on the opposite seat. Escobar studies him a moment. Bo Catlett stiffens. Bo Catlett shrugs. Bo Catlett barely glances at the bodyguards, smiles the gleamy smile to the Latin guy in front of him. As Ronnie zigzags in and out of traffic, giving people 'the look' as he passes, he is on the carphone. Bo Catlett is on the phone. Bones leans forward; Ray's heard that one before. Bones shakes his head, stands up, and begins kicking the living shit out of Harry Zimm. Ray Bones pulls a pair of black leather gloves from his pocket and steps around the desk. Bones grabs him by the hair, picks him up, and throws him across the room into the wall of pictures, many of them coming off their hooks and falling on top of Harry.",
    "981": "They put down their bags, and Benjamin peers into the kitchen, then down the narrow flight of steps to Queenie's basement bedroom, as Daisy watches him walk to the foot of the stairs. An elderly woman appears on the landing. A mostly black congregation has gathered for the funeral in a quaint white church, with Queenie's daughter wearing a black veil and a man in a suit nodding solemnly beside her. Daisy and Benjamin sit at the end of the pew closest to the wall, watching as people grieve openly. Queenie lies at the front in an open casket. The man shakes Benjamin's hand and moves along, while Daisy lowers her eyes as Benjamin stares ahead serenely. People begin to rise from the pews, and the framed family photograph is on the wall. Daisy turns on a bathroom tap, but no water comes out. Naked and wrapped in a bed sheet, Daisy hurries into the bathroom as Benjamin takes delivery at the fridge freezer. Fully dressed, they decorate the house, and Benjamin paints Daisy's bottom with a pink roller, prompting her to chase him with a brush. Night falls, and they dance and twist on the mattress in the lamp-lit bedroom. Benjamin removes his T-shirt, they kiss, and he lies on top of her. Benjamin hangs a picture and makes popcorn as they watch The Beatles on a black and white television. A woman performs physiotherapy on Daisy's leg, and Daisy surfaces at the edge of a swimming pool, watching as a young woman dives in and swims front crawl. Wearing a white shirt, Benjamin appears poolside and observes as the woman swims effortlessly and climbs from the pool, while Daisy watches her with sad eyes. Sobbing, Daisy rests her arms on the poolside and lulls her head as daylight spills in through the tall windows and Benjamin strolls calmly to the water's edge. Daisy's head is buried in the crook of her arm. Wearing a headscarf, Daisy rides with Benjamin down a winding road on his motorcycle. Lightning crackles in the gloomy sky as they ride alongside. Wearing a patchwork blanket around his shoulders and carrying two mugs, Benjamin walks up from behind the parked motorbike, strolls past the lake house to the boardwalk, and sits beside Daisy by the wooden railings as she stares down the length at the derelict jetty and the lake beyond. He hands her a drink, and they're cast in a warm glow as the sun rises. Daisy breezes through a dance studio as young girls file out. She locks up and deposits her keys by a desk, while tall studio mirrors run the length of the wall opposite the front windows. Daisy strolls across the varnished wooden floorboard and regards her reflection as she poses with one arm elevated.",

A boarding officer spots Uri struggling and runs to help. From the platform, Uri has hoisted Alec onto the rising ark, but Alec can't reach him, so with all his might, Uri grabs Alec's legs and hurls him into the air before plunging into the pit and falling. Two boarding officers drag the protesting boy onboard. Meanwhile, the coms officer spots a hydraulic malfunction preventing the gate from closing, and Adriane spots Lily and Noah on the monitor as dark, battling floodwaters wipe out the airfield and the mountains. On the ark bridge, the Ark office leads Adrian and Laura through the crowded hallway, and the crew watch awestruck as the floodwater clears the surrounding mountains. The clock counts down from 10 seconds as the water draws near and hits the ark from a high end. Anheuser glowers as the countdown tower hits zero, lights go off as water crashes over the ark, and the crew are knocked over on the bridge. The boarding officers and Uri's boys hurry away as water crashes in around them, and water slams through a corridor, knocking people over. The crew re-man their controls, and in the flooded corridor, Nina tends to Tenzen, who has injured his leg. A door slams shut on Lily and Tamara, and Tamara gets Lily and Caesar free, trapping herself in a flooding corridor. On the bridge, Anheuser spots a wrecked plane hovering through the crashing waves. The huge jet barges on the water, they hit, and the plane cracks the anchor away as the ark rises with massive waves curling up and over the top. A computer graphic shows the angle of the collision between the two arks as the ark descends dramatically, throwing the crowds in the hallway off their feet. The ark dives headlong, and stuff crashes around in the corridor. Adrian and Laura find Lily, and on the bridge on a flat rooftop, they watch a computer image of Mount Everest. Down in the geological bay connecting corridor, Jackson, Kate, Noah, and Tibetans hear all this over the speaker. Up to his waist in the water, Jackson walks away from the others as Noah stares long and steadily at his father. Jackson kisses Noah, and before Kate takes the boy away, he kisses her too. In flickering light, he turns around and takes a deep breath. Nina flashes a torchlight and screams for help, as does Tamara in the anti-chamber. Tamara's face is pressed up against the grate as the water level rises and covers her. Jackson swims into the hydraulic chamber and surfaces in an air pocket, while Kate tries to treat the injured Tenzen.",
    "876": "A photograph of Christine with baby Zoe is followed by another showing a smiling Christine next to a birthday cake, a photo of Zoe with a teddy bear, and a photo of Christine and Kate with their arms around each other, both grinning happily at the camera, alongside recent photos of Zoe. After closing the album and placing it on the chest of drawers, Kate turns off a lamp and makes her way slowly around the bed, where she sits down on the edge and looks down wistfully. The next morning, Zoe stands by the bed looking down at Kate, who's fast asleep, and sleepy Kate opens her eyes and looks at the clock. Zoe is in her room, staring at her, and Kate sighs resignedly before searching through a cardboard box in Zoe's room, pulling out a scarf that Zoe shakes her head at, then finding another one, only for Zoe to shake her head again. Kate puts the pink, stripy scarf back and begins to look through a second box as Zoe follows her into the hallway. Kate picks up her keys, grabs her coat, and Zoe stands and stares at the door until Kate walks back to her. Zoe, wearing a red woolen hat and multicolored scarf, gives a brief nod, then looks away. Kate comes back with coffee as scores of children make their way towards a large, brown brick building. Kate and Zoe walk along the street and stop by the side of a yellow school bus parked outside, then inside the school, they walk down a corridor decorated with children's drawings. Ellen takes Zoe's hand and leads her away, leaving Kate with her therapist, where she lies back on the couch incredulously. After school, a gaggle of schoolchildren run down the steps of Zoe's school, and Kate stands with other parents and guardians on the pavement outside, smiling as she sees Zoe walking out on her own. The two of them walk along the street together, then at home, Zoe is at the table as Kate takes her plate to it. Later, Kate hurries to the front door and sees a teenager with a nose piercing, looks the young goth up and down, and as Zoe walks past, Kate turns back to Charlotte, smiling awkwardly at the sulky young woman who steps into the apartment, and Kate closes the door behind her before walking off towards Zoe's room and nodding slowly, then sharing a look with Zoe. At the restaurant, in the kitchen, Leah is with Nick as Kate walks past them and turns off the CD player. Nick looks up, and Kate bristles while the staff sit around a table, and Nick dishes up spaghetti, passing a plate along to Kate. Handsome, shaggy-haired Nick stares at Kate, a little put out.",
    "1028": "A wave crashes against a rock in a bay as bright sunlight shines through clouds. Mountains give way to dense trees, above which a bell tower rises. Fluffy white clouds float in a blue sky, and below lies the ever-changing landscape of the United States of America, including lush mountains, densely packed cities, and vast patchworks of fields. The screen splits to show more aerial views: a coastal city, a freeway cutting across lush parkland, a meandering river, and circular fields spread across the land, with snow-capped mountains and a jagged, rocky coastline. A jet comes in to land on the runway. Meanwhile, a thick-set man in a suit, Steve, clears a table, shreds documents, pours bleach in a coffee jar, and aims a rifle at the office. Ryan Bingham, a suavely seated man in his late 40s with neat graying hair and a side parting, interacts with Steve, who hands over his key card at the door. In a hotel room, Ryan packs a suitcase with military precision, studies a pouch full of ties, closes it, and puts it in the case. He zips up the suitcase, pulls out its handle, drags it out of the room, and switches off the light as he goes. At an airport, Ryan drops off a rental car and walks up to the First Class priority access desk, grabs his boarding pass, and shows it to a security guard. He puts his case on a table, grabs two gray plastic trays, and places his laptop, shoes, and suit jacket into them. He steps through the walk-through metal detector, holding up his boarding pass, and passes the security check. Ryan puts his jacket and shoes back on, zips up his case, pulls out the handle, and walks off with it. A jet flies above a blanket of fluffy white clouds, and Ryan sits in First Class, watching a flight attendant walk down the aisle pushing a trolley. She hands a passenger a drink, Ryan looks up at her, frowning, and she places the can of soda back on the trolley before walking on. Ryan smiles. The jet comes in to land, and Ryan unzips a backpack and stands behind a lectern, smiling at a few delegates seated at long tables. At the airport, Ryan walks up to a desk with a sign beside it, shows a card, then drags his case into a lounge where he sits in a leather armchair, looks at a piece of paper, and makes a phone call, after which he looks surprised. Dallas at night displays a vast city of lights as an American Airlines jet taxis at the airport.",
    "515": "The flashback ends. Mickey is back in the present in his darkened living room, illuminated by a glow from a window behind the couch. A coffee table sits in front of the couch, and papers are scattered on the floor. Mickey gets up from the couch where he'd been sitting and paces back and forth as he talks over the screen. Manon Lescaut is being performed. Onstage, the soprano in the title role sings a mournful aria as she kneels by the ruins of a wagon; the background is dark. The film moves up to the private boxes in the upper loge, where David and Holly can be seen from a distance sitting in one of the boxes. David glances at her; he reaches down for a bottle of wine. The movie briefly cuts back to the stage, where the soprano is leaning on a wagon wheel; her voice soars. Then it's back to a closer look at Holly and David in their box. The aria continues as David hands a smiling Holly a glass. He uncorks the wine and pours some in both their glasses. Holly mouths a thank you, glancing around. They look at each other and raise their glasses in a toast. Lee, wearing a baggy plaid shirt and jeans, has opened the door for Elliot and his client, wealthy rock star Dusty Frye. Lee closes the door behind the men and walks over to Dusty. Lee chuckles as she looks at him; he is wearing sunglasses, a red-imprinted T-shirt, and a baggy coat. She turns and walks with Frederick, Elliot, and Dusty farther into the loft, her hands clasped behind her back. Frederick covers his face to hide his disgust. As Dusty talks, the camera follows Elliot, who walks past the others to examine the drawings more closely. Two framed nude drawings of Lee are propped up on an easel. Elliot glances admiringly at the drawings, then surreptitiously at Lee, admiring her body as she converses with an offscreen Dusty and Frederick. The camera leaves Elliot to follow the enthusiastic Lee as she takes Dusty by the arm and starts leading him to the door. Frederick follows at a distance. The camera now moves back to Elliot, still staring at the nude drawings, as the sounds of Frederick's and Dusty's footsteps are heard leaving the loft. He turns and hesitantly smiles to an offscreen Lee. He laughs. Lee, uneasy, looks down. There's an awkward moment of silence. The camera follows Lee as she walks quickly to the stereo unit, pulling a record off the shelf. She pulls the record out of its jacket and puts it on the turntable. The record in place, Lee turns and leans back against the stereo unit.",
    "1034": "Natalie spins around and heads off. Ryan looks out of the window of a jet as it rises into the sky. In Las Vegas, Alex holds the cut-out of Julie and Jim in front of the pyramid-shaped Luxor Hotel. Ryan aims the digital camera, and Alex moves the cut-out closer. He takes a picture while Alex stares at the cut-out. Ryan smiles, and Alex looks surprised before smiling warmly. In Milwaukee, a jet comes in to land. Alex and Ryan walk through the airport terminal, with him pulling a black wheelie case and her a similar, neat red one. Later, they walk into the Chalet Suites, a Swiss lodge-themed hotel, and join a short queue of people checking in. Ryan notices a second counter with no queue. As Ryan opens a hotel room door, his sister Kara walks up holding a basket of washing. Alex and Ryan walk into their gaudily furnished room, where Ryan picks up a photocopied booklet with a picture of Julie and Jim on the front. Julie hugs Ryan, and Jim comes over. There's a large map of the U.S. on the wall, pinned with several photos of the cut-out of Julie and Jim in front of famous landmarks. Ryan steps back and looks at the map, covered in photographs, smiles thoughtfully, and goes back to join Alex, Julie, and Jim, pointing at the map. Later, at the bar, Alex goes back in while Ryan waits outside with Julie and Kara. They smile, and Julie nods and looks down sadly as Kara looks at her, with a box of flower arrangements nearby. Ryan drives up to his old school with Alex, and they get out of the car, looking at the long, low building. They tramp across some snow and walk up to the entrance. Ryan tries the door, finding it locked, and peers inside to see darkness. He turns to Alex resignedly, but she grins and goes to a window, undoes a catch with a credit card, and pulls it open. He grabs her foot and heaves her up, and they both clamber into a classroom, where they look at old newspaper photos of the basketball team and a picture in a trophy case. Outside by a loading bay, they sit on the stairs and kiss. In the gym, they watch the basketball team practice and grin at each other. Kara calls, so Alex drops Ryan off by the church. Ryan runs up to the church entrance, opens the door, and runs up some stairs. He walks into the church and finds Julie, in white, sitting with her bridesmaids, who wear cerise, crying. They see Ryan, and Kara goes over to him as he looks at Julie, who wipes tears from her eyes.",
    "739": "A crescent moon drifting amid clouds is reflected in still water, and a fisherman's float plops onto the surface, creating a ring around it. On the curve of the crescent moon, a boy lounges with his fishing rod. A somber-looking black woman in her 40s turns to face the camera and puts aside a cooking pot. The maid nods with a smile and a long, penetrating gaze, but the smile vanishes as her eyes move across the room, settling on a framed photo of a young, black, graduate student on the facing wall, after which she looks away. She lifts the baby out of her cot and wraps her arms around the little girl. In a wig and a pale, blue and white uniform, she walks to the bus stop and pats the child's tummy. The hem looks uneven. Meanwhile, a young redhead at the wheel of a blue convertible 1962 Cadillac speeds along a dirt track bisecting a wide field, with clouds of dust trailing behind her. Ring lettered Skeeter drives along with a look of determined optimism, then pulls in at a gas station and waits as a black attendant cleans her windscreen. A flag flutters on the roof of the substantial offices of the Jackson Journal, where down in the street, Skeeter pulls up outside the main entrance and strides confidently through the glass-fronted door. A cigarette smoking receptionist leads the way through the sprawling open plan office to the editor's office, where a short, middle-aged man is dwarfed by his big desk and he points to Skeeter. Eugenia Phelan, AKA Skeeter, hands over her resume as he stretches for a folder. Skeeter, carrying a basket of readers' letters, comes out of Blackly's office with a happy smile. At her home, a well-groomed brunette in a flowery, sleeveless, '60s style dress pulls out a length of toilet paper and marks it with dots. Minnie, a stout, well-cushioned maid, trots to the bottom of the stairs and shouts up, then, carrying a pie, follows the ladies to their car. Aibileen Clark, the narrator, is garnishing a dish with grapes, while Elizabeth Leefolt looks through her front curtains and then nods to Aibileen, who slides the chicken dish over a crack in the veneer of the dining table. In the bathroom, she squats in front of moon-faced Mae Mobley, who's sitting on a child's toilet seat, and Elizabeth scoops up her daughter. Hilly sashays into the sitting room and beams at her girlfriends. Minnie joins Aibileen in the kitchen and makes a beeline for a dish of deviled eggs, bites into an egg, and then picks up a tray and a TV set, which she carries off towards the lounge as Aibileen picks up the cord that Minnie is trailing behind her.",
    "919": "A lion's head looks out from a crest formed by a garland of film, Metro-Goldman-Mayer, which features the words. Light flares from a torch held aloft by a robed woman standing on a pedestal in front of a sky dominated by towering clouds. Towering crags rise out of a shining sea. Two powerful cars speed along a tunnel which runs along the coast. A shiny wheel flashes, a driver's eyes are fixed on the road. A gun is caught, the driver checks his rear view mirror. He guns his shiny Aston-Martin past a line of traffic as his pursuers open up. Bullet holes pepper the Aston's windows. The tire on a truck bursts and gets swerved into the Aston's path sliding along the wall as James Bond, the steely-eyed Aston driver brakes hard. He swerves past the truck which pulls out on him. A piece of metal protruding at the front of the truck, punches into the car's door, locking the two vehicles together. Bond brakes hard causing the metal to rip his door open sending the Aston spinning down the road in front of the truck. He regains control and speeds off. The two lanes ahead are blocked. One coming right for him. He locks into a gap. But his pursuers hit the truck head on. Another Alfa Romeo is still in the chase. Approaching a traffic jam he swerves left, flying down another tunnel to chase a track's vision off. The Aston-Martin followed by the black Alfa-Romeo driving towards the quarry. The cops glimpse the cars speed over a bridge. The Land Rover heads off, blue lights flashing. Coming out of the tunnel and rounding a corner, Bond skids the car to avoid the police Land Rover which blocks the road in front of him and heads off through the dusty quarry, the Alfa still on his tail. He swerves past tracked excavators and down a winding bumpy track in front of a smooth new quarry rock face. The cops open fire and get blasted from the Alfa. The Land Rover plows into a building and off the edge of a cliff. Bond calmly changes gear. His eyes widen as the Land Rover bounces across the track right in front of him. The Alfa gunman is leaning out of the car's passenger window. Bond ducks as glass and bullets fill the Aston. The Alfa draws alongside and the two cars trade dusty paintwork. A bulldozer looms in front of them. Both cars swerve round it. Bond draws a machine-gun. The Alfa hurtles off a precipice. Bond drives the dusty battered Aston into a medieval Italian town with stone buildings and narrow streets. A lofty campanile bell tower dominates the huddle of buildings.",
    "1246": "Miranda strides through the foyer and approaches a lift while a staff member waits for another lift. She pulls off her designer shades as Emily runs to meet her. Emily fetches Andy, who's holding her resume, and snatches Andy's briefcase. Andy walks nervously into the bright, airy office, which has black-and-white framed photos on the wall. Miranda takes in Andy's attire while reading a magazine. Andy frowns and heads for the door, then turns back as Miranda turns her attention to black-clad Nigel. Andy hands her pass in at the reception desk on the ground floor and is heading for the doors when Emily appears and beckons. Andy dines with Nate and two mates and is in bed when her phone goes off at 6:15. Andy hurries down the street with four coffees as two women wheel a clothes rail into Miranda's office. She comes out, and Emily calls Andy when she walks in. Andy watches Emily carry the coffees into Miranda's office, then hangs up her coat and hurries to her desk, which faces Emily's. Andy is wearing a bright blue jumper while Emily inputs a message. Nigel has given Andy black stilettos, and Andy hurries in as Miranda stiffens. Miranda's eyes travel down Andy's body, taking in her plaid skirt, black tights, and fixing on her sensible, black flat shoes. Andy scurries back to her desk and quickly dons the black stilettos that Nigel brought her as Emily takes over. Miranda rolls her eyes, and Andy is hurt by the slight. A sleek chauffeur-driven car brings Andy to the Calvin Klein showroom on 7th Avenue, and her mobile phone rings as she's getting out. She crosses in heavy traffic and struggles back into the office, carrying big bags and four coffees. Miranda waltzes in and drops her coat and bag onto Andy's desk as willowy, well-dressed Serena walks off with Emily. Later, Andy goes down to the canteen, where shaven-headed Nigel finds her helping herself to some soup. They exchange a smile as Andy gets a roll and then gets soup on her jumper. A gentleman is in the lift with them as Miranda vets outfits and inspects a dress. Andy chuckles at the similarity of the two blue belts, but her smile fades. At home, Nate hands her a sandwich. Andy is at her desk dumping her coat and bag, and Andrea turns with boards. A dog is there as Andy does her bidding, and Emily goes. Andy and her father have dinner together, and she accepts the cash as they go to the theater. Back at the office, holding back her tears, Andy walks out of Miranda's office into the anteroom and past Emily's desk. Andy walks through the editorial department and passes Nigel's office, which has a glass wall. She stops by the door and looks in at Nigel, who is examining some contact sheets on an illuminated desktop.",
    "237": "He smiles and runs to catch up with his family. He looks back, but Dorota is lost to sight and the procession continues on its way. Two rooms on the third floor: a living room and a kitchen. The Szpilmans are unpacking their belongings in silence. Father pauses for a moment to take stock. They all go to the window and look out. Their POV - the street. Further along, men are building a wall across the street. Slush underfoot. Great activity. People selling shoes, clothes, carpets, curtains, food. A woman offers cakes under a barbed-wire cover. Noise, bustle, restless wing and froing. Among the traders, Henryk, slightly shabbier now, and at his feet a basket with books. He holds a couple of volumes in his hands, trying to interest passers-by. Szpilman, also a little shabbier, wends his way through the setters and buyers, the beggars, the passers-by, and reaches Henryk. Henryk drops the two volumes into the basket, takes a handle one side of the basket, Szpilman the other. They set off. As they walk, carrying the basket between them, passing beggars and children asking for food. Suddenly, a WOMAN appears in front of them, barring their way. She's brightly rouged with thickly painted eyebrows, dressed in an old green velvet curtain with an unsteady mauve ostrich feather rising from her straw hat. She wanders on. Szpilman and Henryk, too, continue on their way. And as they go. Meanwhile, a street band begins to play a waltz. Jewish policemen and German soldiers are clearing a space, shoving Jews out of the way, including Szpilman, Henryk and the nervous man. Other soldiers are clearing a space. Two GERMAN SOLDIERS pull out of the crowd a tall woman and a short man and haul them into the cleared space. The couple dance to the street band's waltz. At intervals, German soldiers select even more unlikely couples: a fat woman with a painfully thin man, a young boy with an elderly woman, two men, and two cripples. The German soldiers are, to various degrees, amused. One of them is almost hysterical with laughter. The couples dance as fast as they can. A soldier kicks one of the cripples who can't go on any more. Then a whistle blows, a policeman stops the traffic, the barrier swings open and people swarm across in both directions. Szpilman and Henryk enter and stop. Seated at the table with Mother and Father is a uniformed young man, YITZCHAK HELLER, unusual appearance, a man with red hair and a Hitler moustache. Heller remains seated, just nods at the brothers. Awkward silence. He runs dry. Benek points to the customer, who makes an imploring gesture to Szpilman. Szpilman stops playing.",

Mr. Bennet leaves the letter on the desk until the housekeeper has left. The housekeeper now makes her way out into the garden to take down the washing. Jane and Lizzie are picking fruit. Lizzie puts down her basket and rushes off, quickly followed by Jane. The two girls hurry around the outside of the house, then across the wide expanse of lawn, looking for their father. They spot him, arms behind his back, strolling pensively into the shade of the trees. They rush over to him. Lizzie sits down with the letter. Lizzie stands up, looking perturbed. Later, Lizzie's in Jane's bedroom in her nightgown. Jane sits by the fire, drying her hair. Lizzie sits sadly on the stool at the foot of Jane's bed. Mr. Darcy's expression is one of determined constancy. A lady's hand at work on a delicate piece of floral embroidery. Lizzie stands and leaves. With a heavy heart, Lizzie makes her way over to her father's study. She pauses to watch him through the doorway and slowly goes inside. He turns round and takes her hand. Two of them listen to Mrs. Bennet's hysterical chatter. Lizzie does so. A building fronted by magnificent pillared portico. An open-topped carriage pulls up, drawn by two white horses. Lydia gets out, dressed in a simple, empire line wedding dress and bonnet, and carrying a bunch of flowers. The Gardiners are with her. Beaming, she takes Mr. Gardiner's hand and heads up the steps. Inside, Mr. Wickham stands up, ready to receive his bride. Mr. Darcy appears beside him, his face taut with anger. Lydia walks down the aisle, grinning, and takes her place beside Mr. Wickham at the altar. The vicar comes to stand before them. An open-topped carriage trundles down the long driveway at Longbourn. Mr. and Mrs. Wickham are sitting in the back. The Bennet family come out to greet them. Mrs. Bennet waving a white handkerchief excitedly above her head. Mrs. Bennet takes her husband's arm and leads the way. Jane makes to follow them. Jane and Lizzie exchange glances, then head inside, followed by Mary and Kitty. Later, the girls are out walking. Mr. Wickham is showing off his riding skills nearby. Wickham canters past them and makes his horse jump over a log. Wickham rides past them again, and Lydia grins cheekily at her sisters. Lizzie looks thoughtful. Mr. Gardiner proffers his hand, and the deal is done. Wickham finds Lizzie reading the letter. She looks away, embarrassed. They walk together in the gardens of Longbourn.",
    "1146": "Harry runs to Cedric and helps him to free himself, and exhausted and trembling, he scrambles to his feet as a strong wind flings leaves high into the air and the hedges advance. As the hedges close in behind them, they both sprint towards the shining trophy, and upon reaching it, they pause in front of it and grab it, one hand each. It spins like a Catherine wheel, and they land beside a statue in the cemetery, scrambling to their feet as Cedric looks around the moonlit graveyard. The trophy is lying on the ground, and Harry clutches his forehead in agony. Wormtail appears, clutching a small, wizened creature in a blanket, and Cedric draws his wand but falls dead. Aiming his wand, Wormtail forces Harry up into the arms of the statue, which traps him fast behind the handle of the scythe. A cauldron stands in front of Harry as Wormtail drops the pale, deformed creature into it, opens the Riddle family grave, drops a bone into the cauldron, draws a knife, slices off his right hand into the cauldron, slashes open Harry's sleeve, and cuts Harry's arm, adding Harry's blood to the cauldron. The contents of the cauldron sieve and bubble, and Wormtail runs into the shadows as flames leap high into the night sky. The cauldron disappears as a ghastly, shapeless figure appears in front of Harry, writhing and twisting as it slowly takes human form. A veil of black smoke descends and unfolds the creature as Voldemort slowly turns his head, his gleaming, gray skin stretched tight over his bony features, with sunken eyes, and in place of a nose, two narrow slits for nostrils. He runs his fingers over his hairless skull as Wormtail emerges from the shadows, and now, draped in a black robe, Voldemort opens his arms triumphantly, admiring his restored human form with a smile on his thin lips. Bowing low, Wormtail holds it out, and Voldemort takes it in his long, bony fingers, pressing his wand into the dark mark tattooed on Wormtail's arm. He looks up into the glowering sky, and from the darkening clouds, a snaking ribbon of black smoke emerges, twisting and turning downwards, dividing into separate plumes, each revealing a black-robed death eater wearing a tall pointed hood and a skeleton mask. As the smoke clears, Voldemort faces them, unmasks them, and they fall to their knees. Snatching another mask, Lucius rips off his hood and restores his hand in silver, looking down at Cedric. He presses one finger into Harry's scarred forehead, causing Harry to fall to the ground, forcing him to bow and writhe in agony. He sends Harry spinning, but Harry dives for cover, summoning up every ounce of courage to face Voldemort.",
    "1048": "Sam spots Howard with his camera and narrows his eyes, furrowing his brow pensively before making his way over to Howard. Meanwhile, Javier stands in the elevator, staring at a CCTV camera, and reaches the fourth floor where he strolls down a corridor, slots a swipe card into a machine on a hotel room door, and unlocks it. Inside, he removes a hold-all from a fridge, takes a pistol from it, loads the pistol, and puts an earpiece in. In the plaza, Sam sees Veronica take the bag from Enrique and glances up at a marksman. Howard talks with Anna, and Sam watches Enrique depart before disappearing into the crowd. Wearing a backpack, Javier screws a silencer onto his pistol as he climbs a flight of steps in the hotel and uses a touchscreen PDA to activate the fan in the window overlooking the plaza, causing the curtain to flutter, which Barnes sees. Sam turns his back and walks away, while Javier stalks through the hotel corridors with his pistol drawn, shoots a hotel maid, and a gun falls from her hand. He goes to use the key card at a room door and gently pushes on his earpiece. In the crowd, Sam fiddles with his phone as he walks, and a receiver bleeps in a high window, with a rifle rotating on a motorized tripod. The view from the sight is relayed to Sam's phone, and he uses the wand to train the rifle on Ashton's double, tapping the screen as the double steps up to the podium with his arm outstretched. The gun fires, shooting Ashton's double, causing the crowd to disperse, and Taylor squats over Ashton's double. Javier shoots uniformed security guards in the hotel's CCTV control room, unplugs a laptop, and makes a call on his cell phone, while Sam enters the digits into his phone. Javier slips a cartridge into the pistol and removes his beige jacket. Barnes speaks into his radio. Felipe stands at his open locker, caresses a family photograph from the inside of the locker door, then shuts it. Sam approaches a parked ambulance, while Felipe stares at himself in a mirror, with dynamite strapped around his waist. He closes his bellboy's jacket over it and anxiously makes his way into a hotel corridor. Sam loads a pistol and offers it to Veronica, who is dressing herself in a nurse's uniform, and she takes it. Javier's brother, the man from Veronica's phone, sits against a white pillow with gaffer tape over his mouth, and Veronica aims the pistol at him. Sam shoots him, startling Veronica. Javier runs up a stairwell in the hotel and checks his watch, while Felipe crosses the busy hotel lobby. In a garage, Sam taps the screen of his cell phone with a stylus.",
    "300": "Produces two glasses and holds them up, puts the glasses on the table, uncovers the wine, and begins screwing in the corkscrew. Carl comes out of the kitchen carrying the empty warming oven, sets it down, and sees Lisa struggling with the corkscrew. Carl, without looking at the money, puts it in his pocket, picks up the warming oven, and she breaks off with a little laugh and a slight reproachful look at Jeff. She sips her drink, then says, and puts down her glass, sliding along the window seat nearer to him, as the camera closes in. She looks up at him with serious frankness, and Jeff's opinion is a short chuckle. Jeff gives a sigh of relief, exhaling his breath, then looks down toward his legs in thought. She moves away behind him into the kitchen. He holds this attitude for just a moment, then seems to shake off his concern to lift his head and turn his attention to what might be happening in his neighborhood beyond his window. Her apartment is below that of the salesman with the invalid wife, and Jeff's attention is concentrated on an apartment we have not seen before. At the moment, she is putting on her make-up in front of the bedroom mirror, and this belongs to a single woman, about forty years of age, who lives alone. She is quite flat-chested, and the dress hangs unattractively, as if she's preparing to meet someone. Jeff leans forward with increased interest, and behind him, Lisa is laying a cloth over the card table. A nearer view shows a more intimate picture of the woman Jeff is concentrating on, as the camera pans slightly to the woman's living room window. The spinster sweeps into the room, smiling, and a small, candle-lit table is set up with dinner for two. She is thin and unattractive, goes to the door, opens it, and admits an imaginary caller in pantomime, pretends to kiss him lightly, takes his hat, and places it on a chair. Then she shows him to a seat at the table, disappears into an unseen kitchen, and returns with a bottle and two glasses. She sits down, pours two drinks, and lifts her drink in a toast to the imaginary man opposite her. Jeff gives a faint, sympathetic smile and subconsciously raises his glass in response. Without taking his eyes from the scene, Jeff picks up his wineglass and drinks. As he drinks, his eyes move slightly over, and she starts to take a sip, smiling across the table at her imaginary guest. The smile fades from her face as her head drops, and she lowers the glass onto the table.",
    "398": "The movie begins with an outline of a woman, followed by Jude and Maguire sitting in a car parked across the street as they look toward a paper seller. Meanwhile, Fergus pulls furiously at his bindings and then drives off. Exhausted, Fergus collapses back on the bed while Maguire's car circles around once more. Fergus strains and roars from the bed as Maguire observes the brothel door opening and sees the elderly judge coming out. The judge’s car, occupied by his security men, accelerates toward him. Maguire grabs something from a woman's pocket, throws open the door, and runs across the street. As Fergus continues to pull at his bindings, the judge walks toward his car, assisted by his goon holding the door open. Maguire advances with a gun in hand, prompting the goon to see him. Maguire shoots while running, causing the judge to fall. The goon, hit in the arm, draws an Uzi and returns fire. Maguire is hit but continues shooting, while other goons rush from the car, causing mayhem and screaming. Jude steps on her car's pedal and screeches away, leaving Maguire dead. The scene shifts to Dil dressed in a soldier's cricket clothes, appearing like a sweet little boy, as she approaches Fergus in bed and points a gun at his head. She begins to cry, gently places the gun on his chest, and pulls on his bindings to free him. Two police cars, sirens wailing, pass by as Dil's face is close to Fergus's, with the stockings that bound his hands nearly undone. His arm is freed, and he strokes her hair as she shudders with weeping, accompanied by the music of a song playing in the background. Jude enters through the open door, arms extended and holding a gun, prompting Dil to rise from the bed and aim her gun at Jude. Dil fires and hits Jude, who falls and writhes on the floor. As Dil walks closer, Jude reaches for her gun, grabs it, but Dil shoots again like a child playing with a toy, hitting Jude in her gun shoulder. Jude spins one way, her gun the other, leading Fergus to scream. As Jude raises her gun, Dil shoots repeatedly, causing Fergus to scream again from the bed as he rips free his other arm. Dil shoots Jude in the throat, killing her amidst a cover of blood. Dil then turns the gun on Fergus, squeezing the trigger, but she stops and looks at a picture, walks over, and sits in front of it. She places the gun in her mouth, but Fergus gently removes it and sets it on the table. He lifts her by the shoulders and guides her out the door. Fergus returns to the room, passing Jude's body, and looks out the window to see Dil staggering down the street through the gathering crowd.",
    "100": "Lt. Dan pushes Forrest away, and Forrest steps back as Lt. Dan flips back over, then pulls himself back up onto his wheelchair and breathes heavily. An anchorman reports in front of the White House. Forrest looks at the fat man on the bus bench. President Nixon holds the plaque, and Forrest speaks on the phone, then hangs up. President Nixon makes a resignation speech on TV, and the television cuts to a shot of President Nixon standing outside Air Force One with his hands in the peace sign. An officer hands Forrest an envelope and then walks away. Forrest takes his paddle and runs out of the gymnasium. Mrs. Gump walks out of the house and smiles as Forrest walks up to the house, wearing his uniform. Mrs. Gump and Forrest walk into the house, where there are stacks of ping-pong paddles and life-sized cardboard cutouts of Forrest playing ping-pong. Forrest walks up to a shack on the edge of the Bayou as a group of black kids play in the front yard. Bubba's mother, Mrs. Blue, and her other children look at Forrest as he steps over to Bubba's tombstone and pulls out notes from his pocket, then walks along a wooden pier. Forrest pays an old black shrimper a large wad of cash and stands at the grave before steering his shrimping boat. The boat is old and rusty as Forrest unleashes his nets, and his catch of the day drops to the deck, which consists of a bunch of garbage and shells. Forrest picks up one shrimp and pulls a couple of shrimp out of a bucket. The old shrimper begins to walk away, then stops and looks at Forrest as he paints a name on the side of his boat. Disco lights flash, and people dance while a guy asks a girl to dance. Forrest stands at the helm as the boat glides across the water. Drug paraphernalia and a large wad of cash are spread out on a table as a man drops a syringe on the table and reaches over to touch Jenny, who is pale with dark lines under her eyes. Jenny smears some lines of cocaine on a mirror and looks at herself in the mirror, then steps out onto the high-rise balcony and steps up on a table to stand on the edge of the balcony. A busy street lies many stories below as Jenny looks down to the intersection, then slips over the edge. She regains her balance, turns and looks back at the intersection below, and begins to get down from the edge. Jenny grabs a hold of the ledge and carefully climbs down, then sits down on a chair and rocks back and forth as she cries.",
    "1299": "Graham smiles, and the two of them turn back to the silent screen of the television. Merrill's mouth opens a bit, and Graham turns back to the television with his eyes opening. Daylight fills the family room, and he is alone on the couch and alone in the room. He looks to where the television used to be, which is not there, and then moves to his feet and looks around the room. His eyes stop on an extension cord that runs from a wall outlet in the family room, across the front hall, and under a closet door. Graham moves to the door, opens the closet, and sees Merrill looking up. Merrill is seated on a kitchen chair with the television on a roll-away stand crammed in with him. Graham looks at the TV screen, which shows a daylight shot of Mexico City with empty skies above it. Merrill puts a finger on the screen and trails it to the bottom. Graham opens the bathroom door and steps out with wet hair, towel drying it as he moves to his bedroom window. He observes the large, green backyard with a wooden jungle gym, a single tree that shades a picnic table, and corn crops lining the back, golden and brown, six feet high, stretching beyond view. Graham stares at them quietly and listens closely. He walks into the hall and looks into the room where Morgan and Bo are seated on the edge of their bed with tin foil wrapped around their heads like helmets. Graham stares at his children, enters the room, and the children make space for him on the bed where he takes a seat between them. Morgan puts a book on his father's lap, and Graham looks for a picture on the back cover while Morgan closes the book. Graham gazes at his children with foil on their heads as Morgan puts the book on his lap again and opens it. Graham acknowledges with a nod and turns the page to see an illustration of a small, bulbous-headed figure shaking hands with a bearded human. Morgan turns the page, revealing a space ship hovering over a home, shooting laser beams at it, and a picture of a house with three bodies lying dead on the front lawn, two of which are children. The children scream and cling to their father until their screams die down. Graham closes the book as the phone rings again. He gets up, steps out into the hallway, tucks the book under his arm, and picks up the phone. Through the phone, there is sudden scuffling, a chair squealing against the floor, and then the phone disconnects.",
    "860": "He sits, and she looks down as Jeep frowns and his expression hardens. He walks away, causing Charlie's face to crumple and she sobs. Wisps of cloud float past the moon. On the roof, Kyle is with Audrey, who's aiming an assault rifle, but she puts the gun down. Kyle looks away thoughtfully, and Audrey shakes her head and grins broadly. Audrey looks down thoughtfully, while inside, more lights come on and the jukebox whirs into action. On the roof, Kyle and Audrey look out into the darkness as a vehicle speeds along the freeway. Bob walks out from the kitchen. Bob, Jeep, and Charlie go to the window and peer out through the blinds. Audrey and Kyle watch the vehicle, a van, driving between the jumble of cars in front of the diner. Kyle gives Audrey a dark look; then Kyle aims his assault rifle and Audrey aims her pistol at the van as it stops by the pumps. A man gets out of the van and gestures to the occupants, while a child looks out of the window at the man as he grabs a gas nozzle. With his hands pressed against the window, the little boy looks up at Kyle and Audrey. Audrey runs to the side of the roof and looks out, and Kyle looks over as several cars drive out of the darkness towards the diner. Kyle stares down at the man by the van, and the boy bashes on the window. The vehicles close in, and the man drops the gas nozzle and runs to the driver's side as a car side-sweeps him, sending him flying. The car stops, and a punky-looking guy gets out. A van stops, and a rabble spills out. They surround the van, open it, and grab the boy. Kyle shoots the rabble, who surround the boy crouched on the ground. Kyle swings over the wall and jumps down from the front of the diner, running at the rabble, gun blazing. Bob starts to wrench the planks away from the windows, but turns to see Michael aiming his gun at him. Kyle barges through and picks up the boy as the rabble closes in. Kyle picks off a few of them, clutching the boy close to him as he stares out at the possessed. The boy looks at Kyle with black eyes and bites Kyle in the neck. Kyle collapses as Bob kicks a chair over. Audrey comes down from the roof and runs at the possessed, gun blazing, but when she aims at the boy and pulls the trigger, she's out of ammo. The boy stares at her with blood around his mouth. Audrey gets in the van and shuts the door as the possessed clamber on the outside. Charlie turns to Michael, who just stares at her.",
    "53": "DYLE has the large man by both lapels of the raincoat in a last-ditch effort to hold him, but SCOBIE, his face horribly distorted from the strain, continues to inch forward toward the gun. Suddenly, DYLE releases his hold, and with nothing restraining him, SCOBIE lurches forward, tumbling past the gun, his momentum carrying him onto the sloping part of the roof, where he begins sliding down. SCOBIE beats wildly at the slate with his claw, trying to gouge a grip as it slides across the slate, making a hideous scratching sound and causing sparks to fly, until he slides over the edge and disappears. As DYLE watches, hypnotized, there appears to be no sign of SCOBIE, but then the camera zooms in for a tight close shot of SCOBIE's metal hand, gripping the rain gutter at the very edge. Having seen the claw, DYLE rises and walks to the very edge of the level part of the roof, then turns and leaves going down the stairs. DYLE leaves the elevator and goes to his own door, where the MANAGER eyes him coldly. She leads him into her room, then as REGGIE and DYLE enter from his room, she leads him to the bed. She wets the cotton with disinfectant and begins cleaning the wound as he winces. She continues working on his back, cleaning it, then bandaging it while they talk. He goes to the bed and sits as she starts kissing him on the neck, on the chin, on the cheek, then on the mouth. The phone rings, and he tries to talk as she continues kissing him. The phone continues to ring and she continues to kiss him until finally, REGGIE reaches out to the bedstand and takes the phone off the hook. She brings the receiver up to their mouths and mumbles into it while TEX speaks into the phone. She covers the phone and turns to DYLE in alarm as TEX lifts JEAN-LOUIS and puts him down on SCOBIE's other knee. A knock at the door, GIDEON goes to open it as REGGIE and DYLE enter. She sees JEAN-LOUIS and TEX's gun, causing a pause as the three men look at one another unhappily. He takes DYLE's key and gives DYLE his, and GIDEON goes to REGGIE, takes her key and gives her his own. Including TEX, busy going through the bureau, who looks up, then joins GIDEON. GIDEON empties the contents of the bag on the table, then starts examining the various items, opening the wallet, then putting it aside and picking up the letter, removing it from the envelope and reading it. A broad grin from TEX as they continue going through the items from the bag.",
    "8": "They stand there in silence; the atmosphere is charged. He is sexy. She's unnerved--this is happening too fast. She's trying to be seductive as she says this, but she's pretty bad at it. His face is very close to hers. Angela takes a deep breath just before Lester leans in to kiss her cheek, her forehead, her eyelids, her neck. And Lester kisses her on the lips. Carolyn drives, her face resolute. Angela lays back on the couch as Lester moves in over her. He pulls her jeans off and gently brushes his fingers over her legs, then moves up and caresses her face. Ricky and Jane, fully clothed, lie curled up on Jane's bed. She seems disconnected from what's happening. Lester starts unbuttoning Angela's blouse. Lester pulls her blouse open, exposing her breasts. Lester looks down at her, grinning, unable to believe he's actually about to do what he's dreamed of so many times, and then. Lester LAUGHS. Lester looks down at her, his grin fading. Angela lies beneath us, embarrassed and vulnerable. This is not the mythically carnal creature of Lester's fantasies; this is a nervous child. Lester's face falls. He grabs a blanket from the back of the couch and drapes it around her shoulders, covering her nakedness. He smiles and shakes his head. Humiliated, Angela starts to cry. He hugs her, letting her put her head on his shoulder, stroking her hair and rocking her gently. But she keeps crying. The Mercedes pulls onto Robin Hood Trail. CLOSE on Carolyn's eyes, reflected in the REAR-VIEW MIRROR. She turns her head to look out the window: The RED DOOR of the Burnham house stands out, even in the pouring rain. Angela, once again fully clothed, sits at the kitchen counter. She's eating a turkey sandwich. He turns to her and cocks an eyebrow. A long beat, as Lester studies her, then. They just sit there, smiling at each other, then. She crosses off. Lester watches her go, then stands there wondering why he should suddenly feel so content. Something at the edge of the counter catches his eye, and he reaches for. Lester crosses to the kitchen table, where he sits and studies the photo. CLOSE on a framed PHOTOGRAPH as he picks it up: It's the photo we saw earlier of him, Carolyn and Jane, taken several years ago at an amusement park. It's startling how happy they look. He suddenly seems older, more mature. and then he smiles: the deep, satisfied smile of a man who just now understands the punch line of a joke he heard long ago. After a beat, the barrel of a GUN rises up behind his head, aimed at the base of his skull.",
    "590": "Whip squats and looks over the array of spirits; he settles for vodka. Still kneeling, he unscrews the top from the bottle and runs his fingers over the cold surface of the glass, bringing the bottle to his nose. He replaces the cap, then slowly stands up and sets the bottle on top of the fridge, closes the fridge door, and walks away. Whip swoops up the bottle. Charlie exits an elevator carrying three coffees, with Hugh following. Edmonds knocks, and the men look at each other as Hugh checks the time. Bottles lie everywhere, and Whip lies face down in the bathroom, a large blood stain on the toilet. Harling arrives with a bag slung over his shoulder; Hugh jumps back, and Charlie raises his hands as Harling gestures to Edmonds. Hugh clears the table, and Harling sits beside Whip, cutting the coke, while Whip smiles up at Harling with a torn piece of toilet paper, with a spot of blood, hanging over his eye. Hugh fetches the water as Harling prepares the cigarette. Whip drinks while Harling sucks on the cigarette and hands it to Whip, then cuts more lines of coke and snorts a line, offering a hit to Charlie and Hugh. Whip nods and enters the bathroom as Harling puts on his shades. Whip strides out of the room wearing sunglasses, a Band-Aid on his forehead, and dressed in a suit, with Charlie and Hugh following behind him. They enter an elevator with a woman and a little girl who stares at Whip as Hugh hands him a handkerchief. Whip tilts his head back and presses the cloth to his nostril, removes his glasses, and looks at his reflection on the elevator ceiling before lowering his gaze to the little girl. In the hearing room, cell phone footage of the plane crash is played on a large screen, ending as Whip shifts in his seat and sips some water. Ellen presses a remote, rises, walks around the table at the head of the room, and projects an image on two giant screens. Ellen faces Whip in the middle of the room, slips on her glasses, and checks her notes as Whip glances at Hugh and Charlie. The evidence appears on screen as Ellen nods and leafs through a file, and Charlie and Hugh share a glance. Whip gazes at an enlarged photograph of Katerina on the screen, rolls his tongue, and looks briefly at Hugh and Charlie before studying Katerina's smiling face with pressed lips. He takes a sip of water as Ellen nods, and Whip looks firmly at Ellen, his face shiny with perspiration. Whip looks down, his eyes heavy, as Ellen closes her file and slowly walks to her seat.",
    "691": "Hazy morning sunshine washes over the New York skyline as Peter stands on a payphone at his rundown digs. Meanwhile, at her home, Mary Jane is staring at her phone. Mary Jane picks up the phone, but Peter has rung off. Peter spins around and answers the phone. Captain Stacy puts a mugshot down in front of Aunt May, and Peter snatches it up. In a black and white flashback, Peter sees his uncle sitting in his car on a dark street, where Flint taps at the driver's window with a gun. Flint pushes Uncle Ben to the ground as his accomplice runs up, but Flint pushes him away, allowing the accomplice to jump into Uncle Ben's car. Flint shoots Uncle Ben in cold blood, causing a tear to fall from Peter's eye as he imagines the scene, and Uncle Ben slumps to the ground, dead while the accomplice drives away, leaving Flint behind. Peter flings the photo of Flint down on the desk. Later in his rundown digs, Peter taps his finger and broods as the radio fires up. Peter wrenches up the door, turns down the volume, and Mary Jane gives him a hurt, angry look, purses her lips, and goes to the door, tugging at it. Peter, his face unmasked and his eyes cold, turns up the radio and stands brooding. Later, he changes into his Spider-Man suit and stares intently at the radio on the chest of radios, beside which are photos of Mary Jane, Uncle Ben, and Aunt May. He leans his head morosely against the doorpost as lighting flashes and he lies on his bed, reliving the attack on his uncle. Something crawls across the floor, causing Peter to stir, raise his head, and then lie back down. The unseen presence glides across the door and onto the bed, casting a tangled black shadow on the wall. In his sleep, Peter sees Uncle Ben looking into his killer's eyes as shiny black tendrils latch onto Peter's hand. Flint shoots Ben, and the tendrils spread up Peter's arm, covering the Spider-Man suit like black ivy smothering a tree. Peter's hands grip the sheet convulsively as the alien growth spreads down his torso, and in his dream, Peter pushes Flint's accomplice out the window. The tendrils cover his face and his eyes open in horror. Peter, now with his Spider-Man suit completely black, hangs upside down from a skyscraper, looking at his reflection in a dark-mirrored window. He drops onto his feet on a ledge, takes a close look at his reflection, and clenches his fingers. He flips up the side of the building and leaps into the air, swinging from a thread, sweeping low between the line of cars and up to a high roof adorned with lanterns. He clings to one huge lantern, looks out over the city, and pulls off his black hood.",
    "1178": "Visitors scatter in all directions as the huge snake slithers along the floor and escapes to freedom out of the door of the Reptile House. Dripping wet, Dudley scrambles to his feet, but the glass window has reappeared, trapping him in the snake house. He bangs desperately on the glass as his mother screams with horror, and Uncle Vernon spots Harry laughing, glaring at him suspiciously. Back at 4 Privet Drive, Vernon grabs Harry by the hair and locks him into the cupboard under the stairs. A tawny owl flies low over Privet Drive and drops a letter, and inside Number 4, Harry picks up the post from the doormat—two letters and a postcard. One of the letters is sealed with wax, and Harry's eyes widen with surprise as he reads the address written in emerald green ink. As he walks slowly into the kitchen, still staring at the envelope, Dudley snatches the letter out of his hand. Uncle Vernon turns the letter over and looks at the coat of arms on the back, staring at his wife with horror, while Harry looks confused. An owl drops another letter, which flies into the letter box at Number 4, and the big bird joins two more perched on the TV aerial. Uncle Vernon tears up three identical letters addressed to Harry, and Harry peeps out of his cupboard and sees his uncle blocking up the letter box. Aunt Petunia sees Uncle Vernon off to work and stares at the owls perched on the car roof rack. She touches his arm as five more letters lie on the path at their feet. Inside the house, Harry watches helplessly as his uncle burns the envelopes one by one, Vernon smiling at him sadistically as he pokes the fire and the flames turn the letters to ashes. Harry hands round a plate of biscuits as Vernon relaxes in his armchair, then peers through the net curtains, where hundreds of owls are perched on the rooftops and cars in Privet Drive. A letter shoots down the chimney and flies past his nose, and Vernon blinks with surprise, then covers his ears as a rushing wind seems to fill the room. Suddenly, a flurry of letters cascades down the chimney and out into the sitting room, terrifying Dudley, who jumps onto his mother's lap. Harry chortles with glee as even more letters hurtle down the chimney, and like a snowstorm, the envelopes cover the carpet and spread around the room above their heads. Harry captures a letter and makes a dash for the cupboard under the stairs, but Uncle Vernon grabs him around the waist. Dudley and his mother escape into the hall, where more letters burst through the letterbox, and they stare at Vernon in horror.",
    "1140": "A metallic shield with the letters WB moves slowly forward out of darkness. A heap of skulls and bones is piled high behind iron railings. From the grinning mouth of a skull emerges the head of a large snake. Flickering its tongue, it slithers down onto a narrow path and moves silently between the gravestones in a dark and overgrown cemetery. The reptile's lithe body shimmers as it glides swiftly along the uneven path. The snake slides past a stone statue of a skeleton with huge wings, draped in a hooded cloak and holding a scythe. Metallic silver letters appear in the dark, glowering sky. A huge dilapidated house stands silhouetted against the night sky. A light is switched on in a cottage nearby. A disheveled old man lights the gas and puts on a kettle. He takes the top off a teapot, and picks up a tea bag. Through the kitchen window, he notices a light in the big house. He throws down the tea bag angrily and takes a bunch of keys from a hook, and leaves the cottage, lighting his way with a large torch. He stumbles across the uneven ground towards the big house. He hauls himself unsteadily up the stone steps to the large wooden door. Inside the house, the strong beam of the old man's torch flickers over dusty wooden paneling and a grandfather clock festooned with cobwebs. Grasping the wooden banister, he starts to climb the un-carpeted stairs, his torch casting eerie shadows over the paneled walls. He turns off his torch as he hears voices from an open doorway. The snake appears and slithers through the doorway towards a figure hidden in an armchair. The old man is engulfed in a flash of green light. In the cottage, the kettle boils. Harry jerks awake. Ron flops back onto his pillow. Mr. Weasley leads his group through a wood. A boy drops down. They climb a grassy slope. The faint glow of dawn appears in the sky. They all touch the boot which begins to spin like a Catherine wheel. They are pulled with it, spinning faster and faster, into a bright light. Ginny, Hermione, Ron, Harry, and the twins let go and land heavily. Harry looks up and sees Mr. Diggory, Cedric, and Mr. Weasley hiking sedately down to Earth. Cedric helps Harry up. They follow the others along a cliff top overlooking the sea. The sun rises as they look down on a gigantic campsite. Jugglers entertain the crowd as even more tents are erected. People on broomsticks fly dangerously low. Mr. Weasley leads them to a shabby two-man tent. Harry gawks. Inside the tiny tent, he sees a vast interior furnished with carpets, beds, and sofas.",
    "201": "Clarence, the angel whose voice has been heard from Heaven, is in the water, and George is seated before a wood-burning stove with his clothes drying on a line. He is wearing his long winter underwear, sipping a mug of hot coffee while staring at the stove, feeling cold, gloomy, and drunk, and ignoring Clarence and the tollkeeper as he remains preoccupied by his near-suicide and unsolved problems. George's underwear is a ludicrous seventeenth-century garment resembling a baby's nightshirt with embroidered cuffs and a collar, gathered at the neck with a drawstring. Clarence stands on the other side of the stove, putting on his undershirt, while the tollkeeper sits against the wall, eyeing them suspiciously. The tollkeeper becomes amazed by Clarence's garment, which falls below his knees, and shakes a book. The tollkeeper stares incredulously at Clarence, while George looks up, surprised. Throughout the scene, George is about to spit but is stopped each time by something amazing Clarence does or says. The tollkeeper, also about to spit, is stopped by Clarence's remarks and leans forward to spit again but is halted by Clarence's next statement, which causes George and the tollkeeper to react. George casually looks at the strange, smiling little man again and the tollkeeper becomes increasingly nervous. George, who has been leaning against the wall and tipped back on two legs, touches his mouth while the tollkeeper's chair slips out from under him with a crash. The tollkeeper rises and warily exits the door, looking as though he will call the nearest cop. George rubs his head to clear his mind and looks up at Clarence beside him. Clarence does not make much progress with George and glances up, pacing thoughtfully across the room. As Clarence speaks, the snow outside stops falling, and a strong wind blows open the shack door, prompting Clarence to run and close it. George notices Clarence speaking and cocks his head curiously towards his deaf ear, more interested in his hearing than what Clarence says. George feels his ear as Clarence talks and indicates his bad ear. He feels his lip, which shows no sign of the recent cut from Welch and is now thoroughly confused. George feels the clothes on the line, and they start dressing. George interrupts himself, and they reach the same empty street where George’s car had swerved into the tree near the sidewalk. As George and Clarence approach the spot where George had left his car smashed against the tree, George looks around to find his car missing and the tree undamaged.",
    "1262": "The rippling waters of Hogwarts' lake are surrounded by dark mountains, and on the far side, a white marble tomb on a tiny island has a large marble block that slides back as two supports beneath it tumble away. Dark Lord Voldemort leans down into the tomb, gazes at the black Elder Wand in his hand, and thrusts up his arm, causing a massive force of energy to shoot from the tip of the wand, illuminating the dark sky. Hovering Dementors, with trailing, tattered black robes, encircle Hogwarts as Severus Snape, in a black tunic and gown, stands in an upper archway gazing out at the mountains shrouded in mist. Subdued students in regimented ranks stride across the courtyard, and Snape watches them with a somber expression. The inscription on the gravestone reads while Harry Potter kneels at the foot of the grave, looking into a piece of broken mirror, where he sees himself reflected, then a face other than his own. The grave stands amongst sand dunes behind a small house, and Shell cottage faces a white beach with a sea beyond. Inside, Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley sit in the lounge of the cottage, which is the home of Ron's brother, Bill, and sister-in-law Fleur. Luna Lovegood saunters up to a set of hanging chimes while Bill is in the kitchen, glancing at Fleur as Luna looks at the chimes. Harry strides in and faces Bill as Griphook, who has pointed ears and a long beaky nose, sits in an armchair with his hands clasped together and eyes closed. Bill shows Harry, Hermione, and Ron into the goblin's room, where Griphook, hands still clasped, stares ahead with his mouth firmly closed. Harry crosses to the window and looks out as the goblin grips the arms of the chair, his long filthy pointed nails visible before he clasps his hands again, staring at Harry. Harry looks at the sword of Gryffindor leaning against the wall while Griphook sits back in his chair, takes a deep breath, and again clasps his hands together as his eyes flick to the sword. He points at it, and Harry looks back at the sword. Downstairs in the kitchen, as Hermione, Ron, and Harry come out of the goblin's room, they stop on the landing, and Fleur shows them into a room where the old wand maker sits by a window, looking up at Harry. He hands a curved wand to Ollivander, who examines it closely as Harry passes him a plain, straight wand. Ollivander raises the wand tip to his left ear, turns it in his fingers, and gives the wand back to Harry. The old man leans forward, Ollivander looks away, eases back a little, his eyes widening as he stares solemnly at Harry. Harry gets up, and they leave as Hermione holds a long strand of curling, black hair.",
    "978": "Daisy toils backwards into her partner's arms, her feet leaving the floor as she is swept into an effortless turn. Daisy strikes an elegant pose, then turns to the audience and cranes a swan-like neck. She skips into her partner's arms, and he holds her above him with her knees bent and toes pointed. He lowers her as he turns, affecting the motion of a helter-skelter. Benjamin watches unblinkingly as they part, holding each other's gaze, only to embrace again in a capricious dance of attraction and repulsion. Backstage, Benjamin approaches a man with a clipboard and follows him through the corridor crowd, waiting by her dressing room door. Daisy steps out in her underwear, sees him, and hastily wraps a robe around herself. She turns to him, smiles, and regards the bouquet of white daisies he's given her. He lowers his eyes, and beaming, she retreats into the dressing room. Benjamin turns with a look of disappointment. He and Daisy step out of the lift and cross the dimly lit party where people dance and drink. Benjamin looks timid as Daisy offers a smile when a handsome dark-haired young man embraces her from behind. Smiling broadly, Daisy trots off, and David and Benjamin watch as a guy takes Daisy's coat. She dances playfully with him as David makes a beeline for the dance floor where Daisy talks with a middle-aged woman and an elderly man. Benjamin watches solemnly as David snatches her away and dances closely with her, toiling her around. They share a lingering kiss, parting when Daisy starts talking, only to be swept away in mid-sentence by another man. Benjamin stops slowly towards the lift as Daisy dances between two guys. With an arm around David, Daisy looks up to see Benjamin leave. Benjamin pulls on his coat, steps out onto the street, and strides away. Daisy canters out after him as a yellow taxi pulls up with David waiting by it. Daisy turns to Benjamin, shrugs slightly, and he blinks. She turns away, shakes her head as Benjamin remains uncomprehending, and goes to the taxi. Benjamin walks away hat in hand as the taxi drives off in the other direction. At the hospital, Caroline looks at the theater flyer and takes a manila envelope from Daisy's bag, which contains photos of Daisy as a young dancer. Light snowfall occurs as Daisy and the young man stroll through Moscow, and later, Daisy lies in bed with the young man. Caroline reads while Benjamin, wearing a brown leather jacket and dark glasses, cruises along a tree-lined road on a cherry red motorcycle. He is seen stripping paint from the porch of a retirement home, and wearing white overalls and a cap, Benjamin nods soberly and descends a stepladder.",
    "669": "As he enters, she rises, crosses over to him, and throws her arms around his neck. Standing by the front door, he hugs her tight. At Quest Proving Grounds, bunker six, a car draws up, and General Slocum emerges from it. The two men move into the bunker, and the exoskeleton is powered up. Captain Curtis stands upright inside the 10-foot-tall rocket as it lifts off. A green fireball flies towards the bunker, resulting in total destruction. At the graduation, Peter's classes photograph, and Harry turns to his father. Father and son shake hands, as Peter, in his mortarboard and gown, stands awkwardly. They spot MJ with Flash and part. Peter nods his head stiffly and manages a weak smile. Later, he and Aunt May arrive home, with Peter in a suit, shirt, and tie, and Aunt May in a floral suit, hat, and carrying her gloves. Peter turns and charges sturdily up the stairs to his room, while Aunt May takes a few paces forward, her head tilted to one side, and watches with a sad and witty face until he disappears. That night, he's sitting up in his bedroom, his tie loosened a little but still on, with tears rolling slowly down his cheeks as he gazes distantly ahead. Aunt May, in her dressing gown, comes to the doorway and softly comes in, sitting down next to her nephew on the bed with her hands on her lap. He acknowledges her presence with a hint of a smile as she leans close to him, placing her hands on his shoulders. He smiles, and Aunt May rises, puts her right hand on his left shoulder, gently squeezes it, and goes. Peter sits deep in thought, then a sparkle comes into his eyes. Inside a small case is a sweatshirt with a spider and web motif, and underneath it is a sketchpad with the original snug-fitting Spider-Man outfit: blue body stocking, a hooded mask, red and black checked shoulder pants, and the chest, with a large black spider in the center. The New York City streets host a delicatessen run by an Oriental couple who are being held up. As two robbers make their escape, Spider-Man swoops down on them, returns the stolen money, and thrusts the two robbers up on a giant spider's web. A girl is being robbed at gunpoint, and then the front page of the Daily Bugle is shown. MJ, in a waitress outfit, walks out of the Moon Dance Diner, putting on her coat, as Peter is on the sidewalk and senses her presence. He turns, chases after her, and they look awkwardly at each other as Enrique heads back to the diner. MJ opens her coat to let Peter see her uniform.",
    "1088": "More cannonballs explode the Bielski lines, claiming more victims. Asael fires his gun blind, the smoke obscuring his vision. Tuvia tosses a bag at Malvin and hares away across the field, his physical and mental strength restored. The two of them dive into thick woodland, moving behind the enemy lines, with a view of the German soldiers and their tank ahead of them. They crouch down as half a dozen Germans come past and set up a gun position in front of them. With murder in his eyes, Tuvia cocks his machine gun and steps forward, gunning down every single man. Tuvia appropriates the German gun, takes up a position in the undergrowth behind the German line, and fires on the troops who are facing away from them, killing a number of them. The Germans regroup. The heavy tank gun is slowly turned in Tuvia and Malvin's direction. As the black mouth of the big gun moves near, Tuvia leaps out of the way and dives behind a tree. A tank fires into the undergrowth behind him. More Germans zip across the field and take up positions just yards away from them. Shells explode to the right and left of Tuvia, but miss their mark. Malbin is cowering behind a nearby tree. The tank gun fires again, showering them both with gunpowder and debris. Malbin prepares an explosive. With gritted teeth, Malbin urges from behind the tree and runs at the tank, but is shot. The missile explodes around him. The helmeted Germans fire in Tuvia's direction. Shells ricochet off the trees around him. One soldier creeps nearer, but is shot in the back. His fellow troops look behind them for a split second as guns fire at them from behind a wall of trees. Zus comes surging out of the trees, single-handedly decimating the Germans caught off guard. The rest of his men follow him out of the trees and set about the rest. As the tank operator fires again, Zus clambers up onto the tank and draws his pistol. The tank operator flops to one side. Zus drops a grenade into the tank. His men spread across the field in alarmed marching in step and fire on the remaining Germans. With not one left standing, Zus gets to his feet on the side of the tank, his eyes anxiously searching the trees. His men go through the dead soldiers' pockets. Tuvia emerges from out of the hazy smoke, his piercing blue eyes darting from side to side. The Bielski Otriad, lying on the side of the hill with their guns at the ready, raise their heads. Slowly, they begin to scramble to their feet and walk to the top of the sunny slope.",
    "227": "He turns to see an extremely pretty young woman gazing adoringly at him while they are jostled and shoved, and his eyes light up. Jurek pushes in beside them and takes her arm, pulling Dorota as he fights his way down the stairs, and he too is carried with the flow into the lobby where debris is everywhere. Szpilman fights to get to the main door when another bomb explodes, filling the air with dust and debris, obscuring him and everyone else. The Szpilman family is in panic, coming and going out of rooms, packing clothes and belongings into open suitcases and a trunk in a comfortable, tastefully furnished bourgeois apartment, the living room lined with books, paintings, and boasting a boudoir grand, silver platters, and candlesticks. Szpilman sits by the radio set, ear to the speaker, trying to tune to a station, while Father, holding a silver-framed photograph, crosses to Mother. He goes into his room as she can barely control her tears and hurries into the kitchen just as the front door opens and Szpilman enters, looking around bemused by the activity. Mother dashes out of the kitchen and starts to look as the others continue to bustle and pack. They gather round, and Henryk hits the set. Father pours liqueur into glasses, and the family is seated around the dining table, having just finished a meal, the table groaning with the remains. They all clink glasses and drink. A column of German soldiers, led by an officer on horseback, marches into view. On the sidewalk of the street, with its buildings in ruins and smoke still rising, stand onlookers, including Szpilman and Henryk, with Father craning to see. They watch expressionless as the Germans march past. Regina is opening and closing the window, examining the frame with her fingers, while at the other end, Father sits counting a small stack of notes and coins. Henryk is deep in thought, and Szpilman is fiddling with his father's violin. The apartment has less furniture now and the silver is gone. They all look at the table: it's covered in stains, and the veneer is coming away at one end until it snaps, revealing bare wood beneath. They start to hide the things. Szpilman is on the public telephone, waiting for someone to answer his call. Szpilman and Dorota stroll along a tree-lined street with bombed-out buildings and rubble. She flicks admiring, almost loving glances at him as they walk and talk, and he is smiling, touched by her. She's embarrassed and begins to laugh, and they become almost helpless, holding on to each other. Amidst their laughter, he takes her hand and kisses it. The family is gathered around the table, listening to Father reading from the newspaper.",
    "161": "The camera sweeps over the crowd, past the loudspeakers on their poles. We see surly knots of belligerent rowdies, mostly young, but not all, hanging on the fringes as we move over the heads of the mass of listening people to a platform where Nehru speaks. Azad, Suhrawardy, and others sit on the floor behind him. Featuring the Muslim leader Suhrawardy, leaning against a wall, watching an action out of shot with evident tension. There are five men facing Gandhi. They wear black trousers and black knit vests. There are thongs around their arms that make their bulging muscles seem even more powerful. Their clothes are dirty -- and they are too -- but they are laying knives and guns at Gandhi's feet. Mirabehn, Azad, Pyarelal, the doctor and others on the roof watch fascinated, a little frightened. Gandhi is looking at him, testing, not giving or accepting anything that is mere gesture. The Goondas stand. They glance at Suhrawardy; he smiles tautly and they start to leave, but one (Nahari) lingers. Suddenly he moves violently toward Gandhi, taking a flat piece of Indian bread (chapati) from his trousers and tossing it forcefully on Gandhi. Mirabehn and Azad start to move toward him -- the man looks immensely strong and immensely unstable. But Gandhi holds up a shaking hand, stopping them. Nahari's face is knotted in emotion, half anger, half almost a child's fear -- but there is a wild menace in that instability. Gandhi stares at him, breathless. It is as though the man has told him of some terrible self-inflicted wound. Almost reflexively he holds his hand out to indicate the height of his son. He glares at Suhrawardy and then back at Gandhi. He is sobbing, but in his anger it seems almost as though he means to kill Gandhi in retaliation. A long moment, as Gandhi meets his pain and wrath. Nahari sneers, but there is just a flicker of desperate curiosity. He raises his hand to the height Nahari has indicated as his son's. Nahari has listened. His face almost cracks -- it is a chink of light, but it does not illumine his darkness. And now the light falls on Nahari. His face stiffens, he swallows, fighting any show of emotion; then he turns to go. But he takes only a step and he turns back, going to his knees, the sobs breaking again and again from his heaving body as he holds his head to Gandhi's feet in the traditional greeting of Hindu son to Hindu father. A second, and Gandhi reaches out and touches the top of his head. Trucks with riot squads (shields and truncheons) in place, but they are lounging, waiting.",
    "741": "In her mind's eye, she sees Constantine sitting on the front steps, plaiting Skeeter's hair when she was a little girl, and she smiles at the memory. On a rainy street corner, Miss Stein puts two piles of slim hardbacks with pale blue covers into the window of a bookshop. Minnie, frying chicken, opens her envelope of money, slips it into the front of her dress, and runs out, leaving the chicken to burn. At the retirement home, Mrs. Walters is reading to some of the residents from the book and turns the page with a glib smile. Later, she's on the phone to her daughter. Aibileen and Minnie are pushing trolleys in a supermarket; Aibileen steps to one side to let a white lady pass, but coming to the end of an aisle, her eyes widen, and she hastily steps backwards. Minnie sees her as well and presses herself against the aisle. They both steel themselves to walk past, but the beefy woman is utterly engrossed. At Skeeter's house, Stuart comes striding out onto the porch with a face like thunder, turns on his heel, and marches off towards his Jeep, leaving Skeeter looking bemused and tearful. She takes two copies. At home, Charlotte is sitting up in bed next to her sleeping husband, reading the book. Sinking down into her pillow, she takes off her specs with an appalled look on her face. Elizabeth, sitting in a rocking chair, is reading it as she bottle-feeds her baby. Yule Mae is reading to her prison inmates. Hilly's reading it in bed; later, she sifts through her post, opens an envelope, and finds a note from Celia Foote. She smirks as she unfolds the enclosed check, tears it into tiny pieces, and storms out of the house. Steaming along a straight dirt road between two green fields, kicking up a storm of dust, she sits at the wheel of the Ford Fairlane station wagon, her lips curling. She glugs back some beer, spilling some over her blouse, swerves the car, glugs down the rest, puffs on a cigarette, and throws the empty bottle into the backseat. Skeeter receives a letter from Elaine Stein offering her a job as a junior editor at Harper & Row Publishers. Hilly arrives in front of Skeeter's house in a storm of dust and marches towards the front door like an angry chicken, hurls a pebble at Skeeter, a cold sore. Charlotte, looking elegant in a tight-fitting turban, smiles loftily at Hilly, and she and Skeeter can barely keep a straight face. Charlotte gropes for Skeeter's hand as they come into the spacious parquet floored hall, with Charlotte suddenly looking very tired.",
    "314": "Evan stares dumbstruck at the machine while Mr. Miller puts the camera on a tripod in the basement. Kayleigh and Evan sit on folding chairs in front of the camera as Tommy stands at the top of the basement stairs, looking down. Mr. Miller lowers his voice and speaks to Evan and Kayleigh, then gets behind the lens. Someone silently opens the door at the top of the basement stairs and watches with horror. Mr. Miller walks behind Kayleigh and cups his hands tightly around her ears, so she can't hear anything now. Evan leans over to whisper in Kayleigh's ear. Kayleigh stares at the floor, then looks up at her father and shivers. Evan whips around to see Kayleigh watching him, causing him to lurch back from the shock and fall to the floor. She sees Evan's nose bleed, and her eyes go wide. Evan, still stunned, can do little but stare from the floor. He stands in the middle of her bedroom, surrounded by sorority plaques and pink preppy decor, hardly able to take his eyes off her as she hands him a tissue. He reaches for his clothes at the foot of the bed and comes up with a Greek-lettered fraternity sweatshirt and brown suede jacket, then frowns with distaste, grabs a towel, and heads out. At the sink, Evan washes the blood off his face and looks at his reflection in the mirror. Evan turns around and sees Gwen, one of the sorority brats from the bar, exit the shower naked; she pats his ass and exits the bathroom. Kayleigh, wearing a long skirt and tight red sweater, catches the eye of every guy on campus as she and Evan stroll arm in arm through the quad. Many students wave to Evan and call his name. Kayleigh gives him a big unexpected kiss and walks away. After a moment of wow, Evan runs off to class himself. Evan inserts his last quarter into the lobby pay phone and dials a telephone number. He hangs up the phone, then checks his watch. At that moment, Thumper passes Evan in the lobby, walks away, leaving Evan dumbfounded. Evan runs into the lecture hall and gets in line behind other students who are taking No. 2 pencils from a box on Professor Carter's desk, then he walks up the aisle and takes a seat. As he sits down, someone puts their arm menacingly around Evan's throat. Evan flinches, turns around, and sees Hunter, the frat guy Thumper assaulted the other night at Dirty Hank's bar. Hunter surreptitiously hands Evan a cheat-sheet to the exam. Evan nods and smiles as exams are passed down his row. Finally, Evan and Kayleigh have just finished having sex.",
    "887": "Lizzie is sitting on Jane's sickbed and gently strokes her sleeping sister's face. Jane slowly opens her eyes and looks weakly at Lizzie, who gives her a hopeful smile. In the dining room, Miss Bingley's good humor fades, and someone stalks across the room as Lizzie is shown in. Two spaniels frighten pheasants from a bush as Lizzie watches the shooting party from Jane's bedroom window. She turns to look at her pale sister, who smiles weakly up at her, and Lizzie smiles back tearfully. The hunting party makes its way back to Netherfield Hall under a twilight sky. Lizzie turns away from a mirror, wearing a white silk gown, and the sisters smile at each other. Lizzie then walks down a staircase, looks around uncertainly, and is startled by a footman. She smiles gratefully, looks around nervously, unsure of where the drawing room is, and walks into a dark corridor. She enters the billiard room where Darcy is playing alone, and he swiftly bows to her. Hesitating in the doorway for a moment, she hurries out, while Darcy looks after her thoughtfully before continuing his game. Later, Lizzie is reading a book in the drawing room. Darcy glances at the card game in progress, then crosses over to Lizzie and takes a seat at a desk while eyebrows are raised. Darcy realizes he is being spoken to, and Lizzie smiles as he holds her in a steady, thoughtful gaze. Mrs. Bennet is being driven in a carriage as Lydia and Kitty excitedly poke their heads out of the window to see the grand red brick facade of Netherfield Hall. Mrs. Bennet and the girls are shown in. Meanwhile, Darcy walks away, and Mr. Bingley glares at his sniggering sisters before Lizzie takes a seat. Bingley glances over at Darcy, and Lizzie closes her eyes in embarrassment. Darcy is then seen washing in a copper bath as a servant enters and pours a large jug of water over his head and back. Darcy flicks water from his hair, leans back on towels against the high end of the bath, leaves himself out of the bath, and into a dressing gown held open for him by a servant. He wraps the robe around himself and crosses to the window, where he sees Lizzie in the garden below. She is playing with a dog, trying to wrestle a stick from its mouth. Standing at the window, Darcy watches her every move. Meanwhile, Mr. Hurst is fast asleep in a chair while Mrs. Hurst is also seated.",
    "820": "Bernie backs out of the driveway and speeds along the road, gripping the steering wheel, while Jessica follows him, honking the horn desperately and running a red light. In the back garden, Molly hands her a glass of champagne, and there's a Crazy Golf windmill. Bernie floors Cal, and Jacob pulls Bernie off Cal, but Bernie punches Jacob, wrenches the sails off the windmill, and drops them. All four guys wrestle and struggle, tangled together, then fall. They sit on a wall side by side, David with an icepack on his cheek, as police officers arrive and then head off. Jacob laughs, and David and Bernie turn to look at Cal before the police officers leave. Emily takes a big sigh, and Hannah and Jessica stare at the ground. Bernie gets up, followed by Jessica who scurries after him, nervously running her fingers through her ponytail, as Robbie watches them go. He gets up and jogs around the corner after them, but then stops. Bernie limps slightly as they reach the end of the driveway, and Jessica glances back at Robbie, looking ashamed. Robbie turns away and shuffles back dejectedly, while the other three men remain sitting on the wall. Cal stands, Emily smiles bitterly while shaking her head, and Hannah frowns, her eyes filled with hurt. Emily gawks at Cal, and Hannah gives Jacob a small nod before he gets up. She wanders away, followed by Jacob, as Emily glares at Cal, and Molly comes out. Hannah and Jacob leave, and Robbie lets his head drop forward. With his brow furrowed, Cal looks down at the ground, and Emily eyes him angrily with her jaw clenched. Cal heads off, while Emily folds her arms. Cal approaches Robbie, who leans against the wall of the house. Cal smiles, nods, and leaves. Molly sits down on the garden steps, putting her head in her hand, as Cal lumbers down the driveway. At school, kids mill past Robbie, who sits alone on the stairs with his head bowed, and he presses Jessica's name on his phone's contact list. In her bedroom, Jessica lounges on her bed, staring into the distance. In Jacob's apartment, Hannah and Jacob are together, as Jacob holds out the phone to Hannah. Emily is at her desk in her office, writing, looking up and pouting sadly. At school, students pour out of the building, and Cal stands outside by his car, spotting Robbie, but Robbie eyes him balefully and walks off in another direction. Cal sits at the counter of a bar, his head resting on his hands, hunched with his head hung. He raises his head as Jacob sits next to him and scans the bar. The bartender sells Cal a shot and shrugs at Jacob. Cal and Jacob both stare down at the bar, and Jacob looks away.",
    "326": "Lurtz is leading 200 Uruk-hai out of Isengard as they run fast, their powerful legs carrying them at speed. The Fellowship are in small elven boats, and elves quietly watch them depart. They row away from the Lothlorien shore into the Silverlode river, and in his head, Frodo still hears her voice. Galadriel gives Frodo a small Crystal Phial, and as the Fellowship's boats drift past, Galadriel stands alone, watching from the banks of the river. The boats pass into the great river Anduin, and the three elven boats carry the Fellowship steadily southward. Green trees slowly give way to a brown and withered land, while the Uruk forces run through the trees with deadly purpose. Aragorn watches them with concern. The three elven boats drift slowly through the steep rocky gorge in the pre-dawn light, with Aragorn slowly paddling in the stern. Frodo slowly looks up, his eyes widening with amazement. Aragorn is strangely moved by the beauty of the silent sentinels, and he speaks almost as if to himself. Two enormous rock statues, towering like 300-foot pinnacles on either side of the river, are carved images of Gondorian kings of old. They loom over the boats with power and majesty. The Fellowship stare in stunned silence as the current takes them through the narrow gap between the statues' feet, craning up past the statues' vast crumbling heads to reveal a large lake only a mile downriver. As they leap out of the boats and clamber onto the wooded shore, Legolas turns to Aragorn with urgency. Aragorn looks at Legolas, knowing full well what he means, and Legolas casts a glance around into the Parth Galen forest. Sam has slumped asleep, and Merry dumps a small pile of kindling at Gimli's feet. Sam sits up with a start, and Aragorn's head snaps round, his eyes flying to Boromir's shield which lies abandoned by his camp bed as he realizes Boromir has gone. Frodo is walking beneath the trees, lost in thought. Frodo turns slowly and stares at Boromir, tense and cautious. Boromir has started forward towards Frodo, but he pulls himself up. Frodo steps hurriedly away from Boromir and turns to leave. Boromir leaps on top of Frodo, grasping for the ring, and Frodo has only moments to act. Frodo rips the ring from around his neck and rams it on his finger. Frodo races through the misty twilight world, past the foggy shapes of twisted trees, and somewhere behind him, Boromir's distraught voice carries from another dimension. A mountain of iron, immeasurably strong, the tower of adamant: Barad-dur, fortress of Sauron. Frodo suddenly finds himself on the stone steps and clambers up the stairs onto a high seat, perched on four stone pillars. Frodo cowers on the seat, like a lost child upon the throne of mountain kings, as the world of mist swirls around him.",
    "1149": "Through a bright gap in the clouds, a huge coach appears, drawn by seven winged white horses, and students crowd into the school cloisters, gazing up in excitement as it swoops down toward them. Hagrid guides the horses to land and dives for cover as the coach flies low over his head. A tall mast flying a slender pennant emerges from the center of the lake, and a huge golden galleon rises majestically to the surface, with water spilling from its decks. Huge sails are unfurled, and the great ship glides smoothly toward the school. Gasping for breath, Filch, the caretaker, runs down the hall and whispers to Professor Dumbledore before running out again. A troop of elegant girls glide into the hall, dancing in blue silk uniforms that flatter their slim figures, and Ron gawks at the girls as tiny bluebirds flutter around them. Seamus gapes as the headmistress, Madame Maxime, who is over eight feet tall, passes and towers over Professor Dumbledore. The visitors drop a graceful curtsy, and Madame Maxime smiles graciously, her face framed by a huge fur collar, and extends her hand for Dumbledore to reach up and kiss. The Durmstrang students stride dramatically into the hall, wearing Slavic, military-style uniforms, each carrying a long staff, and sparks fly as they spin them round and strike the stone floor. Two of them hurtle forward, somersaulting high into the air as a handsome student with close-cropped hair strides past, whom Ron recognizes as his Quidditch hero. A student blows a ring of fire, and High Master Karkaroff, wearing a long white coat and a Russian hat, greets Dumbledore. A storm rages around Hogwarts as a dark, disheveled figure limps through the rain toward the school, and Hagrid accidentally stabs Professor Flitwick's hand. Dumbledore steps forward as Crouch rises, and a figure limps into the hall amid flashes of lightning from the enchanted ceiling, raising his wand to make the lightning retreat. Ron recognizes Moody, who has a scarred face and a large, protruding false eye fixed to another eye patch that swivels erratically and lingers on Harry, with one foot encased in a metal boot. Moody takes a swig from a hip flask as Mr. Crouch nervously addresses the students while Dumbledore raises his hand towards an ornate, jeweled cabinet that dissolves to reveal an ancient stone goblet with a bright blue flame leaping from its wide mouth, which continues to burn. The Durmstrang galleon strains at its moorings as the blue flame flickers eerily in the great hall. Igor Karkaroff enters cautiously and carefully closes the door behind him as Moody writes on the blackboard and advances, causing Ron to look petrified and Hermione apprehensive. Moody takes a lid from a glass jar, scoops out a spider, produces his wand, and makes the spider grow bigger.",
    "1305": "The side door opens with almost no sound as the hooded figure of David Dunne steps into a narrow laundry room where a very large pile of unopened mail sits in a mound on the clothes dryer, indicating two or three days' worth. David stares out from under his hood at the mess with cabinets left open and the breakfast table being the eeriest thing in the room, frozen with a plate of half-eaten, now moldy eggs at one setting and two bowls of colorful cereal in another. David moves slowly to a door in the kitchen, which is slightly open, shielding his face from the strong smell as he pulls the door open quietly. At the bottom of the basement stairs is a man's body, the same man who answered the door in the flashback, lying partly in shadow, partly in light, with his crumpled tie folded over itself on his still chest. David steps into the unoccupied room, his movements slow and tense, and looks up, following the sound as it moves around above. David moves to the stairs just as someone gets knocked out above, at a point where three closed doors converge on a landing. He opens the closest door, finding a young girl's room adorned with posters of boy bands and clothes strewn everywhere, but the room is empty. In the bathroom, a slightly overweight girl, probably fourteen years old, is tied by her wrists with a phone cord to the metal towel rack, sitting with her arms pointed upward over her head, knees tucked up to her chest, next to her younger brother, a skinny boy, maybe twelve, tied and seated in the same way. Their heads are leaned back against their arms, completely listless, with eyes half-mast, as they watch the door to the bathroom open and David Dunne's dark hooded figure step in, his long dark rain poncho still dripping water. He stands in the doorway for a moment before moving towards them, their arms flopping to their laps as they gaze up at the figure leaning over them, the boy blinking once slowly. David takes a step back and stares at them from under his hood, then stares at the drawing before turning to look at the striking and beautiful African American woman in her sixties who stands next to him. The woman turns and looks at David for the first time as David looks across the store at Elijah talking with the customers, both watching Elijah from across the room as Elijah's mother walks across the store and waits for Elijah to finish talking. David then turns back to the framed sketch.",
    "132": "The officer commanding and the Guard of Honor await him. The young Englishman glances at him quizzically. The General has taken the salute and moves to inspect the troops to the accompaniment of the military band. He is suddenly aware of a well-dressed Indian half-listening to their conversation. He glances at him and the well-dressed Indian simply nods slightly and moves off a little. The second Englishman grimaces at the young Englishman and looks down again. Another far less elaborate gangplank extends from the aft section of the ship. Third Class passengers are disembarking here, and on shore, separated by a wire fence from the rest of the pier. A large crowd of Indians is reacting excitedly to someone coming down the gangplank but we can't yet see that person. The young Englishman glances back cautiously toward the well-dressed Indian again, then. Gandhi is smiling, trying to move on, but answering the questions of an Indian journalist. He speaks with an uncertainty and tentativeness that he had lost in South Africa, patently overwhelmed by the reception. An English journalist catches him as he turns. An exuberant woman puts a garland over his shoulders. An Indian reporter has cornered Ba behind him. She joins her hands, acknowledging a garland placed around her shoulders, and pushes on after Gandhi. Charlie helps to guide her. The young Nehru, somewhat amused by all the excitement, leads Gandhi through the crowd to a little flower-covered platform. We see a banner: THE CONGRESS PARTY. He grins. He has guided Gandhi to the first step of the platform. Another garland is wrapped around Gandhi's shoulders, and in some embarrassment, he mounts the platform. There is a great cheer, but in the silence that follows we hear the military band from across the way as the troops prepare to march off. Gandhi looks around at the crowd. Finally he speaks out. He makes the pranam and starts for the steps. The crowd is a little disappointed, but they manage a cheer and applause. Nehru is standing next to a heavy-set, well-dressed man (Patel). Nehru has slammed the door of a gleaming Rolls Royce touring car, the top down. He has seated Gandhi in it beside Patel, taking Gandhi's knapsack. An Indian chauffeur rides in front. The crowd still surges around and Gandhi is looking apprehensively back for Ba. He grins boyishly, in part to comfort, in part unable to contain his amusement at Gandhi and his evident confusion. With Gandhi still looking back anxiously, the car pulls off. He finally turns to Patel. There are crowds along the street, and Gandhi -- in surprise that they are for him -- waves tentatively. Patel waves too but he eyes Gandhi rather critically.",
    "426": "The balls are already racked and ready as Willie collects their stake money and prepares to toss the coin. Preacher and Big John draw up their chairs around the table, while Bert also takes a seat far away, near the coat rack. Willie taps Fats on the lapel to signal it's his break, and Sausage sends the cue ball down the table to begin the game. Fats makes a good break, leaving the cue ball teetering over the far corner pocket. Eddie looks at the lineup of the balls, then sets down his cue and walks over to the washroom, glancing at Bert as he sprinkles powder on his hands. He turns, snatches up his cue, and rams a bank shot into the pack, pocketing the one ball as the others scatter. The crowd applauds, and Eddie moves swiftly to his next shot, talking to Bert as he plays. Bert and Fats exchange glances as Eddie returns to his game, with Fats waiting for his turn, puffing steadily on his cigarette. Bert shifts uneasily in his chair as we hear the pool balls knock together and roll down the track through the belly of the table. The shot goes in, and Eddie looks significantly at Fats, who lowers his eyes and puffs on his cigarette. The balls are racked again, and Eddie sinks shots right and left—some tricky, some not—prompting uneasy looks between Bert and Fats. Eddie circles the table like a hawk. When it's Fats's turn, he is up, his jacket off and tie pulled loose, but after making a shot and chalking his cue, he misses a hard shot. Eddie moves to take his shot, ignoring Fats, while Bert looks on as Eddie continues to shoot pool, making all his shots quickly and accurately. A depressed Fats watches, as the clock over the door reads six o'clock. Fats remains in his seat with a drink in hand as Eddie slips into his jacket, helped by Preacher. Eddie unscrews his cue thoughtfully, while Bert's bodyguards stand waiting for instruction. Fats listens, head bowed, as Bert's men start to move forward but are stopped by a gesture from Bert, who tries to smile a friendly smile. Eddie puts away his cue, staring at Bert before looking over at the downcast face of Minnesota Fats, who looks up at Eddie. Eddie takes his cue case and heads for the door, pausing for a moment to look around at the rows of empty tables before leaving. Ames then returns to normal as Fats puts on his coat, Henry sweeps up, and Bert takes his seat again on his throne overlooking Ames, sipping his glass of milk.",
    "811": "A fast-moving road is seen under a lowering sky when a flash of lightning strikes a dead tree, causing it to sprout leaves. In a store, teenage girls try on funky shoes while a little girl nearby tries on dull, brown shoes and is giggled at by the long-haired nymphets. Her mom leads her down the street, and she looks awestruck as women try on clothes, observing a woman pay with a credit card. The little girl eventually grows up and enters a similar luxury store, spraying on perfume and hugging a shop assistant, while her colleague, Claire, simpers. Rebecca stares at her credit card bill and holds up the apparently missing card while her friend Suze reads from Rebecca's resume in a washroom. Rebecca, with her long, red hair loose and wearing a stylish tartan cape, comes down a fashionable shopping street and stops in front of the window of Denny and George. Her jaw drops and quivers with excitement at the sight of a green chiffon scarf on a mannequin, prompting her to venture inside and make a deliberate beeline for the scarf. The mannequin speaks to her, and Rebecca crosses to an assistant, tenses, then beams, and produces a second card. She beetles down the street towards a hot dog stand, joining a long queue. The man paying for a hot dog buys her one with a $20 bill and then turns to face her. With the green scarf flowing behind her, she dashes towards a tall, glass-topped building, rides an internal elevator, and totters towards a reception desk carrying an apricot-colored briefcase. A pair of studded, six-inch, killer heels attached to a tall, blonde woman in a black dress with a fur collar approach, and she gives Rebecca a quick once-over, causing Rebecca's bag to spring open while she forces a smile. Alicia smiles loftily at her and sashays away, leaving Rebecca to turn back to the pixie-like receptionist and rip a visitors' card from his hand. In a waiting room, she sits between two women and two men reading broadsheet papers, and the brunette next to her watches her disapprovingly. She then finds herself in the office of the hot-dog Englishman, and, aghast, she pulls off the scarf and throws it under a desk. As he sits down, he recognizes her, and she struggles with the lock on her case while the editor pulls a face, making Rebecca look like a rabbit caught in the headlights. However, the editor merely rests his chin on his hand and looks at her benignly. As she leaves, she collides with a glass partition, wanders along the sun-bleached pavement beneath huge fashion posters on her way back to the office, and encounters an immediate termination notice as both girls stare at the phone.",
    "1316": "Rudolfo the Red Nosed Burro is tended by several Santa's elf mannequins, one dressed in cowboy wear and another in a poncho and sombrero. A line of waiting children is present as Marcus makes his way through, eliciting gasps and cheers from the kids. Playing to the crowd, Marcus takes a bottle from the floor and swigs from it while Marcus stares at him. He then grabs the hat, slams it into Willie's chest, and as Willie rises, kicks him in the ass. On the outskirts of the Saguaro Square Mall's parking lot, a city bus stops with a hiss and the doors open to reveal a pathetic EIGHT-YEAR-OLD KID, overweight, snot-nosed, badly dressed, and probably smelling of pee. As the kid nears the mall entrance, he passes a group of older children doing skateboard stunts, who notice him. Marcus puts another young boy on his lap and then walks over to the rope. The snot-nosed Kid is next in line, frozen by fear, but Marcus's actions penetrate the Kid's fear and he moves. Marcus leads the Kid up to the throne and places him on Willie's lap. The Kid just stares, motionless except for the flowing rivulet of snot, which Willie can't help but stare at. Suddenly, the Kid yanks Willie's beard, holding it stretched below Willie's chin. Willie shoves the Kid, who backs away, looking at him in awe and never breaking his reverent stare. The Kid sits on a bench, watching the entrance to Chamberlain's. After a beat, Willie and Marcus walk out in costume and cross toward the parking lot, with the Kid following from a safe distance. Willie and Marcus walk across the huge empty parking lot, followed at a great distance by the Kid, who creeps closer to hear their conversation. A large faux rustic bar is filled to capacity with loosened-tie middle-management as we follow someone's gaze around the room until it connects with the drunken, glowering face of a Hindustani Troublemaker sitting right across from him, startling Willie for a moment. She pours two drinks, and they both pound them back as she pours. Willie stares at her while the man stares at him for a beat. The Troublemaker stops and looks down to find the Kid beating on his legs, allowing Willie a chance to regain composure. The Kid sits in the front seat next to Willie, who drives while stewing and answering absently, with his head slightly ducked and his eyes darting side to side, checking for road signs. Willie escorts the Kid along a long walkway leading to the front door of a large, opulent, new-money Southwestern home, admiring the surroundings.",
    "211": "The full moon is shining through the trees as George finishes talking and jumps up out of his chair. As he speaks, a man leaves the porch, goes into his house, and slams the door. Mary then runs off the scene, but George, standing on the belt of her bathrobe, inadvertently causes it to come off as she runs. He drops his bundle of clothes and picks up Mary's robe but cannot see her anywhere. We see Mary's face peering out from the leaves as George walks toward the bush, about to throw her the robe when a thought strikes him. Meanwhile, Mary thrashes around in the bushes, and headlights flash into the scene as the old Bailey automobile, driven by Harry with Uncle Billy beside him, drives in. George throws Mary's robe over the bush and gets into the car, and as it drives off, Mary, now wearing the robe, rises from the bush, following the car with her eyes. Subsequently, around a long table, about twelve directors, substantial citizens of Bedford Falls such as Dr. Campbell, a lawyer, an insurance agent, and a real estate salesman, are seated, along with Uncle Billy and George. Dr. Campbell is the Chairman of the Board. Before each director are individual reports for them to study along with folders and papers on which they have been reporting. Henry F. Potter, with his goon beside his wheelchair, is prominently seated among them. Dr. Campbell rises from his seat, and George and Uncle Billy start to collect their papers and leave the table, surprising everyone. George stands at the door of the office, holding his coat and papers, ready to leave, but puts them down, incensed by what Potter is saying about his father, and comes back to the table. George then leaves the room, followed by the jubilant Uncle Billy. Potter's face is grim with hatred as he is interrupted by a babble of talk as the directors argue. George, visibly shaken, busies himself with his bag and papers while Uncle Billy follows him around, chattering and worried about the outcome of the meeting, which might alter his plans regarding dissolving the Building and Loan. Ernie stands in the doorway, and a jubilant Dr. Campbell comes running out. Cousin Eustace, Cousin Tilly, and Uncle Billy cheer wildly as Dr. Campbell and George shake hands. The stars from the opening sequence twinkle once more as voices from Heaven are heard. Meanwhile, a number of people wait for the train, and Uncle Billy is seated on a baggage wagon eating peanuts as George paces up and down in front of him.",
    "99": "A footage of Neil Armstrong's first step on the moon is shown on television, followed by Forrest looking at a man. A large mural of Mao Tse-tung hangs on the wall while Forrest plays ping-pong against a Chinese player as a crowd of communist leaders sit and watch. Dick Cavett stands up to introduce Forrest, who makes his way onto the stage and shakes hands with Cavett. Forrest sits down between John Lennon and Cavett and looks oddly at Lennon, who lights a cigarette. A guard lets Forrest out a side entrance door, and Forrest steps and then stops as he hears a man in a wheelchair speak to him. Forrest looks at Lt. Dan, who is dirty with long hair, as Dan's wheelchair begins to slide down the ramp and spins on the icy ground. Forrest watches as Lt. Dan crashes at the bottom of the ramp. Taxi cabs crowd the street as Forrest pushes Lt. Dan along the sidewalk, with one taxi driver honking as Lt. Dan gets wheeled out in front of it. Another taxi skids to a stop, almost hitting them as they cross the street, and Lt. Dan slaps the bumper of the taxi. A Bob Hope Christmas special in Vietnam plays on television as Lt. Dan and Forrest watch. Lt. Dan chuckles, drinks the rest of a bottle of wine, and tosses it down before looking at Forrest. He wheels himself over to the television and turns it off, picks up another bottle of port wine which is empty, and tosses it onto the floor. Lt. Dan becomes enraged, throws the bottle, and looks at Forrest as a television shows Dick Clark emceeing the Times Square New Year's Eve celebration. Two sleazy women named Lenore and Carla walk up to Lt. Dan. Lenore fixes her makeup and leans to speak into Forrest's ear. The people in the bar cheer, kiss, blow horns, and toss confetti into the air. Forrest looks around as Carla and Lenore lean over and kiss him. Carla removes her top and sits on top of Dan in his wheelchair, and they kiss and play around. Forrest sits in a chair, then Lenore leaps on him and begins to kiss him, reaching down to his crotch. Forrest stands up nervously, causing Lenore to fall to the floor. Lenore stands up, angry, as Lt. Dan throws Carla back onto the bed. Lt. Dan falls out of his wheelchair and lands on the floor as Carla and Lenore laugh and leave the apartment. Forrest tries to help Lt. Dan.",
    "1006": "As she sits for a portrait wearing formal robes of state, the Queen's attention is drawn by television news coverage of Tony Blair, who is dressed in a lounge suit with no jacket, smiling towards a cheering crowd. Crawford continues his oil painting, and the Queen smiles at him while seated for the portrait half in profile, wearing a white embroidered dress and a black velvet cloak ornamented with the star and shield of St. George's Cross. As she turns her head from the artist's formal pose, her expression barely changes. A lone pipo walks along a long colonnade at Buckingham Palace, with the royal standard flag gently ruffling in the gray skies above. The Queen lies in bed in a darkened room as a door opens behind her, and a woman enters to put a newspaper on a bedside table. The Queen looks at the paper. Later, the Queen sits at a desk with some corgis behind her as Robin enters. A black Jaguar car pulls to a stop in the palace courtyard, where a man in black coattails opens the rear door for Tony and Cherie Blair, who sit inside the car. The Blairs are ushered through a vast ornate hall by a man in a naval uniform, who smirks at Tony as he leads them toward an imposing set of closed doors. Cherie takes a seat by the doors as Tony is ushered into the room. The two men bow their heads to the Queen, standing in the middle of the room, and Tony shakes her hand. Tony waits for the Queen to be seated before sitting down opposite her. Cherie and the equerry are perched on chairs either side of the grand doors, and they both stand when Tony kneels at the Queen's gesture. The Queen extends her right hand to Tony, who takes it and kisses it. The Queen gestures for Tony to stand and picks up a small bell, and the equerry reenters with Cherie following behind him. Cherie curtsies before The Queen, who looks down and smiles at her, then Cherie shakes The Queen's hand. The Queen walks over to Robin and also shakes Cherie's and Tony's hands. Tony and Cherie back out of the room awkwardly while the Queen looks them up and down as they depart. On leaving, Tony and Cherie smile at the staff. A photo shows Diana and Dodi lounging, another shows Diana sitting alone on a diving board, and video footage shows Diana getting onto a small jet plane. Numerous television reporters are gathered in front of a hotel opposite an entrance with a revolving door, while a group of men on motorbikes wait by the back door.",
    "819": "Rows of old film studio buildings are reflected in a shiny gold surface. In a restaurant, the feet of a woman in high heels and a man in Brogues are seen under a table, while under other tables, another couple's feet are visible. A woman tentatively slides her foot forward and gently rubs it against a man's. More couples are nuzzling feet under various tables, as their feet slide towards each other magically. A man in running shoes and a woman in high heels sit with their feet far apart, studying their menus; the man, Cal, scratches his eye and glances at the woman, Emily, who is looking at the menu intently, while Cal gawks wide-eyed at her. Emily opens her mouth to speak but falters. Later, a girl in her late teens chases a younger girl through a house; the younger girl, Molly, dives onto a sofa, and the older girl tickles her. Molly knocks down a photo frame, runs off, and the glass cracks. The babysitter, Jessica, picks up the framed photo, examining it; it shows Emily with her arms wrapped around Cal's shoulders as they both smile happily. A wistful smile flickers across Jessica's face, and she gently places her hand over Emily in the photo to just see Cal. Emily and Cal drive back through the night in silence, and Emily glances at Cal awkwardly, opening and closing her mouth several times before speaking; she licks her lips anxiously and looks over at him as he stares ahead, Emily shaking her head. At home, Jessica flaps her hands in disgust, while Robbie, about 13, puts a pillow over his face. In the car, Cal stares ahead with a hard expression as Emily glances over at him, pursing her lips. Cal opens the door and listlessly tumbles from the moving car. Emily screeches to a halt, gets out, and races back to Cal, who sits hunched on the road. She stares at him incredulously and goes to help him up, but he gets up by himself and trudges towards the car. At the house, Jessica tidies the coffee table as Robbie enters, leans in an archway, nods ruefully, and looks upwards with a sigh; Jessica cringes and considers. Two young women are seen in a bar, where Liz looks at Hannah with concern as Hannah sags her shoulders and pouts. A guy in a maroon suit with smart, polished brown leather shoes strides confidently through the bar.",
    "1317": "Grandma rises from her chair with the assistance of her walker and begins to move toward Willie, wearing a bathrobe and thick glasses with another pair of glasses on a chain around her neck, while he watches as the senile old woman innocently putters away. He yanks off his mask and turns to the Kid, who shakes his head. The sound of a tumbler tripping is heard, and suddenly, light sweeps in as the safe door opens to reveal a smiling Willie with his stethoscope in his ears and, in the foreground, a few stacks of cash and a folio. Willie reaches in, grabs the folio, and flips through it. A new Mercedes screeches through the frame, and as it recedes, we are left looking at the Kid, who stands at the curb, waving happily, while Willie and Marcus walk to their cars. Opal looks at him with disdain and reluctantly sidles over. Willie is at a pay phone, and the Kid swings the door open to Willie, who stands on the stoop holding a small grip. The Kid follows Willie like a puppy dog as Willie checks out the house, bumping open doors and looking around. Willie has discovered the master bedroom, which appears long unused, and he tosses his grip onto the double bed. Willie lies in the tub, motionless, with a wet washcloth over his face and the fingers of one hand resting against a tumbler filled with ice and amber liquid that sits on the edge of the tub. From under his washcloth, he drags the washcloth off his face and looks at the Kid, who looks at him unperturbed. She glances in as the person passes, and still chewing, gets out her notebook and jots something down. Willie stares at the board for a long beat, then leaps up screaming and flings the board across the room, while the Kid's face remains unfazed and still smiling. The kid lies in bed, sleeping peacefully as Willie bangs Sue in the Jacuzzi, wearing his Santa hat, while blearily, she gazes back. He closes the door, then tips back the bottle and polishes it off with a series of quick gulps. Ever so daintily, he puts the bottle down, and a beat later -- WHAM! -- he faints dead away, hitting the floor like a felled tree. Willie wakes on the floor to the sound of the scream, a bedroom door crashes open, and the Kid emerges screaming and runs right into Willie, immediately caroms off, and goes screaming down the hall, turning the corner to see a row of fresh, bloody palm-prints down one side of the hall while the Kid, screaming, is just disappearing at the far end.",
    "495": "Malcolm's hand with the tape recorder drops to his side as he stares into the night, standing alone as thoughts crash like thunder in his head. The front door opens, and Lynn carries Cole in, asleep on her shoulder. She carries him down the hall to his bedroom and gently lays him on his bed next to his German Shepherd puppy. Lynn watches the two youngsters sleep for a moment. Cole is curled up asleep with a tiny party hat clutched in his hands. Lynn has been carrying Cole's sweater from over her shoulder, and she pulls it off and begins to fold it. Her attention is drawn to the sweater as she fingers the fabric of the back, discovering it's ripped. Her eyes move to Cole, and in the middle of the back of his T-shirt are three small tears. Lynn pushes the fabric open with her fingers and sees deep fingernail-like scratches on his skin. Lynn looks around helplessly, fear creeping into her eyes, as the house seems threateningly still. An unnatural silence fills each room of the house, and the thermostat on the wall now reads fifty-two degrees. The door opens a crack, and Cole's tiny face peeks out, his eyes scanning the darkness. The door opens a little bit more, and Cole's knees are pressed together as his body dances a little—he has to pee. He moves cautiously into the hall and briskly to a door halfway down the corridor, turning on the light in the bathroom. He checks behind the shower curtain before he turns his back and pees into the toilet. Cole instantly stops peeing, and his body becomes very still as he slowly reaches for the toilet handle and flushes. He closes his pants and turns, just standing there and staring into the darkness of the hall, his breath forming tiny clouds in the cold air. Cole finally steps out into the hallway, and his eyes catch a slant of light now coming from the kitchen. He moves down the hall and turns the corner, coming to a stop in the doorway of the kitchen. Cole stares at the back of a person cooking food on the stove, and his fear slowly fades away. Suddenly, Cole's face turns the color of ash as he backs up to the doorway. The woman smiles menacingly as she thrusts her wrists forward, revealing they've been savagely cut. Cole turns and runs down the hall, across his room, and scurries in, his legs disappearing as the bedsheets flap closed behind him. The crazed woman stands at the end of the hall while Cole is curled up in the tent, the red interior of the tent gets lit up, and the bedsheet walls of the tent are lined with religious pictures taped to the walls.",
    "777": "Wilson puts his hand on Adrian's shoulder, and they hold each other's gaze. Smoke fills the sky above Las Vegas as buildings burn by a deep chasm through town. A light plane approaches McAllen airport as the runway crumbles into the chasm, and they land on a chaotic runway. Twins Alec and Oleg are with Yuri and Tamara by the grounded plane as the mechanic runs off. The fireman forces Yuri to move. A limo pulls up by Air Force One, and Adrian gets out. On board, Anheuser hangs up his cell phone in the busy control room lined with computer equipment and terminals. Adrian enters and stands before Anheuser, who tries to read his expression, as the staff onboard stop what they're doing. Adrian stares forlornly as Anheuser walks off. Air Force One taxis along the runway, and on board, Laura comes out of the president's cabin as a steward approaches. Laura goes into the cabin and picks up the phone. She leans against the wall, and as she sobs, a light goes out behind Wilson. His secretary, Sally, stands in the doorway, and he lowers the phone from his ear. Air Force One takes off, and Wilson sits before a TV camera in the office as the broadcast fades. Everyone turns, and the fireman's face falls as he shuts the glass door, which reflects the fast-approaching ash cloud. Sasha leads Jackson and the others to a cargo plane, an Antonov, and they board. The lights come on in the cargo hold, revealing it is full of gleaming sports cars. Sasha does it for him as the Antonov taxis into position while the ash cloud billows across the airport, engulfing the control tower. The Antonov loses a tire as they approach the runway's damaged end, and the plane drops into the chasm. Onboard, Yuri holds his sons to their seats as Tamara touches Caesar. Two buildings appear ahead, and Gordon pilots them between the buildings. The plane's wide wings narrowly scrape through and they rise. Control shakes their hands as they clear another building, and Gordon gawps as they drive towards a tall tower, taking the tip off with the plane's underside. Jackson pats Noah's hand, and Kate hugs Lilly. In Tibet, Nima and Lama Rinpoche sit together on the balcony of a small monastery overlooking a snow-covered mountain range. Lama Rinpoche looks calmly at Nema and pours out some tea for both of them, filling Nema's cup until it overflows. Nema reaches out to stop him from pouring, and Rinpoche stops. A breeze blows across the balcony, and prayer flags hanging from the eaves of the roof billow. Rinpoche holds something up and tosses it to Nema, who catches it. It is a truck key, and Nema grins at the key, then at Rinpoche.",
    "1336": "Valjean comes out of the church into the graveyard and reaches a bell set on the edge of a promontory. He rips the yellow paper into pieces and throws the pieces out over the valley. We follow the scraps of yellow paper as they dance in the wind, then fall away into the void below. The scraps flutter in the wind. Below lies the steep drop down the mountainside to the dark valley. We follow this and accelerate upwards, leaving Valjean and the town of Digne far below, towards the sun breaking through the heavens with the alps beyond. One scrap of paper dances upwards in the sunlight. The camera then starts to tumble back down through mist and cloud below, through time and space, down to discover ships sitting in low tide on the mud of the estuary along the dockside of the town and red brick factory buildings. The camera hurtles towards three horses riding down a long muddy road on a flat plain towards the walled town of Montreuil-sur-Mer. Montreuil sits on an estuary leading out to the sea. As the riders enter the walled town, we see the poor clustered around the gates, destitute and sick people clammering to get in. Javert sees the destitution of the people, expressionless as ever. The police enter the harbour, and the beggars are pushed back as the gates open and close for the police. The long workspace is full of tables at which conservatively dressed women are working, making jewelry out of shellac, a black resin which looks like jet. The Foreman has stopped beside Fantine, a pretty young woman. As he leans over to whisper in her ear, Fantine, surprised, pricks her finger with her needle. The women start to take off their overalls and pack up their tools for the day. Fantine has taken out a letter. The main factory woman snatches the letter away from Fantine. Fantine tries to get the letter back. The letter is passed surreptitiously down the line of women workers. The main factory woman starts to take Fantine's letter over to the Foreman. The women scuffle. The owner enters the factory floor. Clean-shaven, well-fed, transformed: it's Valjean. Suddenly, Valjean sees Javert appear on the first-floor balcony of his office. His world drops away. On the factory floor, Fantine continues to defend herself to the Foreman, as the women sing. The Foreman pulls Fantine away. Below, Fantine turns and calls to Valjean in his office above with a pitiful cry. Valjean walks back to the stairs up to his office and shows some demonstration samples of their work, throwing a sharp glance.",
    "853": "The man talks to Estevez, then he drops them. He stares at the cops and complies as Estevez steps up to cuff him, but is spun around and used as a shield. Burton convulses and dances on the spot as they shake. Lights flicker, and his eyes are staring with a tight face. Burton shoots Estevez. Michael leaps to the ground, moves over, and shoots Burton with two handguns. Michael places his two guns in the bags, takes them to the police car, and drives off in it. Burton's body lies on the sidewalk. The squad car, identified by the number 1127 on its roof, drives past buildings with lights shutting off as he passes. A guy in his late 20s wakes with a start, looks around, switches on a light, and is on a chair. A small television is to his left. He comes out of a two-door trailer, shuts the door, and in the early morning light, walks away from the big gray trailer, passing under two strings of light bulbs with his hands stuffed in his jacket pockets. The green neon lights of the sign illuminate his features. Jeep turns back to the trailer, and she is pregnant. They sit on the swings facing in opposite directions, Charlie's belly very swollen, and Jeep wears a hangdog expression. He nods, she stares at him out of the corner of her eyes, then looks away. She rises from the swing, walks behind him, resting her hand momentarily on his shoulder before continuing on her way back to the trailer. He remains on the swing and doesn't move as she goes back inside through the second door. Jeep's father, Bob, keeps thumping the TV set inside the Paradise Falls diner and plays with a lighter. His chef is a tall, bald black guy who wears a crucifix and a couple of dog tags around his neck and has a hook for a left hand. A skimpily dressed young woman leans over a jukebox, and a woman at a table with a man stares at her and grunts. The man glances round and makes a move. Bob turns, as does Audrey, and Howard turns to wife Sandra. A guy in an SUV drives along a deserted freeway with a half-smoked cigarette in his mouth, wearing a brown beanie hat, a scarf around his neck, and a casual jacket. It's a sunny morning as he stubs out his cigarette, picks up his cellphone, and looks at it. He sees a sign for Paradise Falls, unfolds a map to study it, then lowers it and sees the diner up ahead. He pulls up in the forecourt and sees Charlie standing by a phone box, smoking a cigarette.",
    "96": "He sets Tex down on the bank of a river and runs back into the jungle. Forrest drops another wounded soldier down at the bank of the river next to Tex and then runs back toward the jungle.

Dan grabs Forrest by the shirt, angry. Forrest gets up and runs as Lt. Dan yells after him. Forrest runs through the jungle searching for Bubba. Forrest slows down and looks around carefully. Bubba looks up as he lies on the ground. Bubba holds a palm frond over his wound. Forrest removes the frond to look at the wound. Bubba's chest has been blown open. Forrest looks around as he hears the voices of the enemy. Forrest carries Bubba through the jungle. The sound of approaching planes fills the air. The roar of approaching planes is deafening. Forrest looks up in fear. Three planes dive down toward the jungle. They fire napalm as the jungle explodes with massive fireballs. Forrest runs, carrying Bubba. The fireballs explode behind him. The entire jungle area is in flames as Forrest runs. Forrest carries Bubba to the bank of the river. Lt. Dan and the other wounded soldiers wait for a rescue helicopter. Forrest looks down at Bubba.

Another nurse wheels the rolling bed under Lt. Dan. The male nurse sets Lt. Dan down on the rolling bed. A soldier reads the names from a pile of letters. Forrest looks up at Lt. Dan as he is wheeled away. The soldier hands Forrest a large pile of letters. Forrest looks down at the pile of letters.",
    "375": "He's not just handsome, not just charming, as if all the forces of the natural world had conspired to create him. Suddenly, this Edward thrusts both hands into the water, grabbing hold of a catfish and bringing it up to his face, looking it right in the eye. After a beat, the Beast spits out Edward's gold ring. Over the sound of rain, a phone rings on a chair, and by the tone, it is clear we're not in the U.S. -- it has that insistent European sound. As it keeps ringing, the mostly empty apartment is seen, with just a few half-unpacked boxes and a cradle still in its carton. Keys are in the lock, followed by laughter in the hallway as the door swings open to reveal a drenched Will, carrying four sacks of groceries with collapsing bottoms from the rain. His wife Josephine pushes past him to get the phone and hands it to Will, concerned. Half-stripped, Will takes the phone, realizing this won't be good news. He covers the mouthpiece and looks over to Josephine. Will has a window seat in coach with Josephine beside him, putting on hand lotion. Hours later, the lights are dimmed, and most of the passengers are asleep, including Josephine, whose head is propped against Will's shoulder with her hands tucked under her belly. A beat passes, and Will notices a bored boy in the next row using his hands to cast shadows on the seat back under the reading light, making a convincing bird, passable monkey, and finally a dog. Focusing on the final shadow, Edward is seen making the shapes as a young Will sits in his pajamas on the floor next to him, the endtable lamp lying between them with its shade off to cast big shadows on the wall. Edward looks around for a beat to see if his wife is in earshot, then leans in, complicitous, as Will smiles, excited to hear the forbidden story. Edward holds up his hand, counting names on his fingers, as his hand moves past the light, and a flashlight sweeps by. The night is whirring and breathing, alive, with the moon hanging low, casting long shadows. Five kids walk past in silhouette, four with flashlights on, while the fifth keeps tripping, crashing into young Edward. Moving up behind the kids, they stand at the gates, staring in through the gate. Edward looks back at the spooky house, hands Zacky his flashlight, and starts climbing the gate, dropping down on the far side. Truth be told, Edward is scared, but he forges ahead anyway.",
    "1084": "Later, they are on the march again, with Viktor and Gramov leading the way on horseback, and Zus and all the rest of the soldiers following on foot. In the camp, Tuvia is in his cabin struggling with a fever, while outside, people are patiently in the food queue. Arkady and his friend are sharing a joke. Aron runs up to his brother's cabin as Chaya brings plates full of food to Arkady's table. Tuvia appears and notices Asael's black eye. Asael looks over to Arkady, who's standing with his back to them both, tucking into his large portion of food. Arkady pretends not to hear, takes another spoonful, then slowly hands his plate to a cohort and turns towards Tuvia with an insolent scowl. Arkady glances around at the fearful expressions of the rest of the people. Tuvia looks at him in disbelief, and Asael drops his head in shame. Tuvia turns round to face the community, Arkady behind him, smirking. Tuvia spins around and shoots him point-blank, and points his gun at Arkady's cohort, then lowers the gun. Asael swallows nervously as the men at the table jump to their feet and bend down to carry off Arkady's lifeless body. They carry him away past Lilka, Chaya, and Rachel. Tuvia, with his two younger brothers near him, looks defiantly at the silent huddle of people watching him. Later, he lies in bed, and a blanket is pulled up over him. His eyes flicker open, and he sees Lilka looking down at him. She smiles softly, and his face lights up for a brief moment before his eyes shut. She sits down in a chair near to the bed to watch him as a ray of sunshine bathes the log cabin in soft golden light. Tuvia, armed with his machine gun, is on an early morning watch. Asael unhooks a curtain from his cabin window and peers out. Icicles are beginning to thaw as Lilka stands with her face raised towards the sun, luxuriating in its warmth. Tuvia treads through the softening snow and wanders off into the hazy sunshine. A camera lens is set on a tripod, and the whole Bielski camp assembles for a group photograph. Some of the women are washing in the creek as Bella splashes Chaya. Tamara, huddled in her black coat despite the sunshine, looks nervous and frightened. Lilka steps out of the water to meet her. Tamara glances around, then takes Lilka by the hand and leads her out of the earshot of the others. She opens her coat and touches her belly. Lilka's clear blue eyes look searchingly at Tamara, whose face crumples. Lilka gently squeezes Tamara's clasped hands as Tuvia comes down through some trees, his gun held loosely in his hand.",
    "1111": "They are swarming into it as Ron looks around nervously. Harry stoops and goes into the tunnel with Fang just ahead, and breathing hard, Ron hesitates for a moment then follows his friend. The tunnel lies dark and glow, making it impossible to stand upright. They do not see a very large spider which drops from the roof behind them, silhouetted against the light from the tunnel entrance. The tunnel gradually opens out into a large dimly lit hollow filled with twisted tree roots; Harry and Ron follow the spiders as they swarm across it. But the path stops at a huge hole in the ground surrounded by crumpled cobwebs. The guide disappeared into the hole, and unable to go further, the boys stopped a little away from it. Harry holds up the lantern, unsure of what to do next, and Harry and Ron back away as several long hairy legs emerge from the hole, and a huge spider as big as a double-decker bus holds itself above the edge and peers down at them. It has a hairy face and its tiny eyes are set close together, and the boys stare open-mouthed as Ron stops whimpering. Ron points upwards with a shaking hand, and Harry looks up to see dozens of large spiders lowering themselves from the tree roots to dangle about their heads. He nods politely to Aragog, and Harry swings the lantern but drops it. They pull out their wands as the spiders close in. It's the Ford Anglia, and it stops with the doors flying open. Fang jumps into the back seat, Ron into the front, and Harry dives for the passenger seat as the spiders attack. Scattering spiders, Ron backs the car out around the tree roots and back along the narrow tunnel. The car hurtles backwards out of the entrance and flies through the air. The car hits the ground and comes to a halt, dislodging the lost spider, which grabs Ron through the open window. Harry points his wand and the spider is hurled backwards, and Ron looks at Harry with relief. Harry's eyes suddenly open wide as he looks through the cracked windscreen to see hundreds of huge spiders appearing from amongst the shadowy trees and moving towards the car, ready to attack again. Ron starts the car, puts it into reverse, turns the car, and accelerates. The spiders scuttle close behind the car as it jolts away between the trees, and the floor of the forest is a seething mass of spiders. Harry turns to Ron in desperation as Ron grabs the gear stick, while spiders lurk in the trees ready to jump on the car. Huge spiders loom ahead of them as they both heave on the gear stick, and the car rises into the air, smashing into a branch and scattering spiders.",
    "857": "He's tall and thin with a gaunt face, wearing a light shirt and dark floppy bow tie, with matching light trousers. He steps to the front of the van, his headlights still on, and moves forward. Bob watches as the ice cream man sniffs the air. The man opens his mouth as his arms extend from his sleeves. He bends over and bounds like a stick insect, and as he leaps in the air, Michael shoots him. As the man arrives on the ground, Michael continues shooting until the twitching stops. Inside the diner, the women and Jeep look anxious. Up on the roof, they turn their heads right to look along the road and see lights, as two columns of cars bear down on them. The cars drive straight as if on tracks, and inside, their drivers seem to be convulsing, their heads shaking violently as they drive towards the diner. As bullets rip into the lead cars, they spin on the road, and shells cascade along the feet of the shooters. One car smashes into a static one, rolling over in flames as the bursts of rapid fire illuminate the faces on the roof. Michael runs along the walkway and sees lights coming from the other direction, with a new convoy led by a villain car, then a truck. Michael launches a grenade, taking out the lead vehicle, then opens fire on the truck, which spills some of its load of pipes and slams into other cars. The surviving vehicles stop, and their doors open as drivers and passengers emerge from them and walk sedately towards the diner. From the roof, the guys look down on the approaching hoard of impassive faces. Kyle sees a young girl in a white party dress holding a balloon, noting there are men, women, and children, and she seems to be looking straight up at him. Michael opens fire, and people go down as shells fall from the rifles. In the diner, Jeep anxiously moves the torch around, while his father guns down several of the approaching people. Michael moves away from the other three as Sandra and Audrey are beside Howard, who is on the floor. Charlie's eyes are fixed on the window above the desk in the office, and someone bursts through. They can't see the intruder as Charlie rises from behind the counter and Howard yells, being dragged by the legs by the intruder, who hauls him towards the shattered window. The woman intruder, her young face contorted, leaps out of the window, still pulling Howard as the others try to keep hold of him. Her arm is grabbed, and as the stranger cuts Charlie, a knife cuts through his wrist, severing his hand. Michael is inside as Howard is pulled out, and assault rifle in each hand, Michael shoots out of the window.",
    "60": "Gittes is clicking off more shots when the tiles his feet are hooked over come loose, leading to a slow slide down the tile to the edge of the roof and possibly over it to a three-story drop. The loose tile also begins to slide, and a fragment off the cracked edge of the tile falls. Gittes tries to slow himself down as Mulwray stares at the fragment at his feet, rises, looks up to the roof, and then at the girl. In the style of the Hearst yellow press, there is a heart-shaped drawing around one of the photos that Gittes had taken, bringing a self-satisfied smile to his face. Elsewhere, a car is stalled with the hood up, as a man watches his radiator boiling over, reading a paper while getting a haircut and his shoes shined. Almost all the customers are reading papers. Gittes straightens up and gets out of the chair, despite Barney's concern as he tries to restrain him by holding onto the barber sheet around Gittes' neck. A customer shrinks back into the chair as Gittes bursts in, slapping a newspaper on his thigh. She gets up and leaves, while Walsh comes out of his office and Duffy out of the other one. A stunning young woman appears behind Gittes in his doorway, soon joined by a small, gray-haired man, as they listen unseen by Gittes, who laughs and then is staggered. When Gittes looks up, he sees the young woman, apparently in her late twenties, so stunning that he nearly gasps as the gray-haired man winces. The young woman walks past him toward the door. Evelyn starts out the door, and Gittes starts after her but is stopped by the gray-haired man who has also come out of his office and up behind him. Gittes stares down at the papers in his hand and turns to be handed a thick sheaf of papers, a summons and complaint. The Secretary half rises in protest but Gittes is through the inner door, where the walls are covered with commendations, photos of Mulwray at various construction sites, and large maps of watershed areas and reservoirs in the city. On the desk is a framed, tinted photo of Evelyn in riding clothes. Gittes moves to the desk, watching the translucent pane in the upper half of the door leading to the outer office as he does so. He begins to open and close the desk drawers after quickly examining the top, reopens the top drawer, and the bottom one opens. He looks in it, pulls out a checkbook, and opens it to riffle through the stubs like he was shuffling cards.",
    "903": "Dillinger scans the hillside but finds no sign of anyone, as Red peers over his shoulder from his tree. Dillinger relaxes his aim, and both men start off while Winstead lies low behind a tree. In slow motion, the criminals run along the misty overlook with Red leading the way as Agent Hurt opens fire from uphill, bringing Red down. Dillinger urges Red to his feet, and they move on. Behind them, Winstead resumes tracking the pair. Dillinger accosts an average man standing outside a cabin. Later, Red clutches his side, and Dillinger opens the heisted car's door for him. Baby Face reaches an unpaved road, where Baum, driving a car, peers ahead over the steering wheel. Baby Face turns his back to the vehicle as its glaring headlights draw closer and waves a hand low, paces backward, and keeps his Tommy gun under his coat. Baum stops and climbs out the other door. Baby Face throws him down and tosses Baum's Tommy gun onto the front seat before getting behind the wheel. As Baum's car drives off, Purvis comes running through the forest, finds his fallen partner, doffs his hat, crouches down to his fading colleague, glaring after the car riding steadily away, and moves out. Agent Madala follows, hesitating upon seeing Baum's body. On the dirt road, Purvis aims loosely at an oncoming car while holding up one hand; it's Cowley's team. Cowley pulls a 180, and Purvis rides outside the vehicle on the passenger side running board, armed with his Tommy gun. Baby Face comes upon Homer and Shouse, who aim their guns at the Ford as Cowley's speeding car takes a tight turn, and Purvis scowls into the night as the car follows another curve. Their headlights reveal a dip in the road, then the stolen Ford climbing the rise farther ahead, prompting Purvis to fire. Homer returns fire as Baby Face swerves to avoid incoming shots, and Purvis fires relentlessly from Cowley's car as it gains on Baby Face. Homer loads his next round, with a curve in the road giving Purvis an angled shot. Shouse nervously wipes his nose as Purvis tags the Ford's hood, causing the Ford to careen into a field and roll twice before settling on its tires. Shouse's lifeless face leans on the cracked windshield. Homer leaves Baby Face stuck behind the jammed front door, but the paunchy gangster kicks it out. Purvis arrives and riddles Homer with bullets, with puffs of redness erupting repeatedly from the gangster’s chest. Making an escape, Baby Face nails Cowley, leading Purvis to take aim with a pistol, but Agent Madala fires a shotgun first. Purvis follows up with shots of his own, and the paunchy gangster goes down as Baby Face half recovers, getting to his knees and discharges Tommy rounds.",
    "924": "He changes direction. The underground chase is as furious as the race above. Mitchell crashes through some supports. The roof starts to cave in on Bond. The crowds cheer enthusiastically. Mitchell's on a ladder to the surface as Bond picks himself up and keeps going. Fireworks signify that the race has a winner. The track is invaded. Amidst the tears and celebrations, Bond emerges from a manhole. Mitchell barges his way through the throng. Bond follows. He fires towards Bond, hitting a woman, then scrambles over a barrier onto the racetrack. 007 sprints in pursuit. The chase moves through a courtyard, then through a door and upstairs. Mitchell barges into an elderly woman lifting a crate of fruit on a rope. The crate crashes to the ground. Mitchell leaps across tiled rooftops, his pursuer following relentlessly. He takes a massive leap between buildings. Cluster around the shot civilian. A round strikes nearby as Bond leaps. He lands, slides down the tiles, then jumps again, landing heavily on a ledge. His quarry is on a roof across from and above him. He jumps down onto a balcony, leaps onto another, and holds himself up on the metal railings. He bursts into a room, runs through the apartment, and sees Mitchell climbing onto another roof a short distance away. He jumps from a window onto the roof of a bus. He gets to his feet and jumps from the vehicle onto another ledge, then shins off a drainpipe. Face set grimly, he's now on the same roof as his target. Mitchell arrives at the top of an empty tower. He leaps for a flight of steps dislodging recently. Bond follows and fires as the double agent runs out of sight. Bond pulls on the bell ropes, then heads up to the belfry, gun up and ready. Mitchell attacks from a perch outside the tower. Bond grabs his arm and hits out with an elbow. Both fall through a glass roof and onto a scaffold beneath. Bond's gun falls to the floor far below. Hanging by one hand, Bond tries to pull down the scaffolding beneath his adversary. Mitchell falls but grabs onto a rope. It swings, knocking over a pane of glass which shatters, sending vicious shards raining down. The rope gantry swings and the crate of bricks falls from the other end. Bond also grabs a rope. The two men end up facing each other, dangling on ropes at either end of the steel gantry. They trade blows and smash into a scaffold which topples over, pulling on the rope, hauling them into the glass roof. Mitchell falls onto the scaffold. Leg caught in a rope, Bond plummets, but is stopped just before hitting the ground near the gun.",
    "377": "Will walks towards the door, running a hand along the wallpaper, and almost at the door, he stops for a beat to catch his breath before going inside. Inside, Edward Bloom, 61, lies asleep on the bed. Although not as vibrant as before, his condition is not worse than expected; the illness has been quick but left him largely intact, with no I.V.s or monitors in sight. Will approaches the bed as Edward cracks open an eye, struggling to focus. Edward tries to speak, but no words come out, so he glances at a pitcher on the nightstand. Will pours him a glass of water and helps him drink. There is a long, tense pause, and as Will almost speaks to break the silence, he remembers the can of Ensure, which he holds up. Edward recoils at the sight of it but then rolls his eyes. Will opens the can, finds a straw, and Edward drinks as much Ensure as he can stand before pushing the can away, swallowing with difficulty. Will does not commit to Edward's unspoken assessment, prompting Edward to laugh a little, which turns into a cough. The coughing escalates until another drink of water calms it. Will takes the half-empty Ensure and stands to leave. Before exiting, he smiles at his joke, shuts the door behind himself, and drinks the remainder of the Ensure, finding it tastes horrible. As he heads for the stairs, Will walks past an open door, leaving the frame as we stay behind to see an eight-year-old Will, face covered with chicken pox and calamine lotion, sitting in bed. The young Will sings, his voice high and thin, until it cracks and drops, leaving him embarrassed as he continues singing, struggling to follow the baritone part. As he sings, Edward, undoes his collar, which pops off, followed by two more buttons, one hitting a chubby woman in the neck. We watch as Edward’s pant cuffs rise quickly, indicative of his rapid growth. Young Edward lies in bed, limbs and weight supported by pulleys and levers, surrounded by dozens of encyclopedias. He considers an encyclopedia article, already adorned with drawings, when the crack of a bat signals a game-winning home run. The crowd cheers as the batter, presumably Edward, rounds the bases. This scene marks our first real encounter with grown-up Edward, whom we will follow from the ages of 18 to 30.",
    "1000": "Jordan gives Nick a bemused look and goes in search of Gatsby as Nick stands frowning, captivated by the dazzling firework display unfolding before everyone else. From his upstairs window, Gatsby watches, reflecting sparkles in the glass, as fireworks shoot up into the night sky like a thousand silver stars, while Jordan glides across the confetti-covered dance floor and ascends the stairs. As she walks through double doors at the top of the stairs, Nick continues to frown, his back turned to the fireworks, while Gatsby stands at the window, smiling benignly and smoking a cigarette. Nick eventually turns to look at the spectacular display, observing as twinkling specks of light drift down like snowflakes and shimmering golden flakes flow from a giant champagne bottle, floating down on guests who are relaxing in a lounge with cushions scattered on the floor. Nick lies back, looking dreamy and gazes up at the photos and paintings on the walls. As a barman clears up, Nick stands and looks around thoughtfully, noticing a woman draped across the piano. Jordan appears with Teddy in tow, and they are driven away as Gatsby watches from the top of the steps, pressing his lips together thoughtfully. He then smiles politely and leaves as people cavort by the fountain. As Jordan is driven by, she stands up and waves, prompting Nick to smile and wave back. Nick walks along the dimly lit driveway to his cottage, stopping to look back at Gatsby's mansion. Watching from the upstairs window, Gatsby lowers a telephone and waves, with Nick waving back. Standing with a painting of charging stags behind him, Gatsby smiles charmingly, but when Nick's back is turned, his smile fades, and he lifts the telephone to his ear. Nick sits in his cottage, reading, but at the sound of an engine, he frowns, gets up, and peers out the window, spotting Gatsby circling the cottage in a bright-yellow Duesenberg coupe. The car, featuring white-wall tires and four chrome side pipes curled down from the engine, prompts Nick to come out and do up his dressing gown. Nick sits nervously in the passenger seat as Gatsby speeds along a country road in the Duesenberg, weaving through traffic. Gatsby smiles, patting his hand against his leg, looking at Nick while overtaking and cornering sharply, nearly hitting a pedestrian. Holding up his business card to a motorcycle cop riding alongside them, the cop peels off to the right, and Gatsby smiles. They head toward the Queensboro Bridge, driving alongside a convertible with a white chauffeur and two black couples in the back drinking champagne, and Nick looks bemused. They enter a barber shop, where a distinguished man with gray hair, beard, and mustache sits, and Gatsby taps a wall.",
    "231": "Gebczynski comes up behind him, and he closes the cupboard. Gebczynski makes for the front door, stops, hands over a scrap of paper, shakes Szpilman's hand, and goes quickly. Alone, Szpilman stands, lost for a moment, then takes off his shoe and stuffs the scrap of paper into it. While he does so, his eyes light on the divan bed, and he goes to it, slips off his other shoe, and lies down, testing the divan's springiness with his whole body, then smiles beatifically. He shuts his eyes and is instantly asleep. Szpilman is still fast asleep, but voices wake him, and he opens his eyes. He's not certain where he is for a moment but hears the voices again, coming from the adjoining flat. Intrigued, he rises, goes closer to the wall, puts his ear against it, and listens. Szpilman is enjoying himself, then the sound of a piano being played with great feeling but a lot of wrong notes comes. The piano continues for a moment but suddenly stops, and a door slams. She hands him the parcel, and he goes into the small kitchen and unpacks the contents while Janina gazes out of the window. She turns to look again out of the window at the building burning, corpses lie scattered on the pavement, Germans stand about chatting and laughing, and a handful of Jewish fighters are lined up and shot. Blazing sun. The ghetto buildings are now burned-out shells, the street empty, autumn leaves falling and gusting in the wind. Szpilman gazes out. Snow. Ice on the windows and the sound of the key in the door. Szpilman turns as the door opens, and Gebczynski enters, distraught, whispered, at speed. Gebczynski takes out a cigarette and lights it. While he does so, he goes, and Szpilman listens to his footsteps clattering down the stairs. He sees the cigarette stub, takes it, lights it, coughs, and smokes awkwardly. Szpilman hears a car engine and the screech of brakes and tenses. German voices shout and their heavy footsteps on the stairs. He goes to the window, opens it, and gets a chair, places it sideways in front of the window to make a step, working out how best to throw himself out. He leans against the wall near the door and waits. Slamming of doors, German shouts, a scream, and Szpilman steels himself, ready to jump. Again footsteps on the stairs, but this time descending, and a door slams. He cautiously goes to the window and looks out. In the street below, he sees SS men escorting two prisoners and shoving them into a car, which then speeds off. The street is empty. Snow. Howling wind. Szpilman lies on the divan, cold, unshaven, hair filthy and long. He manages to rise.",
    "882": "A lady's hand works on a delicate piece of floral embroidery. Two horses charge across the English countryside, and their riders stop at a vantage point to observe a sizable mansion nestled between trees in the distance. Mr. Bingley, with a broad smile, rides toward his new property, accompanied by Mr. Darcy. A young woman, Elizabeth Bennet, watches from a distance as the two horses thunder across the fields, turns away from the scene up on the hillside, a smile playing on her lips. Wearing a straw bonnet and simple day dress, Lizzie sets off down a country lane, turns while walking to take in the green and earthy countryside before breaking into a canter. After picking a posy of wildflowers from the woods, Lizzie crosses a small field where a chestnut mare and her foal graze in the sunshine and walks on toward the village beyond. Approaching her house, Longbourn, she bypasses the entrance, hearing her sisters arguing inside, and peers into her father's study. Father and daughter roll their eyes and smile. Lydia dons Kitty's bonnet, and Kitty bolts from the room in tears, passing Jane in the hall. Outside church, Mrs. Bennet is in deep conversation with a neighbor, while her five daughters set off behind their father. Mrs. Bennet manages to extract herself and runs to catch up with them. Mr. Bennet strides ahead into the house, setting down his hat and cane, as a maid rushes to attend Mrs. Bennet. Lizzie and Jane can't help smiling, and Lydia rolls her eyes. Later, Jane sits at her dressing table, brushing through her long, flaxen hair by candlelight, with a wistful Lizzie sitting behind her. Lizzie kisses Jane on the head and walks out of the room, closing her bedroom door behind her. Meanwhile, downstairs, Mr. Bennet works late in his study, poring over household accounts, marking up a book, putting his quill back in its pot, wearily shaking his head, and sitting back in his chair. With a sly look to the side, he reaches for a drinks decanter. Upstairs, Lizzie leans on her dressing table, studying her reflection, practices some facial expressions, smiles, and finally blows out the candle. As people mill around on the main street, a grand carriage pulls up outside The Assembly Rooms, led by men bearing torches. A servant opens the door and holds down the carriage steps. Bingley alights first, smiles at his surroundings, and puts on his large Napoleonic-style hat. Looking a little more serious, Darcy comes next, followed by Miss Bingley, wearing a grand ball gown and feather hat.",
    "545": "Henry presses against the wall, which rotates again. As he disappears into the next room, a dead Nazi radioman swivels into the room, and the other Nazis rush forward to him. Indy picks up a bust of Hitler and uses it to jam the rotating wall in place, sealing the Nazis inside the burning room. Vogel strides purposefully down the hallway and barks an order, causing two more Nazis to fall into step with him. Indy grabs his whip, leather sack, and Henry's case from a table, hands the case to Henry, and they begin to run. Indy and Henry step into an empty room, and Henry looks horrified by what he's been forced to do as Indy searches frantically for an exit. Indy begins to run his hands over the walls with urgency. Henry sits on a chair that tips back, hitting the wall behind it, causing the floor at Indy's feet to suddenly drop away. Indy grabs a railing to keep from falling but loses his grip and plunges through the opening, forming a spiral staircase. He rolls down the stairs, and Henry follows Indy down the staircase. The stairway deposits Indy and Henry into an enormous watery cavern beneath the mountain on which the castle was built, where a full-scale Nazi boat dock has been constructed. Indy boards one of the motorboats and starts the motor. Henry tosses his case at Indy, who catches it and angrily throws it back to his father. Indy moves back to the dock and pushes the boat away, and Henry looks confused. Vogel and the Nazi soldiers enter the room, spot the spiral staircase leading below, and quickly descend the stairs. As Vogel and the Nazi soldiers rush to the dock, Vogel sees that a motorboat is missing and orders the Nazi soldiers into a boat. The motorbike skids to a stop, and Henry slaps him across the face. Arrows point in opposite directions to Venice and Berlin, and the camera moves in on the portion of the sign reading Berlin. A Nazi rally is in process, with a book-burning occurring. The mound of burning books is ten feet tall and growing as college students and Nazi brownshirts continually toss more books onto the fire. Flags, banners, and standards displaying the swastika are waved rhythmically, echoing the mounting frenzy of the enormous crowd. Indy and Henry walk toward the square, with Indy wearing the uniform of a Nazi soldier and buttoning up the tunic, which happens to be several sizes too big. High-ranking officers of the Third Reich flank Adolf Hitler as they oversee the rally.",
    "986": "Queenie turns the baby towards the old woman, and the baby chuckles. Tizzy enters Queenie's sparse basement room, and she looks at him from the bed. He takes off his suit jacket and stares at Benjamin, who lies in the drawer at Queenie's bedside. Tizzy sits down on the bed, and Queenie glares at him, raises her brows, and stares at him. She wears a white nightdress. Tizzy looks away, picks up his jacket, and starts for the door. He pauses and removes his spectacles, putting them on the dresser. He throws his black jacket over the steel bed frame and sits close to Queenie. Benjamin stirs in his makeshift cot, and Tizzy and Queenie put an arm around each other, their eyes meeting. She leans forward and kisses him tenderly on the lips, and he cups her neck as they sink down onto the bed while kissing. As a child, Benjamin resembles a bald, old man. At a dining table, Benjamin uses an ear trumpet and wears round glasses with wispy, white hair around the sides of his shiny, bald head. He pushes himself back and forth along a porch in his wheelchair, but an elderly resident wedges his walking stick between Benjamin's wooden spokes to stop him. The old man retracts the stick, and Benjamin wheels himself to the top of the front steps to watch children playing in the street, his wheels drawing closer to the top step. He lies at Queenie's bedside and clasps her hand as Tizzy enters the room. Tizzy climbs the stairs, carrying frail, child-sized Benjamin in his arms. Benjamin sits in his wheelchair in the empty lounge beside an elderly woman who sleeps in a chair in the corner of the dark, wood-paneled room. Benjamin wheels himself to the glass-paned double front doors, stands up, peers out, and breathes against the glass before his legs suddenly give way beneath him, and he collapses. A naked old man raises a flag up a flagpole in the rain outside. A white-haired old woman with scarlet lipstick, while Queenie bathes Benjamin with the bathroom door wide open and tries to straighten his stiff, right leg. Tizzy washes up next to a large marquee. Benjamin dozes in a wicker-backed wheelchair, but Queenie wakes him and rises primly to her feet. She is approached by women in white uniforms and nurses' hats, while the preacher in a suit stands nearby. Queenie, wearing a pale orange dress, places her purse beside Benjamin and whispers something to the bespectacled preacher, who puts an arm around her and looks at the congregation. The mustachioed preacher puts a hand on Queenie's belly and pushes her into the arms of the nurses, she gets back on her feet, and the preacher removes Benjamin's boater, staring at him.",
    "659": "As the door opens, Harry enters, clutching a bouquet of flowers, and MJ quickly pulls her hand away from Peter's. Harry stares at them with a disappointed look on his face, and the three of them appear awkward. That evening, Harry strides into the dimly lit, arched Osborne living room. Hearing voices, he moves towards the stairs and climbs the grand staircase. His father, Norman, appears on the landing which encircles the room. Harry spreads his arms wide as Norman leans on the wood-carved rail, looking down and shaking his head at his son, who continues up the stairs sullenly. Harry looks at his father quizzically, and Norman steps down to him, then wraps him in his arms. Harry closes his eyes as tears well up in them. Peter rests his head on his aunt's bed, looking coy and thoughtful before turning away in alarm as he stands at a pay phone in the hospital. His eyes widen upon seeing MJ unconscious, a stiff breeze ruffling her hair and nightclothes, which rouses her. MJ gets to her feet on a metal platform high above the city lights, steps back to the edge, and manages to keep her balance. Way below her, traffic moves across the Queensboro Bridge as she stands on one of the towers of the steel structure. The Green Goblin approaches and glides over the ducking MJ, who watches him move towards a cable car filled with children and adults. The Green Goblin shoots a missile, destroying the cable-car station, and motor cars on the bridge collide. From a nearby rooftop, Spider-Man observes the chaos as a massive metal wheel flies into the air, a cable whips free, and the Roosevelt Island cable car begins to fall. The Green Goblin grabs the cable, stabilizing the car, as Spider-Man, standing on a thick strand of web tied between two flagpoles, launches himself into the air by walking down a building. He shoots webs, maneuvering along the steel girders until he lands on a metal strut. Above him, the Goblin holds MJ in one hand and the cable-car cable in the other, lifting MJ as her slippers slip off. The cable car swings in the wind, suspended solely by the Goblin's grip. The Goblin releases both MJ and the cable simultaneously. In the reflections of the large spider eyes on Spider-Man's mask, one shows MJ falling and the other the cable car full of screaming, frightened children. Spider-Man runs along the girder, leaps to catch MJ, and then swings beneath the span to ensnare the cable car in his web.",
    "1312": "A handful of comics tumbles to the ground as the ponytail man straightens the wheelchair and starts down the aisle again. After a couple of feet, Elijah jerks and grabs the other wheel, sending the wheelchair ramming violently into the opposite wall, causing more comics to be knocked free and fall onto the wheelchair and the nearby ground. They move down the aisle, and all is quiet until Elijah jerks the wheelchair to the left again, causing his metal brace and the wheelchair to crash into two racks, covering Elijah in comics. The Ponytail man moves to the front counter, while Elijah sits in a trance—slightly hunched over—and his eyes stare at a comic book in his lap. His expression changes for the first time as the Ponytail man finishes dialing and looks over to Elijah as he waits for a voice on the other end. Elijah raises a single comic book in his hand. In a trendy restaurant, David and Audrey are on stools at one end of the bar, sipping their drinks as they appear in deep thought. Audrey leans slightly closer, and David's grin slowly fades; they're only a foot or so apart. David sips his drink slowly and glances at Audrey, who waits for his answer, her face tensing as she's on the verge of getting upset. Audrey's eyes glaze with water as David's eyes look up and make eye contact with hers, and he stares at her for the longest time. Husband and wife sit close together in the corner of the bar on their second date, and Audrey stands next to David as he pulls out his wallet. The babysitter with the black dyed hair and Buddy Holly glasses stands ready to leave in the doorway as Audrey tries to hide her smile, which instantly fades. The babysitter fixes her Buddy Holly glasses as she looks at the two suddenly quiet faces, and David hands her the money. She opens the door, and it's started to rain, so she covers her head with her jacket and runs down the walkway, closing the door behind her. Audrey takes off her coat as she moves to the guest bedroom and disappears inside. Only the counter light is on in the kitchen where David stands by the phone. The driver of the truck slips and slides his way over to David, who looks at Audrey laying shivering in the grass before looking back at the driver. Elijah closes his eyes, and his face fills with strength. The interior of the station is a mystical sight, with one huge cavernous room, a football field in size, lined on both sides with giant pillars rising into a misty hand-painted ceiling. David stands in a quiet corner and watches the faces of passengers arriving and departing late-night trains.",
    "567": "The Perp flies past him, having leapt from twenty feet down to the top of the Guggenheim. On the roof, the Perp reaches the top, climbs over the edge, and crunches to the gravel surface. He runs to the front door of the Museum, shoots it open, and runs inside. He runs from the rotunda up the grand ramp of the Guggenheim. He leaps to his feet and races over to a door. It's locked. He tugs on another. It's locked too. He scrambles up and over the ledge. He pulls on a third. It swings open, revealing Edwards on the other side, breathing hard. He aims his weapon at the Perp. He decides and he falls, screaming, to his death. The silhouette of Edgar leaps to its feet, races to the door, and throws it open. Edgar is everything his voice led us to expect—a nasty, bug-eyed redneck carrying a twelve-gauge shotgun. His mouth agape, he walks across the yard and stares at the hulking shell that was his truck. The skeleton of the truck is still there, but there's a huge, smoldering hole in it, a hole that goes at least ten feet down into the ground. A woman sneaks into the room. Doctor Laurel Weaver, thirtyish, dark-haired, dark-eyed, general aura of darkness around her, stands above him. Laurel looks like she was just dragged out of bed (which she was) and saw a spaceman (which she did). She looks over her shoulder once, then whispers to him. Edwards twists in his chair, to get a better look. All he sees is Laurel, facing whoever it is in the hallway. The Someone says something else, and Laurel steps forward, now also out of Edwards's line of vision. Edwards stretches even further in his seat, when there is a blinding flash from the corridor. Really curious now, he starts to get up when Kay steps into the room and closes the door behind him. He crosses to the door. Edwards stops. At that point, the Inspector sticks his head in, smiles, and gives Edwards the thumbs up. Edwards looks at the Inspector, then at Kay. Kay opens the door and gets out of the car. They get out of the car. Edwards follows. Edwards looks around and sees they're standing in front of a pawn shop. He casually brushes some Rolexes off the counter. At the sound of Kay's voice, Jeebs suddenly pales, a look of fear coming over his face. He pulls his own gun and aims it at Jeebs' forehead. Edwards, seeing that Kay is getting somewhere, joins in the routine. KA-BOOM! Kay blows Jeebs' head off and Jeebs' body collapses to the floor.",
    "1209": "The soldier with the dancing girl drags her towards his hut, and she struggles. He slaps her, causing her to fall to the ground, then gestures to the hut and crawls underneath it. Unseen by the soldier, En-Joo clamps a hand over her mouth and holds a finger to his lips. The soldier looks underneath the hut for the girl, and En-Joo dives towards him, plunging a knife into his throat and stabbing repeatedly. He drags the soldier's body out of sight. Rambo runs out to a hut and dives underneath it, seeing Sarah lying prone in the pig sty. He throws open a wooden bolt, opens a gate, and crawls inside. He looks out through the timbers and sees the soldier with the bottle of spirits returning. Sarah is asleep or unconscious, and Rambo rushes over to the partition between them, pushing pigs out of the way. En-Joo checks his watch—10 seconds to 2. On the watch tower, School Boy has a soldier in the site of his weapon, and his watch shows 2 AM. He fires, starting by picking off the guard below and the guards in two adjacent watch towers. En-Joo and the girl exchange glances and move, but the boozy soldier has gotten to Sarah first. The hidden Rambo watches as she's dragged away, waits a few seconds, then follows them. BN's party joins En-Joo and the girls in a dark clearing beyond the camp gate. The soldier emerges from between two huts, dragging Sarah along by her hair, her arms tightly bound behind her back. Unseen, Rambo runs behind them. At the dance, one of the women is being held down and throttled by a soldier, and another trooper runs through the throng, brandishing a flare billowing red smoke. Lewis joins the other mercenaries, and Louis throws Michael to the ground and pulls a knife on him. BN leads them away, while School Boy shoots Lewis a murderous look. At the dance, the smoke from the flare is everywhere, and one of the women's dresses is torn away, leaving her topless. Rambo follows Sarah and the soldier, who drags her into his hut and throws her to the floor, with the door swinging closed behind them. At the dance, a struggling woman has her face slapped by one of the drunken crowd, and at the same time, Sarah suffers the same abuse at the hands of a soldier who bears down on her, reaching for his belt buckle. Rambo takes the officer from behind, grabbing a clump of the man's hair in his right hand and clutching the throat with his left, as the officer's face becomes a rictus grimace while Rambo's fingers dig deep into the cartilage and bone at the man's neck.",
    "723": "Lovejoy scowls as he follows Cal, who walks through the bridge, and they brush past an officer. Meanwhile, Ismay stands by the collapsible and glances at a crowd of passengers on the lower side of the bridge before turning back to the collapsible. While Murdoch turns away, Ismay slips into a seat on the collapsible, and Murdoch finds himself staring at his mate who gazes ahead. Murdoch glowers at his mate while motioning downward with both arms. The seamen lower the collapsible, and as it drops below the deck, Ismay glances up. Lightoller grabs a young girl and places her in a lifeboat. Rose turns to Jack, while Cal glances from Jack to Rose. Cal pulls off the blanket wrapped around Rose and shoves it at Jack before removing his own coat and placing it around Rose's shoulders. He starts to caress Rose's hair, but she backs away from him, and Jack steps up to her. A crewman grabs Rose and guides her toward the lifeboat, and Jack, along with another crew member, helps Rose climb into the boat. Rose turns and grasps Jack's outstretched hand as the crewman pushes Jack back and the lifeboat jerks. Standing at the rail, Cal and Jack gaze at Rose as the lifeboat lowers toward the water, and Rose stares back at Jack. Jack looks from Cal to the descending boat, while Rose looks around, up at the ropes running through the pulleys, and back at Jack. Rose sees a young girl next to her waving to her father while her sister cries, as a crew member on deck yells orders with arms raised out at his sides. Rose gazes back up at Jack, who stands beside Cal, as another flare shoots into the dark sky above them and briefly illuminates Rose's face. More streaking flares cascade in the sky above Jack, and suddenly Rose steps to the edge of the lifeboat, leaps from it, and hangs from the ship's rail several decks below Jack. Two crew members pull her on board, and she runs along the deck while Jack turns and runs along the main deck, past passengers and crew members. Rose runs along the lower deck, as Jack rushes inside and runs down the grand staircase. At the bottom of the stairs, Rose runs into his arms, and they embrace, kiss, and then hug. Cal gazes down at them from an upper landing. Stepping up to him, Lovejoy glances down, grabs Cal's shoulder, and pulls him away. As they step away from the railing, Cal grabs Lovejoy's gun from its holster and runs toward the stairs, pulling Rose away as Rose and Jack flee and Cal tears down the stairs after them.",
    "792": "Having smashed the clock and several empties, he sits down on the bed and drinks from a half-full bottle with a cigarette end floating in it. Meanwhile, a smart convertible pulls up at a car valeting service by the beach, and Willie strolls up as the driver hands over the keys. A young guy from the valet service drives off with the convertible, and Willie walks over to a board holding the car keys; he looks around then picks up several of the keys. He saunters through the parking lot pressing the remotes, causing cars to flash and unlock. Willie tosses away the keys nonchalantly and continues unlocking until he walks up to one of the cars he's just unlocked. He then presses another remote and turns to see a blue sports convertible, his eyes brighten, and he goes for that. Climbing in, he opens the glove compartment, takes out the tax disk, reads the address on it, replaces the disk, starts the engine, and drives away. The car is parked outside a grand mansion with a pillared entranceway. Inside, Willie climbs an elegant marble staircase toward a balustrated balcony, and upstairs, in a smart kitchen, he drinks milk from the bottle and replaces it in the well-stocked fridge. He munches on a chicken leg, sits on the toilet, fiddles with the handle of the un-flushing toilet, stands up, and looks at it. Tossing the chicken leg down the pan, he saunters aimlessly down the hallway and tips oil paintings off the wall. On a wood-paneled wall, he sees a large portrait of a boy with dark hair. He peeks behind the painting, removes it from the wall revealing a safe, and sticks his ear to the safe to start turning the combination lock. His eyes catch sight of a companion set by the fireplace; selecting the poker, he attacks the safe and finds lots of money. At an exotic club, he ignores the girl writhing in front of him and rubs a scratch card, looking up as she crawls away. The girl moves towards a second exotic dancer on stage in front of another punter, while Willie continues scratching away as a scantily clad waitress brings beer to him. He places a scratch card in her bikini bottoms. Later, she follows him into his apartment, wanders away as Willie winds back through his phone messages. Marcus and Willie are once again in their festive elf and Santa costumes, striding through a heat shimmer in a car park. Willie pulls his beer down with a cigarette dangling from the corner of his mouth, clutching a bottle of dog in his left hand as he strolls along, removes the cigarette from his mouth, and takes a good pull on his bottle, draining it of its contents.",
    "1343": "Along the streets, silent faces of the poor wait and watch as a column of black-suited dignitaries carrying branches of laurel passes by. Softly, in time with the drums, the watching people begin to sing, among them Enjolras, Marius, and the radical students. The dignitaries become aware of the singing and glance uneasily from side to side. Into frame comes a team of black horses stepping slowly, black plumes nodding, drawing behind them a gun carriage draped in the tricolour flag. As the coffin on its carriage draws level with the students, Enjolras suddenly steps out in front of the horses, waves the red flag, and stops the horses and the procession. The students break the ranks of the crowd and surround the coffin carriage. Enjolras, Marius, Courfeyrac, and other students climb onto the top of the carriage, led by Combeferre. Police and national guardsmen control the growing crowds. The crowd supports them and surrounds the coffin carriage, blocking the police's attempts to intervene, singing with passion. Enjolras, the students, and the impassioned crowd have now become the procession. They turn off the main street away from the expected course of the funeral procession. As the procession turns off, the cavalry division gallops ahead and disappears around a corner. Gavroche's elephant looms over this side street. He slips away through the barricade, which is still rising. Grantaire prises the final piece of Madame Hucheloup's furniture from her arms - her favourite sewing armchair - and adds it to the barricade. The barricade is now complete: an impressive wall up to twelve feet high, with one heavily guarded section that can be wheeled open to allow access. Two smaller barricades protect the left and right side of the cafe. Enjolras climbs halfway up the main barricade and turns to his little army. Javert, still in his disguise as a rebel, is let back through the guarded 'gate' into the barricaded street. A single flaming torch atop the barricade, caged in by cobbles, underlights a fluttering red flag. They all look up; there's Gavroche, on the top of the barricade. Guns swing round to aim at Javert, who stares back in defiance. Enjolras faces Javert as bullets ricochet off the cornices of the houses, bore into the barricade, and wound several men. The red flag falls, the pole sliced through; everyone freezes. Marius brings the torch closer to the powder keg, but already the soldiers have cleared out. Marius comes down from the barricade, and as everyone surrounds him in amazement, he spots Eponine lying propped against the barricade. With a struggle, she pulls the letter out of her pocket and pushes it into his hand.",
    "555": "His face contorts in agony, and he grabs his stomach and turns toward Elsa as he starts to age rapidly, with his hair growing long, gray, and brittle. Elsa gasps and screams while his skin turns brown, leathery, and stretches across his bones until it splits. His skeletal hands reach for Elsa's throat, choking her, and Indy rushes forward to push Donovan away. As Donovan falls, his body breaks into flames and shatters against the wall. Indy studies the array of chalices and picks up another cup, a simple earthenware jug. He and Elsa exchange a look, and Indy goes to the well, fills the jug with water, and pauses before bringing it to his lips and taking several large swallows. Indy and Elsa come forward with the Grail, and the two Nazi soldiers are overawed by the possessors of the Grail. Indy kneels by Henry's side, tilts his head forward, and holds the Grail to his lips, but Henry is too weak to open his eyes. Henry swallows some of the water, though much of it runs down the corners of his mouth. Finally, Indy pours the water over the wound, and everyone watches in astonishment as the wound and bloodstain disappear. The color returns to Henry's face, his eyes open, and they first light up at the sight of the Grail and then even more at Indy’s face. Nazi soldiers run forward but drop their weapons and surrender. Elsa steps forward, picks up the Grail, and turns to Indy, her face alight with possession. She steps onto the edge of the Great Seal, a rumbling sound is heard, and the ground roars and shifts. Dirt falls from the ceiling of the cavern, Elsa falls on the Great Seal, and the Grail bounces away from her grasp. She reaches for it as the ground beneath her begins to split open, slipping into the crevasse. As her hands lose their grip, Indy manages to grab one, sliding forward across the slanted floor. While Elsa tries to get the Grail with her free hand, Indy can't save her unless she gives him her free hand, but her hand begins to slip from his grasp. As the ledge Indy lies on begins to break apart, Henry grabs his hand as Indy struggles to reach the Grail with the other. Indy abandons the Grail and grabs onto Henry with both hands, and Henry pulls him up to safety. They look through the falling debris at each other, and Sallah and Brody rush from the crumbling Temple.",
    "195": "Potter is lighting a big cigar which he has just given George, and the goon is beside Potter's chair, as usual. George drops his cigar on his lap and nervously brushes off the sparks from his clothes. As they shake hands, George feels a physical revulsion because Potter's hand feels like a cold mackerel to him. In that moment of physical contact, he knows he could never be associated with this man and drops his hand with a shudder. He peers intently into Potter's face, turns, and shouts at the goon, impassive as ever beside Potter's wheelchair. As George opens the office door to exit, he shouts at Mr. Potter's secretary in the outer office. The room is modestly furnished with just a cheap bed, a chair or two, and a dresser. Mary is asleep in the bed. As George comes in, his head is filled with many confusing thoughts relating to incidents in his past life. George takes off his hat and coat, moves over to the dresser, and stares at his reflection in the mirror. While the above thoughts are passing through George's head, his attention is caught by a picture on the wall near the dresser, which is the sketch of George lassoing the moon that we first saw in Mary's living room. Mary is now awake and starts singing their theme song. George crosses over and sits on the edge of the bed, and Mary nods her head happily. Over the following series of shots, we hear the voices of Joseph and Clarence in Heaven. George is crossing the street, heading for the offices of the Building and Loan. Mary is sitting on the floor playing with a baby, and a little boy is in a playpen nearby. Mary is busy hanging wallpaper and painting the old place. George has just come into the hall. He is obviously tired and discouraged as he starts up the stairs, and the knob on the banister comes off in his hand. A group of men, obviously just drafted, are marching along in a camp. Mrs. Bailey and other women in Red Cross uniforms are busily sewing, etc. Mary, with a portable U.S.O. pushcart, is serving coffee and doughnuts to men leaning from the train. Sam Wainwright is showing a set of blueprints to two Army officers. Potter is wheeled in toward a long table around which several men are seated. Gower and Uncle Billy are conducting a bond rally from the top of an Army tank. Bert, in uniform, is moving cautiously with a fixed bayonet, and there are smoke and flashes of gunfire in the background. Hundreds of planes are flying overhead with parachutes dropping from them. Marty is in the foreground, beckoning to soldiers to come on, and Harry is fastening the helmet of his flying clothes.",
    "982": "Benjamin stands with his hands in his pockets watching as she tries to turn but instead stumbles awkwardly, flexing her bad leg. She straightens her leg, turns, and holds onto a wall-mounted ballet bar as she puts her right leg up tightly behind her. Benjamin has his arm around her as they gaze at themselves in the mirror. Smiling, Daisy turns to look at him and stares gravely at his reflection. He takes his arm from around her shoulder and looks her in the eye. Daisy wears a searching expression, and Benjamin smiles. She throws her arms around him. They sit beside each other on a tram, Daisy smiles as Benjamin stares out of the window, and Benjamin seems distant. Returning from his thoughts, he looks at Daisy who smiles fondly, then his eyes turn to a man seated with his young daughter flexed and head down. Daisy puts an arm around Benjamin and kisses him softly on the cheek. At night, they sit opposite each other in a diner where she finishes an ice cream sundae then brushes a tiny piece of spilled ice cream from her swollen belly. He leans back in his seat, she takes his hand, and he offers an unconvincing smile before he beams, and she kisses his hand. Wearing an autumnal-colored poncho, Daisy heads off to the toilet as Benjamin puts money on the counter. There's a television in the corner. Daisy returns, and on screen, Elizabeth grins. They leave the diner, and he stops across the lounge, looking at her at the bottom of some stairs where she's bleeding. He rushes to the phone and darts down the basement stairs to Daisy who lies sprawled on the bloodstained floor beside a wash basket. Alone in the kitchen, Benjamin paces, peers out into the corridor, paces anxiously, and leans on a kitchen surface. A uniformed man and a female doctor exit the bedroom through separate doors, and Benjamin, doe-eyed, enters the bedroom to find Daisy lying with a newborn baby. He sits down on the bed, and they gaze at their daughter who's wrapped in a blanket. Benjamin watches as Daisy pops her little finger in the infant's mouth to stop her crying and looks back at Benjamin through teary eyes. He caresses his daughter. In the hospital, Caroline turns to her mother, and they share a look. Caroline puts down the diary and leaves Daisy's bedside, her brow furrowed and face gaunt, as Daisy watches Caroline wander out into the corridor. In Daisy's room, a clock beside the wall-mounted TV reads 5 to 10. Caroline lights up a cigarette, and the nurse, eating an apple, spots her. The TV weatherman is on, and Caroline stares at Daisy, who taps a fist on the bedside table. Caroline picks up the diary and reads aloud by the window.",
    "1139": "Harry dives into a fireplace and is whisked up, followed by Hermione and Ron with Yaxley close on their heels; Yaxley grabs them on their journey upwards, causing their faces to contort, but he loses his grip. Sunlight filters down through a leafy canopy, and still in Albert's clothes, Harry wakes lying on a carpet of dead leaves in a forest. Glancing to his right, he sees the locket, and after slipping off Albert's coat, he scrambles over to the locket and picks it up. Hermione is on her knees by a shivering Ron, while Harry searches desperately in the bag, points his wand, and a bottle pops into his hand. She treats the gaping wound on Ron's left shoulder with a few drops of the essence, sealing the wound as her bloodied hands reveal her relief. Hermione gets to her feet and walks away, and Harry takes her place at Ron's side. Hermione braces herself and lifts her wand as Harry looks at her bag. A dim light glimmers inside a small tent when Harry aims his wand at the locket and smoke rises from it. All three walk towards it, Ron with his left arm in a sling, while the locket lies unscathed amongst the dead leaves. Hermione tries, the locket is engulfed in flames, but it remains unmarked and is thrown across the clearing. Looking weary and ill, Ron gazes down at it as it flies even further away. Harry stares angrily at the shining metal as the flames die out, but the locket remains firmly closed. Harry picks it up, slips the chain over his head, and tucks the locket inside his shirt while Hermione looks anxiously at him. Harry stares at them both, then turns abruptly and walks away, later sitting outside the tent, studying his piece of broken mirror; he spins around, hearing a radio being tuned in the tent, and catches sight of Hermione down in a hollow. He lifts the locket from under his shirt and holds it in his hand, which twists as he connects with Voldemort, witnessing a boy thief escaping with a wand after Voldemort kills Gregorovitch. Harry gasps for breath, and Hermione walks slowly up to him, looking concerned as he glares at the tent. Hermione glances away, and Harry looks impatient, stomping off and reaching inside his shirt. He struggles to hold a chain over his head and hands her the locket and chain, which she studies before walking slowly away from Harry, whose head is lowered. Hermione sits on guard by a campfire in front of the tent, stands up at a sound, while in the tent, Harry wakes up with his head resting on a table, glancing over at the sleeping Ron.",
    "959": "Louis sits up in the driver's seat with his face bloodied, and he looks in his rearview mirror. Alice turns around and sees the creature. Louis tries to get out of the car and tumbles out of the passenger door, then he runs back up the street and trips over Alice's bike. Soldiers watch a colleague using a flamethrower. Charles and Joe pick up their processed film, and as they cycle off past the town's water tower, a vast plume of smoke rises just outside the town. Stuck in an indentation on the side of the water tower tank is the vibrating cube. Their footage from the night of the crash shows just clouds of smoke, but when the smoke clears, they see footage of a giant spider-like creature creeping out of a carriage. Hearing the siren, they look around in confusion, and Joe stops the projector, breaking the film off. Outside, chaos reigns on the streets as people and military personnel hurry to and fro. Joe and Charles walk down the street and see a huge pool of smoke rising above the town, while panicked families load their cars in preparation to evacuate. Troops direct traffic and issue instructions, and Charles and Joe prepare to board a bus as a convoy leaves town led by several military vehicles. They pass military container lorries carrying the white cubes recovered from the crash site on their way into town as the evacuation convoy heads out. Charles and Joe are aboard one of the buses, and the convoy eventually arrives at Greenville Air Force Base, where vehicles queue to get in through the east entrance. Inside, civilians disembark from the buses in a huge hangar, and Air Force personnel shepherd them along. Joe wanders through the hangar looking for Jack and sees Louis lying on a bed in a sickbay area. He goes over to Louis, who looks relieved, and then finds Charles, Preston, Martin, and Carrie. Meanwhile, Donnie, the camera shop guy, looks around as an armed guard opens the door and escorts him along a corridor. Jack punches the guard out, takes his gun, and, now dressed in the guard's uniform and clutching his rifle, trots along a corridor, making his way through a couple of offices. He looks outside, spots a fuel tanker nearby, and shoots it, causing an explosion that distracts the Air Force personnel. Jack then helps himself to a Jeep and drives off along an unmetaled track running through open fields. He pulls up near a grain silo, gets out of the Jeep, and sees a convoy of vehicles traveling along an adjacent road.",
    "254": "Two pedestrians help the shaken Butch out of the wreckage as the woozy Marsellus gets to his feet. Marsellus follows the gawker's finger and sees Butch Coolidge down the street, looking a shambles. The big man takes out a .45 Automatic and the gawkers back away. Marsellus starts moving toward Butch, and Butch sees the fierce figure making a wobbly beeline toward him. Butch quickly takes measure of the situation, then stands next to the door. Before Maynard can finish his threat, Marsellus charges in. The gangster's feet go out from under him, and the big man falls flat on his back. Butch pounces on the fallen body, punching him twice more in the face. Butch takes the gun out of Marsellus’ hand, then grabs ahold of his middle finger. Butch and Marsellus look up at Maynard, who's brandishing a pump-action shotgun, aimed at the two men. Marsellus passes out, and they are tied up in two separate chairs. In their mouths are two S&M-style ball gags, with a belt going around their heads and a little red ball sticking in their mouths. Both men are unconscious. Maynard steps in with a fire extinguisher and sprays both guys until they're wide awake and wet as otters. The two prisoners look up at their captors. Maynard stands in front of them, fire extinguisher in one hand, shotgun in the other, and Marsellus’ .45 sticking in his belt. Without saying another word, Maynard climbs up the stairs. Butch and Marsellus look around the room. After taking in their predicament, Butch and Marsellus look at each other, all traces of hostility gone, replaced by a terror they both share at what they've gotten themselves into. Maynard and Zed come through the curtains; the two hillbillies are brothers. Zed walks in and stands in front of the two captives. He inspects them for a long time, then says, Butch makes no reply. Maynard opens a trap door in the floor, reaches into the hole, and comes back holding onto a leash. He gives it a rough yank, and from below the floor rises the Gimp, a man they keep dressed from head to toe in black leather bondage gear. There are zippers, buckles, and studs here and there on the body. On his head is a black leather mask with two eye holes and a closed zipper for a mouth. Zed takes the chair, sits it in front of the two prisoners, then lowers into it. Maynard hands the Gimp's leash to Zed, then backs away. The Gimp gets on its knees. Maynard hangs back while Zed appraises the two men. Butch and Marsellus are terrified as Maynard looks back and forth at the victims, while the Gimp's eyes go from one to the other inside the mask.",
    "753": "Directly ahead, the enormous, bright disk of the station clock looms as people scurry across the concourse in the beams of cold silver light from lamps high above in the ceiling. Uniformly grey against the grey floor and walls, David descends the stone staircase and stands at the foot of the stairs in a baseball cap and rain cape, watching humanity ebb and flow. He starts to walk unhurriedly through the crowd when a young blonde woman in a bright red jacket bumps into him. He then sees, watching from above, the same woman in a different shiny jacket in a jewelry shop. She points at an elderly assistant, and as his back is turned, she reaches over the counter, takes a bracelet, and drops it into her bag. David watches her disappear into the crowd and then moves slowly on, with other people passing and some touching him. He stops in the middle of the concourse, people swirling around him, and holds his left hand out slightly, fingers extended, as a man in a check shirt worn outside his trousers brushes into David's extended hand. Once again, he's looking down from high above, watching the man in the check shirt lean out of a pickup and smash a bottle over the head of a black woman strolling along a city street at night. Frowning, David sees the man drain a beer can and drop it into a trash bin. A young man in a green shirt kneels by a bed where a young woman in a very short party dress is sprawled. She rolls over, unhearing, the dress revealing her thighs. The boy watches for a moment, rises, and the girl's leg slips off the bed as she lies on her side, blonde hair spread over an assortment of coats, unmoving. The boy leaves, closing the door behind him. David turns and looks around the station as a group of college students, all wearing maroon baseball caps, files past him. He looks beyond them and sees the young man in a green jacket embrace his mother and turn to smile at his father. David watches, starts to walk backwards, swallowing hard, and glancing at other people as they pass by, backing into a maintenance man in orange overalls pushing a trash bin on wheels. A man opens his front door to the maintenance man now in an orange T-shirt, and the two men stare at each other through the outer fly screen door. The maintenance man grabs the door and holds it open while David sees an image of the house owner sprawled on the basement steps. He stares upwards for a moment, his eyes wide, and still looking shocked, he gazes around the concourse and spots the maintenance man emptying the trash can on the far side.",
    "850": "He stands, grasps her shoulder for a moment, and walks away, while Charlie's brow is anxiously wrinkled. Mist wafts over the hands of the hordes of possessed standing outside as they slowly rock from side to side, beneath a full moon that glows between dark clouds. Something hangs overhead, looking down at the diner as Bob and Jeep walk in. Charlie stands staring at Michael, who slowly steps towards her, while Sandra grabs the baby and Michael aims the gun. Something flies down towards the diner as, standing beside Charlie, Audrey shakes her head. Outside, light washes over the possessed, and intense white light shines through the entrance as the door blasts open. Michael shoots Sandra in the head, causing her to jerk backward and drop the baby, which Jeep dives and catches. Gabriel steps out of the bright light, a tall, muscular man with enormous black wings, and spreads his wings, swinging a mace down to the baby. Holding him, Jeep rolls out of the way as the mace slashes a hole in the floor. Bob shoots at Gabriel while Jeep gives the baby to Charlie, and Gabriel spins, deflecting the bullets with his wings wrapped around him. Gabriel slices across Bob's chest, and Bob drops his gun, feeling his bloody chest, before Gabriel swipes him across the face, throwing him onto a cooker. Michael gives Jeep some keys, and Jeep, Charlie, and Audrey rush to a door and open it, finding the possessed standing with their heads bowed, a walkway between them. Jeep steps out holding a pistol, followed by Charlie holding the baby, and Audrey, as Jeep leads the way with his gun held out in front. The possessed stand motionless with mist floating above their bowed heads, while in the diner, Gabriel stands facing Michael, who shakes his head slightly. The possessed step aside as Jeep, Charlie, and Audrey walk between them and reach a figure with a bag over its head, standing in front of the police car. In the diner, Gabriel studies Michael while the figure with the bag over its head wheezes and whacks the hood of the police car with a stick. Jeep, Charlie, and Audrey get in the police car as Michael walks up to Gabriel, and Jeep drives them away while Michael steps right up to Gabriel, who studies him. Jeep keeps his eye on the wing mirror as he drives away. Michael clasps his hand against Gabriel's cheek, looks him in the face, and Gabriel's eyes moisten as he looks down, his lips moving as if grasping for words. Gabriel clutches Michael's hand and looks deep into his eyes before pushing him away. Michael readies his assault rifle as blades poke out of Gabriel's mace, and Gabriel spreads his wings and his chest, lunging towards Michael, who shoots and leaps out of the way.",
    "153": "He is young and vigorous and swivels on the ground as though to strike back, but Nehru lunges toward him and a lathi is brought smashing across the side of Nehru's head. He feels the side of his head, the blood soaking his hand, and struggles to his feet, facing the policeman who has struck him. The Viceroy ponders it favorably, while the senior police officer is brought up by the chill directness of it. He looks at Irwin and the principal secretary for a moment in uncertainty. As he turns to leave, Irwin speaks almost offhandedly, and the senior police officer stares at him. Barbed wire stretches on either side of the stockade-like entrance, and above the gate we see the sign DHARASANA SALT WORKS. Before it, six British police officers and two Indian police officers command a large troop of Indian policemen. They face their opposition, unmoving, tense. The camera pans from them, across a sloping dip in the ground, to a huge group of volunteers lining up to face the police as tautly as the police face them. Walker is off to one side, climbing to stand in the back of Collin's car, watching, looking tensely from one group to the other, almost terrified by what seems about to happen. Collins leans against the back of the car near him, watching with an equally appalled expectancy, and there are two other reporters near them. From Walker's point of view, we see Mirabehn and some Indian women quietly placing stretchers and tables of bandages near a group of tents where the volunteers have been housed. Walker turns back to the two opposing groups at the Salt Works entrance, and the air itself seems breathless with tension. He has approached the chief police officer and stops before him politely. He turns and starts down the dip toward the gate and the waiting lathis of the police. A series of shots shows Azad leading the first row of volunteers down and up the dip as we intercut Walker, frozen, watching the inevitable onslaught, with the British police commanding officer ready to give the first order. He speaks it, trying only half successfully to keep the emotion from his voice. Irwin is in shadows behind his desk, looking still in some kind of shock, staring at Gandhi, and faces Gandhi stiffly. The whirr of a camera, and a swift cut to a wide screen, but slightly under-cranked with the bad cutting and predictable music of the old newsreels. Gandhi, Mirabehn, and Gandhi's secretary, Desai, are waving goodbye from the boat deck of their ship as it sails, with Mirabehn holding the tether of a goat, all of them smiling at the camera like voyagers everywhere.",
    "72": "DANTE holds a ball in the center of the court while REDDING stretches, leaning against the sign. DANTE skids to the sidelines and then skates to his side before skidding back to the sidelines to address the CUSTOMER. Below, a WOMAN pulls at the door, peers into the store with her face against the glass, backs up, and shields her eyes while looking toward the roof. A new face-off pits DANTE against the CUSTOMER, who winds up and takes a hard shot. The ball sails off the court, through the air, and into a faraway yard, dropping between the two as DANTE gets flattened. DANTE scrambles to the edge and calls over, looks around hyperventilating, and calls to the sidelines as SANFORD skates up to him. DANTE skates off and is later seen standing on a ladder, replacing a fluorescent light while an OLD MAN joins him at the foot of the ladder. With the light in place, DANTE descends the ladder and closes it, glances over and reacts as the OLD MAN walks off, and he heads back to the counter. The OLD MAN returns, visibly taking DANTE aback. DANTE is then seen driving with passenger RANDAL, their backs to the camera, in absolute silence, before DANTE glares at RANDAL. A MASSIVE CROWD is outside the store as DANTE and RANDAL walk up the path to the funeral parlor. Car locks are slammed down as DANTE and RANDAL run from the front door, chased by a small crowd of angry mourners, and the car screams away. The pursuing crowd stands in the middle of the street, shaking their fists and throwing things as the car pulls up, and RANDAL and DANTE get out where absolutely nobody is outside. JAY enters the frame next to RANDAL, aims his butt at him, and farts, prompting DANTE to grab RANDAL, and RANDAL to lunge for him. A KID tugs at JAY'S shirt before they head back to the counter, and DANTE walks away, shaking his head. DANTE puts up cigarettes as the CUSTOMER lets it sink in and leaves in a huff, while another CUSTOMER leans in, and RANDAL spits a mist of water at him, drenching him. The man reacts violently, attempting to grab RANDAL from over the counter as DANTE plays block, but RANDAL makes no move and remains untouched, saluting the CUSTOMER as he leaves, wiping water from his face. RANDAL exits as DANTE waits on a customer (TRAINER), lifting a gallon of milk into a paper bag with a slight grunt, and a female customer (HEATHER) leans in the doorway. A SUITED MAN carrying a notebook comes to the counter, scribbles in his notebook, rips out a piece of paper, and hands it to DANTE before exiting with DANTE trying to follow.",
    "789": "Marcus and Willie are in the back room, where a ladder leads up to the air vent. Willie snaps a popper, causing Marcus to glare at him. While the guard bids farewell to shoppers, Marcus crawls through the vent. Once Willie and the last of the shoppers have gone, the security guard checks his watch and taps a code into the alarm system. Marcus is in the air conditioning duct overlooking the security booth and presses a button on a remote control, switching off all the security cameras, then hurries back along the duct. He plunges down the duct, heading straight down, and smashes through a vent above a table of sweaters Lois had repositioned to break his fall. The table collapses, and he leaps to his feet, running to the alarm console and turning it off with two seconds to spare. A service elevator opens, and Marcus and Willie step out, Willie towing a trolley of safe-cracking equipment. They break into an office, and Marcus walks over to a large safe, with Willie staring at it aghast. Still staring at the safe, Willie sits down, and later he tries to crack the combination, while Marcus wheels a handcart through the mall. At home, Thurmond carefully lays the table for dinner and selects a bottle of wine. Marcus is on his annual shopping spree, helping himself to all the various goodies Lois had listed. Having failed with the combination, Willie falls back on drilling to crack the safe, grimacing as he withdraws the bit from the door. Next, he dons dark goggles and tries to cut his way in with an arc welder, but the welding doesn't go well. At home, Sue takes a sauce bottle from the fridge and hands it to Thurmond. Meanwhile, Marcus takes a red camisole off a shop dummy and kisses its left breast, then comes to the dummy modeling the mink stole, which is too tall for him to reach. After jumping up and down a bit, he catches his breath and spots another mannequin holding a golf club. He takes the club and tries to remove the stole from around the dummy's neck with it, but it won't budge. Eventually, he gives up and uses the club like an ax to chop the dummy's legs off. Down in the office, Willie has resorted to brute force and uses a sledgehammer on the safe door. Willie doesn’t crack the safe, but Marcus succeeds in felling the dummy and takes the stole from around its neck. Willie listens to the back of the safe and taps it as Marcus comes into the office just as Willie emerges from around the back of the safe.",
    "344": "GOLLUM is cowering back, coughing and spluttering. FRODO looks at SMEAGOL in shock and gets to his feet, while SMEAGOL stares at FRODO in disbelief. In a fury, SMEAGOL lunges at FRODO, who falls backwards, dangerously close to the edge of the precipice, as GOLLUM tumbles over FRODO's body and falls to the bottom of the ravine. FRODO, overcome with exhaustion, stumbles down the steep stairs of CIRITH UNGOL, full of remorse at his treatment of SAM, and falls to his knees. FRODO lands on soft green grass and sees sun-drenched images of trees. In a hazy image, GALADRIEL walks towards him, barefoot, and leans down, offering her hand. For a beat, FRODO stares at her, torn, not wanting to go on and wanting to lie down, but he knows what he must do. FRODO is lifted to his feet, once again in the dark, rank tunnels of the pass of CIRITH UNGOL, and he goes on. Flaming missiles rain down on the city as GROND thuds against the MINAS TIRITH gate, sending a vibration through the city. GANDALF, on SHADOWFAX, leads several hundred Gondorian foot soldiers down through the streets. PIPPIN watches as FARAMIR's unconscious body is carried on a stretcher by DENETHOR's servants, led by DENETHOR. It has the atmosphere of a funeral as an iron door creaks open and FARAMIR's procession enters a wide vaulted chamber where lantern light throws great shadows upon the shrouded walls. Row upon row of marble tombs are visible in the dim light, with each tomb having a sleeping form carved in stone, hands folded. DENETHOR turns to his servants. The gate splinters with a boom under GROND's mighty weight. Behind the gates, the Gondorian foot soldiers are fearful. GANDALF rallies the line of bowmen as they wait in front of the great doors, their courage wavering with each crashing. Suddenly, the fearsome head protrudes into MINAS TIRITH. Within moments, the gate is smashed, and giant cave trolls enter into the first circle of MINAS TIRITH under the archway that no enemy had ever passed. Rows of archers fire off a volley of arrows, but the trolls continue to smash the foot soldiers with their giant clubs. Orcs swarm through the opening, and the pitched, hand-to-hand battle spills into flames and blackened, smouldering buildings. With a roar, GANDALF leads a counterattack on SHADOWFAX, followed by several hundred Gondorian foot soldiers, as thousands of orcs swarm in through the city gates, and the first level is breached. FRODO staggers through the pass of CIRITH UNGOL, the weight of the ring dragging at his neck. He moves forward, fueled by a grim resolve, and starts climbing a stone staircase that climbs through a narrow pass.",
    "309": "Tommy and Kayleigh load popcorn and drinks onto Evan's lap as Lenny pushes the wheelchair. Evan celebrates his 14th birthday and blows out the candles. Evan screams as blood pours from his nose, and Lenny is out of bed at once to help him, as is Kayleigh. Evan sips from a beer cap as Lenny and Kayleigh make out in plain sight with Tommy's bashful approval. Evan is in agony as Kayleigh opens a series of dorm doors and Lenny rushes Evan's wheelchair through. Kayleigh carries a pair of prosthetic arms in her hands. Evan launches his body forward and spills clumsily out of the wheelchair. Evan focuses on Lenny, but it's hard to ignore the crowd that titters and snickers in the background. Kayleigh turns to face the jeering crowd, which then breaks up and leaves. Lenny and Kayleigh push Evan's wheelchair around the quad. Evan now wears prosthetic arms and looks up as they roll along, his eyes brightening when he sees Evan. Kayleigh looks at Evan, and he allows her to roll him away from the others. Kayleigh, now by a bench, stops and sits. As she casually uses her foot to turn his chair to face her, she pulls out a granola bar and hands it to him. His prosthetic hand crushes it, and it crumbles to dust. Kayleigh shakes her head sadly, then suddenly looks up. Evan turns to see Lenny waving her over. She puts her hand on Evan's shoulder, stands, and goes to Lenny. Evan can't take his eyes off her. He observes Lenny kissing Kayleigh and turns away, utterly heartbroken. Evan's stump turns on a bathtub faucet, and fully clothed, he lies in a bathtub that's filling with water. Beside the tub, the wheelchair has been tipped over. The water rises past his mouth to his nostrils, and Evan makes his peace and takes a final breath. The water spills over the side of the tub, and all Evan can do is watch it, still breathing easily through his nose. Tommy enters, pushes a lever, and the mechanical wheelchair rolls itself out of the room. Evan watches Lenny eagerly as he dumps tons of Evan's junk on the floor: old report cards, books, toys, and photo albums. Evan beams when he sees Lenny holding his old journal. Lenny, utterly baffled, sits back in silence and watches Evan begin reading his journal to himself for a beat. Evan comes to in his childhood kitchen, springs to his feet, and flexes his real hands triumphantly. He rummages through the utensil drawer, pulls out a large butcher knife, and tries to tuck it into his sock, but it won't fit.",
    "83": "The sequence begins with them unwillingly getting moving as both women set off, with WILLA going to the River and ICEY heading towards the GROUP. We track after ICEY as the PREACHER approaches, and ICEY, crossing him, gives him a little shove towards WILLA and acts coy. We follow her to the women who are busying themselves with the fudge. Meanwhile, JOHN and PEARL approach, with JOHN looking hard towards WILLA and the PREACHER from his viewpoint in a tableau of decorous courtship, framed by heavy domestic bodies. They sit by the water among drooling willows, almost in travesty of a romantic scene. His head goes slantwise and he smiles oddly, watching intently towards his mother; PEARL holds his hand. In the background, WALT looks sheepish. All look towards WILLA, who is standing and beckoning JOHN. They start towards their mother as the others agree with her. As JOHN and PEARL, with the DOLL, come shyly up, WILLA is radiant. He desperately conceals his reaction, thinking BEN has betrayed him, and now conceals his new reaction. WILLA touches PREACHER's hand warmly as she walks away towards ICEY and the WOMEN. JOHN moves to stand in front of the PREACHER; PEARL stands beside him with the DOLL. From JOHN's eye-level, as JOHN steps in front of him and PEARL beside him, the hands named LOVE and HATE straighten the necktie. JOHN looks down and then up to see PREACHER in close-up, hands busy o.s., PEARL with the doll, and between them, in the background, WILLA. She is now running fast towards ICEY, who walks towards her with arms outstretched, behind them being the group of WOMEN. Birdie sits beside his open door, strumming a guitar and singing. The scene is lamplighted from within as Ben’s skiff is inverted on trestles in the foreground. At the start of the scene, we only see JOHN's feet as he's under the skiff, examining it. After three lines of song, he comes out from under, lounges against the skiff, tracing a tarry seam with his forefinger, while Birdie lazily picks at his guitar for the rest of the scene. JOHN then leaves the shot, and as he runs past SPOON's, looking in, he is curious. ICEY embraces WILLA, or waltzes her around, as WALT looks on, pleased, while JOHN hurries away from us towards home. In the otherwise dark house, one window is lighted. JOHN enters the shot, his back to us, and hesitates, seeing the lighted window. After a silent pause, listening, he walks cautiously towards us in a tall, narrow shooting-frame, with right and left thirds of the screen in black. We shoot from inside the screen door as JOHN crosses the porch, softly opens the door, enters on tiptoe, and pauses, close to us, in the dark hallway, listening sharply. Relieved, but puzzled, he tiptoes along towards the rear of the hallway in close-up as we pull away.",
    "329": "Gandalf looks at him more keenly as Bilbo leads Gandalf into Bag End, which is cozy and cluttered with souvenirs of Bilbo's travels. Gandalf has to stoop to avoid hitting his head on the low ceiling. Bilbo hangs up Gandalf's hat on a peg and trots off down the hall, disappearing into the kitchen as Gandalf looks around, enjoying the familiarity of Bag End. He turns, knocking his head on the light and then walking into the wooden beam, groaning. Gandalf stops in front of a framed map, charred in one corner; it is Thorin's map of the Lonely Mountain, and Gandalf smiles to himself. Gandalf watches amused as Bilbo tries to hide, and Bilbo's fingers close around his waistcoat pocket, gripping a small, unseen object. Gandalf and Bilbo are sitting on the Bag End porch, and below them, final preparations are being made on the Party field. Bilbo blows a perfect smoke ring and watches it rise into the air, as a tiny sailing ship with masts and sails glides through the center of Bilbo's smoke ring. Glowing flowers rain down from branches, evaporating just above the upturned faces of the delighted party-goers, with 144 Hobbits feasting and drinking. Carts of beer and wine are scattered about, and the tables are piled high with steaming scones and savories. Bilbo is greeting visitors while Frodo and Sam sit at a table drinking ale. Frodo notices Sam's eyes keep flicking to another pretty Hobbit, Rosie Cotton, sitting some distance away. Sam goes to drain his glass, but suddenly it is snatched out of his hands as Frodo thrusts him into the middle of a passing throng of dancers as he is swept away. Frodo laughs and finishes Sam's beer, while Gandalf sets alight a particularly spectacular firework that draws gasps of admiration from the party guests. Bilbo relates stories of his adventure to a group of young hobbit children, and with their upturned faces, their eyes grow larger and larger. Stunned gasps from his young audience greet his astonishing feat! Merry and Pippin, two mischievous young Hobbits in their late teens, are present, and Pippin scrambles onto the back of Gandalf's wagon, snatching up a small firework. Gandalf hurries about, lighting fireworks with a blue spark that dances magically from his staff. Large hands suddenly clamp down on Merry and Pippin's ears, as Gandalf looks down sternly. They are later seen leaning over a barrel, washing dishes in soapy water with Gandalf sitting nearby, smoking his pipe and sipping an ale. Bilbo steps on a stool, bowing in gratitude at the applause, with Frodo and Gandalf smiling to themselves. Bilbo's hand pulls something out of his waistcoat pocket and holds it behind his back as a strange hum seems to fill his head. Bilbo gives Gandalf a look and nods toward the mantelpiece.",
    "262": "Hi moves toward Evelle, his teeth set, meaning business, but Gale steps in front of Hi, snapping the chamber shut and leaving the frame while still talking. Gale returns into frame holding another handgun, in addition to the .38, this one an automatic, and snaps a clip into the automatic. Hi is leaving the frame again, continuing to talk as we hear him rummaging offscreen, then he enters the frame with two handguns stuck in his belt and holding his pump-action shotgun, priming it with a WHOOSH-CLACK. From the front bumper of an automobile, beautiful desert stretches to the horizon as the road rushes under the camera. Gale drives, gazing out at the road while Evelle holds Nathan Jr., occasionally bouncing him contemplatively. Evelle is looking down at the baby, shifting him in his lap as Gale looks over and Evelle, beaming, looks up from the baby to Gale. A carton of diapers is set down on the check-out counter, where Evelle and the Cashier, a late-middle-aged man, perhaps the proprietor of the small mom-and-pop store, face each other. Evelle has various baby purchases, including diapers and baby food, piled on the counter that the Cashier is ringing up. Through the open door beyond them, a strip of the parking lot is visible. Up over his head, Evelle takes a plastic-covered squirt gun off a display rack and drops it on the counter while looking around at other impulse purchases displayed by the register; he unhooks a bag of balloons and is pulling a gun out of his belt as the Cashier is already down on the floor, out of frame. With his hands free now, Gale reaches for the back door while Evelle sorts through his purchases. Gale is looking around, puzzled, and the two men look at each other before their heads whip around to look in the back seat, then they look at each other in horror as their eyes widen, remembering at the same time, and both look up at the roof of the car. Coming off the accelerator and screaming as he watches the foot, Gale, choked up, speaks in a low unsteady voice. Ed is driving, and both are staring wordlessly ahead at the road as Hi looks over at Ed, glum but trying to be kind, nodding to himself, which shuts Hi up. After a moment, Hi clears his throat. A huge rumbling rippling red ball fills the frame as we hear footfalls on concrete steps, and Smalls rises into frame, apparently climbing a stoop, with the sun behind him throwing him into silhouette and the extreme telephoto flattening him against the sun. Heat waves ripple between the viewer and him, making his figure slightly waver.",
    "493": "He points to the chair on the other side of the coffee table. He closes his eyes tight. Cole, surprised, takes a small step forward. Cole takes a step. Malcolm opens his eyes. He looks right at Cole. Cole takes another step. The next step will put him at the chair. Malcolm lowers his fingers from his temple. Malcolm smiles. Malcolm looks to Cole's arm. Cole is wearing a large silver watch. It swims on his thin wrist. Malcolm closes his eyes. Cole takes a step back. Malcolm lowers his hands surprised. Malcolm puts his fingers to his temple. He gazes at Cole's school uniform. Cole takes a slow step back. Cole answers by taking a small step back. Malcolm looks down at Cole's feet. Cole is very still. Malcolm takes his time before speaking. He just stares. Cole quietly takes a step back into the doorway of the other room. Cole's tiny figure steps away. Malcolm hurriedly enters a spacious, dimly-lit Italian restaurant. He finds Anna. Anna sits alone at a corner table. A small piece of cake with a candle in it sits untouched. Anna stirs sugar in her coffee as Malcolm sits in the seat across from her. Anna quietly takes a sip from her coffee. She glances across the table, then looks down. Malcolm demonstrates by holding up his arm to shield his face. Malcolm stops walking. The words hit him hard. He stares at Cole. Cole is surprised. Cole is playing behind the couch. All we see is the top of his head. Every now and then we get glimpses of things Cole is playing with peeking over the back of the couch, but we can't quite make out what he's doing. The top of Cole's head stops moving. Cole has become very still. He looks right at Malcolm. Malcolm watches him carefully. He rises and grabs his coat. Cole's brow furrows as he thinks about it carefully. Malcolm turns back to Cole. Cole's sad eyes stare up at Malcolm. The surface of Malcolm's desk is covered with open texts. Malcolm pours over a thick reference book. He circles a phrase. His face turns up to the ceiling. Malcolm gets up and moves closer to their voices as he stretches his legs. Malcolm smiles at Anna. Malcolm slowly stops smiling. Malcolm shakes his head in disbelief. Mr. Cunningham turns and stares at his class of eight and nine year old private school students. Cole rests his chin on his desk and watches the class with big eyes. Stanley Cunningham looks over the class of blank faces. He's just about to answer his own question when he sees a hand go up. Mr. Cunningham looks surprised to see who it is.",
    "1160": "Lupin grabs Harry tightly and holds him back. Struggling to free himself, Harry's grief turns to rage when he sees Bellatrix Lestrange's evil smile, and she slips away quickly around a dark corner. Harry breaks free from Lupin and races after her, catching up with her as she runs through the great hall of the Ministry of Magic. The spell stops her, and she falls; Bellatrix cowers on the ground as Harry stands over her aiming his wand. His neck twists and flexes, and he hesitates, gripping his wand. Suddenly, Voldemort appears, and Harry turns as Voldemort knocks Harry's wand from his hand. There is a flash of green smoke as Dumbledore appears out of a fireplace and pushes Harry aside, with Bellatrix disappearing in a flash of green smoke. Voldemort flicks his wand, and Dumbledore retaliates with red light streaming from Dumbledore's wand while green light comes from Voldemort's. The two powerful forces meet like molten lava in a burst of flashing sparks and flame, as Harry cowers. Voldemort breathes out a gigantic serpent, weaved in red hot flames, which bears its fangs and heads for Harry. Dumbledore holds it back, and hovered against the wall, Harry shields his face from the heat while Dumbledore draws a great wave of water from the pools surrounding the fountain to submerge Voldemort, forming a huge rolling ball with Voldemort trapped inside. Voldemort bursts out, and Dumbledore launches a blast of powerful energy; Voldemort staggers and then returns it, hurling Dumbledore backwards. Windows shatter, and the banner with the picture of Fudge is torn to shreds by flying shards of glass as Voldemort's face twists into a snarl. He sends the jagged pieces of broken glass hurling towards Harry and Dumbledore, who produces a force field to protect them, deflecting and reducing the pieces to a fine sand. Voldemort's grin of triumph fades as Dumbledore faces him, standing in front of Harry to protect him, before Voldemort suddenly disappears in a whirlwind of sand, which ruffles Dumbledore's white beard. A shiver runs through the sand on the floor at their feet and heads towards Harry, whose body stiffens and convulses before he falls to the ground. His eyes are dark-rimmed, red, and staring as he glares at Dumbledore and speaks. Harry writhes in agony as painful images fill his mind: his mother, Cedric lying dead, and Sirius fading away from him, while Dumbledore kneels beside Harry. Harry sees himself as Voldemort, and Dumbledore leans over him anxiously as Harry lies still. Hermione, Ron, and the others come into the wrecked hall of the Ministry of Magic and stop in alarm when they see Dumbledore kneeling beside Harry. Seeing his friends, Harry recalls happy memories of his parents and good times at Hogwarts with Hermione and Ron, while Voldemort sneers.",
    "285": "She is wearing a Kelly Green suit and is seated at her dressing table. Jeff looks down and smiles to himself. He turns and raises the long-focus camera to his eye. The long-focus lens brings Miss Lonely Hearts into an enlarged picture that reveals details we have not previously noticed. A pair of ill-fitting horn-rimmed reading glasses rest halfway down her nose, and she has to tilt her head back slightly as she applies lipstick with their aid. Satisfied, she takes off the glasses and examines her face as a whole through squinting eyes. Her hair-do makes her seem middle-aged. She has faded good looks, fairly nice clothes, but is badly in need of advice on hair dressing. She reaches for a tall glass of liquor next to her and takes a long drink. Putting the glass down, she squints to see if she has disturbed the lipstick. Unable to see clearly, she puts on the glasses again, looks, and touches up her lips slightly. She puts her glasses in a handbag, then stands to put out the lights. She walks into the living room, finishing the drink. The long-focus lens moves with her. She goes straight for a bottle of liquor, pours out a final neat slug, and tosses it off. Then she leaves the apartment with a show of determination. She turns out the lights behind her. Jeff lowers the long-focus lens and turns his head to the right as he hears the first notes of the songwriter's melody, which we have heard him trying to complete. He is in black tie, and from the looks of the apartment, he is preparing for guests. An attractive girl is setting out trays of canapés, glasses, ice, and liquor. She pauses as she crosses the room carrying a tray of food. She listens a moment to the songwriter's melody. She comments on it to the songwriter, who starts from the beginning again, playing it more fully. Her expression shows that it pleases her and moves her romantically. Jeff's head turns in this new direction. Miss Torso and a male partner whom we have not seen before are practicing a pas de deux. A new source of music comes in to interfere with the piano playing. It is orchestral ballet music in a modern style. He is a tall, flowing-haired young man, lithe and graceful beyond normal masculine capacity. They stop at one point to listen to a word of comment from a woman who is watching. By her gestures, she is obviously a professional choreographer. The camera pans from this to the street beyond. Standing there on the sidewalk, looking up and down the street, is a Kelly Green clad figure.",
    "1330": "A dark, bloody shoe steps out from the ice cream truck, and the camera moves up the long grey pant leg spotted with blood stains to reveal a skeletally thin man in tattered coveralls. As he steps into the beams of the headlights, he becomes more clearly visible; he's tall. He surveys the diner, the garage, and the roof, assessing the situation. On the roof, the men wait for something to happen. That's when the ice cream man's jaw unhinges and stretches, causing everyone except Michael to practically hyperventilate with fear. The ice cream man bolts for the diner with startling speed, his movements resembling those of a human insect. Michael aims and bullets rip into the creature's body, knocking him flat on his back, with arms and legs in a twisted, twitching mess. Michael keeps his aim. A rumbling of engines and headlights follow as a freeway full of vehicles of every variety punches through a wall of dust, racing toward the diner. Vehicles swerve and collide, and dark shapes bolt from the burning vehicles, scattering. Suddenly Howard's body is torn away from Sandra as something grabs his legs, waking Sandra and causing her to scream and hold on. Charlie and Audrey rush to Sandra's side, grabbing Howard's arms, with Jeep right behind them, ready to fire at the creature but unable to get a clear shot because the women are in the way. He discards the gun and helps grab Howard's arms as Howard screams and his body is torturously stretched in a human tug-of-war, lurching further out the window. Kyle looks around the roof with alarm as only a few more inches separate Charlie from certain death through the window, and Jeep is losing her. Charlie and Jeep fall back into the diner, with claw-like hands still grasping Charlie's arms, no longer attached to their owners. Michael leaps over her, wielding a butcher's knife in one hand and a machine gun in the other, as the window blinds turn into a wall of fire. Charlie flings the severed appendages off her, and she and Jeep scoot away from the window. Hysterical, Sandra tries to push past Michael to go after Howard, but he intercepts her before she can make it out. Sandra frantically slaps at Michael as he carries her away from the window and thrusts her down into a back booth. She's about to say something when Kyle rushes into the room with a smile on his face, but his excitement falls when he notices the broken window and takes in the room. Bob grabs Kyle's arm, and all eyes turn to Michael. Michael looks squarely at Percy, as Bob stares at him, uncertain how to respond, and Charlie reacts in shock as all eyes suddenly turn to her.",
    "725": "She swims across the water which nearly reaches the ceiling. She stops at the stairs, then turns. He swims to the stairs and they both climb. At the head of a crowd, Tommy and Fabrizio hop over a barrier. Crew members lift the lifeboat onto long oars set up like a ramp. Reaching to the deck, Murdoch rushes to a stairwell and stares down the churning water. Cal runs through a doorway. A man knocks him into a running crowd. Cal turns and runs with the others, then stops. He climbs a platform and peers over the crowd. Cal peers down at a crying young girl, then walks away. Inside, Rose and Jack run up a staircase. A man falls into the water, another dangles from the rope. Cal approaches. Murdoch pulls money from his pocket and flings it at Cal. Murdoch pushes Cal. A man leaps toward the lifeboat. Murdoch shoots at him. A man pushes Tommy forward. Murdoch shoots Tommy. Fabrizio kneels by Tommy. Murdoch gazes downward and steps back toward the edge of the ship. He looks to his right, then at the crowd of passengers. Cal glares at Murdoch. Murdoch stands at attention and salutes, then holds the gun to his own head. He fires and falls into the ocean. Cal turns and then runs to the crowd. On the other side of the ship, crew members tip another lifeboat onto the deck below. Cal picks up a crying girl, then steps toward the crowd of passengers. Cal hurries forward. Cal hands the girl to a woman, climbs into the lifeboat, and sits. The woman hands the girl to Cal. Jack and Rose run for the smoking room. Andrews stands by the fireplace, gazing at a painting. Andrews gives Rose his lifebelt. She hugs Andrews. Rose hurries through a revolving door. Jack glances back, nods, then follows Rose. Elsewhere, a steward holding two life belts hurries toward the Grand Staircase. Outside, a sailor rotates a winch as others work to turn over the top of the lifeboat. Captain Smith watches, then turns as a man wades through shallow water on deck. A woman holding a baby approaches the captain. Captain Smith stares at her, then turns and steps away. A man with a lifebelt runs up to the captain. The captain stops, glances at the lifebelt, then walks off. Knee-deep in water, he steps onto the bridge. Captain Smith gazes at a ship's wheel and various instruments, then steps into the wheelhouse and shuts the door. The string quartet finishes playing. Carrying their instruments, three of the quartet members walk away as people run past. Hartley, the violin player, places his instrument against his neck and resumes playing.",
    "1038": "Felipe perspires profusely and glowers intensely before clicking a red trigger with his thumb, causing the hotel lobby to explode. In the stairwell, Javier checks his watch, and outside, an ambulance hits the streets with Sam on its radio. A Secret Service agent heads downstairs, only to be shot by Javier. Javier watches more agents pass beneath him in the stairwell, then heads downstairs, easing a door open on level seven. He dons a ski mask, lurches through the doorway, and stabs an agent in the back. Another agent rounds the corner, and Javier attacks, killing the agent and drawing his gun. Meanwhile, Sam drives the ambulance through the streets at breakneck speed, careening through a junction and causing two cars to crash. Javier uses a mirror to spot two agents outside the President's room, then opens fire, shooting a third agent, and sets charges which blow the door to the President's room. He ducks inside and guns down Cavic, McCullough, and Heinkin before pointing his gun at Ashton. The ambulance arrives at the bombed hotel, and Veronica and Sam climb out. Sam taps his cell phone screen as the agent leads him away, and they kneel by a casualty. Barnes enters the GNN OB truck and flashes his ID as Veronica enters the elevator with a gurney and presses the button for level seven. Barnes makes a second call on his cell phone and spots Taylor on the monitor dressed as a cop. A flashback shows Taylor leaving Barnes and Howard, running off with a smirk, and entering the annex behind two agents as the bomb goes off outside. Taylor guns down both agents, sheds his jacket, dismantles the remote-controlled rifle, changes into a Spanish policeman's outfit, and heads down an outside staircase with the packed-up rifle. As Taylor leaves, Barnes spots him on the monitor, glares, and leaps into action, rushing out of the GNN truck. Taylor puts his cell phone into the front seat of the ambulance driven by Sam and Veronica and gets into a Spanish police car. As Barnes rounds a corner, he heads down a quiet street, sees Taylor speed off, and gives chase on foot through a narrow pedestrian street, then onto the main road, rushing into oncoming traffic. Barnes speeds off in a blue hatchback, gets on his cell phone, and slides around a corner. In the hotel, Javier forces Ashton towards the elevator on the seventh floor at gunpoint. Veronica arrives in the elevator and chloroforms Ashton; they put the unconscious President on the gurney, enter the elevator, and Veronica fits an oxygen mask onto Ashton's face while Javier points a gun at the President's head.",
    "481": "She sees the small alley at the end of the L of cabins and starts toward it. She looks ahead at the old house standing against the sky as Lila moves forward, and the CAMERA approaches the house. She moves on, and the house comes nearer. Lila looks up at the house and continues forward purposefully toward the house and the porch. Lila stops at the house and looks up, then turns to it again. The CAMERA MOUNTS the steps to the porch, and Lila's hand pushes the door open, revealing the hallway. Lila ENTERS PAST CAMERA, closes the door, and remains by it for a moment, quiet and listening. Meanwhile, Norman is behind the counter, standing and staring at Sam, who is sitting relaxedly on a small sofa. Lila is halfway up the stairs, and the CAMERA remains at the foot of the stair, TILTING UP as she climbs. She pauses at the head of the stair, observing the closed door to the mother's room on her right. There is a moment of quiet, then the door begins to open, and Lila stands on the threshold, looking in at the room, instantly disturbed by it, and almost chilled, with an expression indicating an impulse to close the door and go away from the room forever. After a moment, she enters, leaving the door open behind her. Inside, there is a four-poster bed without a canopy, a fancy and flounced satin dressing table, a great chiffonier, a big-doored wardrobe, a large oval full-length pier-glass against the wall directly opposite the door, a satin recamier, an upholstered armchair by the window, and a white marble fireplace with a grate cold but piled with ashes. Lila glances at the bed and, after staring at it for a moment, goes to the dressing table. She moves on, catches a glimpse of herself in the pier-glass, is startled, turns away, goes to the chiffonier, is about to open a drawer, sees the high wardrobe out of the corner of her eye, and goes to it hesitantly. She opens one door to see fresh, clean, well-pressed dresses hanging neatly. Lila comes out of the mother's room, closes the door behind her, looks down the stairs, then starts across the hall to the room with the half-open door. Lila pauses on the threshold, reaches in, feels the wall, and throws on a switch. Sam has risen and is standing by the counter now, turning his head to glance out the window at the old house. Lila goes into the room, goes to the chair, and touches it. The touch disturbs the figure, causing it to start turning slowly and stiffly in a clockwise movement. Lila looks at it in horror, realizing it is the body of a woman long dead.",
    "761": "He opens the door to a walk-in wardrobe, switches on the bare bulb, and feels under some folded jeans on a shelf above his head. He removes a piece of gray cloth from which a gun butt protrudes. He lays the cloth on his newspaper, unwraps the stubby, black revolver, looks at it, re-wraps it, and replaces it. Feeling under the jeans again, he removes a battered folder. He opens it and flips through old newspaper clippings about American football. A photo of a young David in football gear looks out from another story. He turns over more clippings, copies of the first stories, pages of sport results, and more photos of football matches. The personalities involved are disguised by their helmets and face guards until he comes to a picture of an overturned car. He stares at it frowning. He looks back at the picture of the car, obviously taken at night. It's lying just beyond a bend in a tree-lined road, upside down in a ditch. Its roof is crushed. He glances across the room, quickly closes, and replaces the folder under his jeans. Audrey is outside his door. She looks down. Her face crumbles, and she pushes her fists to her mouth. He watches her turn and start down the stairs before he shuts the door. In a huge football stadium, David is on duty holding a walkie-talkie in a white covered walkway. David and Elijah stroll beside the crowds, queuing to get in. David brushes past a tall, slim man wearing a pale, sandy green and gray camouflage jacket. A few paces further on, he looks back, eyes narrowed. When they move on again, Elijah, who's wearing a long black leather coat and his usual black gloves, and walking with the help of his stick, glances back too. David stops at the head of the queue and speaks to another security. The other guards start frisking the fans. The man with thinning hair and a black beard looks around. David and Elijah watch the slow-moving queue. Elijah, the taller of the two, stoops while leaning on his stick. The suspect reaches a break in the metal barriers, steps out of the queue, hand covering his mouth, and walks away against the flow of fans. David looks at Elijah, then away again. David grins at Elijah. David looks away again and nods. David holds up his walkie-talkie. David walks along the dark corridor. Elijah's glass walking stick lands on the seat of his car. The man in the camouflage jacket walks past the car. Elijah hobbles around the arched colonnade that encircles the stadium through alternate pools of light and shadows cast by the arches, but the man walks fast enough to disappear from sight around the curve of the building.",
    "1072": "He picks up something silky and holds it out, smiling apologetically. He passes water to the men on the truck's roof. Holding his dog, he looks at Sarah. She looks out of the passenger window. A kangaroo paw and a dribble of blood run down the windscreen. She peers in horror through her desert glasses, her net veil blowing in the breeze. The hunters lounge happily on top of the truck, which heads out across the flat, sandy desert. They drive along the top of a weir, across a wide river. At night, they camp around a fire. Drover is washing his muscled torso, using water from a bucket. Sarah pops her head out of her tent, staring as the water pours off his rippling muscles. They mime keeping each other warm, and she ducks back into her tent. He walks towards her with a raised eyebrow. He pulls down the waistband of his trousers suggestively. Camels pull a truck with no engine, watched by Goolaj and Magarri. A man falls off the vehicle. He lies in a heap in the dust. Later, he's in the truck next to the horrified Sarah. Drover nods. They drive on across a flat, dusty plain. They're bumping slowly along a rocky track. A girl runs up to them. The boy gallops on the horse, through the sparse trees. The boy arrives at Faraway Downs and reins in the horse, looking out at the approaching truck. The boy runs through the gate to the house and leaps over a fence. They just miss the horse, which rears up. Thick smoke obscures the house. As he loads, the boy climbs into the water tower. Drover walks through the smoke. The boy drops down inside the tower. Sarah sits uncomfortably next to the drunk Kipling. The smoke clears, revealing a large house. Kipling collapses. Drover, shrouded in smoke, walks past a dead cow. Sarah, jaw set, gets out of the truck. She stomps furiously towards the house, as Drover approaches a blazing funeral fire. He examines it thoughtfully and looks around. The boy stretches out his hands. An aboriginal is sitting on the ground. As she enters the house, women hold out buckets of smoking leaves. The boy poses mystically. Sarah strides past members of the household and sees her husband, dead on a table. She reels in shock. He's got a wound in the middle of his chest. His eyes stare glassily. She stares at the Chinese man and reaches out to close Maitland's eyes, but a man's hand does it for her. She eyes the man, her hand poised near Maitland's face. Members of staff hover in the corners of the room. The house is shrouded in a cloud of dust and smoke, a big blaze but tiny in the vast landscape.",
    "158": "Gandhi is approaching with Nehru and Azad, with Pyarelal trailing close behind. Azad and Pyarelal come out on the porch behind Nehru. As Gandhi nears the car, a Hindu youth with a black flag calls to him. They are all awed, timid even in his presence, and the mood of their gathering has changed altogether. Gandhi looks at the youth and the line of others, sweeping them sternly with his eyes, showing all his fatigue and strain. He lowers his head and moves on to the car, where Kallenbach holds the door for him, with Nehru, Azad, and Pyarelal following. As they get into the car, we see the car that sits by the two trucks that have brought the youths. In the back seat are two men, one of whom is Prakash. Jinnah is on the small balcony of an elaborate room, looking down in a slightly supercilious manner, impeccably dressed as usual. He has been looking at Gandhi, who sits on the floor of the large room some distance from him, just lifting his head from prayers. Nehru, Patel, and Azad are on the same side of the room as Gandhi. They rise from prayer as Jinnah comes down the steps to them. Gandhi hesitates, then begins, and Jinnah has drawn himself up, his vanity too great not to be touched by that prospect. He measures Gandhi to see that he is sincere, and when satisfied, turns slowly to Nehru, Patel, and Azad. Nehru glances at Patel, all taken by surprise by the offer and not feeling what Gandhi feels. Nehru looks hesitantly at Gandhi. It bears the stamp of undeniable truth. Gandhi's eyes sag with despair, as if his last hope, his faith, has crumbled around him. Gandhi stares numbly at him. On a platform in the foreground, Mountbatten and Nehru are present as a band plays the Indian National Anthem loudly, and there's the roar of a tremendous crowd as India's flag is raised on the flagpole. On another platform, Jinnah and a British plenipotentiary are present as a band plays the new Pakistani National Anthem loudly, and there's the roar of a tremendous crowd as Pakistan's flag is raised. The little flagpole is empty, the rope dangling, flapping loosely down the pole. Gandhi sits on the porch of his bungalow, spinning, the hum of the spinning wheel audible. Inside, we can just see Mirabehn spinning too, but apart from that, he is alone; the whole ashram seems deserted.",
    "17": "Carolyn sits at a table, lost in thought, with two menus on the table. After a moment, Buddy Kane, the Real Estate King, joins her, and Carolyn immediately becomes warm and gracious. She smiles, genuinely touched that he remembers her name, and picks up her menu mechanically, continuing to stare at Buddy, enraptured. Ricky stands with his DIGICAM, videotaping a DEAD BIRD decomposing on the ground. The camera jerks up to discover Jane and Angela staring at us, and Angela looks at Jane, trying not to laugh, then falls out of frame as we zoom toward Jane. Ricky lowers the Digicam, and Angela starts off, but Jane doesn't follow while Ricky smiles at her. Angela stops and stares at her. In another scene, Carolyn and Buddy are in the middle of sex. Meanwhile, Lester is driving, smoking a joint in his TOYOTA CAMRY, cruising through the streets. Lester turns down the volume on the stereo, pulls the car around to the WINDOW, where a teenage GIRL wearing a headset is waiting, pays her, and notices a SIGN in the corner of the window as she hands him his food. Lester sits at a booth with the MANAGER, a greasy kid wearing a white short sleeve shirt and a tie covered with the Mr. Smiley's logo, who looks over Lester's application, baffled. Later, Carolyn and Buddy are in bed, post-sex, laughing. Carolyn sits up, eager to learn from the master, and quickly picks up her cue, kissing him and ready for another round. Ricky and Jane walk along without speaking; he seems comfortable with the silence while she doesn't. They stop walking and after a beat, an automobile FUNERAL PROCESSION appears and begins to pass them slowly, which they watch. Barbara Fitts sits at the kitchen table, staring off into space as if hypnotized, while Ricky enters, followed by Jane. Barbara's eyes flutter and she turns to him slowly, with Jane glancing around at the spotless room where GLASS CASES filled with GUNS line the walls. Ricky crosses to a built-in CABINET behind the desk, unlocks it, and opens it, revealing shelves stacked with WAR MEMORABILIA. He reaches into the cabinet, carefully removes an oval CHINA PLATTER, and hands it to Jane, who examines it closely. On the bottom of the plate, a small SWASTIKA is imprinted in the center. Ricky puts the platter back into the cabinet and shuts the door, noticing Jane looking at him oddly, and studies her. Finally, we're in an empty parking lot on a cold, gray day, with something floating across from us: an empty, wrinkled, white PLASTIC BAG.",
    "98": "Forrest continues to speak into the microphone as the crowd grows restless. Hilary plugs in the right patch cord, and Forrest looks at the massive crowd, who are silent. Abbie Hoffman steps over to Forrest, pats him on the shoulder, raises his fist into the air, and the crowd cheers. Abbie steps away from Forrest. Jenny wades out into the reflection pool and waves her hand into the air. Forrest recognizes her and rushes off the stage as Jenny makes her way out into the pool. Forrest jumps down into the crowd and runs. Jenny smiles as she tries to run through the water, and the crowd parts as Forrest runs into the pool. Jenny rushes toward him, and the massive crowd cheers for the embracing couple in the pool. Forrest and Jenny walk past the protesters who are camping out on the lawn. Forrest stands at an open window and looks at the White House. A Black Panther, named RUBEN, steps over and pulls the shades down. Another Black Panther named MASAI grabs Forrest and pats him down. Jenny rushes over to Forrest and pulls Forrest off Wesley. Jenny tries to help Wesley as he moans on the floor, but Wesley knocks Jenny's hand away and gets up, holding his bloody lip. Jenny steps out the door as Forrest picks up his hat, and the group of Black Panthers glare at Forrest. Forrest turns and walks out of the room as protesters hold a candlelight vigil behind them. Forrest and Jenny walk past the White House in silence. Jenny touches Forrest's uniform as she stands in the rain, hitchhiking. A car pulls over to pick her up, and Jenny and other girls get into the car. A hippie gives Jenny a sugar cube of acid as they sit in front of a roaring fire. Jenny and two other girls sing on the sidewalk and collect change from the passersby as Jenny plays the guitar. Forrest and Jenny walk through the park, and Jenny carries a backpack as she prepares to board a bus back to Berkeley. Forrest looks down at Jenny and pulls his Medal of Honor from around his neck, placing it in Jenny's hand. Jenny looks up at him, and they hug each other. Wesley waits for Jenny as she turns and walks up to him, and they walk toward the entrance of the bus. Forrest smiles as Jenny looks at him. Jenny climbs up into the bus, and Wesley glares at Forrest. Jenny, through the near window of the bus, knocks on the window. Forrest turns and looks as Jenny waves to him. Forrest looks up and smiles sadly. Jenny gives Forrest the peace sign as the bus pulls away, and Forrest gives Jenny the peace sign in return.",
    "67": "The dog yawns and shakes its head. The phone receiver slams into the cradle. The rumpled figure slowly sits up and remains motionless. He musses his hair and stands. The rumpled figure lays down on the bed. It is the face of Dante, and this is Dante's room; this is Dante's life. Dante grabs the dog and wrestles it. The dog licks water from the toilet. The dog stands and wags its tail. A towel-dressed Dante opens the fridge and peers inside. We now see his face. He grabs a half-empty gallon of milk and closes the door. One scoop, two scoops, three scoops, four scoops; chocolate milk mix is heaped into a tumbler. Dante gulps his breakfast. A hand grabs keys from atop a VCR. The car pulls up, with a screech. Feet descend to the ground from the open door. Keys jam into a lock and pop it open. Dante lifts the metal shutter revealing the door. Suddenly, the lights flick on, revealing the glorious interior of the convenience store. A very dark room is barely lit by the daylight. The cat looks at Dante as he passes the camera quickly. The paper bundle is snapped open with scissors. He opens it and grabs two bundles of papers, throwing them inside the store. One rack remains empty. Newspapers slam into the appropriate racks. A coffee filter is placed in a metal pot. Ground coffee follows, and the mix is shoved into place in the coffeemaker. The switch is flicked, and the machine comes to life. The empty newspaper rack with the heading Asbury Park Press seems out of place among all the other stacks of papers. Dante is puzzled and annoyed. He rolls his eyes as it occurs to him. He takes a step back to grab the coin. The register pops open, and a hand extracts a quarter. Through murky glass and thin metal grating, we see Dante approach. He stops and drops a quarter in the slot. He pulls the door down, finally allowing us a clear view as he reaches toward the camera. Dante pulls a stack of newspapers from the Asbury Park Press vending machine. He struggles to hold them all in one hand as he lets the door slam shut. He turns to walk away, but the sound of the quarter dropping into the change slot stops him. The papers drop into the once-empty rack with a resounding flop. The quarter drops back into the register drawer. The lock is gummed up with gum or something hard and obtrusive like gum, preventing the key from being inserted. Dante tries to jam the key into the window shutter lock. He looks down at it. Dante looks around and kicks the shutter angrily.",
    "1013": "The Queen looks at notes on the palace gates, one of which is a crying face, and after reading the third message, she looks down but turns to face the crowd with a grateful smile before turning back to the notes. She flinches, quickly composes herself, and moves on as the crowd of onlookers watches her looking at the flowers. The Queen looks increasingly upset as she tries to maintain her composure but keeps moving along, looking at more flowers and notes. She stops, turns back to the crowd, and smiles before walking up to the barriers to meet the people. Various young women stand at the front, and the Queen moves slowly along and smiles at them. She stops in front of a little girl who holds a bouquet of flowers, which the girl hands to the Queen, and the Queen smiles and continues to move along. A group of older women curtsy as the Queen passes them, and as she walks, Prince Philip follows close by, with more women curtsying as she moves along. In an ornate hall, Robin walks past some TV lighting and camera equipment and approaches the Queen, who sits on a sofa next to Philip. The Queen takes a pen from her purse and writes on a sheet of paper, walks to a nearby table, puts the sheet down, studies it for a moment, and then walks up to a podium that has been placed in front of a window. Philip strolls to another side of the room and watches the TV crew and the Queen as a young makeup woman applies powder to the Queen's nose with crowds visible outside the window. Video footage outside Buckingham Palace shows that the TV lights are set up inside a hall in Buckingham Palace. Back inside, Charles enters and stands next to Prince Philip, while the makeup woman finishes applying powder to the Queen's face. The Queen then puts on her spectacles, and Charles takes a seat while Prince Philip remains standing. Charles watches on a monitor while the Queen Mother, Tony, and Cherie are seen watching the broadcast on their TVs. Cherie turns to Tony with disbelief and gently shakes her head as Tony watches the TV intently while the Queen stares blankly into the TV camera. Video footage at night shows a procession of cars driving on a road lined with crowds of people, with camera flashes going off continuously. The crowds swarm around the vehicles as they slowly move along. On Saturday, a white helicopter flies through the clear daylight sky, and video footage shows a large park packed with thousands of people, with the crowd facing a pair of giant video screens that stand at one side of the park.",
    "22": "In a corner booth, four big Transit Authority police are having a meal together. Cheryl looks at his utensils. The manager comes over, gesturing to the table of police that he can handle it. All attention is on Melvin. Melvin looks at the police, sizes up the hopeless situation, and rises. Melvin, ever the sharp observer, looks from the cab to see slices of community life -- men in front of a bar, parents giving their child a ride on a mechanical horse outside a local store -- two young women discuss dating. Carol opens the door just as he arrives on her landing. She holds a container of ice, washcloths, and a thermometer. Melvin ignores the question, instead answering a charge he had imagined she might make. Spencer just stares at him. She closes the door in his face, then walks to her son and leads him back to his room. The camera moves toward mother and son sitting on the edge of Spencer's bed. She holds a digital thermometer to his ear. They both count down the seconds. As they settle in and drive off. As Carol enters the hospital. Verdell lies just inside the front door whimpering for Melvin. Jackie sits across from Simon's wheelchair. She has some index cards in her lap which she occasionally consults and shuffles. Simon forces his attention to Jackie as their conversation continues -- the dog is distressed. Verdell walks out on the terrace and looks off. He turns for. Verdell hides behind a chair. As Jackie looks at him then thumbs for a card, the woman is tall, attractive, etc. She nods, pissed, waves, and leaves. As Melvin waits, Zoe summons her moxie. The fan is jolted as the elevator doors open and close. A depleted, exhausted Carol approaches her home. She is suddenly wary. As Carol breaks into a run. As she bounds the stairs, comes to her apartment door, and jiggles with the keys, a strange prescient whimpering sound coming from her. As she enters the apartment, the worst confirmed, she moves down the narrow hallway, her innards squirting the same chemicals that drive elk on opening day of the hunting season. Beverly, Carol's mother, enters the room. She is ebullient which, if life allowed, would be her natural state. Bettes' reaction to her mother adds a saving grace. As we approach the doctor and Carol seated across from each other at a small table, Carol looks at her mother -- they share a laugh. Beverly has a hard time stopping. Simon practices walking using his cane. A tearstained Nora hugs him goodbye. Nora, holding her things, knocks on Melvin's door. Melvin opens the door. Nora is still sniffling.",
    "765": "The stock keeper man looks up from behind a counter at the far end of the shop and peers toward Elijah. He puts something away, walks out from the counter, and heads down the aisle towards Elijah. He has thick, curly hair, wears black jeans and a black Motorhead T-shirt. He stops halfway down the aisle. Joseph is playing with two toy figures, a caped superhero and a green reptilian villain. Audrey joins David, watching their son. David, who's been leaning on the wall behind Joseph, unfolds his arms and puts his hands in his pockets and looks at Audrey. In the shop, the assistant peers down at Elijah, his head swaying from side to side, looking for a reaction. Finally, he walks around to the back of Elijah's chair, takes the handles, and starts to wheel it down the aisle, maneuvering carefully between the heavily stacked shelves and displays. Suddenly, Elijah wrenches a wheel and the chair slews into a display, making magazines fall from it. The assistant looks at Elijah as if about to speak, his hands moving feebly, but Elijah, slumped in his chair, ignores him. The assistant starts pushing again until Elijah wrenches the other wheel, prompting the assistant to step back, raising his hands as if in surrender. He looks down at Elijah, who still stares sullenly ahead, and they set off again between the racks of comics and related toys. The assistant leaves Elijah by the display he's run into, where Elijah's hand, protected by a padded black mitten, carefully lifts it up. The cover shows a powerfully built hero in blue, racing towards a gaggle of shadowy demonic figures, and he holds it out towards the assistant who's at the counter on the telephone. Meanwhile, David and Audrey are sitting at a bar, facing each other and gazing at each other very still. The babysitter is present as David gives the girl money. She turns toward the door and sees the rain streaming down the window, throws a little brown jacket over her hair, and leaves. David runs his hand over his head while Audrey leans against the pillar at the foot of the stairs, looking at him, one hand holding his coat, the other in his pocket. She nods, turns, and goes. He throws his coat over the back of the sofa. The green light on the answering machine flashes in a dark room as David walks in from the unlit landing and presses a button. Outside, headlights blaze through the teeming rain as a car stops before a chain link fence. The driver's door opens and a caped and hooded figure walks to the fence, looks to his left, stands for a moment as a black shape against the headlights, hesitates, then grasps at links above his head and begins to climb.",
    "955": "They cycle by a road as Joe looks down awkwardly. The old yellow Coupe pulls up and Louis gets out, with Joe and Alice watching him intensely. Louis walks over to them, removes his shades, and, with heavy sideburns, steps inside the house, then immediately comes back out. Alice follows Louis back into the house, leaving an awkward looking Joe standing on the veranda, but she comes back out to Joe, who looks surprised and steps towards her. Filming a scene, Martin shoots zombie Cary as Alice watches, with the wrecked train in the distance behind them. Joe takes the camera and sets it up to film the crash site in the distance while news crew helicopters hover in the air above the scene. The film makers look down at the destruction, and Joe looks down with a troubled expression. At the crash site, Air Force personnel are busy clearing up the cargo of strange white cubes, repacking them into crates, which are loaded onto military lorries. Joe's dad Jack is there with Air Force Colonel Nelec, who goes, leaving Jack unsatisfied as he looks around and sees men carefully making a plaster of Paris mold. Back at the police station, he talks to Sheriff Pruitt, who goes, leaving Jack looking nonplussed. The sheriff drives his car into a gas station and pulls up by the pumps. He goes into the shop and finds the clerk playing with a new Sony Walkman; Breen can't hear him, so the sheriff lobs a candy bar at him. The sheriff pays for his petrol and the candy bar, then goes back outside, fills his patrol car, and opens the candy bar. His attention is caught by some odd noises and he looks around, surprised, as a pack of dogs runs across the filling station forecourt. The sheriff's patrol car starts malfunctioning, prompting him to check it out. Hearing something move nearby, the sheriff goes to investigate, keeping a hand on his gun. He nearly leaps out of his skin as a dumpster flies past him, while in the shop, Breen is oblivious as his Walkman drowns out all the sound. Over his shoulder, the sheriff's car jolts violently. Suddenly, the lights flicker and Breen looks round, pulling his headphones off as he looks out of the window. The lights continue flickering as Breen, looking apprehensive, slowly makes his way outside to find the front of the sheriff's car smashed in by a violent impact. Breen walks around the wrecked patrol car, observing steam rising from its ruptured radiator, and picks the petrol pump's nozzle out of a large pool of gasoline on the ground. Hearing something behind him, he turns around and looks completely terrified.",
    "968": "As the mustached stranger waits to cross a busy intersection, he checks his wristwatch, which reads 7:06. He makes a flicking motion, causing David's coffee to slosh. As the lovely woman wipes coffee off her legs, a taxi hits the stranger, and the cabbie stops his car to rush to the fallen man. The stranger opens the book, revealing a line traveling at right angles across a map. Outside, he watches the bus drive off, and his book shows the line moving towards a pulsing red dot. He runs after the bus, but on board, she tries to tip David's cup. She grabs his phone, answers, and drops it into his coffee, which bubbles as the phone rings. David extracts his phone and she wipes it on her skirt. Outside, the mustached stranger hurries across a street as the bus stops. Elise climbs off and turns to David, who stands in the doorway as the doors close. Elise grins at him through a window and, with a mocking frown, she flips him off. Smiling, he watches her head away, then sits again, placing his coffee in the seat beside him. He eyes Elise's number on the back of one of his business cards and makes a call, then hangs up. Later, he pushes the revolving door of an office building and enters a vacant lobby. As he passes between two waist-high security scanners, he holds his card to the top of one and strides to an elevator. Emerging in a reception area, the receptionist's gaze remains down, her hand holding a phone to her ear. As he steps past another receptionist, her eyes remain ahead. Hurrying past two men standing in a corridor and a third sitting in a waiting area, he enters the conference room. Inside, men in shiny black body suits and visored helmets work on his colleagues, who stand frozen in time. Two men scan Charlie's face with wand-like devices. Two men in hats look over, and one is the mustached stranger's superior. David races out, and glancing back, he sees the helmeted men close behind. Sprinting to the reception area, he passes his frozen coworkers as more men join the chase. David runs up some stairs, finding the lead man at the top. As David races down a corridor, the white-haired boss opens a door off the hall and walks through. Turning a corner, David sees the man in front of him, and taking another corridor, he finds the man waiting at its end. Several of the helmeted men close in, and David doubles back, hurrying into Charlie's office and locking the door. He closes a second door leading to a small conference room, then picks up a phone and waits.",
    "62": "Evelyn is wearing jeans that are lathered white on the inside of the thighs and laced with brown horsehair, as well as riding boots, and despite perspiring a little, she looks younger than she did in the office. Gittes is a little taken aback at seeing Evelyn as the Chinese Butler appears on the veranda, nods, and disappears. Evelyn sits at a glass-topped table, and Gittes joins her. The iced tea comes on a tray which Ramon sets down between them. Evelyn looks up, and Gittes smiles a little sheepishly and then laughs a little nervously, nodding. Gittes drives up a winding road, following a flood channel up into the parched hills, reaching the entrance to the reservoir where a rescue truck is parked. The chain link fence with its KEEP OUT sign is open, and there are people milling around. The reservoir is below, and Gittes' car is stopped by a couple of uniformed police. He fishes out one of Yelburton's cards from his handkerchief pocket and hands it to the guard, driving past through the gate along the reservoir. Gittes stops and gets out of the car, spotting a police car and an unmarked one, with several men with their backs turned, one talking quietly, staring down into the reservoir where other men in small skiffs are apparently dredging for something. One of the men turns and sees Gittes, visibly shocked, as Loach tries to ease him down the path, and at the sound of his raised voice, a man standing at the edge of the channel, talking to two boys in swimming trunks, turns around, resulting in both Gittes and Escobar registering considerable surprise at seeing one another. The men around them are extremely uneasy as they walk a couple of steps, with Gittes reaching into his pocket to pull out his cigarette case, to which Escobar nods and finally smiles. The other police, two plainclothesmen and a uniformed officer, watch them. Escobar points down to the reservoir where a couple of men using poles with hooks are fishing about in the water and manage to hook something, revealing the soaking back of a man's coat, then start to pull the body into the skiff, standing over the body of Mulwray. Escobar has the sheet drawn back, then drops it as Evelyn nods. Escobar and Evelyn move a few feet to one side and whisper, almost as though they were trying to keep the corpse from hearing them, then move slowly toward the door. Evelyn looks at Escobar but doesn't know how to answer him, and Escobar nods while Gittes has been sitting on a wooden bench, smoking and listening.",
    "154": "Gandhi stands on the steps of Kingsley Hall in the East End of London, being greeted by a cheering crowd, with the now gray-haired Charlie Andrews beaming possessively at his side. Gandhi, dressed in his dhoti, waves to a small crowd as he enters the gates of Buckingham Palace. He takes his seat at the conference table among the formally dressed delegates, some Maharajahs elaborately so. A gavel is struck, and Ramsay MacDonald begins his opening address, wearing his white suit and black-ribboned pince-nez. Gandhi sits on a wicker chair with Nehru and Patel leaning against the railing, while Azad and Kripalani sit on the floor like Gandhi. As Gandhi winds up what he has done and starts to rise, he moves toward the steps, stops, and looks at Patel with a wry, gentle smile before looking at Jinnah and shrugging. Jinnah takes it less philosophically, and his eyes burn with anger as he watches Gandhi head for the young girl with the injured goat. Gandhi moves with the stream of passengers disembarking from the Third Class section, with Ba and Mirabehn struggling along behind him, accompanied by Desai and Pyarelal. A British captain stands before a full platoon of Indian troops, and as Gandhi approaches, a British Lt. Colonel and his Adjutant move out from one side of the troops. Gandhi stops, looks up at him and the troops, then shakes his head with a weary grin. The British Colonel signals back to the troops, and as a detail marches up, the colonel's adjutant speaks gently to Ba, who stares at him belligerently, leaving him flummoxed. The colonel and his adjutant stride toward the exit of the station, followed by a detail of six soldiers accompanying Gandhi, then another detail of six soldiers accompanying Ba, and another accompanying Mirabehn. A jeep driven by an American lieutenant with a woman dressed in an American War Correspondent's uniform, Margaret Bourke-White, as the passenger, bounces along the road. As the jeep passes the camera, the view pans to see the walls of a palace ahead, with Bourke-White staring at the palace, absorbing the experience with the appetite of her breed and her own particular sensitivity. Gandhi sits by a window that is grilled rather than barred, spinning in a shaft of light and looking off, as the sound of a camera click and the rustle of movement is heard, while his hair, only half-gray in London, is now white.",
    "1273": "She turns to Aberforth, and he nods. Hermione turns to face Harry, and they continue staring at the painting. Hermione screws up her eyes and peers closely, and they step back slightly. The girl resumes her position in the portrait, and the whole frame opens like a door, revealing the entrance to a tunnel. In the tunnel, Neville's face is bruised and battered. A painting with a gold frame reveals a long, dark passage with a pinprick of light in the distance. Neville turns to the others and opens the gold-framed painting. Neville steps aside, revealing Harry, who sees a hoard of students in a large room strung with hammocks. He steps down, and they take it in turn to hug him. Neville approaches a student, who runs to a radio. Harry shifts uncomfortably and turns to the expectant faces as Ginny Weasley rushes into the room, ignoring Ron. Everyone turns to Harry. At the grand staircase at Hogwarts, lines of students, closely watched by Death Eater Amycus Carrow, march across the courtyard and tramp down the staircase towards the great hall. Staff and students are assembled in the hall as Severus Snape strides between the rows and stands at the front. With Amycus Carrow and his sister, Alecto, on either side of him, Snape slowly turns to face the gathering. Students turn to each other as he stalks between them. The students who met Harry, including Cho, Ginny, and Seamus, stand looking at the floor. One student wearing a gown steps forward to stand in front of Snape. Ron, Hermione, the Weasleys, Shacklebolt, and Remus march in. Snape draws his wand, but Professor McGonagall pushes Harry aside and faces the headmaster. Those at the door also raise their wands. McGonagall fires a burst of energy, and Snape repels McGonagall's ferocious assault. The Carrows are hauled, hit by the deflected energy. Spinning, Snape twists his black cloak around himself and swirls up towards the high window. He flies off. Harry discards his gown as torches burn and students celebrate. Harry sits down suddenly, and McGonagall goes to him as the room darkens. Ashen-faced, Harry is wide-eyed and tense, and the students look up apprehensively. The sky is dark with ominous clouds, and McGonagall stares anxiously. Harry steps towards the screaming girl, then a second girl screams as the gray gloom vanishes and the flaming torches in the great hall burn brightly again. The students move away from Harry, but Ginny immediately moves protectively in front of him. Hermione steps up, as do more students. Filch, the caretaker, runs in, and Harry strides up to McGonagall. On his way out, Harry stops and then leads the way out of the hall. Characters abandon the portraits and scuttle away as students rush down the stairs. Harry fights his way up through them, handing Ron the Marauder's Map as he sets off again.",
    "692": "In a science lab, the small black globule slips off the microscope and makes a beeline for Peter, who traps it under a glass. Peter comes home, crosses to his Spider-Man suit hanging on a rail and reaches for it. He hesitates and looks down at the battered black trunk on the floor, crouches down, lifts the lid, and contemplates the black spider suit inside. Moments later, black-suited Spider-Man drops from a skyscraper, a thread flashes out from his wrist, and he swings across the city. An overturned taxi stands outside the blown open doors of a bank as Black Spider-Man lands on the street and sees a trail of sand slithering down the grating. Eddie Brock jumps out of a car, camera ready, as Black Spider-Man tears the heavy grill from the ground and smashes Brock's camera, then jumps down the manhole. Brock glares down the manhole shaft after Black-suited Spider-Man as escort cars start arriving and surreptitiously takes out another smaller camera. Flint Marko strides along the tracks of a subway tunnel, carrying two clear sacks of banknotes when a flash of light reveals Black Spider-Man crawling along the ceiling behind him. Flint turns and looks up, but the shaft of light vanishes, and he sees nothing before he turns and carries on walking as Black Spider-Man hovers upside down in front of him. Spider-Man gives Flint's fist, touches stripes on a train, and leaps on Flint, causing him to tumble off the track into a deep tunnel and drop the money onto a track far below. Black Spider-Man swings at Flint on a thread, but Flint takes him away to the park of a train. Black Spider-Man swings away to the gird as an archways, flying back to drop kick Flint into the side of a train, grinding Flint's head against the side of the passing train like cheese on a grater. Flint drops to his knees, briefly becomes Sandman, and sends Black Spider-Man ricocheting between two passing trains. Spider-Man thumps Flint, knocking sandy lumps out of his face, and both he and Flint fall down a white shaft, landing on a pipe halfway down, which breaks, causing Flint to land in a muddy puddle close to his money. He reaches for it, but his arm has turned to damp sand, and he recoils in horror, watching as his hand disintegrates. Above him, Black Spider-Man lands on a ledge, swings down onto a huge water pipe, and tears up the pipe, causing jets of water to spring from the red holes. Flint watches in horror as a torrent of water sweeps him away down the concrete's loose, slamming him up against the grating as the water rushes past, dissolving his sandy body.",
    "1108": "The huge giant leaves the room, and Harry looks at him uncertainly, then shakes his head. A pure white landscape emerges as high-stepping white horses trot out of the snow-covered forest, drawing handsome sleighs full of students well-wrapped against the cold. In the Great Hall, now decorated with tall Christmas trees, the ceiling reflects the weather outside, and huge snowflakes float above the heads of the students sitting at the long, polished dining tables. Harry and Ron are sitting by themselves at the end of one of the tables when Hermione carries her meal down the hall and sits opposite them. She holds up two cakes. Later, followed by Harry, Ron peers around a statue in the corridor, makes sure the coast is clear, and lifts his crooked wand. Harry waves his wand, and the two cakes float into the air. Harry and Ron hide as Crabbe and Goyle appear with armfuls of cake. They see the floating cakes, grab them, and start to eat them, greedily smacking their lips and stuffing the cakes into their mouths. They suddenly stop chewing as their eyes roll up, and they both fall over backward and hit the floor. Later, in the girls' lavatory, Hermione fills three glasses and hands one to Harry and one to Ron. They look at their thick sludge suspiciously and put the hairs into the potion. Ron pulls a face, and clinking glasses, they all drink at once. Ron takes a swig and heads for the nearest cubicle, followed by Hermione. Harry drops his glass and clutches his stomach in agony. He staggers to the marble sink and leans on it. Looking down, he sees the skin on his hands begin to bulge and bubble, and when Harry looks into the mirror, his face is also erupting. As he watches, he gradually turns into podgy Goyle. He lifts his hand and touches his beefy face with plump fingers. Pleased with the transformation, Harry smiles, then turns and sees Ron coming out of the cubicle, transformed into fat-faced, dumpy Crabbe. They stare at each other. In a dark corridor, Percy Weasley spots them, and Draco Malfoy stares at Harry, then glares at Percy, giving him a withering look. In the Slytherin common room, Draco slumps onto a leather sofa. Looking around nervously, Harry and Ron sit opposite him. Ron clenches his fist, and Harry nudges Ron. Draco stares at Harry, then gets to his feet and looks down at him ominously. To Harry's relief, Draco backs off. Ron looks at Harry with surprise, picks up a small parcel, and shakes it. Harry shakes his head, and Draco puts the parcel in his pocket. Ron springs up, and Harry warns Ron, who looks at him in dismay as Harry touches his forehead where his scar is reappearing.",
    "601": "Harry gets up, takes something from the overhead luggage rack, goes out of the compartment, and walks along the corridor, hiding it behind his back. The train steams across a vast, brown landscape illuminated by the evening sun. Harry stops to let two girls pass and sees Draco in an open carriage with seats on either side, looking thoughtful as he glances down at the Peruvian Darkness Powder in his hand. Suddenly, darkness engulfs the carriage. Summoned by Pansy and Blaise, a surly boy with short-cropped hair, Draco sits down opposite them and glances up to see his briefcase move slightly on the luggage rack. As Hagrid stands swinging a lantern on the Hogwarts platform when the express pulls up, its headlight cuts through the darkness. Pansy and Blaise wait for Draco at the carriage door and finally leave their compartment, while Ron and Hermione leave theirs. Draco pulls his briefcase from the luggage rack, heads for the door to the next carriage, slides it shut, and pulls down the blind. All the blinds close, and something falls from the rack, crashing to the floor. Draco pulls off the invisibility cloak, revealing Harry immobilized and staring, stamps on him, flings the cloak back over Harry, and walks out of the carriage. He steps onto the almost deserted platform, glances along it, and steam rises as he walks away. Someone walks through the train, viewing it as if through a rose-tinted kaleidoscope, with pink and mauve shapes swirling. The carriage door opens, and it's Luna, wearing the blue and white Spectrespecs advertised in the Quibbler. She sees a cloud of silvery dust hovering above the floor and pulls out her wand. The invisibility cloak is removed, and Harry snaps out of the immobility spell as Luna raises her specs. Harry's nose is broken and bloody when they reach the school gates. Flitwick erects an invisible shield across the gates as Luna and Harry watch Draco snatch his walking stick from Filch, smirk at Harry, and walk away, with Snape following him. Luna raises her wand, and Harry's swollen and misshapen nose returns to normal, though blood remains on his upper lip, chin, and t-shirt. In the Great Hall, Ron is guzzling jelly and cream until Hermione hits him with a book, and Harry walks towards them. Dumbledore steps up to the lectern, a gilded owl on the front of it stretches its wings, and Ginny wipes blood from Harry's face. Professor Slughorn, in a gown and mortarboard, acknowledges the applause. Draco stares glumly ahead while Slytherins celebrate around him as the students glance at one another. Draco rests his chin on his hand, lost in thought, and remains seated.",
    "1060": "Jenny smiles as she looks around the glamorous hall and all the table lamps while Helen and Danny exchange a worried look. David glances at Jenny, who freezes, but then she smiles happily and applauds the singer, keeping her eyes on the stage. Danny and Helen talk together as Jenny watches the glamorous couple. As David looks at her, she glances back at him and smiles self-consciously, while Helen and Danny are completely wrapped up in one another. Jenny smiles at David, and they both laugh; she grins happily to herself. Later, Jenny arrives home, cautiously opens the door, and walks quietly in. Her mother is in the kitchen and gives a non-committal nod before returning to her casserole. Margarie glances over her shoulder, and Jenny trudges sadly from the kitchen. The next day, David waits by his car outside the school as Jenny hurries out, having changed out of her school uniform. They both grin as she gets into the passenger seat and David gets behind the wheel, driving the Bristol off to the auction. At the auction, Danny smiles knowingly as a woman shakes her head, while Jenny reaches with excitement and David grins. Later, at Danny's palatial place filled with art and luxury furniture, Helen turns and stares at Jenny, and they shake on something. Later, they're in David's car parked in a part of town with tall townhouses. David takes his hat and approaches a family waiting with baggage on the corner. Jenny smiles as she watches his easy manner while he slings a young lad under one arm and helps with the bags. David shows the family in through a wooden front door as an older woman peers out from behind some curtains, and Jenny looks up at her. Jenny leans forward, opens the glove box, takes out a packet of cigarettes, lights one, and watches David return to the car. Later, Jenny slumps onto her desk at home, looking stunned at her mother. She goes to a café with friends, where Graham cycles up and scrimmages, trying to laugh it off. Jenny emerges from her bedroom onto a landing and listens to her parents talking downstairs, looking wistful and suppressing a giggle. Helen is putting a scarf in Jenny's hair, and Jenny, now wearing Helen's little bright dress, smiles nervously. She wears a stylish coat and has her hair neatly done up as Danny and David stand and admire the effect. They drive through the countryside in David's Bristol, with the sun shining on the palatial stone buildings of Oxford, and Jenny stares at the spires. Helen shutters, and later they're in a pub, where Jenny grins and closes the book. Later, she is getting ready for bed, with David fully clothed on the bed, as she comes out of the bathroom.",
    "61": "Gittes drops it and finds a set of keys, an old phone book, and a menu from a Water Department lunch at the Biltmore Hotel in 1913. He spots a shadow looming in front of the translucent pane and enters the room, followed by an anxious secretary. Gittes nods and follows Yelburton out through the outer office to his smaller office down the hall, which features a lacquered marlin mounted on the wall, a couple of pictures of Yelburton with yellowtail and other fish, and a small burgee of a fish with the initials A.C. tacked onto the wall. Gittes spots a card tray on Yelburton's desk, fishes a couple of cards off the tray, and puts them in his handkerchief pocket. As he goes out the door, he nearly runs into a man standing by the secretary's desk, about Gittes' age but taller and wider, dressed in a plain suit that fits him poorly. Mulvihill stares at Gittes with unblinking eyes, then moves toward him, shaking with fury, but Yelburton steps between them and rings the bell. A powerful Chinese butler with heavy hair and a half-jacket of gold on one tooth answers the door. Gittes hands the butler a card from his wallet, and the butler takes it and disappears, leaving Gittes standing in the doorway. Gittes stands and sweats, watching a Japanese gardener trim a hedge. A chauffeur is washing down a cream-colored Packard with a chamois, causing steam to rise off the hood, and the squeaking comes from the chamois. Gittes looks behind him as the Chinese butler gestures for him to follow. He follows, trying to check out the rooms as he goes, passing a maid cleaning in the den. They pass through French doors along a trellised walkway to a large pond with running water. After a moment, the gardener returns, smiles at Gittes, and probes into the pond, dropping the long probe after the waters recede, revealing the overflowing pond. It becomes very quiet except for the running water, leaving Gittes standing by the pond. There's something gleaming in the bottom of it, and the gardener nods before leaving, leaving Gittes staring at the gleaming object. Gittes notes it, looks at the tool the gardener was using, hesitates, and starts to probe into the pond himself, toward the gleaming object. He spots Evelyn rounding a turn and coming down the trellised pathway, so he casually belts the probe and holds onto it for poise.",
    "544": "The Sinister Man clicks his heels and bows quickly. Brody takes off his hat. The man turns and joins a Second Man. Brody and Sallah follow them. The Second Man overhears Sallah. He and his companion turn quickly. Sallah puts Brody's luggage down and glances at Brody. Sallah pats his clothing, searching for his papers. Sallah laughs and pulls out a newspaper. Brody looks confused. Sallah shows the newspaper to the Second Man. Sallah puts the newspaper in front of the Second Man's face, then punches him through the newspaper. Donovan leads Vogel out. The Nazi Guards follow. Once they are gone, Elsa turns to Indy. She runs her hand down the side of his face. Indy and Henry are still tied back-to-back, of course. Elsa bends to speak quietly into Indy's ear, which is near enough to Henry's ear. She smiles and kisses Indy passionately. Henry glances back and looks rather disappointed. Vogel appears to remind Elsa of her appointment. Elsa exits. Vogel stays behind for another moment. Vogel punches Indy in the jaw, a hard and vicious jab that snaps Indy's head around. Indy and Henry are pulling at the ropes with great urgency. Henry is able to wiggle his hand towards Indy's coat pocket. Indy squirms his body around towards Henry's hand. Henry's fingers open the lighter and ignite the flame. Henry yelps as the cigarette lighter burns his hand. He drops the lighter to the floor. Henry kicks at the lighter, trying to reach it, but cannot. The rug starts to burn. Finally, they turn their heads in the same direction. Indy struggles to free his hands. His foot kicks out and accidentally hits a metal grill that operates a Secret Door, where a Nazi Radioman wearing headphones sits at an elaborate panel of dials, switches, and meters, and a woman stands over a map plotting coordinates. Their backs are turned to Indy and Henry, inside the fireplace, still tied back-to-back. Indy's foot hits the grill again. Four Nazi Radiomen and the woman are still hard at work with controls and coordinates. Suddenly the woman looks up and spots Henry and Indy. She screams. Indy finally breaks free. All four Radiomen now have their guns drawn. They activate the lever and begin to rotate through the Secret Door. The Radiomen appear in the fireplace on the other side, but there is no sign of Indy and Henry. The Radiomen move cautiously toward the flame, shielding their faces with one hand, holding their guns with the other. They've hidden themselves up the chimney. And now they drop down, behind the Radiomen. One of the Radiomen grabs Indy by the neck. As they struggle, they fall against the rotating wall and disappear into the next room, leaving a frightened Henry behind.",
    "1156": "The sun breaks through the threatening storm clouds, illuminating words in spiky metal letters as the sun blazes down and a heat haze hangs over suburban London. Cars speed along a dual carriageway beside a field where the grass is scorched and dry. In a corner of the field is a neglected playground. A teenage boy, Harry Potter, walks across the field. In the playground, a boy gets off the roundabout, and everyone leaves. Harry sits on a swing lost in thought. He sees his cousin Dudley with his gang, and Harry pulls out his wand, holding it to Dudley's throat. The sky grows dark, and heavy storm clouds roll overhead, blocking out the sun as a strong wind rises, causing the gang to run off. Dudley and Harry look up as the sky grows even darker while the powerful wind blows flurries of waste paper across the playground, prompting them to run for shelter as the storm breaks and heavy rain begins to fall. Harry leads the way along a rutted cart track, with Dudley, who is overweight and finds it hard to keep up. Soaked to the skin, they find shelter in a long tunnel under the road and stop to catch their breath. Ahead of them, the grimy underpass is dimly lit by yellow lamps reflected in the puddles of water underfoot. The faulty lamps flicker and fizz, throwing an eerie yellow light along the tunnel, and the dingy concrete walls are covered with graffiti. They look around nervously, their breath visible in the icy air, when a cloaked figure swoops in and grabs Harry. As Dudley flees, his legs are knocked from under him, and an unseen force drags him along the ground. A second skeletal figure floats closer above his face. A Dementor hovers in front of Harry, forcing him against the wall with his bony fingers around his throat, attempting to suck out his life. Harry struggles desperately as a faint vapor is drawn from his face, while the second Dementor floats above Dudley, sucking vapor from him. Harry pulls out his wand and strikes his attacker, causing the Dementor to release him. Harry falls heavily, dropping his wand, but grabs it as the cloaked figure swoops again, and a powerful bright light hurls his attacker away. Dudley lies helpless beneath the other Dementor, and Harry uses his wand to hurl the dazzling light towards it, causing the creature to fly from the underpass. Traffic roars past on the road above as Harry runs to Dudley, who is semi-conscious and gasping for breath. An elderly woman wearing a plastic mac and rain hat enters the tunnel pulling a shopping trolley, prompting Harry to try and hide his wand. The elderly woman stops, and they walk home, with Harry half-carrying the stupefied Dudley to number four Privet Drive, where Aunt Petunia is watching television.",
    "1195": "Ron and Hermione follow the footprints in the snow until they reach the edge of the forest, and Ron hangs back as Hermione walks across a clearing in the trees towards the sound of crying. Falling snow deadens her footsteps. Kneeling beside her friend, Hermione puts out a hand and pulls off the invisibility cloak, revealing Harry, who looks at her miserably. A yellow butterfly flutters above the emerging snowdrops. The Whomping Willow twists its trunk and shakes the snow from its branches. In Lupin's room, Harry nods and grasps his wand. Unlocking a trunk, Lupin releases a Dementor, and Harry collapses into blackness. Chocolate. Harry nods again. Lupin opens the trunk, and a powerful silver mist flows from Harry's wand, shielding him from the terrifying power of the threatening Dementor. With determination and willpower, he gradually forces it to retreat inside the open trunk. Laughing with delight, Lupin slams down the lid. In the quadrangle, and then at the lake, Hagrid skims a stone, skims another, and then his face crumples as he hurls a stone into the water, distraught. The school corridors are dark and deserted. In the boys' dormitory, Harry is sitting up in bed eating a biscuit and reading the Marauder's Map by the light of his wand. Ron half-wakes from a bad dream, goes back to sleep. Harry tracks Filch the caretaker's footprints around the map, then spots another name, Peter Pettigrew, and he stares in surprise. Harry goes into the corridor, where an old man in a portrait shields his eyes from Harry's brightly lit wand. Harry consults the map, and as he walks along the corridor, his own name and footprints appear on the parchment. Moving cautiously, Harry shines the lighted wand into dark, empty corners and checks the map. Peter Pettigrew's footprints move erratically across the map, and Harry watches them as they run this way and that, then appear to be heading down the corridor straight towards him. He swings round in a panic, holding up the wand. He sees his own reflection in a mirror, and more portraits object to the light as Harry taps the map and puts out his wand. Snape points his lighted wand at Harry, who opens the map. Snape touches it with his wand, and writing appears on the parchment, grabbing the map. As Harry follows Lupin, the portraits glare at Snape. In a classroom, he indicates the Marauder's Map, and Lupin stares in disbelief. A crystal ball. Hermione knocks the crystal ball onto the floor, picks up her bag, and marches out of the room as the crystal ball rolls after her down the corridor. Later, on a circular staircase, carrying the crystal ball, Harry goes back up the stairs and along the corridor. He goes back into Professor Trelawney's cluttered classroom and looks around at the overstuffed furniture and shelves of teacups.",
    "786": "The light beams from a torch held aloft by a statuesque woman wearing Grecian style robes, and the logo fades away to black. A few flakes of snow gently flutter out of a night sky past a Christmas Tree made of fairy lights atop an establishment advertising itself as O'Hara's Pub, while a few people wander down the street, clutching gifts for their loved ones. Inside the pub, various groups of friends, families, and work colleagues have gathered together for a festive drink and to exchange presents. They chat and laugh, enjoying the Christmas spirit. At the far end of the bar, a seedy, unshaven man in his late 40s, wearing a Santa costume, sits alone, enjoying two glasses of an entirely different kind of spirit. Santa cuts a lonely figure as he sucks on a cigarette and calls over to the barman, then stares sadly at a group of people drinking a toast. Later, Santa lurches unsteadily up a snow-filled back alley, leans against the wall, and throws up. In a brightly lit shopping mall, a mother and her young children ride up an escalator, and at the top, one of the children stares in wonder at the lavish Santa's grotto that's been constructed. In the grotto, an elf hands a photo of a girl and Santa to her mother, and as the girl goes off, a boy of about eight walks up and sits on Santa's knee. Santa still looks seedy but has at least bothered to put his white beard on, and he shoves the boy away. A little later, Santa wets himself as his little helper wanders over. Santa pulls down his beard and swigs from a bottle of grog, then examines his pants, while his little helper shakes his head despairingly. The security guard says farewell to the last shoppers, and as Santa shuffles off, the guard keys a code into an alarm system. Up in the grotto, three snowmen sit behind statues of Mary and the baby Jesus in his crib, and the smallest snowman suddenly jumps up, but after a quick look to see the coast is clear, runs off, knocking Mary and Jesus over in the process. The snowman slides down between the escalators as the alarm system continues its arming countdown, crashes into a display at the bottom, and trots up to run through the shop. The snowman pulls the arm off of a mannequin as he goes and uses the arm to reach up and switch off the alarm before it can arm. The snowman pulls his head off, revealing Santa's profusely sweating little helper, and now in regular clothes, Santa's little helper opens a back door and finds Santa surrounded by empty beer cans.",
    "6": "Ricky walks into view, and Lester drapes his arm around Ricky as he gives him the money; from the waist up, Lester looks naked. Ricky, with wet hair from the rain, puts the cash in his pocket while Lester's arm remains draped around his shoulder. Grinning, Ricky squats down and reaches under the weight bench as Lester sits in the bowl chair, leans back with his hands behind his head, and watches Ricky roll the joint. From the Colonel's point of view, Lester leans back in his chair, and we can only see Ricky's back and shoulders as he rolls the joint, causing the Colonel's face to tighten. After a moment, Lester's jaw drops, and he throws his head back, making it appear as though Ricky is giving him a blow job from our perspective; the Colonel watches incredulously. Then, as we hear a car approaching, the Colonel glances over to see Angela's BMW pulling into the driveway, stopping behind Lester's Firebird. As Angela and Jane get out and run toward the house, our focus moves back to the garage window, where Ricky stands, looking a little panicked, as Lester pulls on his T-shirt and both he and Ricky cross out of view. Jane and Angela enter, with Jane frowning when she sees Lester, who leans nonchalantly against the counter, trying to remain cool and doing so successfully. Jane rolls her eyes and exits, while Angela walks over to Lester, placing her hand on his arm flirtatiously and looking up at him with a smile to intimidate him, but something has changed and he isn't intimidated. He looks directly at her, leans in, and smiles slowly, speaking in a low and intense voice, causing her to move away, suddenly insecure, and she heads out quickly with Lester watching her go, baffled. Ricky enters, wet from the pouring rain, crosses to his bureau, and pulls the wad of cash out of his pocket; he turns, startled, as the Colonel steps out of the shadows. The Colonel backhands Ricky so hard it sends him sprawling, but he gets up and eyes the Colonel, realizing he's discovered a way to break free from his father, incredulous at its simplicity. Ricky grabs his backpack, turns, and walks out the door, leaving the Colonel standing there, glassy-eyed and breathing heavily. Ricky enters another room to find Barbara standing in the middle, clutching a dish and looking frightened, having obviously heard his argument with his father; she looks into his eyes, aware something eventful is happening. He kisses her cheek softly, then exits through the back door, leaving her standing alone, still clutching her dish. From the Colonel's point of view, below him, Ricky dashes through the rain to the Burnhams' front door and knocks.",
    "561": "Indy blows dust away from the tile and tries to pry it up but cannot. He then rushes past Brody to a cordon held by a brass stand underneath the stained-glass window. Indy raises the brass stand and, timing his actions, hits the tile precisely as the Librarian stamps a book. The Librarian regards the stamper curiously while Indy continues to pound at the tile as the Librarian resumes his stamping, still puzzled by the sound echoing through the library. Finally, Indy breaks the tile. As he bends to remove the pieces of broken tile, a two-foot square hole is revealed. Indy is impressed with Elsa's spirit and cooperates agreeably, holding her by the hands and lowering her into the hole. When her feet finally touch ground below, Indy releases his grip on her and slips the Grail Diary to Brody. Then Indy disappears into the hole and jumps down a steep step. He reaches back to help Elsa, and they glance around, noticing the dark and dank surroundings. Elsa removes a cigarette lighter with a unique ivory four-leaf clover design, and Indy and Elsa inspect markings carved onto the walls. Indy takes the lighter from her and lights their way down a dark passageway. Three men carrying guns make their way down the spiral staircase toward an unsuspecting Brody, and one of the men, Kazim, raises his gun and brings it down hard on Brody's head. Indy only has to give it a quick glance to know and holds the lighter up as he and Elsa enter another dark passageway. Indy steps to the wall and runs his hand over the stone, then Elsa holds the lighter as Indy rams his shoulder into the wall. The wall collapses on impact, and Indy falls through into another room onto rocks surrounded by bubbling, green, slimy liquid. More skeletons surround him, resting in their carved niches, as Elsa holds the lighter and peers in at him through the hole in the wall. Indy reaches up, tears a piece of cloth from one of the skeletons, which breaks apart and falls into the oil-slick water. He uses the scrap of cloth and a bone to fashion a crude torch, which he then dips into the oily water. Using the cloth-wrapped bone torch to guide their way, Indy and Elsa come upon a narrow passageway with water knee-deep and teeming with rats, thousands of them crawling on one another's backs and thrashing in the water. Elsa gasps as the rats scamper between her legs, and Indy moves forward through the rat-infested water as Elsa follows, still gasping in horror. Suddenly, Indy slips into a hole, and recovering his balance, he reaches out to Elsa.",
    "38": "Annina runs up to him and hugs him. He looks over and sees Rick. At the bar, Carl whispers in Sacha's ear. He kisses Rick on both cheeks. Carl pours a brandy for Rick. Pretending not to do so, Rick glances in Ilsa's direction. Renault comes up to him. He smiles and walks away. Laszlo comes up to Rick. Rick gets up, as does Laszlo. Laszlo looks at him, puzzled. Rick and Laszlo hear male voices singing downstairs. Rick stands at the balcony outside his office and watches the Germans below. At the bar, Renault watches with raised eyebrow. Laszlo's lips are very tight as he listens to the song. He starts down the step. Yvonne, sitting at a table with her German officer, stares down into her drink. Laszlo speaks to the orchestra. Laszlo passes the table where Ilsa sits and goes straight to the orchestra. Members of the orchestra glance toward the steps, toward Rick, who nods to them. Laszlo and Corina sing as they start to play. Strasser conducts the German singing in an attempt to drown out the competition. After a while, Strasser and his officers give up and sit down. Yvonne jumps up and sings with tears in her eyes. Ilsa, overcome with emotion, looks proudly at Laszlo, who sings with passion. Finally the whole cafe stands, singing, their faces aglow. The song finishes on a high, triumphant note. Yvonne's face is exalted. She shouts at the top of her lungs. She deliberately faces the alcove where the Germans are watching. Several French officers surround Laszlo, offering him a drink. Renault thinks a moment, then blows a loud blast on his whistle. The room grows quiet, all eyes turn toward Renault. An angry murmur starts among the crowd. People get up and begin to leave. Rick comes quickly up to Renault. This display of nerve leaves Rick at a loss. The croupier comes out of the gambling room and up to Renault. He hands him a roll of bills. His manner is abrupt but cordial. As the cafe empties, Strasser approaches Ilsa. She looks at him, understanding what he means. He bows and exits as Laszlo arrives at the table. They start out of the cafe. Ilsa and Laszlo walk to their room. Laszlo switches on the light as they enter. While Ilsa takes off some jewelry, he walks to the window and peers out into the darkness. Below and across the street, a man stands under an arch. Laszlo watches him, then draws down the shade. He crosses to a table, takes a cigarette from a box, and strikes a match. He lights the cigarette. Ilsa is now noticeably uncomfortable. Ilsa walks over to the couch and sits down.",

Thorwald fights to dislodge Jeff's grip. Looking down on Jeff's face, showing his strain and the pain of Thorwald's attack. Doyle pulls himself to the top of the wall. From Doyle's viewpoint, Jeff is hanging out the window and Thorwald is hammering at his hands and arms with bare fists. Thorwald and Jeff are struggling. Doyle reaches the top of the wall and looks up at Jeff. Jeff, as seen from Doyle's angle, is hanging, somehow weathering Thorwald's insane attack. Jeff's grip begins to slip. Lisa is white-faced and frightened. He opens his eyes. Winces with pain. Doyle then looks up to the detective. Stella tugs at Doyle's arm and stands on tiptoe to whisper something into his ear. Doyle turns quizzically at Stella. Beginning on Jeff's window thermometer, the CAMERA PANS FROM RIGHT TO LEFT around the neighborhood. In the songwriter's apartment, we see the songwriter with a guest—Miss Lonely Hearts. The songwriter is placing the first recording of his new song on a record player for her to hear. Both in dress and manner she seems quite happy and adjusted to life. It is a full symphonic arrangement which is heard over. Thorwald's apartment is empty, stripped of its furnishings. Two painters are repainting the walls. The siffleuse and her husband are on their fire escape, training a new white dog to ride in their basket. Miss Torso is practicing her ballet again; she wears a white leotard. The sound of someone at the door interrupts her. She goes to the door, opens it an inch or two cautiously. When she sees who is outside, she throws open the door. An innocuous, unhandsome and somewhat shy army private enters with a barracks bag slung over one shoulder. She kisses him fondly after closing the door. He puts down the barracks bag, tosses his hat into a chair and, with the attitude of a man who belongs there, goes to the icebox to see what's to eat. The newlyweds are arguing. The CAMERA PANS past Jeff who is asleep in his wheelchair facing away from the window. CAMERA MOVES DOWN to the lower part of his body and we see that both his legs are now in casts. The CAMERA LIFTS SLIGHTLY to show Lisa sitting on the sofa nearby.

Suze pushes a stack of bills across the kitchen table towards Rebecca, who pushes them back, and then the girls knock back shots and run out into the street. Rebecca falls off her bed as they run to a post box, where a bag lady comes by with a packed supermarket trolley. The next day, Rebecca is at a flea market with her mom, Jane, and dad, Graham, where her dad performs a magic trick. The scene includes a waistcoat and Rebecca’s phone as she goes up in the lift of the Dantay-West building. Just after a postie wheels in a post trolley through the glass door, Rebecca spots her pink envelope among the stacks of mail. When the lift opens up and a man wheels out a clothes rail, she steps aside to let him pass, then ducks down behind it to get through the door. Rebecca slips an arm into a coat hanging on the rail and tries to reach the letter, attempting to hook it with a stiletto heel and swinging at the post trolley with the shoe. She hides in a blue fur as Alette strides off, and the clothes rail is wheeled away, leaving Rebecca lying on the floor, clutching her letter. Rebecca looks from Alicia to the clothes rail and some fashion stills along the wall, sits on a creaky chair, and sharpens her pencil as the prim PA giggles. Luke peers oddly at Rebecca, and she turns towards Haley, trying to follow his gaze. Hayley beams inanely as he leans forward. Rebecca and Suze are in a bookshop where she tries to copy from a book, then they watch a DVD at home. Rebecca packs clothes into plastic bags and stuffs them into a cupboard, closing the cupboard that's full to bursting as mannequins try to lure her. At the office, Rebecca, wearing pink, bends the article, turns to her pink laptop, and types something in Google, then leans forward to read what's popped up as the corner of his mouth drops. At a conference, all eyes are on Rebecca, who gulps nervously as Luke smiles like a Cheshire cat, Mr. Xander looks cornered, and Luke grins, having not meant for her to say that. Rebecca beams with newfound optimism, and as she strides down a street, a piece of paper floats down towards her and lands on her chest; it’s a flier for a sample sale. In his penthouse, Luke's boss, Ryan, slams a virtual golf ball at a virtual golf course. Rebecca is in the queue for the sample sale as women emerge from a door and stride past with their purchases. Then, another door opens, and the women in the queue jerk their heads.",
    "435": "His eyes travel to the window. Don, with his back toward Wick, is bent over the suitcase, packing and has crossed to the chest of drawers to fish out more shirts and socks. Bent forward tensely, he watches Wick go into the living room. Left alone, he acts with lightning rapidity, taking the sweater, going over to the window, pulling up the whiskey bottle, and wrapping the sweater around it so that only the top with the string around it shows. He tries to loosen the noose but, nervous, loses a precious second. From the living room comes the sound of Wick opening the closet door and ransacking. Don sees he can't loosen the string in time and in the last fraction of a second before Wick enters, he manages to lower the bottle back down the wall. With what nonchalance he can muster, he bends down and looks under the bed just as Wick enters with a sheaf of white paper in his hand. Wick pulls out a Remington portable, 1930 model, and puts it in Don's suitcase. He goes toward the door while the bell resumes short, short, long, short, and from the bedroom, we see him open the door. Helen enters breathlessly, crossing to the bedroom. She is a clean-cut, good-looking girl of twenty-six with two books wrapped and another small package in hand. Her face is brave, gay, and piquant. She's wearing a three-quarter-length leopard coat, despite the Indian Summer day being a good ten degrees too warm for it. She puts the packages in the suitcase, indicating a running gag between them. Don bends so she can kiss him on the cheek, and she does so. His face is now close to hers, and something flickers in Don's eye. Wick looks up, and there is an exchange of suspicious looks between Wick and Helen. Wick, who has been smoking a cigarette throughout the scene, throws it out the window, but it doesn't fall out the window; instead, it ricochets against the opened casement to the window sill, where it lies smouldering. Furious, Don takes a bunch of keys from his pocket, and his eyes fall on the cigarette still smouldering on the sill. Wick turns away and goes toward the window while Don, held by Helen, watches him tensely. Wick flips the cigarette into the garden and is about to turn back into the room when his eyes fall on the cleat and the string. He leans from the window, and Helen, sensing something amiss, looks from one brother to the other. Don lets Helen go, staring at Wick, panic in his eyes.",
    "54": "Gittes reaches into his desk and pulls out a shot glass, quickly selects a cheaper bottle of bourbon from several fifths of more expensive whiskeys and pours a large shot. He shoves the glass across his desk toward Curly, who stares dumbly at it, then picks it up and drains it. He's now walking Curly past Sophie, who pointedly averts her gaze. Gittes throws an arm around Curly and flashes a dazzling smile, then shuts the door on him and the smile disappears. Walsh rises when Gittes enters, Gittes nods and walks on in. Gittes walks over to Mrs. Mulwray and again flashes a warm, sympathetic smile, and she holds her breath. Gittes pulls up a chair sitting next to Mrs. Mulwray between Duffy and Walsh, gives Duffy an irritated glance, causing Duffy to stop chewing, and then Gittes sighs. Former Mayor Sam Bagby is speaking, with a huge map, overleafs, and bold lettering behind him. Some councilmen are reading funny papers and gossip columns while Bagby is speaking, and some grubby farmers sit next to them, bored. One yawns and edges away from one of the dirtier farmers, while an amalgam of farmers, businessmen, and city employees listen with keen interest. A man looks up with interest from his racing form during a whispered conference, walks to the huge map with overleafs, and he is a slender man in his sixties, who wears glasses and moves with surprising fluidity. He turns to a smaller, younger man and nods, prompting the man to turn the overleaf on the map. Mulwray leaves the overleaf board and sits down. Suddenly, there are some whoops and hollers from the rear of the chambers, and a red-faced farmer drives in several scrawny, bleating sheep. Bailiffs and sergeants-at-arms respond to the imprecations of the Council and attempt to capture the sheep and the farmers, having to restrain one who looks like he's going to bodily attack Mulwray. The sun blazes off the river's ugly concrete banks, while where the banks are earthen, they are parched and choked with weeds. After a moment, Mulwray's car pulls into view on a flood control road about fifteen feet above the riverbed. Someone holding a pair of binoculars is positioned downstream and just above the flood control road, using some dried mustard weeds for cover, and trains the binoculars on him. They watch while Mulwray makes his way down to the center of the riverbed, where he stops, turns slowly, and appears to be looking at the bottom of the riverbed or at nothing at all. Then a small Mexican boy atop a swayback horse rides it into the riverbed and into Gittes' view. Gittes moves a little further back as Mulwray rounds the bend in the river and comes face to face with the Mexican boy on the muddy banks.",
    "621": "As she runs up to the Lorings' front door, she smoothes down the hem of the skirt she wears over her jeans and peers in through one of the two oval leaded windows. She shows Mark the image. Mark seems to lose himself in the music, then he looks at Juno. Juno notices a VHS. He snatches the tape from her, and they watch the film where a sinister man drives a stake through a woman's stomach. Juno shows Vanessa the picture, and Vanessa studies the image lengthwise and sideways, then looks across at Mark, who shrugs brutally. Vanessa stands with her arms tightly folded. He places Juno's bag over her shoulder and opens the door to let her out. Vanessa gives her husband a tight smile. It's dark by the time Juno arrives home, sipping from a drinks carton. Bren is cutting out pictures of dogs, and as Bren goes back to her paper dogs, Juno pours the dregs of her drink into Bren's ornament. Outside, on the snowy street, Juno stops the Previa and eases off her grey overskirt. Bleeker's mother opens her front door, and Juno races up the stairs, outrunning Bleeker's mother and getting to Bleeker's room before her. Bleeker reaches for a box. Juno eases herself into a chair with her legs apart and slides onto the floor next to him. They both look away awkwardly, and Juno suddenly looks glum. At her home, Vanessa, in an old T-shirt with her hair pulled back in a ponytail, stands before a bare wall. Mark, standing next to her with his arms folded, looks glum. Playing nervously with the chain around her neck, Vanessa turns to the wall behind her, and Mark stares bleakly at the wall. Juno and Leah are in the mall, crouching down behind a glass balcony. Vanessa is joking around with a friend's little girl in the mall play area. Leah sucks in her cheeks, stands up, and looks elsewhere, but Juno stays where she is, gazing down at Vanessa playing with the little girl, and a soft smile spreads across her face. They walk into Vanessa, who shakes her head in awe. Juno winces and then plants Vanessa's hand on her belly. Vanessa shakes her head, and her beautiful sculpted face tightens self-consciously. Then, she drops to her knees in front of Juno, and with a nervous glance about her, she places her hands on Juno's belly. Her eyes widen excitedly, and Juno, standing over her, watches her with a mixture of fondness and pride as Vanessa gazes at the swollen belly like a love-struck puppy. Bren, at the sewing machine, cuts the top of a pair of jeans and sews on an elasticated band, giving a satisfied smile as she tests the elastic.",
    "1192": "Each singer in the front row holds a huge toad as Professor Lupin stands and nods to the students, while Hagrid, the huge giant, stands up, knocking into the table and extinguishing a candle that relights itself before he leaves the Hall. Harry and his friends climb the moving staircase towards a portrait of a fat lady holding a glass and singing, which she smashes against a pillar. The portrait swings back, and they go into the common room where a ghost walks through them, and the boys try magic sweets. Neville chews the sweet, Ron tries one, and steam shoots from Harry's ears. Outside the window, the rain lashes down and lightning flashes as the storm rages around Hogwarts Castle, with black-cloaked Dementors hovering outside the school grounds. A small bird flies along the stone cloister, swoops down a grassy slope towards a crooked willow tree, which pulls back a branch and thwacks the bird, causing feathers to fly. In a classroom, she recoils, then outside the school, the students follow Hagrid around the edge of the sunlit forest to a grassy clearing surrounded by a low wall where Malfoy strokes his monster book, which purrs contentedly. Malfoy slowly approaches Harry, stares at him arrogantly, then, looking terrified, points over Harry's shoulder, and Harry spins round as his cronies pull up their hooded cloaks. Neville looks bedraggled next to a magnificent creature that stands in front of them, and all but Harry step back as Ron gives Harry a push. Nervously, Harry moves forward and bows to the creature, which flaps its huge wings and bows its birdlike head. Hagrid throws a tidbit while Malfoy pushes to the front, and Harry stretches out his hand as Hermione clutches Ron's hand and they both look embarrassed. Harry pats the creature, and as Hagrid smacks its hindquarters, it raises its huge wings and takes off while Harry hangs on desperately to Buckbeak's feathery neck, the four-legged creature, half-horse, half-eagle, rising above the trees. In the distance, Harry sees a river winding its way down the valley, the strong wings of the hippogriff carrying them even higher as they sail between the towers and turrets of Hogwarts School and soar above the craggy hillside. The silvery sun filters down through the storm clouds, turning the waters of a vast lake below them to a steely gray as Harry, clinging to the creature's neck, sees his reflection in the water while Buckbeak skims low over the lake, one huge claw just touching the surface. Harry relaxes, enjoying the sensation with a huge smile crossing his face, and spreads his arms wide but then grabs hold of the feathery neck once more as the huge wings lift them up and away from the lake. At last, Hagrid calls them back, and the hippogriff soars down through the treetops, flaps its wings as a brake, and lands in a clearing.",
    "855": "Charlie, wearing a name badge, saunters over as Sandra smiles through gritted teeth. The door opens, and Jeep walks in, heading to the kitchen, where a steak is covered with flies. Charlie's smile fades, and she glares as everyone turns to the dear, sweet old lady. Charlie slams down the bill and goes to the kitchen. Jeep looks across at the old lady and begins to walk towards her, noticing her rare steak is covered with flies as she cuts into it. Audrey grins as Gladys bites a chunk from Howard's neck, causing him to fall to the floor. Gladys tips her table, Percy grabs a frying pan, and throws it at Gladys, hitting her. She straightens up, a gash in her cheek, her eyes dark, and charges across the diner, leaping onto the window blinds and scuttling up them to the inverted V-shaped ceiling, which she scampers over. Bob fires a pump-action shotgun, but she leaps in front of him and swats him away; the shotgun falls to the floor in front of Jeep, who picks it up as Gladys approaches. Jeep closes his eyes, and Gladys slows to a halt at his feet without him firing. He looks up to see Kyle holding a smoking pistol as Howard lies in a puddle of blood on the floor, gasping for breath, and Sandra runs to him, her hands covered in his blood. Kyle puts the gun in his waistband and runs over, placing a napkin and his scarf over Howard's wound. Audrey, sitting on a bench seat, hugs her knees and shivers as blood drips from the ceiling onto her head, spotting two stains above her. Percy and Kyle haul Howard to the SUV, dragging his toes on the ground, and load him into the back with Sandra and Audrey. The SUV reverses, then goes back onto the road, heading for the dark cloud in the distance. Audrey spots the dark cloud on the road, which looks like smoke spreading upwards, as a fly comes in through a grill, and others splat into the windscreen. Flies storm in through the grill by the thousands. In the men's room at the diner, Jeep throws up in a cubicle as Bob stands by a nearby sink, drinking from a can. Bob sees Jeep's reflection in the mirror and pats Jeep's shoulder, then turns when he hears a car as the others return. He grabs Percy, looks up as Percy rushes inside, and sees a giant storm of flies looming overhead, darkening the sky above him. He retreats inside, where the gruesome face of old Gladys is uncovered from under a plastic sheet. Bob and Jeep, along with Kyle, carry Gladys out and watch the approaching police squad car as Kyle turns to Jeep, then Bob.",
    "999": "High up on a skyscraper, a workman hammers a steel girder, and sparks fly. Nick wakes up in his underwear, curled up on the porch swing outside his cottage, as Gatsby watches from a window. Nick receives a personal invitation, and cars loaded with party goers roll up to Gatsby's immense mansion, which is lit up at night, with a fountain in front. Cars crammed with people arrive, and Nick walks up, holding his invitation, getting caught up in the tide of people surging towards the mansion. Hundreds of people move towards a cavernous ballroom, where a spot-lit dancer twirls enormous multicolored feathers. A giant, dome-shaped crystal chandelier glitters, and standing on a raised platform is a large pipe organ. A flood-lit blue pool sits in the middle of the ballroom as Nick wanders about, smiling. A dancer hangs upside-down from the ceiling, and someone plays the massive organ. People dance everywhere, and Nick talks to a barman before downing a martini in one. He wears beige boots, white trousers and shirt, a dark-blue blazer, and a bowtie. Two flapper girls in flouncy yellow dresses do the Charleston with a man who's standing on a podium. An extremely attractive young woman glides through the proceedings, and Nick turns to Jordan, who takes off her hat. Gilda shimmies across the dance floor in a cream flapper dress with tiers of tassels. She pushes her hands out, spins and kicks, her tassels swishing and swaying as she moves frenetically. The dance floor fills, and Nick and Jordan walk upstairs. At the top of the stairs, Jordan leans sharply to Nick, then leans against doors, and Nick pushes her, and they tumble into a library. The old man comes down the library steps and hands them drinks. They look through a window down at the party, which throbs as people dance crazily. Colorful confetti floats down from the ceiling, the band wear red fezzes, and people jump into the round pool for a dip. Back amongst the throng, Nick holds his hand out to Jordan, who's dancing with Teddy Barton. Nick pulls her away from Teddy, a chiseled young man with slicked hair. Jordan flops her arms over Nick's shoulders, and they shimmy on the circular platform over the middle of the pool as glittering strings fly through the air. Teddy grabs Jordan's hand, and Jordan turns back to Nick, who looks miffed. The man turns to Nick, smiling, and Nick gawks at Gatsby, a handsome, fine-featured man with bright eyes and swept-back, wavy brown hair. Gatsby talks to Jordan, kisses her hand, and squeezes Nick's shoulder as fireworks light up the sky. Gatsby nods to them both and goes, and Jordan smiles and turns to Nick. The older, distinguished-looking man, Herzog, leaves Jordan looking bewildered. Gatsby watches from the top of the stairs for a moment, then walks away.",
    "1388": "Harry has donned Hermione's scarf and Ron's hat to disguise himself as Fudge looks around nervously and then jerks his head toward the pub. As he leads Rosmerta and McGonagall inside, we cut back to Hermione and Ron. Footprints track through the snow into the pub, as Ron and Hermione ripple briefly past a frosted window. Three shrunken heads swing into view while Rosmerta looks to McGonagall, who nods grimly. Suddenly, the pub doors fly open, revealing Main Street, where Ron and Hermione wait, rubbing their hands against the chill. As they look down, the camera tilts and footprints appear in the snow, marking the end of Harry's point of view. At the end of a rocky outcrop, the footprints end and sobs are heard. Ron takes Hermione's arm to discourage her from going further, but she does, filling the footprints with her own, then kneeling and gently drawing the cloak from Harry, who stares into the mist with eyes stinging with tears. Butterflies flutter over the great green lawn, the giant squid breaks through the last glaze of ice on the Black Lake, and the Whomping Willow shakes the water from its branches as the dying sun streams through high windows, painting Harry's face a fierce amber-red as he stands opposite Lupin. Ancient charts drape the walls while gleaming spheres of spun glass orbit one another silently, and Lupin paces before a large trunk. Harry shakes his head, and as his eyes wander, Lupin snaps his fingers to bring his attention back, then nods. Crack! The Dementor mutates into a silvery white orb, and Harry glances toward the window at the bloody sun, then looks up into Lupin's eyes, emotional, and nods. Harry takes a breath as Lupin blinks at Harry's quiet fierceness and opens the packing case, instantly causing the Dementor to appear again. The hair skates off Harry's scar as he sets his jaw, his hand trembling, and his whole body trembling, but he holds his ground when a huge silver shadow bursts from the end of his wand, hovering between him and the Dementor, which falters. Lupin nods as all the boys are asleep except Harry, who lies in bed studying the photo of his parents, barely visible in the fluttering light of a guttering candle. The camera begins to move, creeping forward, but it's only an old man in a painting, scowling in the glare of Harry's wand light. Harry makes to follow, then stops as the wand's spot dances across the parchment and finds another dot. Harry stashes the map, extinguishes his wand, and turns into the harsh glare of Snape's wand. A sneer curdles the corners of Snape's lips as he eyes Harry coldly, lowering his wand. Seeing the map, Snape's eyes glitter, and to Harry's horror, words begin to appear as Snape studies him with a sadistic half-smile on his lips.",
    "23": "He closes the door in her face, and she stands there, thrown by the abruptness, pausing briefly outside Simon's door before continuing on her way. The doctor is gone, and mother and daughter are arguing. He grunts with pain, hope, and anxiety as he answers. Simon wheels away from Melvin and Simon is in a wheelchair. Melvin pauses as Simon weeps. Simon swings his arm and cast at Melvin—the sudden attack jolts Melvin, but not as much as what follows. Melvin heads for the door but Simon blocks him. Verdell looks at Simon with concern. As Simon works to stop crying, Melvin is weird with discomfort. Simon looks up, his mood changing quickly, and he's rapt, looking apologetically at Simon in stoic ruin. Carol lies in bed on the pullout sofa. She walks to the kitchen, trembling as she drinks a glass of water and exits. Carol crosses to Manhattan, looking like she's on her way to a final exam where she has no idea of the subject. On a hot summer night, she gets off the bus as the rains come. As Carol consults the slip of paper with the address on it, she enters the building and realizes her thin summer dress is clinging to her like an old movie poster of The Deep. She stands in front of Melvin's apartment, twists herself to ease nervousness, and knocks on the door. Finally, Carol hears muffled throat clearing on the other side of the door. As we hear him unlock the door, Carol looks at her breasts and gasps, grasping the fabric and holding it straight out just as Melvin opens the door. His hair is standing on end with static, and he periodically gives it self-conscious pats. She pauses, beginning an extraordinarily long silence. Melvin’s reaction is an intense inner struggle not to scream or cry as he turns halfway from her, answering hoarsely. Carol is amused and surprised as two digital clocks on Melvin's nightstand tell us the time. He gets up, taps one foot on the floor twice and then the other foot twice more. He knocks on Simon's door, which opens quickly, and Simon walks painfully back to a chair. He rises and makes an awkward exit, leaving Simon puzzled and concerned. Carol is seated, working on a letter, trying to express her gratitude, with an enormous sheaf of completed pages sitting next to her.",
    "226": "Romantic music tinnily plays as Delmar and Everett watch, with Everett slumped down and angrily hissing, in a dark and quiet theater where they, along with the rest of the sparse audience, look restively about. A man carrying a shotgun enters the auditorium, walks halfway down the aisle, and stops several rows behind Delmar and Everett, scanning the theater before bringing a whistle to his lips. At his whistle, the back doors burst open, and a line of chained men trot in at double-time, filing into one row and then, when filled, the row behind it, remaining silently on their feet. The first guard and two others who escorted in the convicts scan the theater before the first guard blows his whistle again, causing the two rows of chained men to sit. One more whistle cues the movie to grind back up to speed. A hissing whisper from behind draws Everett and Delmar's attention, causing Everett, with jaw hanging open, to stare as if at a ghost, while Delmar also stares but finally acknowledges Pete's corporeal reality. Pete squints and cocks his head as if to ask, \"What was that?\" Delmar repeats the whisper slowly and with exaggerated mouth movements, but Pete shakes his head, indicating he didn't catch it, and repeats, also overarticulating. Meanwhile, Pappy O'Daniel sits on the veranda of the Governor's Mansion, smoking a cigar and sipping bourbon as the evening sun sets; he reacts quizzically to a whispered conversation, looking sadly from one person to another, like a spectator at a dull tennis match. A moment later, Everett rises over the lip of his bed, his face blackened and swaying as if on a boat, raising a large, long-armed, short-nosed pincering tool, which he locks onto Pete's chain and levers free. As Pete's hand chinks free, he doesn't react to his newfound liberty, instead burning his eyes into Everett's while shaking his head miserably and weeping. Pete hugs a stunned Delmar and then Everett, who looks profoundly uncomfortable. Now, stunned, Pete and Delmar stare at Everett, with Delmar brightening and Pete suddenly lunging at Everett. Pete tackles Everett, and with his hands wrapped around Everett's throat, the two roll through some brush into a clearing where they abruptly stop. Their view reveals a great open field where men in bedsheets parade in formation before a huge fiery cross. Pete, Everett, and Delmar hastily crabwalk back into the bushes before pushing through together.",
    "1054": "Mr. Gardiner smiles over at Mr. Darcy while Georgiana stands at Lizzie's side, looking down at her. They both look over at Mr. Darcy, and then Lizzie gets up and sets the music out for Georgiana before making her way across the room, only to be stopped by Miss Bingley. Mr. Darcy sits up, and embarrassed, Lizzie hurries back over to Georgiana. Slowly, Lizzie raises her eyes to meet Mr. Darcy's, who sits across the room, watching her with an enraptured expression. The two gaze at each other, their eyes filled with warmth and understanding. Later, as dusk falls, a carriage pulls away from Pemberley, waved off by Mr. Bingley, Mr. Darcy, and Georgiana. Mr. Bingley and Georgiana head inside together, arm in arm, but Mr. Darcy remains on the doorstep, watching the carriage clatter down the long, curving driveway. Moments later, he and Mr. Bingley stride back into the drawing room, where Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley are waiting, and he gives Miss Bingley a piercing stare, causing her to look away. Mr. Darcy then walks through the magnificent portrait-lined hall at Pemberley, holding aloft a candle to light his way, with two dogs trotting at his heels. He enters the now-darkened drawing room and places the candle on a mantelpiece, pausing for a moment, leaning against the fireplace as if lost in thought, before looking over at the piano Lizzie was playing earlier and softening his expression as he remembers her lifting her eyes to meet his in a moment frozen in time. The next day dawns grey and misty over Pemberley as Darcy stands in front of his mirror, getting dressed, while his butler brings him his frock coat, which he takes and pulls on. Dressed immaculately in a bottle-green frock coat, cream breeches, riding boots, and a top hat, he gallops through the grounds on his white horse, giving it a faint tap with a whip to speed up the grassy hill. At Lambton, the maid finds Lizzie and the Gardiners, prompting Mr. Gardiner to open the door, and they head out, leaving Lizzie alone with her letters. She settles down to open the first one, while elsewhere a messenger dismounts from his horse and hands Mr. Bennet, in his night things, a letter, which he opens after passing his candle to the housekeeper. Lizzie's eyes fill with tears as Wickham turns to look at Lydia. Lizzie hurriedly opens the next letter, then puts down the letters and hurries to the door as Mr. Darcy strides in. The maid appears, and Mr. Darcy sits down, taking Lizzie's hand, as Lizzie breaks down in tears.",
    "661": "Spider-Man steps back as two more webs pull a wall down on top of him. From beneath the pile of rubble, a hand appears, followed by the Goblin's head and torso, as he hauls himself unsteadily to his feet. Then Spider-Man swoops down, dragging the villain through a trellis and smashing him against another wall. Now it's Spider-Man's turn to rain blades on his opponent, causing the Green Goblin to fall to the ground. The Green Goblin removes the hard mask with a jutting jaw, revealing Norman Osborn, and Peter, Spider-Man, stares in disbelief. The Goblin sneers as he has pressed the remote on his glove, triggering the glider with blades drawn to target Spider-Man. Spider-Man does a backward flip over it, and it heads for Norman, piercing through him and pinning him to the wall. Norman leans on the glider, then looks up at Peter, whose face is clearly visible through the torn mask, before slumping over the glider with his eyes staring wide. On the ground beside him lies the mask of the Green Goblin. Peter lowers his head and later, in the dark, lays Norman, no longer in costume, down on the sofa in the Osborn mansion study. As he does so, Harry, dressed in black, walks into the room and sees his father and the shadowy figure of Spider-Man. Harry scrabbles in the desk and finds a gun, but when he looks up, Spider-Man has gone, and the net curtains billow in the wind with the window open. On the day of Norman's funeral, after the interment, Harry is standing alone when Peter, hands in pockets, walks slowly over to his friend. Harry turns and nods acknowledgement, and Peter stares, transfixed at Harry. Peter steps forward and puts one arm, then the other around Harry, as the two friends hug. They part, and Harry turns away solemnly, with Peter watching him trudge down the path through the gravestones towards the waiting Rolls-Royce on the road. The bare trees have cast their autumnal leaves as Peter turns to see MJ and Aunt May, standing in front of his uncle's gravestone. MJ comes to join him, and hugs him as they wrap around one another. MJ breaks away, and they stand facing each other as she strokes his cheek with her gloved hand, and he stares intently at her. Standing in the middle of the graveyard with tears in her windblown face, MJ pulls his head towards her and their lips meet in a long and passionate embrace. The lingering kiss stops, and they study each other's faces as tears well in MJ's eyes. When she closes her lids, the tears roll down her cheeks, and Peter sadly turns from her and slowly walks away. MJ stands by the gravestone, sobbing, then suddenly, as if struck by a memory, she moves her hand up to her lips.",
    "513": "Lee glances over her shoulder, then turns from the doorway and walks away. The camera follows her, moving across a book-and-photograph-filled bookshelf that obscures her from view as she walks into a crowded, comfortable vestibule. People, some holding drinks, some just entering the apartment, surround her. Everyone is talking at once, carrying on easy, familiar conversation. Lee smiles at the various people, exchanging greetings. Lee walks into the living room, turning her head back for a moment to talk to the child she has just hugged. The camera is still moving with Lee as she smiles and stops to chat with her mother. Lee starts to walk off again, finishing her conversation with her mother. She passes several other guests, then turns to greet April, giving her a warm, brief hug. Elliot's voice-over continues as he is actually seen, standing in a doorway having a conversation with a gesturing, rotund man. Both are holding drinks as Lee, carrying a tray of hors d'oeuvres and two drinks, walks between them. The space is very tight; the men hold up their drinks to make room for her. Elliot watches Lee walk off; the other man, oblivious, continues to talk. Elliot reluctantly returns to the conversation, but he can't help turning his head to gaze at the offscreen Lee as the other man chatters on. The camera resumes following a smiling Lee. She has just put down the tray and drinks near April, and briskly and obliviously, she walks past a doorway where Elliot, still ruminating, watches her, entranced. The camera stays with Elliot, who is still watching the offscreen Lee. In the background, guests continue to chatter warmly with each other. Hannah, carrying a tray of hors d'oeuvres, walks up behind the distracted Elliot. Elliot, taking one of the hors d'oeuvres, starts nibbling as well as he and Hannah walk past the bookshelf into the living room. Elliot and Hannah, eating and talking, walk past a hallway and offscreen as Holly appears, walking down the hallway. She holds a drink and a plate of hors d'oeuvres; she stands at the entrance to the hallway, eating and looking at the offscreen guests. Holly, standing in the hallway onscreen, swallows loudly. Holly takes a sip of her drink as Hannah and Elliot walk over to her. Holly and Hannah begin to laugh. Hannah, licking her fingers, walks past a memo-cluttered refrigerator to the stove as Holly, behind her, begins to speak. As Holly talks, sipping her drink, Hannah busily works in the kitchen, which contains a large center table stacked with bowls and plates of food, hanging pots and pans, and general party clutter. She walks on-and-offscreen as she talks and listens to her sister.",
    "257": "He is pulling into a convenience store parking lot and puts the car in park but leaves it running. As he gets out of the car, a hand enters to take a package of panty hose from the standing rack, and another hand takes a big carton of disposable diapers from the shelf. A pimply-faced lad with a paper 7-Eleven cap on his head is looking up from a dirty magazine, reacting in horror to something approaching. Hi is approaching the check-out island with a gun in one hand and the carton of Huggies tucked under the other. The L'Eggs stocking is pulled over his head to distort his features as he presses a silent alarm under the lip of the counter. Ed is reading to Nathan Jr. from a large picture book but pauses for a moment, listening, as they can barely hear a distant siren. She resumes absently, but her voice trails off as the WHOO-WHOO of the siren is definitely approaching. Ed hooks an arm around the seat and looks behind the car, then looks forward. Indistinctly visible through the semi-reflective glass are two figures at the check-out island, one pointing something at the other as the siren grows louder. Under her breath, she unstraps herself and gets out of the car. In a two-shot of Hi and the Cashier, the cashier is stuffing bills into a grocery bag, and beyond them Ed can be seen outside, circling the front of the car. Her shout is muffled through the glass, and with this Hi notices her. He turns to the Cashier, but Ed is already getting into the driver's seat of the car. As she slams the car door shut, the siren is quite loud now, and the car squeals out of the lot. The squad car tops a rise to bounce into view, its siren wailing. Hi bursts out the door, still wearing the stocking, and the carton of Huggies is still tucked under one arm as he bellows hopefully after his departing car. Hi looks around the parking lot, bewildered, as the wailing siren becomes painfully loud. Hi looks behind him at the plate-glass front of the store, where a bullet pock mars the glass. Through the glass, the pimply young Cashier with the paper 7-Eleven cap pops up from behind the counter to sight down his huge .44 Magnum for another shot, the gun so big he uses both hands to heft it. SMACK-CRACK - the bullet kisses another hole in the glass. Hi is off and running as the squad car is screeching into the lot. An officer tumbles out of the passenger side before the car is fully stopped, rolls on the pavement, then hurriedly rights himself and takes up a half-kneeling shooting stance.",
    "1259": "Carl walks up to Allison, who's wearing a dark blue coat with red piping, and picks her up around her waist with one arm, carrying her to a check-in desk where a woman looks at a computer screen. Carl frowns, perplexed, as they proceed to walk through the small Lincoln, Nebraska airport. At the Telephone Pioneer Museum, they see a mock-up of an early telephone switchboard and a mannequin holding a modern mobile phone while Carl holds up the massive vintage phone. At a shooting range, Allison shoots the ground, an instructor raises the gun barrel, and she hits the clay, making everyone duck as she swings round with the gun. A uniformed band plays at the packed Nebraska Cornhuskers Memorial Stadium where a mascot jumps up and down, and the football team, Big Red, runs onto the field in red-and-white stripes. In Carl's apartment, Peter, Lucy, Rooney, and Lee watch the game on TV as Carl, wearing giant yellow corncobs on his head and arms, jumps up and down in the crowd while Allison wears a massive red Stetson. At a slaughterhouse, Carl faints. In the country, Carl and Allison walk along a track beneath a brooding, gray sky, and he takes off his jacket to wrap it around Allison's head, marches her to a barn, removes the jacket, and she shakes her head, smiling contentedly as they wrap their arms around each other, and Carl, looking thoughtful, rests his chin on her hair. At the airport check-in desk, Carl and Allison stand facing a uniformed woman who checks a computer screen and smiles at them while two serious-looking, suited men walk over and show ID. Carl points at Allison and starts to smile just before they are in an interrogation room where thick-set Tweed narrows his eyes. Allison looks at Carl, disappointed, as they sit handcuffed, and Peter, Tweed, and Multack leave the room. Carl smiles weakly and stares at her wretchedly until Multack walks in to unlock Allison's handcuffs. Allison gets up and, without looking at him, leaves the room as a jet touches down in LA. Allison marches through the busy terminal building with Carl and Peter walking some way behind her. Carl retreats while Allison gets in a yellow cab and Peter watches Carl run back through the terminal building. Later, Carl watches a film and calls Allison, but in a meeting, he sits staring at the table. Meanwhile, on the terrace outside her apartment, Allison stands at an easel, painting. She checks her phone, sees it's Carl calling, and puts it back on the table. Carl takes a flying lesson but looks uninterested. Eventually, Carl stands on the edge of a bridge with a harness around his waist and ankles attached to a bungee rope.",
    "41": "DYLE shrugs. She offers him her cone, thrusting it forward with enough force to dislodge the ice-cream, and it lands right next to his lapel, over his outside breast pocket, including the Cathedral of NOTRE DAME in the background as REGGIE and DYLE step from the elevator. He goes into his room and she goes into hers. She enters, fixes her hair in the mirror, then goes to the door connecting her room with DYLE's. She unlocks it, tries to open it, but finds it locked. Disappointed, she knocks. He calls to her through the closed door as he empties his pockets. He sits down to take off his shoes but is interrupted by the sound of REGGIE screaming. He races for the connecting door, pulls back the bolt and rushes in. As DYLE enters, he wheels as the door is slammed and REGGIE, who had been standing behind it, locks it and pockets the key. He goes to the door leading to the hall and finds that locked as well. She smiles at him. DYLE looks at her, then sits down and starts to remove his shoes. Testing the water with his hand, he now steps in fully dressed. REGGIE can't believe her eyes. She goes to the open door for a closer look as he takes out his handkerchief and rinses it. He opens his coat and reads a label inside. He flicks a little water in her face, then takes the nail-brush and scrubs his watch and watch-band. He holds up his wrist so she can see the watch. He begins unbuttoning his suit. She turns and leaves, slamming the door after her. The PHONE rings and she answers it. CLOSE SHOT -- REGGIE on the phone, looking like the rug has been pulled out from under her. REGGIE slowly lowers the phone to its cradle, a worried expression on her face. Then the bathroom door opens and DYLE appears dressed in a large bath towel. She shakes her head. The large motor launch, moving along the river, gaily ablaze with lights. At a table for two by the rail, the city slowly passing in the b.g. They walk back to the table, where a WAITER is busy putting food on it, mostly on REGGIE's side. REGGIE reacts in surprise. She looks at him with happy amazement, then pushes her plate away. The lights go out. A searchlight near the boat's bridge has gone on and now begins sweeping the river banks. On benches by the water's edge, lovers are surprised by the bright light which suddenly and without warning discovers them in various attitudes of mutual affection. Some are embarrassed, some are amused and some (the most intimate) damn annoyed.",
    "528": "A couple stands by the window; one man gets up from his chair and walks away. Some guests sip their drinks, smiling, as the camera moves back to the piano and the book-laden wall. Evan is playing the piano with exuberance while Norma, still standing behind him, has a poignant, wistful expression on her face. Mavis the maid walks by with a tray of hors d'oeuvres, and the man takes one, mouthing his thanks, as the camera travels past the open bookshelf, past two boys in suits who are drinking soda and munching, to reveal Lee. She is leaning against another doorway, a faraway look on her face as she listens to the music. Mavis passes in the hall beyond the doorway. Several people, deep in conversation, stand nearby as Elliot, holding a drink, walks up behind her. Lee slips past Elliot and walks away. Elliot looks back at her briefly, then, sipping his drink, he turns and looks offscreen at the crowd in the living room. Holly is standing in the pantry, preparing some offscreen food when Hannah walks into view, headed for the refrigerator, carrying two tomatoes. Hannah opens the refrigerator, totally ignoring Holly, then walks over to the table, gathering up more food. Holly walks over to the sink and washes her hands, drying them as Hannah, her arms laden with vegetables, strides over to her sister. Hannah storms out a nearby door as Holly turns away from the sink. Holly wipes her hand on the towel as Hannah reenters the kitchen, carrying even more vegetables, and strides into the pantry area, flopping the vegetables down on the counter. Holly puts the dishtowel down and absently straightens some things on the food-laden table. Hannah angrily gathers up some spices from the table; Holly walks back onscreen holding a silver ice bucket, stops at the corner of the table, and faces Hannah. Hannah picks up a large bowl and carries it, along with her armload of spices, into the pantry area. Hannah, reacting, puts the spices down on the pantry counter while Holly turns away. Guests can be seen mingling and talking and helping themselves at a buffet table in the living room. Lee and Elliot can be heard offscreen as the camera slowly moves from the doorway across the empty dining room to reveal them in the midst of an intense conversation. Lee goes over to an open door and closes it quickly. The door opens and Mavis appears, holding a set of candlesticks. She walks over to the dining room table, which is already decked out with a floral centerpiece, glassware, and china, and puts them down as Lee and Elliot stand awkwardly near the door, waiting for her to leave.",
    "640": "Bo points at it, and Graham falters, opening the book. Graham looks uncertain, nodding dubiously as he takes the book from Morgan and starts to leaf through the pages, while Morgan and Bo look on. On one page is a simple sketch of an extraterrestrial with a teardrop-shaped head and large catlike eyes. On another page is a picture of a bluey-green alien with an angular jaw and black almond-shaped eyes. On a third page, a gloomy nighttime drawing depicts a UFO firing two red laser beams into a wooden farmhouse, which is on fire, with flames pouring from the upstairs windows. Lying on the lawn of the pictured house are three shadowy bodies, an adult and two children. Morgan and Bo are staring at the picture as Graham's eyes flick pensively from side to side, and they all jump back. Taking the book, he leaves and answers the phone on the landing. Graham stands stock still with the telephone receiver still pressed to his ear and glances down the landing into a room containing a dressmaker's dummy. Now clothed, Graham plods downstairs, takes a coat from the closet where Merrill is still glued to the TV, and then picks up some keys. Merrill looks confused. From the bedroom, Morgan is looking at clouds through a telescope as Bo stands beside him. Bo nods with a worried expression, gives a slow deliberate nod, hugs his arm, and avoids eye contact. Graham knocks at the house of Vet Ray Reddy. He opens the screen door, peers through slats in the wooden door behind it, then gingerly closes the screen as Graham gently releases the handle. Stepping back from the door, his keen eye scans from left to right. He turns and treads calmly along the wooden veranda surrounding the house. Reaching the closed window, he stops and looks through the glass into an office, where the compact ruin is deserted, and the solid dark wood desk is clattered with papers. Graham's gaze alights on a wooden chair lying upturned on the floor beside the lampshade, with its toppled vase on a small round table above and the naked bulb still glowing brightly, viewing the scene with restrained alarm. Then, backing away, he turns and spots the brown Chevy 4x4 parked on a short driveway with a figure at the wheel. Graham approaches the vehicle cautiously across a lawn, leaning over to get a view of its occupant. The passenger side window is lowered as Graham puts both hands on the sill and leans in with an inquisitive frown. Ray, the Asian man who stayed in town, sits with one hand clamped to the steering wheel, rocking nervously and staring numbly ahead. In the back are bundles of clothes which Graham eyes questioningly. Returning his attention to the front, he notices a blood stain on Ray's check shirt.",
    "1127": "Hermione crouches down and, taking out her wand, draws a circle in the air, producing a wreath of white roses. Harry wipes his nose with his sleeve and gazes at the grave. Comforting him, Hermione rests her head on his shoulder, then she turns and spots a dark figure watching them from a short distance away. Harry sees an old woman wearing a knitted cape with a hood, who turns and totters slowly away. They follow her up the street until Harry slows and stops beside a burned-out, roofless house. He looks over the gate at the overgrown garden and recalls Voldemort's attack, with both bodies lying on the floor, setting Harry's joy. They turn to find the old woman close beside them, and Harry approaches her as she stares at him. Inside a dark house, Harry takes a matchbox from Bathilda, lights a candle, and the wizened old woman studies Harry's face. He captures sight of something over her shoulder as Bathilda turns her attention to Hermione. Harry holds up the match beside a framed photograph of the young thief who stole Gregorovitch's Elder Wand. Bathilda gazes at him, then picks up the candle and eases her way past him. Hermione looks anxious as Harry follows Bathilda, leaving Hermione in the filthy living room. The tip of his wand lights up, illuminating his way up the stairs, while in the living room, the tip of Hermione's wand is also glowing. She picks up a book with a note attached to the cover, lifts the note to read the title, and turns the book over to reveal a moving picture of a smirking Rita. Upstairs, Harry reaches a dingy bedroom where the old woman is waiting for him, and he sees her looking at the locket around his neck. She indicates something across the room as downstairs, Hermione walks into another dark room, her wand as the only source of light, and disturbs a swarm of buzzing flies. Upstairs, Harry examines a photograph album on a dressing table as the old woman's face contorts, becoming cadaverous, and she disintegrates when Harry spins around. Downstairs, Hermione spots blood on the ceiling as the snake lunges. Harry fends it off with a chair, while downstairs, Hermione trips and falls. The snake hurls itself at Harry, smashing him through a brick wall into a child's bedroom, causing the light on the ceiling to sway. The snake wraps itself around Harry, who picks up a brick from the rubble and smashes the snake's head with it, causing it to slither off him. Harry hauls himself back through the wall as Hermione comes up the stairs, and the snake attacks again. Hermione flourishes her wand, hitting the snake and causing it to fall down the stairs. Harry's wand, dropped in the struggle, is lying at the top of the stairs.",
    "943": "Holmes pulls him away and whacks him with a curtain rail. As they fight, the Corsac attaches a line to Holmes' belt. Sim kicks the Corsac out of the window. The line between him and Holmes is pulled tight, dragging Holmes towards the window. Holmes is wrenched backwards, out of the window. He lands heavily on a barge carrying sand on the canal outside. The Corsac bursts up out of the sand and grabs him. Holmes breaks free and falls onto a lower deck. The Corsac tries to flee, but Holmes yanks him back with the rope connecting them. Men grab them both. The men release Holmes and the Corsac. Holmes grabs a club off one of the men watching and whacks the Corsac in the face. Then he yanks on the rope, pulling the Corsac over. The Corsac gets up again and cuts the rope linking them together. The Corsac starts to climb back up the window they fell from. Sim sees him coming and backs away from the window. One of the spectators urges Holmes on. Holmes shins up a rope hanging from a block-and-tackle on the side of the building. The Corsac gets back inside. Watson collects his winnings from the other players. Holmes smashes through a window and crashes into Watson, scattering all the money. Holmes sits up and sees the Corsac bounding along the second floor balcony above Sim, who runs along the first. The Corsac leaps down onto her floor. Holmes picks himself up and gives chase. Watson notices the other players eyeing his winnings, which are now scattered on the floor. A free-for-all erupts as everyone lunges for the cash. As Watson struggles with the other gamblers, Mycroft leaves the men he was chatting to. The Corsac leaps down some steps and trips Sim up. She rolls out of the fall and draws a knife. The Corsac dodges her attack and punches her in the face. He thumps her a second time and is about to strike with his own knife when Holmes intervenes. He kicks the Corsac out of a door and into the canal. Sim gets to her feet, clutching her nose, and turns to Holmes. Dr. Watson arrives, a bit drunk. He falls over. Carruthers looks dubious. Holmes retrieves Sim's bag and Rene's letter. The next day, he drives his car along a narrow road leading to a village. The car pulls up outside the church. Sporting dark glasses and smoking his long pipe, Holmes turns around to a bruised and beaten Watson, who is asleep beside him. He nudges Watson, who stirs but doesn't awake. Holmes gets out of the vehicle, walks round it and shoves Watson again. He still doesn't rouse.",
    "599": "The front door is off its hinges. As they enter the house, Dumbledore holds his wand in his undamaged left hand. The tips of their wands glow like torches. The house is in a mess. Pictures hang at angles. There are scratches on a door frame. Harry and Dumbledore enter the sitting room, where the furniture is toppled over. The room has been completely trashed. As Harry stares down at the paper, a spot of blood drops onto it. Harry looks up. Plaster has broken away, revealing bloodstained rafters. A drop lands on his forehead. Dumbledore wipes the blood off Harry's forehead with a finger, and tastes it with the tip of his tongue. Dumbledore glances suspiciously around the room. He fixes his eyes on an over-stuffed comfy armchair and slowly walks towards it. Harry follows. Dumbledore prods the armchair with his wand. A man in disguise. He spots Harry. Dumbledore sweeps his wand over the room. Bits of broken glass fly towards a shattered chandelier. It re-hangs itself from the ceiling. Harry steps aside, as a vinyl disk returns to a record player. Books fly back onto shelves, and a grand piano rights itself. The missing plaster renews itself on the ceiling, and Harry smiles. He looks down at his feet. Trapped under his trainer is a piece from the chandelier. He raises his foot, and it zooms up to its rightful place. Horace wears pajamas made from upholstery fabric. He grins at Harry. Harry crosses over to a collection of framed, moving photographs. A group of them raise glasses. Dumbledore leaves. Harry glances at Horace Slughorn, then goes out. As they walk down the path, Slughorn comes after them. In the street, Dumbledore holds out his arm. Harry braces himself. Dust rises as they apparate. Alone, Harry lands in a stream. Shaking water from his trainers, he trudges through a reed bed. He smiles when he recognizes the Weasley house. He sees Ginny in an upstairs window. Coming downstairs, Ginny spots Harry's trunk and white owl. On the stairs, Ginny runs to Harry and they hug warmly. As they part, they gaze at each other. Hermione runs up. Ron touches Hermione's cheek. Harry regards Ron and Hermione with interest. Harry, Hermione, and Ron are sitting on the floor, around a tray set on a stool. In a dingy, wet part of town, Draco's mother Narcissa walks along a narrow alley, with Bellatrix Lestrange. They wait for children to cycle past. Then, Narcissa steps out onto a street and knocks at a door. The two women wait outside in the rain. A face peers at them through the glass panel in the door. A round-faced man, Wormtail, lets them into Severus Snape's study.",
    "89": "Jean rushes toward the door, cloaked by the shower curtain but awkwardly trying to push it off; still thrashing, Jean crashes against the upstairs railing, trips on the curtain and falls, thumping crazily down the stairs. Grimsrud follows and trots down after her. Wade sits behind his desk; another man rises as Jerry enters, and Stan Grossman shakes his hand. Wade scowls, looks at Stan, and is angry. We are high and wide on the office building's parking lot. Jerry emerges wrapped in a parka, his arms sticking stiffly out at his sides, his breath vaporizing. He goes to his car, opens its front door, pulls out a red plastic scraper and starts methodically scraping off the thin crust of ice that has developed on his windshield; the scrape-scrape-scrape sound carries in the frigid air. Jerry goes into a frenzy, banging the scraper against the windshield and the hood of his car, but the tantrum passes; scrape-scrape-scrape - he goes back to work on the windshield. The door swings open and Jerry edges in, looking about, holding a sack of groceries. He shuts the door and has already seen the shower curtain on the floor. Jerry stands in wide shot, hands on hips, looking down at a telephone; after a motionless beat he picks up the phone and punches in a number. It is a flannel-shirt woodsman carrying a double-edged axe over one shoulder. As we hear the rumble of an approaching car, the continuing tilt and boom down brings us down the woodsman's body to a pedestal. A sweep of headlights illuminates a sign on the pedestal. The headlights sweep off and a car hums past and on into the background. The two-lane highway is otherwise empty. Carl drives while Jean lies bound and curled on the back seat underneath a tarpaulin, and from the back seat we hear whimpering. Grimsrud smokes and gazes out the window, then turns to look and stares at Carl, then turns back to the window. At a loud WHOOP Carl starts and looks back out the rear window; fifty yards behind a state trooper has turned on his gumballs. Carl looks up at the rear-view mirror and Grimsrud looks at him. Both cars have stopped, and Carl looks into the back seat as the car bounces and slows on the gravel shoulder. The trooper is stopped on the shoulder just behind them, writing in his citation book, as Carl watches and Grimsrud stares at Carl. The trooper walks up the shoulder, one hand resting lightly on top of his holster, his breath steaming in the cold night air. Carl opens his window as the trooper draws up; the trooper scans car interior, taking his time, while Grimsrud smokes and gazes calmly out his window.",
    "216": "At the foot of the cross, Everett snaps its last guy wire with his pincers, and the four men sprint off. As the crowd scatters, the cross descends toward Big Dan, who is frozen, looking up, and it crashes in a shower of sparks and embers that obliterates Big Dan Teague. A car pulls up in front of a town hall from which party sounds filter out, and Pappy O'Daniel emerges from the car with his retinue: Eckard, Spivey, and Junior. Delmar sulks while Everett is stunned. As headlights play, the men suck back into the alley as a car passes by. The car tools up to the banquet hall, and Homer Stokes emerges with his midget, who tosses his balled-up white hood into the car and both men shrug into their suitcoats; they start up the stairs with Stokes's pace brisk and the midget hopping awkwardly to keep up. Everett, Pete, Delmar, and Tommy enter through the back door with the blackface scrubbed off, and all four now wear long gray beards as a disguise, clumsily affixed with spirit gum. Each is carrying a musical-instrument case, and they elbow past the bustling kitchen help. Out in the banquet hall, Penny and Waldrip sit side-by-side at the head table, surrounded by the Wharvey gals, facing the hall with their backs to the stage as Everett, Pete, Delmar, and Tommy take their places. Pappy O'Daniel stands by Waldrip's chair, draping an arm over his shoulder and murmuring confidentially, as Waldrip sits stiffly erect, listening, frowning at a spot in space. Suddenly, Waldrip erupts, and she shakes her head vigorously and looks down at her plate as Everett continues pleading to her back. The band launches into \"Man of Constant Sorrow,\" precipitating a huge reaction. Everett, trying to get Penny's attention, is stunned at the ovation as he and the boys, still singing, exchange bemused looks. They shrug and lean into the song with a will. Everett performs an impromptu buck-and-wing, bringing the crowd to new heights of hysteria. Stokes is staring at the band, frowning, while the crowd stares at him, stone-faced, as he plows on. He is hit by a tomato and pelted by foodstuffs, shielding himself with one arm while bellowing into the mike. An old man in overalls and his wife sit hunched before a crystal set, listening to the tinny voice. They look at each other wordlessly and then look back at the crystal set. Stokes is almost drowned out by the music as his midget looks on apprehensively, and a disgruntled audience member yanks out the microphone plug, leaving Stokes to mouth inaudible words.",
    "445": "Don removes his hat in a courtly bow, very much at ease with the apples, and then passes the ladies who are chatting, while one of them tsk-tsks, and they both look after Don as he sits on a bar stool, putting down the paper bag. He takes the bills and change from his pocket and puts it on the bar as Nat pours the drink and returns to squeezing lemons. Don picks up the glass and is suddenly acutely aware of the people at the table and Nat's eyes, which causes the glass to freeze halfway to his mouth. He puts it down and starts playing the nonchalant, casual drinker -- the man who can take it or leave it -- then takes a pack of cigarettes from his pocket, shakes one out, and lights it. As he puts the match in the ashtray, his eyes fall on that jigger of whiskey, so he puts the handkerchief back in his pocket, lifts the glass, and drains it in one gulp. Nat comes up with the bar towel to wipe off the wet ring left by the glass, while Don holds the empty jigger in his hand. From the table in the background, Gloria heads for the powder room, passing Don and running her finger through the neckline of his hair, then she goes on. Don turns back to Nat, points at the bag with the apples showing, but Nat looks and doesn't get it until Don, like a magician, takes two apples out, revealing the necks of the bottles, prompting Nat to pull one. Nat leans over the bar towards Don as he points to the empty glass for Nat to fill it, and without a change of expression, Nat pours the second drink. Gloria returns from the powder room, and on her way to her gentleman friend at the table, she runs her finger through the neckline of Don's hair. She is almost past him when he catches her hand and pulls her towards him, then Don looks off toward the table, and she returns to the table. The camera focuses on the wet rings the wet glass has left on the bar, and in two quick dissolves, we see the five rings, then six, then nine. He puts the robe with the slippers inside it into the case as Wick slams shut the suitcase and snaps the lock. Wick takes his suitcase and goes into the living room, followed by Helen, setting down the suitcase and taking a topcoat from the closet, while Helen turns away from Wick, leans against the wall, hoping he won't see that she's crying. Don, with an empty jigger in his hand, stands at the same spot, only now leaning with his back against the bar in a place about half filled with eight customers at the bar and five tables occupied.",
    "1129": "He wrestles with the chain as it drags him back, and choking, pressed up against the ice, Harry can't find the opening where he entered the water. He hammers with his hands on the underside of the ice and kicks at it with his bare feet as a shadowy figure walks over the ice above him. Harry's movements slow, and his eyes close as the figure enters the water behind him. A hand grabs the sword, and Harry is hauled across the ice. He's leant against a fallen tree as the figure moves away still clutching the sword. Harry leans forward and grabs his glasses, and he sees Ron. Harry sets the locket on the fallen tree. Drenched, Ron stares awkwardly at Harry, then looks at the ground. Ron prepares himself, and the locket springs open, knocking Harry and Ron to the ground as a huge black cloud swirls over Ron and a swarm of spiders appears. Ghostly images of Harry and Hermione speak to Ron, and he sees naked images of Hermione and Harry kissing passionately. Ron seethes as he watches them, and with the sword in both hands, Ron races towards Harry, who cowers. Ron strikes the locket with the Sword of Gryffindor, and the black cloud and the images disappear. Harry stares at the open locket as Ron is on his knees and lets go of the sword. Harry sits on the ground beside him. Hermione wakes and comes out of the tent as Harry approaches. He indicates Ron and smiles, and Ron grins broadly. Hermione glares, stomps over, and wrenches the rucksack from Ron's shoulder, then turns back to Ron, who holds up the open locket. He glances at Harry, blinks, and looks away. Scruffy and bedraggled, Ron gives Hermione a faint smile, and she faces him with her arms folded and a set expression on her face. In the tent, Ron and Harry are watching a flame in a jar while Hermione sits outside. He gazes at the flickering flame, Harry takes it, and the flame flares and dies. She ignores Ron, rushing past him to address Harry and shows him Rita's book as Ron stands shoulder to shoulder with Hermione. He puts up his hand, and she glances at Harry, raising her eyebrows, and walks off, leaving Ron crestfallen as he lowers his hand. A vast expanse of open heath land stretches out with hills in the distance, and Ron trudges ahead of Hermione and Harry. A crooked house stands alone, with plums floating in the air like orange balloons. The top half of the door opens, and Xenophilius peers out as Harry moves towards the door. Inside, they sit in a cluttered room, each holding a mug, and all four raise their mugs and drink in unison. Xenophilius holds up the pendant, and Harry glances blankly at his friends, then back to Luna's father.",
    "148": "He takes the prisoner's stand. He looks around, a little surprised, a little affected by the demonstration. He looks up at the judge. For a minute, their eyes meet; the judge makes a little bow to Gandhi. Gandhi reciprocates, and the judge sits down. Featuring the reporters shrugging incredulously to each other, as they sit once more. The Advocate General is speaking from a folded journal. There is a little shock of reaction around the courtroom. The Advocate General smiles with a brittle disdain, then he turns to the judge. The judge nods. He turns, glancing at the empty table for defense counsel, and then to Gandhi. It is almost a cruel challenge to the obviously humane Broomfield. The reporters scribble, watching the Judge even as they write, because the mere doubt in the Judge's face reflects on the whole position of the British to India. He lowers his glasses soberly, staring at them for a moment. He looks up at Gandhi, and his own respect for him is almost poignantly manifest. A stunned intake of breath from the whole courtroom, then in absolute silence the clerk scribbles the sentence in his notebook. The Judge lowers his eyes. He folds, and refolds his glasses and then without looking at anyone, he rises. The court rises, and he walks stiffly to his chambers. He stands, staring at Broomfield, and now it is his face that shows the respect. From far above the hills, we see a car traveling along the road. Its style tells us some years have passed. The reporter from the New York Times, whom we first saw as a younger man in South Africa. He is in an open car, turning back to look at something, his face intrigued by what he sees. We see from Walker's point of view an Indian woman walking along the road, leading a tall camel that carries sacks of produce. Two young girls in ragged saris walk with her, and a boy of eight leads a smaller camel behind them. They are staring off at the car. The car is an early 1930s Morris Minor. Collins glances at him in surprise as he steers the car around another procession of camels heading toward the port. He is looking straight ahead. Across the emptiness of the temple, Ba faces him. Another angle featuring Walker and Collins, who are sitting alone, in the cool shadows of the temple, watching with fascination as Gandhi and Ba repeat their marriage ceremony for them, Walker jotting notes occasionally, but his eyes always glued to Gandhi and Ba, who are in part lost in memories and echoes of a significance only they can know. Showing the two of them before the altar of the temple, moving closer to each other.",
    "750": "Minnie sits down on the chair Celia has set out for her with a sigh, as Celia gently dabs the cut above Minnie's eye with a cloth. Minnie listens mutely to Celia's suggestion. At the Phelans', everyone is listening to Walter Cronkite on the black and white TV. Stuart kisses Skeeter on the forehead, and they're both wearing black. She turns her teary eyes back to the TV, where a color photograph of John F. Kennedy hangs next to a photograph of Aibileen's son. Minnie's eyes shift, and she flashes back to her visit to Hilly's. Hilly, sitting at a polished mahogany dining table, takes a bite of Minnie's pie and luxuriates in its deliciousness as Minnie watches her with a look of a satisfied bullfrog. Hilly takes another forkful, and Mrs. Walters stomps in with an empty glass and pours a whiskey. Hilly shoves the plate at Minnie, waves her away, and takes another forkful. Minnie slams down the plate as the last forkful enters Hilly's mouth. Hilly rises to her feet, and Minnie fixes her with a look of barely-disguised amusement, while Minnie's round black eyes indicate the pie. Mrs. Walters dissolves into giggles, and Minnie raises her eyes from the chocolate-colored pie to fix them on Hilly, who retches. Minnie picks up the remaining pie and flees as Skeeter shakes her head, and Minnie, wrapping her cardigan around her, storms out. A white-only Jackson City cab brings Mrs. Walters to the Junior League benefit dinner, where she joins the other elegantly-dressed guests climbing the steps towards the fairy-lit venue. The Footes arrive arm in arm, grabbing a glass of champagne from a mate's tray. Sugar, Minnie, and Aibileen are on duty in black uniforms with white collars and full white aprons, while Minnie nudges Aibileen to look at Celia's body-hugging pink dress. Polishing off her glass, Celia waves at Hilly, whose automatic smile freezes as she slaps her husband's cheek for looking. Charlotte and her husband are among the guests taking to the black and white checkered dance floor, next to Skeeter and Stuart who are dancing cheek to cheek. Celia, standing by the buffet table with another glass of bubbles, writes something down. Mr. Blackly performs a jig followed by a cartwheel on the dance floor, causing the maids to double up with laughter. Celia wanders unsteadily into the powder room, where Elizabeth, Jolene, and Mary Beth stand in a hostile line in front of the mantle piece. Celia leans forward to reapply her lipstick, turning her perfectly formed behind in their direction. In the ballroom, Hilly is at the mic and holds out her hand towards the dozen or more staff standing in a line. Skeeter's face tightens.",
    "1073": "The boy watches from long grass. He gives a smile as dry as the flat plains which stretch out to the hills on the horizon, and accompanies Sarah down the hill, away from the cemetery. The sun sets on the darkening plains and hills. Darkness settles on the house and buildings of Faraway Downs. The lights go out. Sarah is asleep in bed, moonlight filtering through the curtains. Fletcher looks out at the night, and urges an Aboriginal lady indoors. As King George chants by a fire, Sarah sits bolt upright in bed and lights a lamp. Something moves beneath the steps she's standing on, and King George dances by his hilltop fire. She hurries indoors to find the boy in her bedroom. As he strikes a pose, the curtains billowed. He grins broadly. Sarah's intrigued. A shadow falls over the porch. Fletcher peers in through the shutters, but seeing nothing and leaves. Sarah stands up and looks around the room. She goes to the window, accompanied by Nullah, and peers out. She turns with a start. The curtain is billowing. Clothes hang on a line in the morning sun. Fletcher emerges from his cabin. Nullah's mother hovers in the doorway. He looks around the homestead and scratches his head. She follows him out. Wearing an orange dress, she looks at Fletcher, then walks away from him and the cabin. He idly tosses a stone and watches her go. The sun rises in the clear blue sky. Sarah walks out onto the veranda of the main house. Nullah follows her. He scampers off, as two riders approach. Nullah, hiding behind the gate, opens it. Nullah walks slowly to him. She smiles and nods nervously. Nullah pulls away from the Chinese cook. He's climbed up and removed a chain holding the blades in place. The windmill swings around and starts to turn. They all stare as rusty water is pumped from a pipe. Fletcher chases after the boy. Nullah leaps over the fence before being grabbed by the man. He holds the boy's mother aside and hits him again as Sarah strides up. She cracks him across the face with a riding crop. She points a finger with steely determination. He reaches his truck, then looks around. Flynn tilts his head stubbornly. He backs up as Flynn joins Sarah. He drives off into the dusty distance. His Drovers abandon the cattle and ride off with him. Sing Song watches without emotion. Nullah, his mother, and her friend comfort each other and also join Sarah. She looks at Flynn, who respectfully removes his hat. She looks at her little entourage, and turns and sheds her eyes from the sun. Sarah sits at her messy desk.",
    "593": "Slughorn sits on a chair, looking anxious. At last, Ron comes round, sits up, then lies back weakly on the floor. In the infirmary, Ginny and Hermione sit beside Ron's bed as Madam Pomfrey checks his temperature. Harry turns as a group of staff come in, and Lavender rushes in. She sees Hermione at Ron's bedside and leans closer before running out as Hermione takes Ron's hand. McGonagall, Dumbledore, and Snape leave, followed by Ginny turning to Harry and Madame Pomfrey leaving. Hermione catches Harry's eye, and they exchange a smile. Harry is the last to leave the ward. Sitting on Ron's bed, Hermione strengthens her grip on his hand with a sigh of contentment. The shadow of a figure climbing stairs is cast on a wall. Going up the spiral staircase, Harry spots the figure through an archway: it's Draco Malfoy. Harry steps forward, watches him, and then follows. Draco leaves the upper corridor where the birdcage hangs, now with only one bird remaining. Draco stands still and closes his eyes. When Harry rounds the corner, Draco has disappeared. In the cluttered room, Draco holds the heavy cloth from the cabinet, holding the missing bird. He closes the bird inside the cabinet, picks a single feather off his cuff, and holds it up to the light. Draco opens the cabinet: the bird has gone. Rain pours down on the Borgin and Burke shop sign. Through the dusty arched window at the rear of the shop, a dim light reveals the triangular cabinet, its door firmly closed. Draco nervously opens his cabinet door, looks inside, and finds the bird dead. Draco stares at its lifeless body and frowns, then sobs. Lavender sits in the Great Hall glaring at Ron. Clenching his wand, he sits beside Hermione, as snowflakes start to fall. Ron looks puzzled. Ron, Hermione, and Harry look across at Lavender, who lifts her chin and grits her teeth. Harry's eyes flit from Ron to Hermione and back again, while Hermione looks down. Harry reads a note scrawled in his advanced potion book, jumps to his feet, picks up his book, then marches up the hall to Katie. She looks over his shoulder and stares. Harry turns and sees Draco watching them. Draco backs away, turns, and Harry's out. Katie walks away with her friend as Harry marches down the Great Hall. Draco makes his way upstairs. Harry pushes his way through a group of students as Draco strides along the upstairs corridor where the birdcage is now empty. Harry isn't far behind. Loosening his tie, Draco rushes into the boy’s lavatories, leans over a basin, then pulls off his sweater. Turning on a tap, he studies his distraught face in a mirror.",
    "532": "She is flipping through a book by a curtained window. Lee puts the book she's been holding down on the desk, only to pick up another one. She looks at the offscreen Elliot and reacts. The camera moves to a blushing Elliot, following him now as he walks across the room. As Lee speaks, Elliot parts a hanging curtain against the wall to reveal a stereo and some records. He looks at the offscreen Lee. As Elliot reaches inside the stereo shelf, grabbing a bottle of antihistamines, the camera moves back to Lee, who sits down on the bed. She is still holding a book. Elliot walks over to Lee; he sits down on a footstool in front of her. She chuckles; Elliot smiles and chuckles with her. Hannah, eating a carrot stick, enters the bedroom. The camera stays with her momentarily as she walks towards Elliot and Lee. Holly laughs, and Lee glances over to her, reacting. Hannah, embarrassed, reacts and sits with her hands on her face. They look at Evan, listening. Hannah, embarrassed, makes a victory sign. Lee and Holly try to suppress their laughter. Norma glares at them. Elliot wraps his arm around Hannah; he pulls her towards him affectionately and kisses her on the cheek. She hugs him back. Mavis the maid exits, carrying some trays, as the group starts to cheer and applaud. Holly waves her napkin at April, then holds up her wine glass. The group continues to cheer as they all toast Hannah. She reacts, smiling but embarrassed. The guests, sipping their wine, quiet down as Norma continues to speak. Lee and Holly unsuccessfully try to contain their laughter. Mavis reenters the dining room to serve more food to the children. Norma toasts her daughter; everyone follows her. The applause and cheers begin anew. Hannah, reacting, chuckles. Hannah tenderly takes Elliot's hand as she looks around the table. He, in turn, kneads her shoulder, chuckling with equal tenderness. Hannah, still embarrassed, looks down at a plate. The group applauds once more, toasting and drinking, and warmly sounding their approval. Classical string music plays as the film cuts to a taxi moving down Broadway towards the camera, passing a truck on the right, the Winter Garden marquee advertising Cats, and several buildings, and as the taxi moves offscreen, the classical music still playing, the movie cuts to the taxi's backseat. Lee sits by the window, leaning her head in her hand, a reflective look on her face. Lee stirs a cup of coffee on the counter of the loft's modern kitchen area; a nearby vase holds flowers. She walks across the loft, with its high ceilings and beige walls, holding her coffee. Lee continues to walk, past a modern chaise, a bookcase, some sofas, and two columns.",
    "488": "Norman stands watching him drive away as the car pulls up and Arbogast gets out, leaving the motor running. As he starts to walk across the highway, the camera pulls away, and Arbogast reaches the phone booth and enters. The camera starts forward, and we see Arbogast remove a small notebook from his pocket, check a number, drop a dime in the slot, and dial. He hangs up and gets out of the phone booth. A distant view shows the House and Motel, with a light on in the house and also in Norman's office. We see Norman emerge from his office and move along the porch toward the distant cabins, carrying sheets on his arm. He goes into the last cabin and switches the light on. The hood of the white Ford enters the scene and stops, and Arbogast gets out and goes over to the Motel office. Arbogast enters, looks around the empty office, and calls out. He goes over to the door to the parlor, enters, looks around the bird-ridden room, goes over to it, finds it unlocked, and with a quick, cautious look around, he opens it, straightens up, and goes out. He goes off and dashes up the stone steps to the House. The camera holds as Arbogast goes up onto the porch. The house is dark within except for a faint spill of light in the foyer, coming from the upstairs hall. After a careful wait, he crosses to the stairs and starts up slowly and guardedly, placing his foot squarely on each step to test for squeaks or groans before placing his full weight on it. The camera follows, remaining on floor level but traveling along the stairway as Arbogast makes his way up. We see Arbogast coming up the stairs, and then the door of the mother's room opens, carefully and slowly. As Arbogast reaches the landing, the door opens, and the mother steps out, her hand raised high, the blade of an enormous knife flashing. The knife slashes across his cheek and neck, blood spurts, and he stumbles back, staggering down the staircase. He frantically gropes for the balustrade as he goes backward down the stairs, and as he collapses at the bottom, the black head and shoulders of Mrs. Bates plunge into the foreground as the camera moves in to contain the raising and descending murder weapon. Meanwhile, Lila sits close by the phone, looking as if she hasn't moved from it in the last hour, while Sam paces, occasionally stopping at the window, glancing out, and pacing again, creating a thick atmosphere of smoke, tension, and weariness in the small, otherwise cozy room."
