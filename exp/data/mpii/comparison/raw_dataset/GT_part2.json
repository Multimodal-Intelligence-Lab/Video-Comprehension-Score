    "523": "The two sisters walk away from the rack, Hannah slightly in the lead. Holly pauses, looking at her sister. They continue to walk. Holly looks at her sister for a beat. A female customer, who'd come over to the table, browsing through the rack of clothes near Hannah, looks up, reacting. She walks away. She walks past Holly and briefly looks at a different rack of clothes beneath the table. She walks offscreen to a nearby rack; the camera remains focused on Holly. Holly chuckles and begins to look through the scarves on the table. A group of theater executives, including the producer, the director, and two assistants, sit in a cluster in the empty audience, talking; they look up at the offscreen Holly, who is auditioning on the stage. The film moves from the audience to the stage where Holly, her hands clasped in front of her, continues to sing her song. A large group of other hopefuls are seen in the background behind her. The camera moves from Holly back to the executives in the audience. The camera has reached the executives in the audience. They are now chattering among themselves, Holly forgotten. A theater marquee can be seen on the busy street as Holly and April walk down the street towards the camera, moving closer and closer as they talk. Holly looks away sadly; she shakes her head. The film cuts to Father Flynn's rectory office. The Catholic priest looks out a simple stained-glass window, then turns to an offscreen Mickey. The camera moves back to reveal Mickey, his back to the camera, sitting in front of Father Flynn's desk. The movie cuts to Mickey's face. The camera cuts back to Father Flynn, who walks over to a leather armchair next to a table set for tea. He begins to pour the tea into china cups. Father Flynn clasps his hands in his lap. The film abruptly cuts to the long hallway in Mickey's parents' apartment. Mickey's mother stands in front of this bureau at the hallway's end, screaming at the top of her lungs, holding her heart dramatically. His father walks into view, carrying a teacup and a candy dish. He strides past Mickey towards the kitchen. Holding the dirty dishes in his hand, Mickey's father looks at his son. Mickey's father walks offscreen again, to the kitchen sink. Mickey's father walks out of the kitchen, past his son, to the living room. Mickey stops at the bathroom door at the other end of the hallway. He starts to pound it. Mickey's father comes back on screen; he's carrying a plate of hors d'oeuvres and an empty glass towards the kitchen. He stops and looks down the hall at Mickey, who's now struggling to open the bathroom door.",
    "369": "She watches him while he slowly drinks the entire glass, thirstier than he imagined. While he's drinking, Will, back from the grocery store, reaches the top of the stairs. He hears voices coming from the bedroom. Will quietly approaches the door, not exactly sneaking, but not exactly announcing his presence. The door is open a few inches, letting him look in on his father and his wife. In the hallway, Will shifts to a new position, letting himself listen to the story one more time. Bruised and bandaged, Edward sorts through a big bag of mail with help from Sandra. He rips open an official-looking letter. Reading it, his face drops. FLUTE and DRUM, music rising to a military cadence. With a buzz cut and paratrooper gear, Edward squats with a dozen other SOLDIERS. The noise of the ENGINES is deafening, but Edward is engrossed in an Asian phrasebook. The JUMP LEADER yells. One by one the men jump out, their chutes clipped to a main line. When his time comes, Edward leaps. Looking down, he can see the white parachutes disappearing into the darkness. It finally POPS. Edward jumps from the plane. A THOUSAND CHINESE SOLDIERS sit, bored, watching the equivalent of a U.S.O. show. A CHINESE VENTRILOQUIST is on stage with his Communist puppet. We have no idea what they're saying to each other, but every act is fundamentally the same. The EMCEE comes on to usher him off the stage before he's finished. The Ventriloquist protests, but finally gives in. We LOOK DOWN with Edward, who is drifting right for the stage. He can't steer. He's helpless. The lights go out as a DRUM ROLL begins. He lands with a CLANG on the lighting catwalk above the stage. He barely grabs on, disconnecting his chute just as the curtain goes up. The curtain rises to reveal PING (27) at a microphone. She's as gorgeous a woman as you'll ever see. She stands with her hips turned in profile. Her body is a knockout, dress cut to reveal skin. The soldiers are on their feet, WHISTLING and HOLLERING. UP ON THE CATWALK, Edward is surprised by an ENEMY SOLDIER. The two men begin to SCUFFLE. Ping sings melody while an off-stage voice carries perfect harmony. Ping HUFFS, turning her back on her sister. Jing reaches deeper into the closet to find a new dress, exposing Edward's hiding place. She GASPS. Ping turns to look. Jing grabs her, a hand over her mouth, but it's too late. A rifle-toting GUARD looks in. Pretending to be her bitchy sister, the guard obeys. Ping shakes her sister off. Edward pulls a photo out of his flak jacket. Even Ping is a little affected.",
    "907": "In the outer office, the burly agent downs a paper cup of water and passes Doris, who glares at him as he returns to the interrogation room. The interrogator returns, shuts the door, and eyes Billie. He crosses to her and grabs her chin again, shakes her, and Billie's mouth hangs open. She shudders, and her lips tremble as she finds words. The two agents leave her. On the way through the field office, the interrogator points to Doris, who holds the telephone at her shoulder. He puts on his jacket as the other men gather their things and move out. Doris dials her telephone. The agents run up a stairwell and, standing outside an apartment door, one shoots the top and bottom hinges. They rush in. Daylight filters into a bare room through an open window. The place is empty, and the burly agent stiffens his jaw. Back in the interrogation room, Billie sits with her head down. The two agents barge in, and the burly one grabs a phone book and whacks her with it. She keeps her head down, then looks directly at him. As Purvis enters the field office, Doris approaches him. In the interrogation room, she lowers her head and wipes her mouth. The interrogator glares down at her and tensely wipes his mouth, while Billie looks him in the eye. He sneers and winds up with his fist, but Winstead intercepts his arm and slams him against the wall. Purvis enters, and the other interrogator quickly uncuffs Billie's right arm from the chair. As she holds her wrist, Purvis leans over to her. He stands upright as Billie presses down on the arms of the chair to get up, then stops. Purvis glances at the other interrogator, then lifts Billie from the chair and carries her out. In the hall, the rest of the agents stand aside as he passes with the weakened woman. In the interrogation room, Winstead lowers his arm from the burly agent's throat and leaves. Purvis nods to Doris, who escorts them. In the interrogation room, the burly agent stays put beside the open door, out of the sightline of his peers, who stare in from the hall. In a pool hall, Marty dials a pay phone, and at his home, Nitti answers. A woman sits at a bar, and a door opens across the room. Marty enters and takes a seat next to her. Her weary gaze hangs straight ahead, then she looks directly at Marty. He takes her hand and gazes into her eyes. They pick up their drinks, share another glance, and both sip. At night, a lake reflects city lights. Marty leads Anna to a car. She gets in back and gazes at the unseen driver.",
    "1297": "Graham watches them turn into a store as Merrill steps onto the sidewalk, hands in his pockets, and walks away. Graham turns and calls after him, but Merrill waves over his shoulder and keeps walking. Graham starts across the street to the pharmacy, which is three aisles wide, where Mr. and Mrs. Nathan, a couple in their early seventies, sit behind their counter watching a black and white TV. Morgan steps up to the counter and shrugs, prompting Mrs. Nathan to push her husband aside and point to the far corner. A gum-chewing pharmacist in her early twenties, who looks like she's in her teens, glances through back shelves of medicines as she listens to the radio, while Graham stares at her. When Tracey speaks, her voice is a bit shaky, and Graham notices her teary eyes. Meanwhile, Merrill is at a narrow Army recruiting center, staring at a poster of a muscular guy in an Army uniform on a beach. Inside the small storefront space is a desk, where a crewcut guy savors the beat of silence before Merrill smiles and the crewcut guy smiles back. The crewcut guy reaches for a stack of brochures, picks the top one, and hands it to Merrill, who looks up from it. The crewcut guy begins to stare at Merrill closely as Merrill turns to Lionel, a young man about his age sitting at a folding table, who smirks. Merrill tucks the pamphlet in his jacket, looking like he's not going to say anything, but when he does, the words are soft and worn, as if said a hundred times. Merrill turns and starts walking, making a quick move toward Lionel as he passes him, causing Lionel to flinch and cover his face. Merrill then walks out the door of the army recruiting office. Graham glances at the girl sitting sideways at the counter, and his eyes widen as Morgan turns a knob on the side and hands Graham the monitor in the front seat. Everyone becomes frozen, standing next to the station wagon, with three doors open, and Graham keeps it out in the air as he closes his door. He looks to Merrill over the roof of the station wagon, hands the monitor over the hood, and Merrill reaches for it. Graham looks at Merrill, who's now one of them, and Morgan is the first one to move, climbing from the back passenger door to the back bumper and onto the station wagon roof. Morgan then crawls on the roof and takes the monitor ever-so-gently out of Graham and Merrill's outstretched hands.",
    "37": "Laszlo reaches the entrance to the cafe as Rick comes out, and he stops to address Rick politely. As he exits, Laszlo looks after him with a puzzled expression. At the linen stall, Ilsa examines a tablecloth which an Arab vendor is endeavoring to sell, and Rick walks up behind her. She looks briefly at Rick, then turns away, maintaining a politely formal manner, and walks away into the cafe as Rick stares after her in stunned disbelief. Ilsa and Laszlo then sit with Ferrari, who gets to his feet and walks away while Ilsa smiles faintly and again. At the bar, Ferrari talks to a waiter as Laszlo glances in the direction of the bazaar. Ferrari looks shrewdly at Ilsa while there's a moment's pause as this sinks in, and Ilsa's face darkens as Laszlo quietly observes. Ferrari bows to them. Later, a European picks a tourist's pocket, and the tourist laughs. The European dashes off and collides with Carl, who then leaves. As Rick lights a cigarette, Renault shows up, and Rick pours a drink for him. Renault gets up and strolls away. At the bar, Yvonne and the German officer place their orders, and she indicates with her hand where she wants them. A French officer makes a remark to Yvonne, and they begin to fight, as Strasser eyes him closely and smiles. Renault lights a cigarette and puffs away. Carl, bottle in hand, approaches the table of a middle-aged German couple, the Leuchtags, and sits down. He produces a glass from a back pocket, and they clink glasses and drink. Annina meets Renault in the hallway as she leaves the gambling room, and then she sees Rick and goes to his table. Rick looks at her as Annina shakes her head. He pours himself a drink as Annina appears very disturbed. Rick looks at her closely, stares off into space, and abruptly rises. Laszlo looks around as Rick snaps his fingers for the headwaiter, then walks over to Sam and whispers something to him. Sam shakes his head as Rick leaves. A waiter appears at Ilsa and Laszlo's table while Jan sits at the roulette table with only three chips left and seems bewildered. As Rick comes up, the croupier speaks to Jan, and Rick stands behind him. Jan looks at Rick and then at the chips in his hand. Rick and the croupier exchange looks, and the croupier understands what Rick wants him to do and spins the wheel. Jan pauses, then puts the chips on twenty-two. The wheel stops spinning, and Carl follows the proceedings, fascinated, as Jan hesitates, then withdraws his hands. Carl continues to watch as the wheel spins and stops, and Jan rises to go to the cashier. A customer complains to Carl, and meanwhile, Rick has walked over to the croupier, then smiles slightly and goes toward the door.",
    "759": "David is sitting alone at the table in a small dimly lit kitchen, staring down at the spoon he’s holding against the rim of a cereal bowl, and nods slightly as he brings the spoon under control. He walks down the hall past an open doorway and starts to go upstairs, where his wife looks up at him from inside the room. He stops and looks down at her; she’s standing in front of an open drawer, drops her eyes momentarily, and looks up again gently. He continues upstairs. David, in a gray jacket, walks past a large sign reading \"Memorial Service for the families of East Rail Train 177.\" In the church, a priest stands in the pulpit, and photos cover a large board by the pulpit. Outside the church, David heads towards his car, stops, looks at the windscreen, walks to it, and takes an envelope from under the windscreen wiper. He turns the envelope over, frowning, flicks open the unsealed flap, and stands looking at the card for some moments before turning and gazing back at the church. In a locker room, David opens one of the chipped green doors, stops in the doorway of an office, and takes off his baseball cap. A gray-haired woman with gold-rimmed glasses sits at a computer, glances at her computer screen, picks up a pen, makes a note, puts down the pen, and returns to her work, ignoring him. David pulls on his baseball cap and goes. A cape-hooded figure stands motionless in an archway silhouetted black against the teeming rain, watching an American football training session. One player suddenly erupts into a sprint, sidestepping opponents without losing speed, captures the ball thrown from behind, and dives over the line, tossing the ball to another player and trotting back again. Protected from the rain by the hood of his cape, David sighs deeply. In the locker room, David towels his head and face, puts his towel away, and glances to his right at an older man in the doorway, then stares at the locker door, and glances at Noel. In a darkened room, a hand reaches out and switches on a bedside lamp, and David, head on a pillow, looks sideways at his son who’s sleeping peacefully, while a clock on the other side of the bed reads a quarter to one. David stands at his wife's closed door, and Audrey frowns and shakes her head. From blackout, a fuzzy grayness takes the shape of a sling holding the arm of a black boy sitting in a strangely hazy living room, with a photo on the wall behind and a corner table with a lamp on it.",
    "144": "He has deliberately if delicately caught the eye of both Jinnah and Maulana Azad during this. His smile flitters cynically on the mouths of the others on his side. He looks at them all, then up at Lord Chelmsford behind them. The top is lifted, whiskey pours. The camera pulls back. We are still in the Council Room, but time has passed. The Indian delegation has gone, and the British are relaxing as a servant pours. And they all laugh. There are some smiles, but not all of them are quite so amused. It is an instruction they all find correct. A roar of approval from a huge crowd. We are featuring two British soldiers, their faces partially lit by a flickering torch light that reveals their tense wariness. And we can see its cause. A huge crowd is gathered around a platform -- torches sprinkled through it -- and their mood is confident, belligerent. As their defiant roar carries through the night air we see that Gandhi sits cross-legged on the platform. Patel, now for the first time in an Indian tunic, and Azad, also in an Indian tunic. Desai, Gandhi's new male secretary, is with them. But it is Ba who is speaking at the microphone, who has brought the shout of defiance from the crowd. It is the end of her speech and she makes the pranam and turns away. There is applause and noise, but Ba does not acknowledge it; she simply sits cross-legged behind Gandhi, who is talking with Patel and Nehru. At last he rises, and the noise and applause increase to something like chaos. In close shot we see other British soldiers watching on the perimeter of the crowd and they are now made even more wary by the enthusiasm of this greeting. Gandhi fiddles with his glasses, preoccupied; finally he looks out over the crowd and holds up a hand -- almost lazily -- and gradually, but quite definitely, the crowd stills. We intercut with the crowd, listening raptly. Gandhi holds up one finger. Neither of these goals is easy, and the audience reaction shows it. Now Gandhi raises a third finger. And the crowd breaks into stamping and applause. Gandhi lets it run for a time, then stills it with the one small gesture as before. This has sobered the audience somewhat. Now he looks out across them as though seeking something. There is an excited stir; he silences it. As suitcoats, shirts, vests, trousers, are flung into a pile. Featuring the two British soldiers -- later -- on the edge of the crowd, staring off, their faces now brightly lit by darting flames. A huge triangular pile burns before the platform, an excited half-naked crowd swirling in the shadows around it.",
    "57": "Evelyn is breathing very deeply now. She lifts her head and looks up at him. He's genuinely puzzled. Gittes sighs. She begins to cry softly. Gittes looks over to Evelyn. Her hair covers most of her face from him. There is a long moment of silence. She nods. He gets out and slams the car door. The spray is hitting him full on the top of the head. Gittes is so exhausted he's literally holding onto the nozzle as the water pours down. He shuts the shower off, reaches weakly for a towel, dabs his nose lightly with it. Pads around in elegant silk pajamas. He walks over to the window where morning light is streaming in. He closes the curtains, collapses on the bed, on top of the covers, inert. Gittes lets it go on for a moment, then picks it up without saying anything. Gittes slowly rises to one elbow. He hangs up, falls back down. Gittes swears, picks it up. Before Gittes can say anything, the phone clicks dead. It is a bungalow courtyard with a very narrow walkway and sickly green stucco. Gittes is at the front door. It's slightly ajar. He knocks. He opens it and enters. Morning light filters through the half-open blinds. Dust particles in the shafts of light. It's still and empty. Gittes sees something down the hall, under the legs of a telephone table. Gittes moves toward it. It is grotesque. When he gets closer he can see it's a wilted head of lettuce. Just inside the kitchen some radishes and onions lie on the linoleum. Gittes walks on into the kitchen. Clearing the kitchen counter, Gittes sees Ida Sessions lying on her back on the floor, surrounded by the groceries from a broken bag. Ice cream has melted around her. Her eyes are open, a stream of ants is moving across the ice cream and into her mouth. She's recognizable as the woman who posed as Evelyn Mulwray. He gingerly opens her handbag, fishes for its contents, takes them and looks at them on the kitchen counter. Wallet with a few bills in it, driver's license with her name. A Screen Actors Guild card. Gittes nods, turns, carefully replaces the items in the purse. He idly opens the broom closet, pantry, and even Frigidaire, which is all but empty. Then he steps over her body and moves across the hall to a door that is slightly ajar. Gittes enters and turns on the light. Escobar and another plainclothed man stand in the bathroom by the entrance to the bedroom door. Gittes turns around. A third man is now coming down the hall from the bedroom. The assistant starts to move for Gittes who is ready for him.",
    "465": "Then suddenly, Fezzik, as he jumps forward with stunning speed for anyone his size, reaches for the Man In Black, who drops to his knees, spins loose, and slips between the Giant's legs. Fezzik considers this a moment, then attacks, and if he moved quickly last time, this time he is blinding, and as the Man In Black slips down to avoid the charge, Fezzik moves right with him. Instead of twisting free and jumping to his feet, this time the Man In Black jumps for Fezzik's back, and in a moment he is riding him, with his arms locked across Fezzik's windpipe, one in front, one behind. The Man In Black begins to squeeze, tighter. Fezzik charges toward a huge rock that lines the path, and just as he reaches it, he spins his giant body so that the entire weight of the charge is taken by the Man In Black. The power of the charge is terrible, the pain enormous, but he clings to his grip on Fezzik's windpipe. Again Fezzik charges, slower this time, but still a charge, and again he spins and creams the Man In Black against the rough boulder. The punishment is terrible, and for a moment, it seems as if he is going to let go of Fezzik's windpipe and crumble, but he doesn't; he holds on. Again Fezzik slams the Man In Black against a boulder, only this time his power has diminished, and Fezzik starts to slowly collapse. There isn't much breath coming. The Man In Black, holding his grip as Fezzik tries to stand, halfway makes it, but there is no air. Back to his knees he falls, holds there for a moment, and pitches down to all fours. The Man In Black increases the pressure. Fezzik tries to crawl, but there is just no air. Fezzik goes to earth and lies still. Fezzik, as the Man In Black turns him over, puts his ear to Fezzik's heart. The Man In Black stands and nimbly scoops up his sword with his foot, catches it as he dashes off up along the mountain path. Prince Humperdinck slips his boot into a footprint in the sand. Count Rugen, mounted, watches. Behind him, half a dozen armed warriors, also mounted. A great white horse waits riderless in front. Humperdinck is all over the rocky ground, and maybe he isn't the best hunter in the world. Then again, maybe he is, because as he begins to put his feet into strange positions, we realize that what he is doing is miming the fencers. And he gallops off. The Man In Black is cresting the peak of the mountain.",
    "933": "He shows Watson the chess piece. In the auditorium, Moriarty watches the performance, apparently spellbound. Holmes, Watson, and Sim hurry into the street and make their way towards the Hotel de Triomphe. The cake containing the bomb is being delivered to the hotel by the rough-looking man and his identical accomplice. In a meeting room at the hotel, Meinhard is making a speech. Holmes and the others race towards the hotel. Meinhard turns to look at the cake, which explodes. Out in the street, Holmes and the others see a massive fireball erupt from the hotel. In the opera house, Don Giovanni throws himself at the feet of the Commendatore statue. Moriarty watches, transfixed, as demons surround Don Giovanni. Holmes, Watson, and Sim run into the hotel and survey the carnage. The demons close in around Don Giovanni. The statue sinks into the ground. In the hotel, Holmes finds Meinhard's body and looks at a ring on the little finger of the dead man's left hand. Looking around, Holmes spots a bullet hole in a wall. He pulls a small telescope out of his jacket and, through it, sees another bullet hole in a window nearby. Beyond it, in the distance, there's a statue on top of a building. Later, he, Watson, and Sim are up on the building, beneath the statue. Holmes imagines a rifle. Moriarty's agent is the sniper. He wedges it in an ornate carving. Holmes recalls entering the opera house. Moran loads his Martini action rifle and aims it at Meinhard. He takes his shot. Day, the Eiffel Tower. Sim and Watson are sitting at a table outside a cafe at the foot of the tower. Holmes, disguised as an old man, is sitting at a nearby table, listening. Once Moriarty and Moran have gone, he leaps to his feet and dashes off down the back staircase. He pulls off his wig and tosses it to a waiter. Nearly colliding with another waiter, he dons a bellhop's uniform and removes his mustache just in time to intercept Moriarty and Moran in the lobby. Sim takes Watson's hat. She exchanges it for a battered old hat. Holmes eyes the horse uncomfortably. Watson pulls her face. Sim, Watson, and a group of gypsy men ride through the forest. Trailing in their wake comes Holmes, astride a very small pony. The gypsies gallop on through the woods. Holmes bumps along uncomfortably on the pony's saddle. They stop a little way away from a border post. Holmes watches through his telescope as troops stop people crossing. Holmes looks disgruntled at the prospect of more riding. He passes the gypsies as they have a break. The gypsies stare after him as he trots by.",
    "804": "Ferris shoots him. Ferris runs to the house. Ferris enters the house with his gun held out in front. He turns a corner and sees a man holding a detonator with wires attached. Ferris shoots him and runs out. As the house blows up, Ferris is thrown off his feet. The black choppers fly above a winding river, then a forest. Bassam drags Ferris to the four-by-four. Ferris burns his hand as he grabs CDs and cassettes from the fire. Bassam drags him to the four-by-four, throws him in the back, and drives off. Explosions rip through the buildings. Two four-by-fours drive towards Ferris and Bassam. Ferris cocks a rifle. Ferris shoots at the other vehicles as they approach. They collide on a bend and ram into a rock. Bassam drives off along a dirt road. The two choppers fly over the desert. Ferris keeps shooting at the Iraqis as they follow in the four-by-fours. Bassam radios. The choppers fly overhead. An Iraqi in each of the pursuing four-by-fours loads a rocket-propelled grenade into a launcher. Ferris leans out of the window and shoots at them. The RPG grazes a chopper and the chopper destroys one of the four-by-fours. The other four-by-four gains on Ferris and Bassam. The chopper fires a rocket which destroys the second four-by-four and knocks Ferris and Bassam's four-by-four onto its roof. It slides to a stop in the dirt, throwing Ferris about in the back. One of the choppers lands. A soldier runs to Ferris. Ferris is hauled into the chopper. A soldier knocks Ferris out with an injection and the chopper takes off. Ferris lies by the open hatch. His face splattered with blood. Lying in a hospital, Ferris remembers being with Bassam and his family. The Iraqi prisoner being beaten to death. A doctor leans over Ferris, who wakes. In a yard outside, soldiers are playing basketball. Using tweezers, the doctor picks a sharp fragment from an open wound in Ferris' arm. He puts it with many other fragments in a kidney bowl. U.S. Military Base, Qatar, Persian Gulf. Ferris sits outside. Ferris takes a phone from the agent. Ferris frowns and stares intensely. Ferris hangs up and looks down. There's a bandage around his left forearm. He picks at a small bloody wound and digs out a splinter of bone. He holds up the tiny pointed fragment on his fingertip for a moment. Ferris opens a matchbox and drops the fragment into it. Deep in thought, he rubs his hands together. A grand boulevard with palm trees along strips of grass running between the lanes of traffic. Ferris is in a dirty black BMW with a heavy-set guy wearing shades, Skip.",
    "250": "Lance continues his frenzied search as Jody calls to him. As he continues searching, flipping and knocking over things, Jody appears in the doorway, and Lance spins toward her. Lance angrily knocks over a pile of items and leaves the shot, heading for the living room. Vincent is bent over Mia, talking softly to her, when Lance reenters the room. Lance bends down by the black case brought in by Jody, opens it, and begins preparing the needle for injection. Vince rips her blouse open as Jody stumbles back into the room, hanging back from the action. Vince points to Mia's right breast, and Lance glances over and nods. As Lance readies the injection, Vincent looks up at Jody, who runs to the desk, opens the top drawer, and, in her enthusiasm, spills the contents (bills, papers, pens) to the floor. The injection is ready. Lance hands Vincent the needle, and Jody hurriedly joins them in the huddle with a big fat red magic marker in her hand. Vincent grabs the marker from Jody and makes a big red dot on Mia's body where her heart is. Then, once you do, push down on the plunger. Vincent lifts the needle up above his head in a stabbing motion, looking down on Mia, who is fading fast. Vincent's eyes narrow, ready to do this, while Lance, on his knees right beside Vincent, does not know what to expect. A red dot is on Mia's body, and the needle is raised, ready to strike. Jody's face is alive with anticipation. The needle is in the air, poised like a rattler ready to strike. The needle leaves frame, thrusting down hard as Vincent brings it down, stabbing Mia in the chest. Mia's head is jolted from the impact, and the syringe plunger is pushed down, pumping the adrenaline out through the needle. Mia's eyes pop wide open, and she lets out a hellish cry of the banshee. She bolts up in a sitting position, needle stuck in her chest screaming. Vincent, Lance, and Jody, who were in sitting positions in front of Mia, jump back, scared to death. Mia's scream runs out, and she slowly starts taking breaths of air. The other three, now scooted halfway across the room, shaken to their bones, look to see if she's alright. Mia, still breathing, not looking up at them, speaks in a relatively normal voice and then turns around. Vincent is out of the car, standing on the walkway, with a big distance between the two. Mia smiles, and the two walk toward each other, holding out their hands to shake, which they do. Mia lets go of Vincent's hand and silently makes the see-no-evil, hear-no-evil, and speak-no-evil sign with her hands.",
    "407": "His eyes open suddenly. The view pulls back slowly from a close-up of a television screen with snow on it to reveal a long row of television sets along the ceiling of the aircraft. Pulling back from the close-up of Ben reveals a row of passengers staring straight ahead with their headsets on. Ben has not moved. The bed on which he is lying moves as though someone has sat down upon it next to him. As Ben speaks, the door to the bedroom opens, and Mrs. Braddock looks in. They move out of the door, with Mr. Braddock steering Ben. Phil and Mimi Carlson are coming up the stairs as the Braddocks move down. Mrs. Carlson gives Ben a broad wink, and Ben tries to smile and return the wink politely. They reach the hall at the bottom of the stairs. Ben moves to the front door and opens it. Mr. Loomis steps into the house and grabs Ben's hand. Mr. Loomis closes the door and pushes Ben back down the hall. Mr. Loomis turns and goes into the dining room. Ben moves back to the stairway as three ladies come out of the living room. One lady takes Ben's right hand, another lady his left, and the third fingers the front of his jacket. Mr. McQuire appears behind Ben, and they look at each other for a moment. Mr. McQuire turns and walks back into the house. The people at the other end of the yard look toward Ben. Ben goes into the house through the back door. Through the windows of the house, Ben makes his way through people trying to stop him and speak to him as he goes through rooms, up the stairs, and to his room. There is the sound of a door slamming. Ben stands with his back against the door. A long shot over Ben shows the pool area and people below. The door opens, and Ben turns to see Mrs. Robinson enter the room. They stand for a moment, looking at each other. Mrs. Robinson moves into the room and sits on the edge of the bed. She takes a cigarette from her purse, lights it, blows out the match, and puts it down carefully on the bedspread. Ben picks up a wastebasket, walks over to the bed, picks up the match, and puts it in the wastebasket. Ben reaches into his pocket and hands Mrs. Robinson a set of car keys. Mrs. Robinson looks at him, shakes her head, and throws the keys to him. Ben gets out and goes around to her side, opens the door, and they move to the door. She takes out her key and opens the door.",
    "580": "Parrish, in a state of shock, doesn't answer for a moment, and then he starts up the stairs. Joe waits guardedly at the bottom as Parrish descends, sensing Parrish's tone, but doesn't answer. Parrish measures Joe, his jaw sets, while Susan seems distracted. Parrish blinks and stares down at his cards, realizing that something in Susan's tone lets him know not a word has sunk in. Quince, meanwhile, sips wine, pouring some red and white into one glass, smiles, nods embarrassedly, and drains his glass. Joe regards Quince, who drains one more glass, then heads out as Parrish and Joe fall silent. Joe is silent too, cogitating, as Parrish begins to reach him. Joe then makes his way down the path from Parrish's study, a weight on his shoulders, until he is hit by the lights, laughter, and music of the party, blinking and at a loss. Susan waits, and Joe kisses her, falling into a deep embrace. Joe struggles with a response and eventually drifts into a long silence; Susan, beside herself and her emotions tossed, is steadied by Joe. She smiles wanly as Joe leaves her. Parrish is seated by the window, with party lights flashing past, the music and laughter audible but muted, lost in thought. Joe enters, and Parrish looks up, waiting and regarding him sympathetically. A knock on the door breaks the silence, and Quince appears, flushed with excitement. Parrish weighs the information for a moment; Quince exits, and Parrish presses the speakerphone button. Quince leads the way through the lights and music as Drew makes an imperial entrance, hailing partygoers, with Quince enjoying the irony. Parrish sits at his desk, while Joe stands in a distant corner. Drew enters with Quince, who nods, excuses himself, and closes the door, while Drew takes a seat. Joe can no longer control himself, and Parrish is struck dumb, looking at Joe pleadingly and shaking his head imperceptibly. Joe nods blithely and commandingly; Drew is all attention as Joe steps forward, and Parrish clicks the speakerphone off. Drew stares at Joe, shaking his head, as Parrish hesitates, waves, and steps away to applause and cheers. The music resumes with another dance tune as Quince grabs Parrish, pumps his hand, and claps him on the back. Parrish spots Allison and wraps her in a tight embrace, but they are separated by guests. Finally, Parrish sees Susan, who smiles with a tinge of sadness.",
    "1166": "The student army faces a metal figure dressed as a cloaked Dementor holding a wand, with a target painted on its chest. Harry nods to Neville, whose wand is hurled across the room, and the Dementor's wand falls. Filch lurks behind a pillar, spotting students approaching the room, and reaches the door as it dissolves back into the stone wall. Nigel, a plucky small boy, faces Harry and prepares himself. Harry is thrown backwards. Filch, eating a huge sandwich, guards the blank wall. Ron faces Hermione, as Neville encourages him, and then Ron flies backwards. Fred collects his winnings. Outside, Filch wakes from a doze while Nigel keeps watch as everyone leaves the room through another door. A student is ushered into Umbridge's room. Nigel floats in mid-air as Harry guides Cho's wand, and she turns to look at him. Nigel plummets to the ground and tucks in, while the twins hide nearby. Red pustules break out all over Filch's face, and Umbridge snaps her pencil. Umbridge's squad, including Draco Malfoy, Crabbe, Goyle, and Filch, watches Luna skip along the corridor and go through the large wooden doors. The squad runs, the door shrinks, and they fall into a broom cupboard. Ginny Weasley's spell destroys the metal Dementor, which disintegrates into a pile of dust. She is amazed at her own skill, and her three brothers look rather put out. Harry beams and watches Cho, who gives him a shy smile. Neville is determined to succeed, and as a wand spins out of a girl's hand, Harry congratulates him. Harry smiles proudly as his pupils applaud, and the students start to leave. Ron and Hermione exchange a smile when they notice that Harry is watching Cho, who is lingering beside a mirror covered with photographs. Harry can't take his eyes off her. Ron and Hermione leave as Fred and George leave the Room of Requirement. Harry joins Cho in front of the mirror, where they both look at a moving photograph of a smiling Cedric. She smiles at him, and Cho looks up as something green and white appears above their heads. Harry gazes into her dark eyes, and their lips meet in a gentle kiss. They're standing close together, but only their lips touch, and above their heads, the bunch of mistletoe continues to grow. Ron looks blank as Harry catches his eye, and the three friends smile warmly. In a black corridor, Harry writhes in his sleep, and a snake is reflected in the shining black. The blue door and the glass sphere appear, along with the light of a wand and a figure in a room full of shelves. It's Mr. Weasley, his eyes wide with alarm. Harry's neck flexes as Mr. Weasley falls and struggles, then lies still, covered in blood. Harry wakes.",
    "563": "He squirts some wiper fluid onto the glass, which clears it up a bit, but now he sees something worse up ahead. It's a grouping of headlights, eight of them, all pointed at him, sealing off the road. He bites his lip and calls over his shoulder, to the back of the van. He speaks in Spanish, which is subtitled. The Agents fling open the rear doors, revealing a dozen frightened Mexicans, hopeful immigrants without official permission. Agent Janus looks at the Driver, who's now held by two other Agents, and shakes his head. He stops in the middle of his sentence, as another car is approaching, fast, its engine whining as it barrels down the road toward them. The new car pulls a hard right, goes off the road, spins around the INS cars, and squeals to a sideways halt, silhouetted in front of their headlights. It's a boxy, black 1986 Ford LTD. Two men get out, dressed in plain black suits, crisp white shirts, simple black ties, shiny black shoes. Kay, fiftyish, is the apotheosis of world-weary; his partner, Dee, mid-sixties, is just weary. They approach the INS agents. Kay and Dee move past him and approach the row of nervous immigrants. He walks down the row, studying the faces, greeting each one cheerily in Spanish. Silence on the road. The others pile into the rear and they tear out of there. Kay and Dee escort their captive across the road and over a small rise, leaving the stunned INS agents standing alone in the roadway. He pulls out a small laser device, which he zips neatly down the front of the man's clothes. The man's clothes fall to the ground, revealing what he really is underneath—a scaly space bastard, about four-and-a-half feet tall, with a snout, snail-like tentacles, and independently moving eyes on stalks at the top of his head. It's propped up by a stick, like a puppet, and it continues to make expressions as he holds it. Mikey replies—an unfathomable combination of grunts, squeaks, and saliva. Mikey makes a lame squeak. From behind Mikey, they hear a terrified gasp. Kay and Dee both look over quickly. One of the alien's eyes, on a tall stalk, whips around too. All three of them see Agent Janus, standing just over the rise, staring in frozen amazement. Janus freezes, terrified. Dee struggles to roll over and change the controls on his gun, which fell out of his hand as he hit the ground. The other INS agents burst over the rise, shouting questions. From over the rise, car engines whine in the distance and headlights start to flash around them. Kay reaches into his pocket and pulls out a tubular metallic device the size of a pocket recorder.",
    "706": "He tries to run off but one of the capacitors hits him, throwing him back onto the sand. The air is thick with sand as he gets to his feet, trying to shield his face. Tiny granules of high velocity sand fly into his pores and shatter into fragments, fusing with his own molecules, giving his internal structure a sand-like appearance. Flint's hand becomes sand, and his fingers blow away in a fierce wind. His entire body turns to sand and is eaten away by the wind until he completely disintegrates. The cops arrive at the edge of the pit and look down to find the capacitors slowing down and Flint nowhere to be seen. Peter sits alone in a hospital corridor, staring blankly at the paper cup in his hand. He looks up and hurriedly stands as a doctor approaches. The dark haired, bearded doctor goes, leaving Peter looking pensive. With a tentative step, he passes the window of a private room and looks inside. Harry is lying in bed with a bandage wrapped around his head. He turns to face the doorway and smiles as Peter steps inside. Mary Jane comes in. Mary Jane and Peter step into the corridor. Peter looks relieved. In the room, the nurse smiles at Harry. Large rocks roll and clink against each other. Seen from further away, the rocks look more like gravel, and from even further away the gravel reveals itself as millions of grains of sand which sweep along the floor of the pit like waves on a beach. The sand forms a curving shape, almost like a human body. The undulating shape rises up as though to stand, then slumps down again. The shape reforms and slowly rises in the form of a human torso from the waist up. It's Flint, now transformed into Sandman. Sandman raises his arms and examines his bulky, paw-like hands. He looks down at his body of sand, then holds his hands to his large, round head. Sandman looks at the mound of sand next to him and spots the locket Penny gave him lying nearby. He reaches out to pick up the locket but the loose sand of his hand just crumbles around it. He reaches out again and his hand becomes more human, with slim, mobile fingers. He picks up the locket between his finger and thumb, then drops it into his palm. The locket falls open, revealing Penny's picture inside. Sandman's hollow eyes look melancholy as they gaze down at the picture. He clenches the locket in his fist and hauls himself up from the sand like a man climbing out of a swamp. He stumbles as he finds his footing, then slowly steps forward, gradually becoming more human until he looks exactly as he did before the change, right down to his brown hair, green and black striped t-shirt, and beige chinos.",
    "442": "Don has already reached the second floor and is hurrying down the stairs, the fur coat over his arm, not paying any attention to Helen, and is just coming from it. He walks down the street about ten steps when Helen comes up to him, but Don disregards her and tries to go on. Helen overtakes him and blocks his way, but he continues on. Helen stands looking after him for a moment, then turns angrily and proceeds toward the pawn shop where the pawn broker has put her coat on a hanger and is brushing it. Helen enters, very matter-of-fact. In another scene, Don is at the desk writing on the second page of a letter, with a revolver beside him, ending with, \"But amid all the grimness can we share one little joke, dear Wick: I did finish something, didn’t I? Goodbye.\" He puts down the pen, stands the letter conspicuously on the desk, picks up the revolver, gets the cartridges from the drawer, and loads the gun. Having been out in the rain, his hair is still a little damp, and he walks into the bathroom. Don stands and looks at himself in the mirror with the gun in his hand, notices the unbuttoned points of his collar, and with a rueful smile at the funny timing of his urge for tidiness, buttons one. As he is buttoning the second, he hears a sound from outside, becomes startled, and puts the gun into the empty wash bowl. The door is being opened and Helen, breathing hard from her race to get there, enters with rain on her hair and face, and a wet dress. Don comes from the bathroom as Helen stands staring at him, wiping the rain from her face, and maybe some tears too. She looks around desperately and sees the gun reflected in the shaving mirror. Before she can step toward it, Don returns with a scarf. Helen goes to the umbrella stand and takes out a bottle, puts down the raincoat and scarf, and goes to the kitchen for a glass. Don picks up the raincoat and scarf, bends down for a kiss, while Helen stands looking at him and holds out the glass. She turns, runs into the bathroom, and picks up the gun with Don following her. Helen holds the gun behind her while Don half pushes, half leads her into the entrance hall. Overcome by a wave of weakness, he sags against the door, then goes and opens it.",
    "284": "She looks toward the front of Thorwald's apartment house, and by her attitude, we can see that there is no truck outside. She looks about her for a moment. The figure of Stella is seen, looking up toward Jeff's apartment, and arms outspread in a helpless gesture. Jeff lowers the binoculars, discouraged. He lowers the glasses and turns to Jeff. Shooting towards the big window, with the neighborhood beyond, Jeff is as usual seated in his wheelchair on the left of the window, but now turned toward a newcomer, the second man standing near the divan looking out the window with the binoculars. This newcomer is Police Detective Lieutenant Thomas J. Doyle, the man Jeff phoned earlier in the day. He has a sense of humor. Jeff lifts his hand in a feeble parting gesture. He is an intelligent-appearing, well-dressed modern detective. Doyle paces a little. He goes up the steps to the door, putting on his hat, and pauses his hand on the door knob. From Doyle's viewpoint, Jeff answers, showing only the slightest irritation. Doyle, still at the door, starts to go out the door, and closes it behind him. Doyle becomes interested in watching something out the window: Miss Torso, in ballet costume, practicing her dance on the outside balcony. She is exciting and desirable, and he even smiles somewhat secretly to himself at what he sees. Jeff smiles at catching Doyle enjoying Miss Torso and notices Doyle's interest. Startled at being observed, Doyle moves quickly away from the window, affecting nonchalance. Jeff's face grows serious as Doyle quickly collects his thoughts and gets back to the case at hand. The camera moves back as Doyle returns to his drink, moves to the sideboard, picks up a felt hat, pulls a slip of paper out of his pocket, and Jeff watches him intently. Doyle looks at Jeff with some smugness, puts on his hat, and goes toward the door. The camera concentrates on the long-focus lens camera, which fills the screen. Just beyond, there is a plate on which a solitary sandwich rests. Jeff's hand comes in and picks it up. We pan up with the sandwich until Jeff's head fills the screen. Jeff is sober, and except for a small light in the kitchen, Jeff's apartment is in darkness. As he munches, he keeps his attention on the neighborhood. The camera pans slightly to the left, as we see the dog being lowered in its basket. Thorwald's apartment is in darkness as the sun has just set. We follow the basket down to the yard, which brings Miss Lonely Heart's apartment into view as she seems to be putting on the final touches of her makeup, prior to going out.",
    "1245": "She wipes mist off her bathroom mirror and brushes her teeth. Elsewhere in New York City, some very fashionable ladies are also getting dressed. The model-type women put on expensive-looking designer underwear. Andy roots through a jumbled drawer and pulls out a serviceable pair of white pants. One of the women, a fashionable blonde, selects a jacket from her extensive walk-in wardrobe. Another lady carefully coordinates her brown top with just the right skirt. Then, the fashionable ladies put on their designer makeup, working to achieve a flawless finish. In contrast, pretty Andy has put on a comfortable-looking mauve jumper over a white shirt and trousers, and dabs on a bit of lip gloss. The fashionable ladies make their jewelry selections, while Andy consults her appointment book. Andy flips through some political articles she wrote for the university newspaper. The well-dressed ladies pull on their high-heeled shoes and boots. Andy kisses scruffy boyfriend Nate goodbye as he sits reading in bed. The fashionable ladies scoop up their designer phones and bags and leave their swanky uptown apartments. Unfashionable Andy, who is slender and has long, dark hair, walks out of her downtown apartment followed by a gaggle of young schoolchildren out on a trip. A model-type measures out a small amount of cereal and adds some nuts to her breakfast. Andy stops at a bakery and walks down the street, unashamedly munching on an onion bagel. The fashionable ladies flag down taxicabs and get into chauffeur-driven cars, while Andy heads cheerfully down into the subway in her rather shapeless brown coat and clunky black heels. Andy makes her way down a busy city street, as smartly dressed businesspeople dash this way and that. Skyscrapers loom overhead on either side of the street. She arrives at a tall building housing Elias-Clark Publications and gazes up at its impressive facade. Clutching her battered, brown leather briefcase, she takes a deep breath and walks into the marble-floored reception hall and up to the desk. An elegant redhead is waiting. Andy follows Emily. Emily's BlackBerry. Emily springs into action as a sleek, silver car pulls up outside. Creative director Nigel leaves. Andy checks her onion breath. A chauffeur-driven car pulls up outside the building. Chic, grey-haired Editor-in-Chief Miranda Priestly gets out, carrying a designer handbag and a mockup of the magazine. Emily dashes into Miranda's office, puts a glass down on her desk, and fills it with mineral water. Andy watches a member of the editorial staff quickly binning her breakfast, and another changing her shoes. A woman uses a webcamming feature on her computer to touch up her makeup. Emily arranges a pile of magazines on Miranda's desk before quickly tidying up her own.",
    "780": "Guests gather for a wedding as a young bridesmaid sits and watches. The two girls walk back down the aisle, and the elder one admires herself in a mirror. The bride's dress is ripped, and Jane gives a knowing smile, eyeing the ribbon in Tess' hair. Jane proudly holds the train of the ribbon-repaired dress. Carrying the bulky dress in a bag, adult Jane, in a formal purple dress, hurries out of the shop onto a busy New York street. Pausing for breath on a street corner, another young woman wearing the same purple dress walks up. Tess nudges her bored friend. Jane rushes out of the ceremony and hurries over to the cab, where she starts getting changed in the back seat. The cabby looks in his mirror as they drive through the colorfully lit New York night, pulling up below the Brooklyn Bridge. She gets out of the cab wearing a red sari and places a jeweled bindi on a friend's forehead. Flinging herself back into the cab, she frantically starts changing again, and the cabby sneaks another look. She's back at the first wedding where a handsome, dark-haired guy who was at the ceremony watches her with raised eyebrows as she heads off in the cab again. She's dancing, first in her Indian dress and then, after another dive for the cab, in her purple one. After some energetic dancing, she emerges from another cab ride once more in her Indian finery and kicks off the wrong shoes. The cabby throws her the right ones, and she joins in some choreographed dancing. Later on, she catches the sari in the cab door. She helps both brides with their dresses as they sit on their toilets and gets back into the swing of the choreography at the Jewish Indian party. Then she rushes in disarray into the other wedding just as the bride and groom are stuffing cake into each other's mouths. It's a bindi. Jane smiles in delight, arms outstretched, as the bridal bouquet is thrown and sails straight towards her, then she's barged to the floor by an over-zealous competitor. Everything goes black. As Jane comes hazily to, the dark-haired guy is looking down at her. She blinks up at him, touches a hand to her sore head, and gives a tight smile as two other guests arrive. She sways unsteadily, clutching her head. The lights of the city twinkle in the night as the pair shares a cab, sitting as far apart as possible with a huge bunch of flowers between them. She pays, and Kevin grabs the flowers. The truck drives between them. As Kevin sits in the cab smiling to himself, he looks down and notices Jane's filofax on the floor. Looking thoughtful, he opens the filofax.",
    "1296": "Morgan is petting Houdini's fur gently. As Graham and Officer Paski get closer, they see Morgan is crying. Then they see the dog is laying on its side and has a barbecue fork in its neck. Bo is on top of the jungle gym curled up in a ball. They stare at Morgan as he slowly pulls an inhaler from his pocket and brings it to his mouth. He inhales the asthma spray and lowers the inhaler so he can speak. Graham stares at his ten-year-old son and starts crying. Graham picks him up in his arms and reaches up for Bo, who has dirt and tears on her face. She slowly climbs down, and Graham carries Bo as she cries in his arms. He starts towards the house. Merrill walks out from the back holding a bowl of potato salad and stands still. Graham reaches the porch of his house and opens the screen door. The children watch over their father's shoulder as Merrill runs to their other German Shepherd sitting quietly near the house and leads her by her collar across the yard to the shed. Officer Paski is pulling the barbecue fork out of their dead dog's neck. Graham lies in bed, resting his cheek against the pillow as he lies by himself. He slowly gets up from the bed, takes his daughter's hand, and starts out of the room. They both sit quietly for a moment. He looks to his daughter with startled eyes, and Graham's eyes drift to the bedroom window. A large silhouetted figure is seen. Graham stands as Merrill opens the front door. It's pitch black outside, and Merrill turns to Graham and gestures with his fingers, bringing them together at the end of the gesture. Merrill and Graham look out into the darkness. Graham runs through the darkness around the first corner of the house, and Merrill waves his arms and turns a corner full speed. The large figure has come into view as Merrill's eyes drift above them. Graham starts out of the kitchen, while Bo watches cartoons. Bo's cartoon is replaced by a special report news icon. Morgan takes the asthma inhaler from his pocket and breathes in deeply. Graham and Edgar walk down the driveway to Edgar's patrol car, and Graham turns the car off as Morgan nods and then plops back into the backseat. Downtown Bucks County is a group of small stores along a quiet street. The Hess family's station wagon pulls in front of a free parking meter. Graham steps out the driver's side and looks around as Merrill puts change in the meter. Morgan walks up to Graham with Bo, holds out his hand for money, and after receiving it from Graham, takes Bo's hand and walks down the sidewalk.",
    "213": "He is silent for a moment, then blurts out. By this time, a small crowd has collected to watch the above scene. Violet is furious and talking in a loud voice, and George is trying to quiet her. As George stalks off, the crowd breaks into laughter. George is walking slowly past the Hatch home. He walks past the house a few yards, turns, and starts back again. Mary is looking out the window, watching George walk back and forth. But after a few steps, he turns around and starts back. George stops, startled, and looks up. George looks surprised at this. But Mary has disappeared from the window. Mary is running down the stairs. Mary looks in a mirror at the bottom of the stairs and fixes her hair. She is plainly excited at George's visit. She runs into the parlor and puts a sketch on an easel. It is a caricature of George throwing a lasso around the moon. Then she opens the front door and stands there waiting for George. George is struggling with the gate; he finally kicks it open and starts slowly up the path toward Mary. Mary and George are in the entrance hall. They go through the doorway into the parlor. George sees the cartoon on the easel and bends down for a close look at it. George and Mary are sitting on the divan. There is silence for a moment, then Mary joins in singing with the phonograph record which has been playing all through the above scene. He looks at his watch, as though about to leave. He is uncomfortable, and she tries desperately to keep the conversation alive. Mrs. Hatch, in a bathrobe and with her hair in curlers, is leaning over the banister as she calls: George and Mary are seated on the divan. George is aghast. As George leaves the room, the telephone in the hall starts ringing. Mary comes into the hall. As Mary picks up the phone, George comes in from the front porch. George has stopped, hat in hand, to hear the first greetings. She hands the instrument to George. Sam is seated at his desk, while a couple of his friends are nearby, with highballs in their hands. As she hears this, she hastily hangs up the extension phone on which she has been listening. Mary takes the telephone from George and holds it so that of necessity George's cheek is almost against hers. He is very conscious of her proximity. Mary is watching George interestedly. George is very conscious of her, close to him. As Mary listens, she turns to look at George, her lips almost on his lips. George can stand it no longer.",
    "1367": "Debbie is getting a mammogram, and the machine clamps too hard on her breast, causing her to scream. Meanwhile, Pete gets his testicles examined. Debbie then undergoes a colonoscopy and later endures some very painful oral surgery, feeling a little high from the laughing gas. Dr. Bowe performs a prostate exam on Pete. Debbie visits the gynecologist, revealed to be Dr. Pelligino from the beginning of \"Knocked Up,\" and her legs are up in stirrups as two nurses enter the exam room. Debbie enters the bedroom, Sadie runs down the hallway, and Charlotte tries to open the door, which is locked, while Debbie gives Pete a blow job out of frame, making Pete super happy sitting on a chair. Charlotte shoves Sadie, leading to an escalating physical fight and muffled screams from the girls outside. Pete walks to the front door, greeted by his father Larry, revealing his small house is too close to the airport due to a low flying 747. Pete and Larry sit down to talk, and two other identical children enter and jump on Larry before the three exit. Larry stands and walks outside, followed by Pete, and prepares to spray the kids with a hose, eventually spraying Pete instead, as Larry's wife, Claire, enters. Larry gets up and walks outside once again. A nervous Debbie approaches a hostess and sees Oliver sitting stiffly at a table. Oliver shows Debbie photos on his iPhone before exiting, leaving Debbie to sadly scroll through the happy pictures of his new family. The family relaxes at dinner, with Charlotte using an app on her iPhone that animates her mouth to look like a talking monkey's while Sadie stomps off. Pete and Debbie drive down the Pacific Coast Highway, arriving at a beautiful hotel in Laguna. Pete makes a wood chipping splatter noise and runs into the bathroom looking for a cookie, which they both eat. They sit in silence, staring through each other in a haze, as they are stoned. As they enjoy their time, Pete and Debbie jump up and down on the bed, fall on it, kissing, and almost totally under the covers, watch as a waiter brings in a room service cart full of food. Pete does magic tricks for the waiter, and Debbie hands Pete a banana and two oranges, which he holds to his crotch in front of the waiter, before Pete takes a bite of the banana.",
    "391": "Lebowski stares at him, dumbstruck. The Dude is encouraged and takes a hurried sip from his drink. Brandt is handing him a letter-sized envelope, which is distended by something inside. The Dude, frowning, untucks its flap, takes out some cotton wadding, and unrolls it. The wadding, undone, reveals a smaller wad of gauze taped up inside. The Dude undoes the tape with his fingernails and starts to unroll the inner package. Between thumb and forefinger, the Dude holds up the contents of the package--a little toe, with emerald green nail polish. The Dude and Walter sit at the counter, both staring off into space, both absently stirring their coffee with little clinking noises. A waitress enters. The Dude has left frame; Walter calls after him as he looks defiantly around. A dripping noise follows. The Dude sits in the bathtub, staring stuporously, a joint pinched in one hand, a washcloth draped over his head. He stares at his toes, which protrude from the soapy water, splayed against the far side of the tub. After the Dude's outgoing message, we hear a dripping noise, and the Dude looks stuporously up, his head swaying. One of them holds a string at the other end of which a small animal skitters excitedly about the floor, as two other men enter behind him. The Dude looks curiously at the small, nattering animal before the man with the string scoops up the marmot and tosses it, screaming, into the bathtub; the Dude screams. The marmot splashes frantically, biting at the Dude in a frenzy of fearful aggression. The three men turn to leave and have reached the Dude's car, where the driver's side exterior has been scraped raw. A policeman hands the Dude a door handle and an exterior rear-view mirror, laughing and agreeing broadly, while the Dude looks sadly through his window at the policeman rocking back on his heels, his raucous laughter muffled by the glass. The Dude, Walter, and Donny sit at the bar, the Dude with a White Russian, Walter with a beer, and Donny eating beer nuts. Walter sadly shakes his head as they leave the Dude sitting morosely at the bar, and he stares. He is middle-aged, amiable, craggily handsome--Sam Elliot, perhaps, with a large Western-style mustache and wearing denims, a yoked shirt, and a cowboy hat. We recognize the voice of The Stranger whose narration opened the movie. The Stranger nods and, waiting for his drink, looks amiably around the bar. His crinkled eyes settle on the Dude, who, still staring down at his drink, shakes his head. The Dude looks at The Stranger as if just now noticing how out of place the cowpoke is, while the Stranger chuckles indulgently and pushes off from the bar.",
    "588": "Whip stands in a dark suit and watches the procession pass, when a young boy touches his arm, prompting him to turn around and see Margaret. He goes to her and they hug, as Margaret reaches for her son and pulls him close. Both watch as Trevor goes off to find his dad, then hug again. Margaret looks at Whip with tears in her eyes and they stare at each other, unmoving. He wipes her tears with his thumb, and Margaret watches him, her brow creased and her eyes soft with sympathy. He kisses her and leaves. Later, Whip leans against his car in a parking lot, watching an airplane overhead, as Nicole approaches in quick strides. They hug, and she hands him a Zippo, which he uses to stick a cigarette in his mouth. In a different scene, a man stands at a podium while Whip sits semi-slumped in a chair, as the majority in the room lift their hands, including Nicole, making Whip cross his arms before he leaves. Whip parks outside a bar and walks in as his co-pilot, Ken, appears on the news, but he soon exits the bar. At the hospital, Whip walks over to a private room and peeps in, tapping his cane on the door frame, while a nurse dresses Ken's wounds. Vicky and Ken look toward Whip, who closes the door, sits down, and later arises to leave. Ken reaches for Whip's hands, and after Whip's eyes dart up and down, he takes Ken's hands. Later, at Whip's family farm, Nicole sees the lights on in the hangar as Whip leans over the Cessna, still wearing his tie with his shirt's sleeves rolled up. He jumps off a ladder, hustles over to Nicole, and kisses her before sipping his beer, as she notices cocaine on the table. Nicole sits on the bed, ends a call, and continues packing her things in the bedroom, ignoring Whip. Whip takes a large swig before setting the bottle on a table and entering the bedroom, where Nicole walks past him, raising a hand to her head before sitting on the bed. He sits next to her on the bed, and she leans in, their foreheads touch, as he kisses her and she allows him to pull her into an embrace. In the morning, Whip lies sleeping on the bed, fully dressed, as Nicole stands at the bedroom entrance, looks at him, and leaves an envelope with Whip's name on it between his lighter and a bottle of whiskey. She carries a suitcase and a basket, walks away from the house, and puts her things in Sheila's van parked behind some trees, which then drives off. Whip stops as he sees the envelope, trots over to the table, picks it up, and opens it.",
    "479": "Mary looks at his smile, has to respond, pulls him to her, and kisses him. Then, without breaking the kiss, she swings her legs over the side of the bed, toe-searches around, finds her shoes, and slips her feet into them. Finally, she pulls away and sits up. She rises, goes to the bureau, takes a pair of small earrings out of her bag, and begins putting them on, not bothering or perhaps not wanting to look at herself in the mirror. Sam watches her, concerned but unable to inhibit his cheery, humorous good mood. Throughout the remainder of this scene, they occupy themselves with dressing, hair-combing, etc. She stares at him, surprised at his willingness to continue the affair on her terms, as girls are so often surprised when they discover men will continue to want them even after the sexual bait has been pulled in. Sam smiles reassuringly, places his hands gently on her arms, and speaks with gentle and simple sincerity. He moves away, and again the weight of his pain and problems crushes away his good humor. He looks at her long, pulls her close, kisses her lightly, looks out the window, and stares at the wide sky. Mary goes out quickly, closing the door behind her, as Sam stares down at his shoeless feet. A small, moderately successful office off the main street, we see Mary get out of a cab, pay the driver, cross the pavement to the office door. Mary enters the office, crosses to her desk, sits down, rubs her temples, and finally looks over at Caroline, a girl in the last of her teens. Caroline rises and starts for Mary's desk, pills in hand, but breaks off, distracted by the SOUND of the door opening. MR. LOWERY and his oil-lease client, TOM CASSIDY, enter the office. Lowery flashes an embarrassed smile at Mary and tries to lead Cassidy toward the private office. Cassidy pauses beside Mary's desk, hooks a haunch onto the desktop, and smiles a wet smile at Mary. Mary glances but cannot bring herself to smile or make some remark, continues sorting out the deed copies, and tries to ignore the man's hot-breath closeness. Cassidy rises, reels toward Lowery's office, pauses, turns, and speaks to Mary meaningfully. Lowery starts after him but pauses and turns to Mary. Cassidy has gone into Lowery's office. Lowery starts quickly away when it looks like Cassidy is going to come and pull him bodily into the office. When the men are gone and the door is closed, Caroline picks up a bundle and smiles at it. Mary has put one bundle into a large envelope and takes the other from Caroline. When the bills are away, she puts the filled envelope in her handbag, notices the remaining deed copies on her desk, picks them up, goes to the private office door, knocks, and starts to open the door as.",
    "875": "She unpacks a rabbit. A plate of vegetables and a fish with a gaping mouth is slid in front of Zoe. Zoe sits and stares at her dinner in horror, as Kate squeezes lemon over her fish. Zoe shakes her head. Kate's smile fades and she looks disappointed as Zoe gets up and leaves the table. Zoe sits in her bedroom, playing with a red-haired rag doll. Zoe looks sadly down at her doll as Kate goes. Patrons sitting in a window table smile and chat as they enjoy a meal. Kate rounds a corner and enters the restaurant, walking straight past Paula who's standing by the door chatting to two customers. Kate makes her way through the crowded dining area. Hearing singing, Kate slows down as she nears the kitchen. She meets Bernadette coming out with two plates. Kate walks into the kitchen. Leah's standing with a man holding a pastry brush. The man turns. He conducts. Kate watches in disbelief as the man raises his arms in the air and sings to the staff. He's holding an uncooked quail in his other hand. Kate turns to Paula. Kate whisks the man's coat off him. Paula leads the couple to their table. Kate and Paula go into a small glass-fronted room filled with well-stocked, floor-to-ceiling wine racks. Kate's speechless. She looks over at Nick, who stands grinning at her. Kate points at a pan on the stove next to him. The contents have caught fire. Kate shakes her head at Paula in disbelief, then grabs her bag and heads out. A flicker of a smile plays on Paula's lips. Kate wearily climbs the stairs to her apartment. A packet of chopsticks have been sellotaped to her door. She bends down and picks up a plastic take-away bag. She takes the chopsticks off the door and walks inside. She walks down the hallway to Zoe's bedroom. Kate pokes her head around the open door, then tries to enter her own bedroom. The door won't budge. She forces it open a crack. Kate sees Zoe curled up, asleep on her bed. Kate walks into the bathroom and enters her bedroom through an adjoining door. A chair has been propped up against the bedroom door to prevent anyone from entering. Kate walks over and moves it aside, along with a wicker laundry basket. Kate steps slowly towards the bed and picks up the remote control, which is lying next to Zoe. She turns off the TV. Kate looks down at her sleeping niece, then places the remote on a chest of drawers. She gently covers Zoe with the bedclothes, then notices a photo album, which had been hidden beneath them. Kate moves the photo album around and begins to look through it.",
    "29": "He looks at Rick and says nothing as Rick walks to the bar, picks up a bottle, and pours a drink, which Laszlo takes. Rick then reaches in his jacket for his cigarette case, opens it, takes out a cigarette, and lights it, before looking away for a moment. Suddenly, there is a CRASH at the door of the cafe, followed by the forced entry of several gendarmes, as a French officer walks in and addresses Laszlo, who looks at Rick for a moment, then crosses to the officer in dignified silence, and together they walk toward the door. Rick's eyes follow them, but his expression reveals nothing of his feelings, when they are interrupted by an orderly. Renault hands some forms to the orderly, who exits, and the conversation continues. Renault sits at his desk and smokes while Rick nervously fingers his hat. Renault gets out of his chair, crosses to the front of his desk, retrieves a fresh cigarette from a box, chain-lights it with the old one, and sits back down. Rick stares at the floor, then looks back up at Renault, who presses a button on his desk, triggering a BUZZER as the door to Renault's office opens and Rick rises to go. A waiter brings tea to Rick and Ferrari, who sit alone at a table in a secluded nook off the main room, where Ferrari pours a cup for Rick, who takes a sip, then gets up, followed by Ferrari, and they shake hands to seal the deal. Rick walks to the door, stops, turns around, and leaves, while Ferrari picks up a fly swatter from the table and swats a fly. A car pulls quickly to a stop just outside the cafe, on the door of which a huge placard reads, as Renault looks around the empty cafe. Rick points at his breast pocket before they hear the CRUNCH of tires as a car pulls up. Renault walks up the stairs to Rick's office, and Ilsa quickly walks toward the entrance as Laszlo pays the cab driver. Ilsa pauses and looks at Rick, unsure for a moment, as Laszlo comes in and closes the door behind himself. Renault opens the office door and peers down at the proceedings. They all walk towards the bar, where Laszlo deposits his hat on a nearby table, takes out the letters, and hands them to Laszlo, who takes them gratefully. All three hear footsteps and turn to see Renault walking toward them from the bottom of the stairs, catching Ilsa and Laszlo completely off guard, with horror in Ilsa's eyes. Renault takes the letters, and they turn toward Rick, bewildered, while Renault is obviously delighted by the situation.",
    "906": "He works his lips as Nitti listens to the radio and then phones D'Andrea. Cardboard tags label switchboard cables at the telephone exchange as two female operators work an adjacent switchboard with an agent standing by. Outside, on a moonlit shoreline, Dillinger sits by a sleeping Billie, whose hair hangs in her face. Dillinger gazes at her, brushes her dark hair aside to reveal her big eyes, and she briefly lowers her gaze before smiling. He takes her in his arm, with the horizon sprawling flat between the sand and black sky. Dillinger's car parks on a street, and Billie smiles at him before getting out. Peering through his round sunglasses, Dillinger watches her go, then looks into his side view mirror and sees only a man at a mailbox, a vagrant, and a few pedestrians. In her fur-collared coat, Billie crosses the street between passing vehicles and enters the building. In the car, Dillinger faces the side mirror and brushes his bangs off his forehead. Inside, Billie passes through another doorway where Purvis' men grab her, handcuff her, and she uncomfortably glances at the agents. Outside, Dillinger waits in the car as more armed agents exit a building directly in front of him, and he startles slightly, but the G-men step right past, realizing he's inside, and cross the street. Dillinger takes off his sunglasses as the agents restraining Billie indoors lead her outside. Dillinger glares into his side mirror, then gets out of the car. The two lovers make eye contact as the burly agent marches Billie away, shoving her toward a government car. Dillinger steps forward with a pistol in hand as the burly agent pushes Billie into the back seat and gets in next to her. As they drive away, Billie peers through the back window, sitting between two agents, and a shocked Dillinger stands out in the open, watching the car drive off. Several armed agents remain behind on the sidewalk but fail to notice Dillinger, who strides around a parked car and returns to his vehicle. Dillinger gets in, shuts the door, grips the steering wheel, bows his head, and collects his breath. His car backs out, leaving the remaining agents behind, and the gangster wipes his reddened face, holding a hand over his mouth as he sobs. In a dim interrogation room, the burly agent leans in front of Billie, who sits in a chair, with his partner standing behind her. She slouches with her left cheek bruised as the interrogator smacks her, grabs her chin, flings her head to the side, and stands upright. The interrogator steps out of the room as Billie trembles, with her right hand cuffed to the chair, holding her knees together.",
    "900": "As Red and Homer return fire, Baby Face shoots at a townsman who holds a pistol at his side. Dillinger crawls to the dead gangster, looks sadly at Tommy, then turns his attention back to the fight. As Baby Face raises his gun to fire again, a guy jumps on his back, and Baby Face tosses him into a window. Dillinger joins the others, firing at the second story window across the street, with dust billowing around it as bullets hit the exterior stone wall. Red glances over his shoulder as Dillinger reloads his gun and fires it at a man hiding behind a car. He hurries to Baby Face and drags him, who continues to shoot. With its door still open, the car pulls out of the town square, leaving the hostages lying helplessly in the street. The car speeds down an empty road lined with tall evergreens that jut into the pale blue sky. Golden sunlight shines on its sleek exterior, reflecting the snow-covered ground bordering the woods. Dillinger sits in the backseat, the wind from the open windows blowing against his disheveled hair. In the front passenger seat, Homer stares distantly. Behind him, Dillinger drinks from a flask as Red administers an injection into his shoulder wound. Nighttime comes, and the car's headlights glow eerily through the trees as it makes its way through the dark woods. The night casts a turquoise hue over Dillinger, who clutches his shoulder in the backseat. The car slows as it approaches a lodge where light shines warmly through the windows. As Baby Face pulls the car to a halt, Dillinger addresses him with a frown. The four gangsters enter the lodge. Upstairs, Baby Face bundles cash while Red preps a dressing and Homer looks on. Red unrolls a bandage and dresses Dillinger's wound. Homer grabs his take as Baby Face picks up two cash bundles and tosses one to Shouse. As they both clear out of the room, Homer hangs back in the doorway, looks to Dillinger, who gives a nod, and Homer leaves. Red remains seated at Dillinger's side. As Red wipes his hands, Dillinger springs restlessly to his feet, and the two men share a solemn look. Dillinger holds out Red's share. Red accepts the cash, gives his brow a resigned lift, and shoots a tentative smile at Dillinger. He stows the cash in his bag and leaves. Now in a medical exam room, the gangster with the eye wound pleads with two G-men. Purvis halts a doctor and courteously gestures for the doctor to step away. The interrogator pushes on the man's wound while Purvis stands with his back to the torture session. The gangster spits at his tormentor, and the stern-faced G-man turns gravely towards Purvis and nods.",
    "143": "The crowd is running and screaming. He looks off at the crowd, his eyes narrowing. A group of men are hurling themselves at a breach in the top of the wall, hanging there, scrabbling for a purchase, with some disappearing, while a few heroic individuals astride the wall reach down to assist their women and children in the swirling crowd below. Dyer glances woodenly at the panel, a man in some shock at the consequences of what he assumed was an act worthy of praise. The Advocate looks at him with a degree of disbelief, more at his attitude than his statement. He stares at the panel like a reasonable man making a reasonable point. The evasiveness and only half-buried embarrassment of their response deepen his own withdrawal into himself, and Dyer thinks about it. There is a muted reaction from the public section. The Indian barrister stares at him a moment, then simply lowers his eyes to his notes. For the first time, there is a hint of uncertainty in his manner. There is just a tremor of distaste quickly suppressed among the panel as Dyer looks at him quickly, and that answer stops the Advocate. He smiles dryly. Dyer faces him stonily, a seed of panic taking root deep in his gut. There is quiet: the same silence as at the Court of Inquiry. The camera is panning slowly along a section of the wall. We are close and see the bullet holes, the patches of splashed blood, and the scratches where fingers have dug at the surface of the wall to claw a path to safety. Finally, the camera comes to a close shot of Gandhi, matching that of Dyer, whom we have just left. Gandhi is surveying the wall in the now empty park numbly and desolately, with Nehru standing a few feet away from him, sharing the same benumbed grief and incredulity. The camera continues its pan over bits of human hair matted in the dried blood, the bullet-ripped foliage, the well, trampled ground around it, and little pieces of clothing. There is the imposing capitol building of the British Raj in India with Chelmsford pacing along one side of a large conference table. This time Gandhi is in the middle and speaks with the full authority of a leader. The Indian side acknowledges Chelmsford's disclaimer—coolly, but accepting it—and that lifts Chelmsford's hopes a little. It is spoken with the cold determination of a man still angry. The British are stunned almost to speechlessness by the audacity and impossibility of it—and from Gandhi, of all people. The senior civil servant, Kinnoch, is the first to recover, while Gandhi and the others just look at him. Chelmsford, realist enough to recognize that a faux pas has been made, strives to get the meeting back on the course he intends.",
    "196": "He waves as he exits through the door. A flaming plane crashes into the sea. George, behind the counter, is trying to quiet a crowd of people all clamoring for more ration points. George shouts. George, in the uniform of an air raid warden, is patrolling his beat. A man beside a lighted window pulls down the shade as George blows his whistle. George is helping load his old car with scrap paper. A wheelbarrow full of junk is being dumped onto a pile. It is a raw, gusty day, and his overcoat and muffler flap in the breeze. George is walking along the sidewalk reading a newspaper. Draped around one arm is a large Christmas wreath. Under his other arm are several more copies of the paper. George comes to where Ernie, the taxi driver, is standing on the sidewalk. The front page of the paper, the Bedford Falls Sentinel, has a subhead telling of a plan for a giant jubilee and parade, to be followed by a banquet, in honor of Commander Harry Bailey, U.S.N., on his way home from Washington after receiving the Congressional Medal of Honor. There's a large picture of President Truman pinning the coveted medal on Harry's bosom, in the midst of dignitaries, and a picture of the transport which Harry saved. Practically the whole front page is devoted to the story. Gower comes running across the street from his drugstore and joins them. Uncle Billy is walking along the street, humming happily to himself. The outer door opens and George enters. The offices are unchanged, still small-time and old-fashioned. Cousin Tilly and Cousin Eustace are talking on the phone. The same office force, albeit a few years older: Cousin Tilly and Cousin Eustace. Seated on a chair is a middle-aged man with a briefcase. Cousin Eustace has turned away from George and caught a glimpse of the man waiting in the chair. This is Carter, the bank examiner, come for his annual audit of the books of the Building and Loan. George gives the phone to Eustace, puts down his wreath, and goes over to Carter. They shake hands. Uncle Billy is filling out a deposit slip at one of the desks. He grabs the paper from Potter's hand. Uncle Billy folds Potter's paper over the envelope containing his money, and flings his final taunt at the old man. In a cold rage, Potter grabs his paper and wheels off toward his office. Uncle Billy smiles triumphantly and goes toward the deposit window with his deposit slip. Uncle Billy hands the bank book over. The teller opens it, starts to punch it with rubber stamps. Uncle Billy searches through every pocket he has. The teller, knowing the old man's vagaries, points to one of the numerous strings tied around his fingers.",
    "1287": "A sphere rises over the Great Wall of China, another over the Pyramids, and from all over the world, glowing spheres head into space, away from Earth's atmosphere. Klaatu walks in slow-motion through the woods, a shadow emerging through the mist, as Jacob glares at him and reluctantly obeys. They are caught in the police car's spotlight as Helen backs away from Klaatu in horror; Klaatu's face appears on the cop's computer as the officer drives up to them, looking shocked. With a touch, Klaatu sends Helen's car crashing into the cop, crushing him against his own cruiser, then releases Helen's car as the cop slumps dead to the ground. Klaatu scoops some of the fatty flesh from the sample jar and touches a hand to the police cruiser, activating all its systems. Helen and Jacob stare as he then reaches down with his other hand and touches the alien flesh to the officer's head; power surges through the man's body, and the officer rolls over—he’s alive. They stare at one another as Klaatu looks around, hearing the sirens. Meanwhile, Mike is with the Defense Secretary, and a robot is floating down a deep, concrete-walled shaft as the light in its head slit comes on. Helen's car is parked in the rain, and a grandfather clock shows 5 past 11 as Helen leads the way into the house, into a study. Klaatu walks into the next room, which has books piled everywhere, and approaches a chalkboard covered in figures; he erases a highly complex formula. Helen turns away looking worried and approaches Jacob, stroking the boy's hair affectionately. Klaatu writes his own formula on the chalkboard as a gray-haired man watches him work, then approaches him and picks up a piece of chalk to also start writing. Klaatu glances at Karl's work, then moves to another part of the board, and Karl pauses to look at his figures as Helen watches them both curiously. Klaatu draws a sweeping arrow across the board, connecting the formulas as Karl continues to write, and Klaatu adjusts some of his equations, studies Karl, then turns away from the chalkboard, walks across the room, and looks up at the speaker through which the music is playing. Lights shine in the dark at Mount Weather Flash Facility, Bluemont, Virginia, where a suited agent steps into the operations room separated from a circular chamber by thick windows; the windows look out onto the vast head and shoulders of GORT, whose light in his head is glowing orange and tracks the agent's every move. The agent stares at GORT, walks slowly forwards, then backs nervously away from the window as Klaatu studies him thoughtfully and walks out of the room through the French windows out onto a terrace.",
    "757": "Her eyes follow him around the room, and her head turns to him as he gets into bed beside her. She looks into his eyes for a moment as he lays his head on her shoulder before she turns back and gazes out beyond the foot of the bed. Her eyes close, and Audrey opens them again as David closes his, and his face relaxes. Joseph, in a green T-shirt with white and gold bands around the middle, walks downstairs and into the kitchen, where Audrey and David are at the table, leaning towards each other, holding hands. They look around at him, smiling. David picks up the paper, and Audrey goes to the cooker, wearing a white T-shirt and green and white striped pajama bottoms. Joseph sits at the table, looking up at her cautiously as David continues to read the paper. She turns from the cooker, and David continues to read, looking up and nodding at last. Joseph unscrews the cap of a big carton of orange juice and carefully pours himself half a glass full. He replaces the cap, stands to remove the carton from the table, and sits again, staring at the glass. The paper slides surreptitiously across the table to him. Joseph looks up at his father, who almost imperceptibly nods down at the story. Joseph pulls the paper to him and reads. Beside the headline is a black and white drawing of the heroic figure in a cape, with a particularly prominent square jaw. Joseph gazes down at the paper, his lips moving slightly, and looks up at David, mouth open. David nods expressionlessly. Joseph closes his mouth, swallows, and blinks hard. David puts a finger to his lips, and Joseph nods and wipes away a tear. David glances down, then looks up and gives Joseph a smile. At the Limited Edition Gallery, a bored security man looks at a picture, and a waitress carries a tray of food amongst the smartly dressed guests. Elijah is talking to a couple from his wheelchair, and David wanders in wearing a casual brown jacket and open-neck shirt, glances around him, and stops in front of a picture. A black woman with gray hair approaches him and looks across the busy gallery, and David looks across the busy gallery as well. Elijah wheels his chair from the gallery down the narrow corridor lined with comics, and David follows. Elijah freewheels down a ramp into his office and swings the chair around to face David. He's wearing a tight black leather zip-up jacket with short glittering blue lapels. He reaches to a shelf behind him and picks up a paper, looks at it, and turns it round, showing David the drawing of the hero in the cape.",
    "821": "Jacob cocks his head, then nods, and Cal sighs heavily. Cal turns to Jacob, who shakes his head and shrugs his shoulders, as Cal gazes at him penetratingly and raises his brows. Jacob looks at him directly and nods, then he nods again and turns away. Cal turns and stares directly ahead as Jacob gets off his bar stool and soldiers out, putting his hands in his pockets. Cal downs his shot. At school, all the kids have dressed smartly and lined up on a long row at the back of tiered seating constructed in the hall. Cal walks past the kids and over to the seating, looking across the hall and spying Emily with Molly and Hannah. His eyes light up hopefully when he spots an empty seat next to Hannah, but then he sees Jacob stamping over a chair to take the seat next to her. Cal looks away and heads upstairs, making his way to a seat on the other side of the structure. Cal points to a seat between a man and woman who are chatting, and the guy leans back so Cal can sit down. On the stage, Robbie in a suit, sits slumped at the end of a row. Cal eyes him and smiles softly. Robbie looks up and sees Jessica sitting with her parents and looks down miserably. The principal walks onto the stage and up to the podium, and Emily's jaw tightens. Kate takes the podium, and Cal beams and claps proudly as Emily, Molly, Hannah, and Jacob clap and cheer. Robbie gets up, and Jessica smiles as Robbie plods over to the podium. Emily smiles and glances at Molly, while Cal frowns and Emily’s face falls. Robbie looks at Cal, who stands up, causing the audience to all turn to him. Cal makes his way down the seating structure, squeezing past Bernie as Robbie's eyes start to find. Kate leans into the principal and whispers something, to which the principal nods. Cal faces the audience, and Kate puts her middle finger up at him. Cal turns to glance at Robbie as Emily's eyes brim. Tearfully, Emily smiles as Claire and Bernie glance at each other and smile. Emily's jaw slackens as Cal turns back to Robbie, and Emily smiles and looks down. Cal turns back to Robbie, who beams. Jessica hangs her head, giggling, as Emily laughs. Claire glances at Jessica with a worried look, and Emily wipes away a tear. Cal puts his arm around Robbie, and they leave the podium. In the school grounds, the kids and parents stand around chatting as Emily, Molly, Jacob, and Hannah head over to Cal and Robbie. Hannah and Cal wrap their arms around each other, and Cal eyes Jacob as Hannah steps back. Cal addresses Jacob, who steps forward nervously, and Cal holds out his hand. They shake, and Jacob smiles before Cal slaps Jacob.",
    "451": "The Kid's Grandfather bursts into the room, kind of rumpled, but his eyes are bright. He has a wrapped package tucked under one arm as he immediately goes to The Kid and pinches his cheek. The Mother ignores it and beats a retreat, and she is gone. There's an uncomfortable silence, then The Kid does his best to smile, suddenly passionate. The two of them are together as the Grandfather sits in a chair by the bed, and the story he's reading about transforms the monochromatic look of the bedroom into the dazzling color of the English countryside. Buttercup stands holding the reins of her horse, while in the background, Westley, in the stable doorway, looks at her. Buttercup, in her late teens, doesn't care much about clothes and hates brushing her long hair, so she isn't as attractive as she might be, but she's still probably the most beautiful woman in the world. Westley is perhaps half a dozen years older than Buttercup and maybe as handsome as she is beautiful. He gazes at her as she walks away. Westley is outside chopping wood as Buttercup drops two large buckets near him. She leaves, but his eyes stay on her. She stops and turns, and he manages to look away as now her eyes stay on him. Westley enters with an armload of firewood, gets it, and hands it to her; they stand very close to each other gazing into each other's eyes. Westley and Buttercup, outside his tiny hovel in the red glow of sunset, are locked in a passionate kiss. They stand near the gate to the farm, locked in an embrace; he smiles at her, she smiles too, and throws her arms tightly around him. They kiss, and then as Westley walks away, Buttercup watches him go. Buttercup stares out the window of her room, holding on her face, perfect and perfectly sad. In the main courtyard of Florin, replete with townspeople, livestock, and a bustling marketplace, Prince Humperdinck, a man of incredible power and bearing, stands in his royal robes on a castle balcony. Three others stand behind him: an old couple with crowns, the aging King and Queen, and a dark-bearded man who seems the Prince's match in strength: Count Rugen. A giant staircase leads to the crowd, and as a figure just begins to become visible, the crowd sees the figure and collectively holds its breath. The staircase reveals the figure appearing in the archway, and she is resplendent as she descends the stairs and starts to move amongst the people. The crowd does a very strange thing: with no instruction at all, they suddenly go to their knees.",
    "156": "Finally, Azad takes just a step forward, and Gandhi looks up at him. For a moment he folds his hands absently, then stands. He moves to Ba's side and kneels. Ba's eyes flutter open, and she holds her hand out to him, which he takes. When he goes to release it, she clutches it, so Gandhi hesitates, then sits, holding Ba's hand in his lap. He looks across at Mirabehn and nods for her to go. Mirabehn smiles weakly, gives Ba a last little rub of farewell, and stands. Patel stands, allowing Mirabehn to pass him and go down the corridor with Azad. He looks back at Gandhi sitting, holding Ba's hand, his eyes once more on the floor in their empty stare. A fly moves along a small section of the floor that still contains a ribbon of the dying sunlight. Gandhi still sits, holding Ba's hand, staring into nothingness. The doctor appears in the doorway, pauses, and nods amiably to Gandhi, though Gandhi does not react to his presence at all. Moving quietly, the doctor goes to the other side of Ba, crouches, and lifts her wrist to feel her pulse. He holds it for a moment, then lifts his eyes in doubt and sudden fateful apprehension. He glances at her, then slowly lowers her arm and puts the branches of his stethoscope in his ears, placing the acoustic bell over her heart. After a moment, he lifts it slowly, his face confirming what he and we already know: there is no heartbeat. He glances at Pyarelal, who only lowers his eyes. The doctor turns his head slowly to Gandhi, whose posture is utterly unchanged, Ba's hand still in his lap, his eyes still staring emptily at the floor, but suddenly tears begin to run down his cheeks. The funeral pyre burns, its work almost done. Mirabehn, Patel, Azad, Pyarelal stand with other prisoners and the military wardens in solemn obeisance to the dead and the living, as Gandhi sits a little distance from the pyre, wrapped in his shawl, staring at the dying embers in tragic and impenetrable isolation, as though he may never move again. Mirabehn watches him, her face wet with tears. A piece of cloth shimmers in a stiff breeze. For a moment, we hold it in silence, then we hear the sound of an aircraft growing louder and louder. Slowly, the camera pulls back, revealing the cloth as part of a pennant on the nose of an aircraft. The scene cuts from the pennant to the aircraft stopping before a reception area, with a carpet rolled out toward its door.",
    "64": "He is stopped cold, and swearing and choking, he pulls himself out of the rushing water using the fence. Drenched and battered, he slowly climbs back over the fence and makes his way toward his car, fishes for his car keys, and looks down to see that one shoe is missing. He starts to get into his car, but Mulvihill and a smaller man stop him, with Mulvihill pulling his coat down and pinning his arms tightly. The smaller man thrusts a switchblade knife about an inch and a half up Gittes' left nostril. Frozen, with the knife in his nostril and the street lamp gleaming on the blade, the smaller man quickly flicks back the blade, laying Gittes' left nostril open about an inch further. Gittes screams as blood gushes onto his shirt and coat, and he bends over instinctively to keep the blood from getting on his clothes. Mulvihill and the smaller man stare at him as he grovels on his hands and knees, and on the ground, he can only see his tormentor's two-tone wing-tipped shoes, lightly freckled with his blood. He is lightly shoved into the ground, the sound of footsteps retreating as he gasps. He later sits behind his desk, back to the camera, not moving. Duffy sits staring at nothing while Walsh moves uneasily around the room and Gittes slowly turns to Walsh. He lightly taps his nose, looking irritated, and picks up the phone as Walsh begins to tell Duffy the Admiral Byrd story, finishing with the punch line and making both men laugh raucously. Gittes drops the mail, loafs through it, puts his hand over the receiver, and looks at his two men. Seated, he flips through the paper to find the obituary column, scans it, looks up, abruptly tears the column from the paper, and puts it into his pocket. Evelyn Mulwray stands at the table as he does so, and he rises to allow her to sit. She's wearing subdued, tailored dove-gray gabardine, and as the waiter appears, Evelyn looks at Gittes' nose, then down to smooth her gloves. Looking back up, she stares expectantly at Gittes, who pulls out and fingers a torn envelope. He coughs, smiles, and looks significantly at Evelyn, who is clearly angry but controlling it, which subdues Gittes a bit. Evelyn is still slightly heated and then appears a little embarrassed for the first time, looking squarely at Gittes, who nods while fingering the envelope. Evelyn turns toward Gittes, who leans on the open door of his car, talks quietly, but spits it out.",
    "1085": "Malbin hurries up to meet him. Handing Malbin the gun, Tuvia runs off to investigate. He whips back a curtain across the door of a cabin. Lilka, Bella, and Riva are with Tamara and her baby. He strides away. Tuvia gazes at Lilka and his face softens. She plants a kiss on his lips. He looks at her in mute surprise. She stands in front of him unflinching. Slowly he moves his mouth towards hers, lightly brushing her lips. They kiss more fully. He smiles and their lips meet again. Beyond some trees, a German truck full of soldiers drives across a metal bridge followed by a car. Aron, hiding behind a tree, watches faithfully. At the camp, Shimon and Malbin are hunched over their chess set. A message bag, a German courier. People crowd round the blond head German. Tuvia checks Aron's cheek, then sits down at the table and opens the courier's leather case. He hands a document to Shimon. Malbin watches anxiously as people's anger turns to violence. Tuvia has his back turned as a bearded Jew spits on a man, and Shelman, the man who brought him, kicks him in the back. Tuvia and Shimon hurry over. Tuvia remains at a distance watching the mob take over. The German is felled. Aaron, his cheek swollen, turns away. Bella viciously slams the man with her rifle butt. Tuvia glances at Asael and walks off. Shimon and Malbin wincing, watch the mob savagely beat the man to death, with eyes dulled and a numbed expression. Tuvia comes across Aron sitting hunched on a mossy bank, his rifle on his lap, a hand to his mouth. Tuvia leans against a tree and watches his young brother's distress. Asael observes from a distance. At night, a guard patrols the camp. In his cabin, bathed in golden lamplight, Tuvia is sitting up in bed bare-chested with Lilka lying against him, covered by a blanket. He pulls her close to him and they settle down to sleep. Early one morning, at the army camp, Zus strides into Viktor's tent. Viktor turns to Zus. Zus turns to leave the commander's hut. Zus strides past Lova, glancing at a German plane crossing the sky. At the camp Tuvia and Malbin see it too. People pack up their belongings, guns and grenades loaded into baskets and bags. Tuvia peers up to the sky at a plane changing direction. He dives towards Aron as the bomber passes overhead. People run in all directions as bombs explode around them. Many are hit. Tuvia and Lilka herd women and children through the smoke and flame towards the largest bunker. A woman is hit. More and more people are bundled into the shelter.",
    "1017": "Colin drives along in his silver BMW convertible with Abby beside him, and they smile and chat as they head along a winding road through mountains, across a steel girder bridge, and through rolling countryside. Sitting on rocks beside a creek, Abby and Colin have a picnic where they clink glasses and drink wine; Colin teases Abby with some caviar, then pops it into her mouth, after which he looks away. Abby chews, winces, spits the caviar out, and grimaces, but quickly wipes her hand across her mouth, composes herself, and smiles at Colin. Abby and Colin walk barefoot over rocks spanning the creek; he wraps his arms around her, and they share a lingering kiss. In a coffee shop, Colin buys coffees for Abby and Joy, who grin girlishly and go to a table, and as Colin pays, Joy mimes giving him a good seeing to, clenching her fists and thrusting her groin. On set, Mike is spooning chocolate into the mouth of a sexy babe when a man delivers a bouquet of red roses to Abby; her mouth hangs open, and she and Joy do a little dance, which makes Mike's face fall as he turns back to the babe and sees he's smeared chocolate over her face, then distractedly wipes it off. Mike and Abby sit in the SF Saloon and Grill, where Abby is on the phone smiling at him while Mike checks out an attractive woman wearing a crop top, who's standing at the bar, drinking a shot. Abby looks round at the woman as Mike stares at her intensely before Abby drinks her wine. Mike frowns, taken aback, and looks troubled as Abby watches Mike on the monitor, steps up, frowns, goes to see Stuart in his office, and rolls her eyes. In Los Angeles, outside the expensive modern facade of the Century Plaza Hotel, Abby arrives in a yellow cab, and a bellman opens the door for her to get out. Abby walks through the lobby before they're driven through town, with Abby watching and smiling while Mike looks uncomfortable and then forces a smile. At La Noche Cubana restaurant, Mike walks up to a hostess who leads him away, and the colorful restaurant is decorated with palms while Abby sits in a booth overlooking the dance floor where couples salsa. She's on the phone to Stuart, and Mike sits and smiles at Abby, nods, while Abby sips her drink as a waitress walks up and Mike looks at Abby, who smiles thoughtfully. He takes her by the hand, throws his jacket aside, and Mike leads Abby onto the dance floor and spins her, turns, ducks under her arm, and pulls her close as they smile and dance together, back and forth. Mike spins Abby and leads her, and she steps away, holding his hands, and returns with her back to him.",
    "990": "At the graveside, Benjamin turns to Mrs. Maple's dog, and Daisy watches as he says his goodbyes. Tizzy shakes hands with Benjamin, and Queenie hugs him. Red-haired Daisy watches as he heads off. Carrying a kit bag and a suitcase, Benjamin, who now looks in his late 60s, walks along the sidewalk until he gets to the end of the road. He stops and sees Daisy running after him, but she turns and runs back down the street. Benjamin carries on up the road. In the hospital, Caroline opens a box full of old postcards tied up with ribbon. Meanwhile, Daisy does a pirouette. Captain Mike and Benjamin are on the snow-covered deck, where Mike points to a tattoo on his chest and makes a figure of eight with his hand. The twins start to fight. In an elevator, Benjamin now looks in his 50s. To Benjamin, as he follows them out of the lift. Back on the snow-covered deck of the tugboat, the tug is towing a gigantic ship. Later, Benjamin lies in bed in the hotel and finds Elizabeth in the lobby of the hotel. She's sitting on a sofa, a dressing gown over her nightdress, reading. Benjamin, in his dressing gown, heads towards the kitchen, then turns back to her. He goes through to the kitchen and Elizabeth stares after him, closes the magazine she was reading, and gets to her feet. She peers into the kitchen, where Benjamin is busy making the tea, and walks in as Benjamin looks up. Elizabeth opens her mouth as if about to say something. Benjamin goes over to her worktop and picks up two Russian tea glasses and their holders, puts the fly-ridden honey pot down, and carries the tea glasses and the teapot over to a table. Elizabeth takes a seat as Benjamin pours the tea. Benjamin sits down, and they eye each other across the table. Elizabeth wags her forefinger, and Benjamin checks on the teapot. Elizabeth looks a little awkward as he pours her a cup, which she sips thoughtfully. They share a smile, sip their tea, and both smile again. Heavy snow falls over the tugboat. Later, Benjamin comes downstairs, and Elizabeth gets up to greet him, looking a little flustered as she turns to Benjamin and heads off. In the hospital, at the ballet school, young Daisy reads Benjamin's card and, looking sad, she dances with other students in front of a panel of judges. At night in the hotel, Benjamin comes downstairs into the lobby and finds Elizabeth wearing an evening dress. They sit at a table in the hotel dining room where Benjamin tentatively tries a spoonful of caviar.",
    "1154": "Harry scrambles up and reaches high above his head for a broomstick as the dragon gets closer and closer, with the Firebolt stuck fast. Harry frees the broomstick as the dragon lashes out and smashes the window to pieces. He falls from a great height, pursued by the Horntail, but reappears out of the mist once again astride his broomstick. A dragon is close behind, and a burst of flame sets the end of Harry's broomstick on fire. It continues to smolder as the dragon zooms after Harry through a stone arch, with the massive viaduct ahead. Harry flies towards it and hurtles through one of the narrow openings at the top. As the dragon tries to bat, its huge wings smash into the brickwork, and Harry and the Horntail plunge into the valley far below. The crowd of spectators in the arena scan the sky with nervous anticipation, with Dumbledore and Fudge looking very concerned. Hagrid shields his eyes as he looks up into the empty sky until a tiny speck appears in the distance, prompting Hermione to scream. Harry hovers for a moment, then aims the Firebolt down towards the gleaming golden egg, triumphantly snatching it up. In a packed Gryffindor common room, the painted characters in the pictures join in the applause, and the twins hoist Harry onto their shoulders. The egg glows as Harry twists it open, and they clap their hands over their ears. Ron appears in the doorway as Harry closes the egg, facing Harry awkwardly as the twins usher everyone away and Hermione shakes her head, bemused. Gray clouds are reflected in the waters of the lake while owls fly in and out of the great hall. Parvati and Padma Patil walk together down the length of the hall and pass the table where Harry and his friends are eating breakfast. Harry sees Cho at the next table, and as her friend points him out, Cho smiles, causing Harry to dribble his drink in embarrassment. Hermione reads the paper as a small boy lingers at Ron's elbow, and Hermione looks curious as he unpacks a strange brown garment and holds it up, revealing white frills. The twins try it, while Ron gets up reluctantly with his shirt hanging out, and Filch starts the gramophone. The twins grin as the girls get up enthusiastically, but none of the boys move until Neville stands up. Later, Harry and Ron find Neville waltzing by himself around the bedroom, wearing his pajamas and a pair of shiny dancing shoes. Ron and Harry approach Cho and her friends, grinning inanely before moving on hurriedly, and Harry smiles at a group of Beauxbatons girls who stalk off. Meanwhile, Hagrid and Madame Maxime are together, and Madame Maxime reaches down to pick something from Hagrid's beard, pops it in her mouth, and licks her fingers seductively. Finally, Hermione, Harry, and Ron sit beside the lake.",
    "1049": "A lady's hand is at work on a delicate piece of floral embroidery. Darcy emerges from the parsonage with his lips drawn tight, pulling on his dark leather gloves. Inside, Lizzie begins to pace around the drawing room, and tears spring into her eyes. Meanwhile, Darcy hurries into a room upstairs, looking deeply troubled, and stands in the middle of the room. He dashes over to a bureau, pulls out a sheet of paper, picks up a pen, dips it into an ink pot, then sets about writing a letter. He replenishes the nib with ink, puts down the pen, and leans back in his chair with a defeated air. Next, he goes over to the paned window, observing the two young boys with their fishing rods and nets scrambling down a hill towards the river. Darcy strides through cloisters in his gown and mortarboard and throws open a door to find Wickham in a compromising position with a lady, but Wickham just smiles at him. Darcy hands Wickham a check, and as Wickham turns at the door, he bumps into Darcy's sister and kisses her hand with a flirtatious smile. Georgiana and Wickham walk arm-in-arm by the sea. Darcy's carriage pulls up at the sea front, and he jumps down to peer over a wall, seeing Wickham and Georgiana on the rocks below together. Georgiana spies her brother and her face breaks into a smile. When the door has closed behind Wickham, Georgiana turns her sorrowful gaze to Darcy and slowly walks over to be comforted by him. With the letter finished, a now disheveled Darcy leans wearily back in his chair and closes his eyes, then, with renewed energy, dips his pen in the ink pot once more. Outside, the sun is setting, casting a salmon pink glow over Rosings. The next morning, Darcy splashes his face with water from a silver basin, then pats it dry. He's still wearing the same white shirt from the night before, with the top few buttons undone, and his manner is troubled and agitated. He snuffs out last night's candle, which is all but burned out, and on the bureau is the sealed letter addressed to Miss Elizabeth Bennet. Lizzy wanders over to the breakfast table, then heads out, leaving the others to resume their breakfast. It's a bright, sunny day, and Lizzy takes a walk in the park, swinging her bonnet casually to and fro. Suddenly, she breaks into a run, racing as fast as she can across the grass, slows down to a walk again, and heads onward through the trees, not really taking in her surroundings. Suddenly, she becomes aware of a man standing with his back to her, a few meters ahead, and he turns just as she's trying to slip away unnoticed.",
    "1277": "Hermione smiles as Ron races after the three students, and Harry starts climbing a mountain of furniture to reach the diadem, with Hermione following. Harry finds a blue Pixie in the junk and tosses it aside, but more Pixies fly out, causing him to climb frantically, with Hermione beside him. He sees the diadem wedged in the sofa, wrenches it out, and they clamber back down to the floor, looking down the aisle where the entrance is glowing. A huge wave of flames surges towards them, uniting with a second wave and pursuing Harry, Ron, and Hermione. Harry knocks over furniture to slow it down and looks back as the furniture is consumed by the inferno, which takes the form of a fiery winged dragon. Goyle tries to extinguish flames from his burning wand, while Draco and Blaise back away. Goyle tosses his wand into the fire as Hermione and Ron sprint ahead of the flames, with Harry pursued by a flaming serpent in a different aisle. Terrified, Draco and his cronies scramble up a high stack of furniture. Reunited, Harry, Hermione, and Ron see flames ahead, turn, and find themselves surrounded. Harry conjures a protective shield, and Ron falls back against broomsticks, tossing them to his friends. They soar upwards as Goyle climbs after Draco and Blaise, but dislodges a chair and falls into the inferno, with Draco and Blaise watching him fall. Ron turns to Harry as Draco and Blaise lose their grip and cling to a carpet by their fingertips. Harry looks around, they swing their brooms, and Harry flies past, just missing Draco's hand. On another pass, Harry grabs Draco onto the broom, and Ron grabs Blaise. Hermione leads them, swerving to avoid burning furniture, clears a path with her wand, and they make it out through the doors, falling off the broomsticks. Draco runs, and Harry sees the diadem on the ground. Hermione tosses him a Basilisk's Fang, which he sinks into the diadem, causing black smoke to rise. Ron kicks the diadem back into the burning room, where three fiery images of Voldemort appear. As they back away, the doors slam shut, and gasping, Harry leans against a pillar. Nagini coils as Voldemort falters, Harry shivers in the light, and Voldemort, with a sweaty face, turns in the dark to face his army. A group of Death Eaters, led by Pius Thicknesse, steps forward, and a spell kills Thicknesse.",
    "1172": "Snow falls onto the tars and turrets of the school as Hagrid, wearing a huge fur coat, plods across the snow-covered courtyard, dragging behind him an enormous Christmas tree. Inside the school, Hermione pulls a trunk on wheels past a group of ghostly carol singers and enters the great hall, where tiny Professor Flitwick waves his wand and levitates decorations onto a tall Christmas tree. Hermione finds Ron and Harry playing chess at one of the long polished tables and walks down the brightly decorated hall to join them. The white knight moves by itself, and as Ron contemplates the board, the red queen moves and knocks the knight's head off. Meanwhile, Harry's snowy owl turns its head as Harry leaps out of bed and puts on his spectacles. Down in the Gryffindor common room, Ron stands in front of a blazing fire while Harry runs barefoot down the stone stairs towards a pile of presents on the Christmas tree. Harry picks up a parcel, and Ron dips into a box of every flavor beans. Harry opens a letter, puts it down, and unties the string on the parcel, unfolding the silver wrapping paper to reveal some soft material with a rich dark pattern, which he swings onto his shoulders, and his head begins to float. In the library, a floating hand carries a lantern between the bookshelves as Harry, under the invisibility cloak, peers about him wearily. Inside, he searches along more dark bookshelves, takes off the cloak, and holds the lantern closer to a shelf, then puts the light down. As he takes down a book and opens it, a screaming face bursts violently out of the pages, prompting Harry to slam the book shut. Grabbing his cloak, he knocks over the lamp, quickly puts on the invisibility cloak over his head, and disappears as Filch, the caretaker, holds up a lantern, the lamplight showing up his thin lips. Hidden by the invisibility cloak, Harry feels his way across the dark room, stopping for a moment as Filch passes by with his lantern, and breathes a sigh of relief as the caretaker goes out through a far doorway. Harry creeps into a moonlit corridor, where Filch's red-eyed cat is lurking, while still invisible. As the cat runs past, two professors, Snape and Quirrell, burst through a door, and suddenly suspicious, Snape turns around. Harry covers his mouth to muffle his breathing as Snape makes a grab but only snatches a handful of air. Harry takes a step backward as Snape turns sharply back to Quirrell, and then Quirrell, Snape, and Filch rush away down the corridor. A door in the far wall seems to open and close by itself.",
    "169": "Chili watches a woman on the sidewalk pause to tighten the scarf around her neck, then turns and studies Tommy for a moment before Tommy looks at him. As Chili gets up from the table, the other men around the table follow his lead as he finishes up some jokes. He merely watches in the glass as Tommy turns up his collar and steps out into the cold Miami day. A moment later, the manager, an old Italian guy in a black suit, joins him in the doorway, looks off-screen, and begins speaking in Italian. Chili stares straight ahead, rubs his hands together, and tries to stay warm. Tommy drives, and Chili points out the window. Tommy looks up at the hotel as Chili takes a pair of leather gloves from the top of the dash and opens the door. Tommy pulls up out front, and Chili knocks on the door three times; he waits, pulls the right-hand glove on tight, so that when Ray Bones opens the door, Chili nails him with one punch. Later, Chili and Tommy each sit in a barber chair, reading the newspaper, while Fred and Ed sit nearby playing checkers. A car pulls up, and Chili is no longer listening to Tommy but instead watching as Ray Bones and a Black Guy get out of the car. Ray Bones eyes Chili, then nods to Fred and Ed, while Tommy looks over as Ray Bones, with a smaller bandage on the top of his head, and his man enter the shop. The two guys leave as the Black Guy steps up to Chili, who exchanges a look with Tommy, watches as 'Mr. Bones' goes down the hall into the back office, then turns to the Black Guy. Ray Bones comes out with the collection book open, looking at all of the names of who owes what, stepping over to Chili. Ray Bones checks his man for some appreciation, but the guy is too busy looking at the hair rinses and other items on the counter. Tommy watches as the Black Guy picks up a pair of scissors, runs his hand along the edge, and Ray throws the book at Chili and walks out, his man right behind him. Ray Bones then nods to his man, who grabs Chili and holds the point of the scissors to Chili's throat. Chili looks over at Tommy. Finally, Chili sits with Fay Devoe, an attractive woman in her thirties wearing a sundress, on her patio. They each have a drink, and she looks at him, touching her drink to the side of her face as they sit there in silence for a moment. Fay reaches over, puts a hand on his leg, and Chili finishes his drink, setting it down. She finally looks at Chili.",
    "628": "Graham and his family look up and stare at something. Graham walks slowly across the polished wooden floor into the front hallway, reaching the door to the cupboard under the stairs and pulling it open. He looks at the TV set inside, which is displaying a test card. He turns to look back at the others and swallows. Later, Merrill is upstairs, hammering boards onto the door of the children's bedroom. Across the landing in his room, Graham cautiously approaches the window and looks out over the maize field. His eyes widen and become fixed in a fearful stare as he backs towards the bedroom door. Merrill looks over at him. Eyes still on the window, Graham sidles out of the room and closes the door. Graham lifts up a plank and holds it across the door, with Merrill taking the other end. Together, the two men hammer nails through the plank into the door frame, with Bo and Morgan standing at the top of the stairs behind them, watching. Turning to get another mail, Graham stops and stares at Bo before helping Merrill with another plank. Bo remains motionless, clinging to her brother, then walks over, and he crouches down. She shakes her head, Bo grins at him, and he strokes her cheek. Graham pulls her towards him and picks his daughter up. Merrill slaps another plank across the bedroom door. Bo in his arms, Graham and Morgan go downstairs into the front hallway. Graham and Merrill put the children down, and they stop and listen. They all stare in the direction of the barking beyond the wooden mantle piece, which stands at the far end of the room, with two China dogs sitting on it, one on each side, illuminated by the dim glow of two wall lamps above them. Graham's eyes dart nervously around, his fingers tightening on Bo's shoulders in front of him. He and Merrill exchange anxious glances. They look towards a boarded-up window to the right of the mantle piece, their gaze passing across the fireplace as they turn to follow the noises. Shadows flit across the slit of moonlight between two planks across the window on the left of the mantle piece. Slowly, the family turns to watch the figures block out the soft light diffusing through the gaps between the boards on another window at the front of the house. They swing around and stare petrified down the hallway and into the kitchen towards the back door. They turn quickly back around to look at the front door, one plank nailed across the frame halfway up, as the doorknob turns. Morgan starts to back away, and Graham looks around and puts a comforting hand on Morgan's shoulder before kneeling down in front of the frightened boy. Graham smiles lovingly as a tear falls from Morgan's eyes.",
    "657": "She leans forward, cups his face with her hands, and they kiss, a long, lingering kiss, as the rain continues to fall around them. She then places her fingertips on the roll of the mask and tugs it back into place. He shoots out a web and pulls himself up while she stands in the pouring rain, looking up into the sky with the broadest of grins. The next day is clear and bright, with the sun shining over the skyscrapers of Manhattan as fire trucks surround a burning apartment building, where flames roar out of the top floors and firemen evacuate the building's occupants. A woman runs to them while Spider-Man zooms along the streets, leaping from web to web above the traffic. Spider-Man swings from a lamp stand in front of the burning building and leaps through a window on the lowest floor, which is alight, disappearing from the view of those on the ground. A fireman, his face and outfit blackened, stands by the mother, whose hands are closed as if in prayer, as they all remain calm. Spider-Man reappears at the second explosion and lands on the sidewalk with a baby in his arms. The mother pulls back the shawl as a policeman races up and scrutinizes Spider-Man. Spider-Man hauls himself back up to the top of the building and bursts in through a window, looking around the blazing inferno as part of the ceiling caves in. He sees a figure in the distance and reaches out for it, but the figure spins round, revealing the Green Goblin, who delivers a punch that sends Spider-Man sprawling. The Goblin throws an orange ball that explodes into several spinning boomerang blades, which Spider-Man leaps acrobatically to avoid. As he jumps, ducks, and weaves, the Goblin attacks with his gloved fists, and Spider-Man fights back while deflecting the rotating blades, one of which cuts his left arm. In a nimble, darting move, Spider-Man arches his back to avoid another blade, whips back up, smashes the Goblin in the face, pulls him back with a webbed thread, and volleys him with his left foot through a partition. Using the explosion as cover, Spider-Man beats a hasty retreat as Norman's eyes glaze over on his way up to Harry's apartment, where Harry and Aunt May are tidying up, and MJ has a sniff of a casserole. They hear the elevator gate, and Aunt May opens the door while Spider-Man lands outside on his room's window ledge. Harry hears the sound as Norman eyes up MJ, and Aunt May calls upstairs. They're all gathered in the living room by the bottom of the stairs as Aunt May starts to make her way up, and he whips off his mask.",
    "615": "He waves to her daughters. A bearded man with long gray hair stands non-plussed as Sydney ponders. A beer bottle emerges over the railing of the bandstand, and drunk Sydney climbs onto the railing behind the band, addressing the crowd with his arms out. The guests resume their conversations as Sydney limps up to Alison, who sits alone in the half-light with a bottle of wine in her lap, gently rocking on a swing. He skulks off, then races back, gesticulating wildly, and Alison strides off tearfully, leaving a dumbstruck Sydney staring after her. She quickly returns and kicks it as he slumps down on the rope swing, then falls backward onto the grass. Shimmering lights play on the rippling surface of the swimming pool as Sydney lies on his belly by the water's edge. Sophie's reflection appears like a mirage on the water, and he rolls over to look up as she kneels down beside him, lies down beside him on her belly, rolls onto her back, and moves closer to him. She stares up at the stars, and Sydney bites his bottom lip. Smiling, she turns her head to look at Sydney, who lies on his side, gazing at her. Dappled by a pale shifting light, she looks back up at the stars, and Sydney springs to his feet and races off through the party. A man hands Sydney a small Ziploc bag of white powder, and Sydney runs off. Alison is bent over, drunkenly failing to unlock her car door, and holding Alison upright, Sydney gazes over at Sophie, who is kneeling by the pool. Sydney drives with Alison in the passenger seat, and they drive down a dark stretch of road as she presses her lips together, stifling tears, then vomits. Alison is slung over Sydney's shoulder as Sydney sits in his apartment with his bespectacled father and Mrs. Kowalski. Wearing Sydney's jacket, Alison puts a song on in his bedroom, and Mrs. Kowalski gives Alison a sideways look as she dances out to join them. The bag of white powder is present as Alison joins them on the sofa, covers her mouth, and balding, brown-suited Richard stands as Mrs. Kowalski leads Alison to Sydney's bedroom. Sydney washes up as his father returns a framed portrait photo of a woman to a shelf. Richard looks blank, sidles up behind Sydney at the sink, and goes to put a hand on Sydney's shoulder but can't bring himself to do it, turning away instead. Richard puts a copy of his book down on the table as Sydney stares solemnly at him, then reluctantly cracks a smile. Sydney opens the bedroom door, leans his head against the door frame, and peers into the dark room where Alison lies sleeping, smiling fondly as she stirs. Sydney's eyes dart left and right as he retreats from the room.",
    "1125": "He picks up the radio. Outside of the clearing, Hermione tip-toes towards the invisible, protective shield. Her eyes peeled, she gazes into the gloom. Narrowing her eyes, she peers towards the dark shadows under the trees. In the tent, Harry studies the Marauder's Map. Snape's footprints appear near the headmaster's study. Hermione continues to prowl. She freezes as men approach, one carrying a woman. He passes by. A second man follows with someone slung over his shoulder. A third stops, just past Hermione. He retraces his steps, until he stands directly in front of her. She stands stock still. He can see no sign of her, the tent, or the campfire. The second man drops the body from his shoulder. The man does as he's told. The three of them walk away. Harry joins Hermione. Hermione looks in the direction the men went. Her face is solemn. They walk towards the tent. Ron steps out of the tent. He sees the two of them together. He looks pale and haggard. As they journey through fields and past devastated homes, Ron grows more drawn and suspicious. They're camped under a bridge. Harry stands alone a little distance from them. Ron stays glued to the radio. Now, they're camped on the shore of a lake. At night, Ron lies awake. In the tent, Hermione is cutting Harry's hair. She stops suddenly. She consults a book. The light whisks away from the lamps. Hollow-eyed, Ron appears holding the deluminator. He returns the light. Harry lunges at him. The two friends glare at each other. Ron tugs off the locket and throws it down. Ron picks up his bag and scowls at Hermione. She looks distraught. She glances round at Harry, then back to Ron. She hesitates. Ron glowers at Harry. His mouth curled in a snarl, Ron storms out. Hermione follows. Harry paces uneasily. His face troubled, Harry remains alone inside the tent. Next morning, Harry steps out of the tent and sees Hermione standing by the water's edge, her back to him. She gazes anxiously across the wintry landscape. Harry waits as Hermione ties her scarf round a slender tree trunk. The locket dangles from her hand. She walks through dead bracken and stands beside Harry. He takes her hand. They apparate on a stony clifftop. Hermione sadly wipes her eyes. Harry moves away discreetly as she turns to hide her tears. High on the limestone clifftop, he creates a protective shield. Hermione sits huddled on a flat-topped rock. Harry stands alone, looking towards the setting sun. A dim light glows inside the tent. The wind ruffles Harry's hair as he walks over the rocks. He turns, hearing the faint sound of the radio.",
    "81": "We watch, for a moment more, the two sleeping faces and then find ourselves in Peacock Alley, a tree-shaded dirt street of a small, one-street river town; a picturesque, mid-19th-century remnant of the old river civilization, which general progress has left behind. They stroll barefoot down the empty dirt sidewalk, eventually looking towards the voices; PEARL is friendly, but JOHN is hostile. Several stick their heads around the edge of the Schoolhouse door, chanting at the HARPER CHILDREN while another draws something on the wall next to the door. Over these lines, we briefly cut to -- chanting and drawing -- as the ARTIST completes in chalk a large simple sketch of a man hanging from gallows. As the verse ends, we see them looking towards the children; JOHN pays them no attention, taking PEARL'S hand. We shoot them through the window of MIZ CUNNINGHAM'S second-hand store, with the back of a watch silhouetted large in the foreground; JOHN'S eyes instantly fix on it, while the schoolchildren finish their song and vanish, giggling, into the schoolhouse. A watch with a moving sweep-hand ticks away. Over a shop-doorbell, we hear PEARL watching her; JOHN, the watch. He walks off fast as we dolly behind them; he leads PEARL, who hugs her doll, a few paces in silence until they come to the big window of Spoon's Ice Cream Parlor. WILLA's face is seen within; serving a customer, she sees them and waves them away, but he keeps her strolling. WALT SPOON comes out, proffering two lollipops. A short, lighted, toy-like train departs the town along the riverbank, whistling, and the whistle ties over the previous. A square, head-on shot features river water below and vibrant starlight above, highlighting a gas-lamp by the road, a tree, and pretty tree-shadows working across a window. PEARL lies in their bed, her doll snug on her shoulder, as JOHN sits on the edge of the bed in his underwear. He moves, and as his shadow moves away, the shadow of PREACHER is seen, motionless. PEARL sits up and points at it, causing JOHN to notice her and see it. We pan JOHN to the window, where he looks out and stands motionless before turning. We pan him back to bed while people wave from shore and boat. We pan her into frame at UNCLE BIRDIE STEPTOE'S toy-like little wharf-boat, which passes broadside, cutting to as the boat passes. BIRDIE'S head sticks through a porthole, showing he is a wiry old river character, and the boat whistles. As BIRDIE speaks, we pan JOHN and the foundered skiff into a two-shot before panning JOHN from the skiff to wharf and Birdie's door. JOHN enters and sits on a box as BIRDIE, in a ramshackle rocking chair, pours coffee and gives JOHN a cup.",
    "537": "The movie cuts to Holly's point of view: the front seat where David and April sit, the Jaguar's windshield, and the passing lights and traffic of the street. Holly continues her ruminations as April leans over to say something to David. The film moves back to Holly in the backseat, still lost in thought. The screen cuts to black and a title appears. The movie briefly holds on a ripped, red, paint-splattered door as Elliot, wearing a raincoat, appears nearby. He looks down the street and the film cuts to his point of view: Frederick's loft building. The movie goes back to the impatient Elliot; he's looking around him. He glances at his watch as the film cuts back once again to the loft building, where Lee finally appears, walking down the street away from Elliot. A truck passes down the street. She walks further and further away; she turns a corner. Elliot frantically looks around again; then, in a burst of decision, he runs around a garbage dump, crossing the street, and still running, he moves down an adjacent street, past The Canal Lumber Company and several other buildings, as the film cuts back to Lee, walking down a different street, oblivious. The jazz plays on as the movie cuts back and forth between the fast-moving Elliot, rushing down the SoHo streets, past a truck waiting for a light to change, past some pedestrians, some garbage cans, turning corners, and the strolling Lee, walking up different streets, past different buildings. Lee eventually crosses a street, lost in thought, looking right and left, as Elliot, pretending nonchalance, waits on the corner, looking at his watch. She looks up in surprise; the music stops. They begin to walk down the street. She shrugs. They begin to walk again as the movie cuts to the interior of the Pageant Book & Print Shop, an old, serious bookstore. A nude print hangs at the end of one of the library shelf-like bookcases, which are packed, row after row, with books. An unseen Elliot and Lee carry on a conversation as the camera moves down an aisle, past the rows of books. Pictures hang on the aisle ends of the shelves. The camera moves past another aisle of books to reveal Lee, browsing through a shelf. She walks down a center aisle, the camera still in its parallel aisle, following her. Lee stops at the row where Elliot has been browsing. She is hidden by a shelf; only Elliot is seen as he talks to the offscreen Lee. Elliot starts walking down the center aisle, in the same direction Lee had walked up. He continues to talk to her as she remains offscreen in a nearby row.",
    "992": "The tug drifts, and somewhere ahead a U-boat surfaces in the darkness. Pleasant bangs on the wheelhouse window, and the tug restarts its engines, sending a plume of black smoke out of its funnel. Mike and Benjamin peer over the side and spot the U-boat's upper head as a U-boat blinds the whole surface. The tug's lights are visible on the horizon. Hurrying into the wheelhouse, the wheelman stares at Mike. Mike hands the wheelman a pistol, and a crew member mans a heavy machine gun on top of the tug while a gunner climbs into the conning tower. Benjamin has a life jacket, which he gives to one of the twins. The lights are turned off on the tug as Vic makes the sign of the cross. Manning the heavy machine gun, Danny Smith cocks the weapon, and the wheelman aims his pistol at the U-boat. Captain Mike grits his teeth, sets the engines full ahead, and steams towards the U-boat. The German gunner spots the tug approaching and opens fire with a machine gun. Benjamin ducks his face around as Danny returns fire. Mike flinches as the German rounds shatter the windows, and Pleasant, manning the searchlight, catches a bullet and collapses. Benjamin cowers on the deck below the wheelhouse, and Danny Smith is hit and falls from the machine gun. Mike also takes a hit and collapses. Vic crosses himself again as the tugboat plows forward and smashes into the side of the U-boat. The U-boat explodes beneath the tug, and both vessels take on water and begin to sink. Benjamin staggers into the wheelhouse and finds Mike on the floor. He props him up, and Mike screams in pain, tearing his jumper to reveal two bullet holes in his chest. Benjamin takes the captain's blood-soaked hand in his, and Mike dies. Benjamin stares down at him, his face stained with blood, as he stares at his lifeless skipper. Vic cradles his dead twin. A door swings open on the tug, which is listing badly in the water, and as dawn breaks, the tug and the U-boat have sunk below the waves. A fleet of other ships is now at the scene. Watched by a grieving Vic, Benjamin tosses a life belt from The Chelsea over the side of the rescue vessel. As it floats in the water, a hummingbird flies past it, then flies up and hovers briefly in front of Benjamin before flying off. The sun shines down out of a clear, blue sky. Benjamin, who now looks about 50, with shorter hair and new specs, wanders into the retirement home. She looks around and sees him, taking a few seconds to recognize him. He looks down, and Benjamin plays the piano.",
    "399": "She is screaming and the room is alive, each man awake, grabbing guns, and screaming. She takes in huge gobs of air and rubs her hand on his chest, sidling closer to him and coming on to him. Fergus walks over to him, lifts the hood up so his mouth is revealed, and pushes the sandwich toward his lips, allowing Jody to eat slowly. Fergus then pushes the last crumbs of the sandwich toward Jody's mouth, and Jody eats the last bits. Jude makes her way from the door toward the greenhouse, carrying a pot of tea and two cups. It is sweltering now in the greenhouse, and the hood is drenched with sweat. Jude comes into view, lays the tea on the ground, and his breathing becomes labored. Fergus gives her the gun, and Jody's head follows Fergus while he leaves. Jude smiles, holding the gun on her lap as Fergus enters. Maguire has a newspaper, which has a headline regarding the kidnapping. Jude drinks tea while looking at Jody sweating. Fergus re-enters and she goes. Fergus walks to Jody and slowly takes the hood off, and Jody looks up at him with his face bathed in sweat, breathing in mighty gulps of air. He smiles, and Fergus smiles back. Fergus pours out a cup of tea and brings it to his lips, drinks, and looks at him. Jody isn't smiling anymore, so Fergus goes back to his seat, drinks his tea, and fingers the gun on his lap. He looks at Fergus, and Fergus holds the gun to his face, fishing inside Jody's inside pocket. Fergus's hand emerges with a wallet containing credit cards and an army identification photograph. Fergus takes out a picture of Jody in cricket whites, smiling, and holding a bat, smiling again himself. Fergus then takes out another picture of Jody and a beautiful black woman smiling, and Jody chuckles. Fergus looks at him, keeping his gaze, and Jody smiles. Fergus leads Jody outside, holding the gun against him, and Jody walks toward it, breathing heavily while Fergus stands motionless in the dark, looking at him. Fergus turns him around, unzips his fly, and Jody takes two steps toward the wall. Fergus holds his hands from behind so Jody can lean forward, and Jody now pisses with immense relief, shakes his body, and steps back. Fergus leads him back toward the greenhouse and back to his chair, and Jody begins to laugh. Fergus also begins to laugh without knowing why, waking Maguire, who is walking out of the house at the sound of laughter. Jody continues to laugh until the hood is suddenly slammed back over his head. Maguire stands there in the dark, looking at Fergus, who gets up slowly and walks toward the door, while Maguire sits with an Armalite in his hands, watching him, as the sun comes up over the low hills around the farmhouse.",
    "1389": "Snape turns and sees Lupin standing in the shadows. Lupin takes the parchment, which now displays a rather unflattering caricature of Snape and a pair of potions. Harry walks aside a fuming Lupin, who grips the map fiercely. Harry walks silently and lingers briefly in the doorway, absently eyeing the waxing moon that glimmers beyond the window, then starts to turn away but stops. Lupin hesitates ever-so-slightly, then returns to his papers. As Trelawney eyes Harry's crystal, Hermione rolls her eyes. Stung, Hermione starts to reply but seems incapable of a single word. Rising gracelessly, she exits, knocking her crystal ball to the floor. Harry watches curiously as the ball rolls slowly out the doorway. Ron stops, glances at Harry, then moves off. Harry watches him go, along with the others, then spies Hermione's crystal ball lying on the landing. Harry sets Hermione's crystal back on its stand and starts to go, when the smoke within the crystal suddenly darkens. Leaning close, Harry watches the shape that appears. It is unmistakable: Sirius Black. Just then, a shadow crawls the glossy surface of the crystal, and a hand snatches Harry's shoulder. He wheels, finds, and Harry stiffens. When it rises, she blinks, eyes the hand that lies upon Harry's shoulder—her hand. Harry shakes his head. Clearly unsettled by his encounter with Trelawney, Harry hastens down the stairs, and we fade out. SWOOK! SWOOK! We fade up on a moving POV of a crow as it glides to the flock circling the feet of a pot-bellied man, the Executioner, sitting in the courtyard. As he sharpens his axe—SWOOK! SWOOK!—we cut to Harry, Ron, and Hermione hurrying past. The Executioner looks up, and we see Harry leading Ron and Hermione toward Hagrid's hut. She and Ron look and see Malfoy, along with Crabbe and Goyle, lurking within a grouping of monolithic menhirs, binoculars in hand, spying on Hagrid, who stands in the pumpkin patch, tossing dead ferrets to Buckbeak. Malfoy stumbles back against a tree, cross-eyed with fear as Hermione jabs the tip of her wand under his nose, when she turns, surprised Ron's spoken to her. Hermione nods, then—SMACK!—quick as lightning, lands a looping right to Malfoy's jaw, putting him flat on his back. Stunned, he leaps to his feet and runs, Crabbe and Goyle huffing and puffing behind. The trio makes their way down the slope and past Buckbeak, chewing on a ferret with idle satisfaction. Hagrid stands by the window watching Buckbeak. Harry and Ron sit, and the trio slips silently into a stand of trees. Beyond them, Hagrid's hut glimmers desolately in the dying sun. High in the clock tower, a bell begins to toll.",
    "1040": "The chase mounts a pedestrian area and crashes down a wide stone staircase, then rejoins the main road as other cars desperately veer to the side while Taylor powers onward. Barnes swerves to avoid a collision and mounts the pavement, wrestling with his steering wheel as Javier looks back and sees Barnes lose a little bit of ground. The chase continues as a fire engine bounds towards Taylor but holds while both Taylor and Barnes brake on the turn and then accelerate along parallel lines. Barnes drives through a pedestrian colonnade, spots two cars in the way, and brakes, being thrown around as the hatchback breaks through the gap. Taylor and Javier look behind them as they join a busy road and the chase weaves through a slow traffic. Javier pulls his gun, and Taylor clips another driver, who hits a parked car. Barnes powers through the flipping vehicles as Taylor looks back anxiously over his shoulder, and Javier lowers his gun, then leans out of the window and fires. Two bullet holes appear in Barnes' windscreen, and Javier sits back into the police car as Taylor looks in his rear view mirror and steers, then handbrake turns the police car round a corner and into the path of a truck which loses control. As Barnes rounds the corner, the truck smashes into the hatchback, causing pedestrians to scatter as Barnes is sandwiched between the truck and the nearby wall. Taylor smirks as they proceed along the underpass in the shadow of an elevated road, where Enrique steps from behind a pillar. Taylor stops the car, and Javier gets out, shooting the armed Enrique and then pointing his gun at Enrique's face while Howard films nearby and spots Anna crossing the road. Barnes pushes the windscreen out of the wrecked hatchback and climbs out onto the road as the truck driver holds his arms out, and Barnes pulls his gun, heading for the underpass. Veins stand out on Javier's forehead as he presses the gun up to Enrique's forehead while Barnes takes aim some way back. Javier spins and opens fire, and Barnes fires back as Taylor starts the police car, and they both land shoulder hits, with Javier grabbing the door of Taylor's car. Taylor pulls a gun and shoots Javier point blank as he accelerates, as Barnes gives chase on foot while Enrique dies by the roadside. A shot from Barnes shatters the back windscreen and hits Taylor in the shoulder, and Taylor looks dazed and loses control of the car, then veers onto the curb and crashes into a concrete ramp which smashes through the windscreen. Javier lies dead on the road with his face resting against his right arm as Barnes approaches the police car with his handgun held out in front of him.",
    "1161": "Harry staggers in with Dudley, who, about to be sick, points weakly at Harry as an owl hits the ceiling and falls in a flurry of feathers, then flies off. The envelope speaks, and Uncle Vernon smirks with glee. Under cover of darkness, the Dursleys smuggle Dudley into the car with a blanket over his head while Mrs. Figg watches from her window opposite and waves. In his bedroom, Harry thumps the wardrobe in anger and frustration, causing a photograph beside his owl's cage to fall onto the carpet, which he picks up, then sits on his bed to look at his parents dancing together in the moving photograph. He places it carefully on his bedside table beside a half-eaten plate of food. Cedric's face looms out of the darkness, sweating with fear, and Harry relives his terror as a flash of green light engulfs Cedric, who falls lifeless, followed by Voldemort's blank eyes staring out from his bony, snake-like skull, and Harry jerks awake to a streak of moonlight across his pillow. He lies as if in a trance, his lips moving, then turns his head as he hears a scraping sound. Still fully dressed, Harry reaches for his glasses and puts them on as he looks towards the door, where the key is slowly turning in the lock. Harry grabs his wand and sits up as the key continues to turn and falls to the floor. With a dazzling flash, the door flies open, revealing five people lit by a wand standing in the doorway, one of whom Harry recognizes. Moody leads them all outside, taps his stick, and a broomstick flies into each person's hand as Mrs. Figg watches them soar away high above Privet Drive. The twinkling lights of central London are spread out below as Kingsley, a wizard in African robes, flies in front, following the line of the River Thames as it winds through the city. They fly low, cloaks flying like a flight of huge bats skimming the surface of the shimmering water, swooping by HMS Belfast and heading upriver towards Westminster. Harry flies close beside Nymphadora Tonks as a pleasure boat on a nighttime cruise heads straight toward them, and Nymphadora steers to the right of it, with Harry to the left. They pass the flood-lit houses of Parliament, reflected in the water like a huge ocean liner, while a refuse lorry passes a garden in the middle of the London square. Moody leads them from the garden into the street, facing a terrace of Georgian houses, where he strikes the pavement, and one of the houses in front of them moves to the left, causing Harry's jaw to drop as an extra house slides into the space and balconies slot into position, with the people next door remaining oblivious as they continue watching television.",
    "47": "He stops, looks down at Lampert's body for a moment, then suddenly sneezes six times in rapid succession. He takes a small bottle from his pocket, shakes a pill from it, and swallows it dry. He turns and walks back up the aisle, looking for a place to sit. He comes face to face with Grandpierre, stops, and turns to sit somewhere else. Again, the sound of the door opening interrupts them, and they turn to look. The figure of a man, outlined in silhouette against the outside brightness, wears a velvet-corduroy suit, string tie, and a bright yellow flower in his lapel. A bulldurham tag hangs from his outside breast pocket, dangling from its string. He starts down the aisle toward the bier, camera leading him, and we notice his unsteady gait. He turns to look at the others present, moving down the aisle. Grandpierre's face, then Gideon's, then Reggie's, and Sylvie's—all stare at the camera as Tex arrives. He stands staring at Lampert's body, swaying on his feet until he reaches out and grabs the side of the coffin to steady himself. Then he takes the flower from his lapel and throws it into the open box. Sylvie points to Reggie, and unruffled, Tex starts over, addressing Reggie this time. She pulls out the letter and starts to read it. It bears the Great Seal as a letterhead, and the typed message reads. Sylvie has been reading over Reggie's shoulder. The elevator door closes on them, and Reggie reacts to this, starting down the hall, finally stopping at the door. The office is empty, the typewriter on the secretary's desk covered with its plastic shroud. Reggie enters, looks for somebody, and notices that the door to the private office is slightly ajar. Bartholomew comes to the door and looks in. He is a pale, grey-haired man who looks, on first examination, older than his forty-odd years; sickly would be the word that describes him best—pallid, consumptive-looking. He wears heavy tortoise-framed glasses that fall down his nose and cause him to push them back in place every so often with a quick automatic motion. He motions for her to enter, standing aside to let her do so. A small cubicle has a silver-framed photo of three kids on the desk. A can of lighter fluid stands open on the desk and a crumpled hankie beside it. He works at a stain on his necktie with lighter fluid and hankie. He looks up at her, laughs silently, then goes back to his tie. He puts away the lighter fluid in a desk drawer, smells the hankie, passes on it, then sticks it in his pocket.",
    "1025": "Sadie lies at the foot of the bed and turns around as Charlotte touches her with slobbery fingers. Sadie hops out of bed and storms off down the hall, and Charlotte sits up to face her dad. Charlotte then jumps off the bed and scurries away, leaving a wide gap between her parents, while Debbie glances at Pete, yanks the bedspread toward her, and faces the TV as they both stare forward. Charlotte sits at her desk writing a note in red marker and hangs it on Sadie's door. Meanwhile, Pete wears headphones at his desk, while Sadie watches something on her tablet. Debbie now lies with Charlotte in her bed and leans over to kiss Charlotte on the lips. In the morning, Pete awakens on the couch in an awkward position, props himself up, and grips his shoulder. Pete then sips coffee at the island with his back to the table as his family eats breakfast, glancing back before eyeing his mug. He drives the kids to school, sloppily eats an egg sandwich, and sings, while Sadie eyes her father and looks away as Charlotte's eyes widen. At school, Charlotte puts on headphones as Pete walks her to class; they pass a gray-haired pregnant woman, and Pete stops to kiss his daughter on the head before starting to leave. A fat woman approaches with Joseph, who stands a dozen feet away and pokes her several times. In a coffee shop, Debbie sits with Jodi, grabs her phone, and Jodi narrows her eyes. In a school office, Debbie nods as Jill glares, Debbie shrugs, and Pete nods slowly. They exit the school with mischievous grins, each glancing at the other, avoiding eye contact, and enter the parking lot where Debbie heads to her silver SUV and Pete strolls to his blue Sedan, pulling keys from his pocket and briefly glancing toward her. They enter separate vehicles simultaneously. Later, at home, Pete and Charlotte sit at the table as Debbie serves chicken and looks at Pete, while Sadie storms away. Debbie then sits down, resting her head on her hand. In her room, Sadie does homework on her bed, as Charlotte's door slides open across their shared bathroom, and Charlotte emerges with an armful of things. She places Sadie's computer, phone, and tablet on Sadie's bed, and leaves as Sadie grabs her phone, smiles, and looks toward her younger sister as the door slides shut. Downstairs, Debbie sits on the couch while Pete paces, moves close, and they embrace. Finally, a main character, Jack, lies on the ground dying as a plane flies overhead.",
    "334": "The tall Bree folk loom over the nervous little hobbits as Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin make their way through the narrow streets, with tall buildings towering above them and lights glowing dimly from behind thick curtains. Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin come rushing in as Frodo attracts the innkeeper's attention. Sam watches Pippin rise unsteadily to his feet and head to the bar, while Sam indicates a brooding stranger who sits alone at a table in the far corner, smoking a curiously carved long-stemmed pipe and peering from beneath a travel-stained cowl with gleaming eyes. Frodo gestures to Butterbur while sitting at the bar and chatting with locals. Frodo leaps to his feet and pushes his way towards the bar, grabbing Pippin's sleeve and spilling his beer. Frodo is then pushed into the hobbit's room by Strider, who sheathes his sword with a slight smile playing on his lips. The gatekeeper comes out of his lodgings with a lantern and a look of fear on his face, approaching the closed gate with great apprehension. As the gatekeeper peers out of his peephole, the gate crashes down on him as four Ringwraiths ride into Bree, flying down the empty streets like horsemen of the apocalypse. The front door flies open, and the four Ringwraiths rush into the Prancing Pony with wicked swords drawn, while Butterbur hides behind his bar, trembling and sweating in terror. Pippin stirs slightly, then settles back to sleep. The door creaks open, and the four Ringwraiths silently slide into the hobbit's room, looming above each bed and raising their shining swords above the sleeping hobbits. Sam's eyes open wide as, in unison, the Ringwraiths stab the hobbits in a slashing, hacking frenzy. The Ringwraiths step back from the slashed beds in triumph, but a hacked blanket is pulled back to reveal nothing but a shredded pillow. The Ringwraiths shriek with rage as Sam sits up with a start, and another shredded pillow is revealed, causing more shrieks of rage. Pippin and Merry wake with a start, revealing that Sam, Merry, and Pippin have been sleeping on Strider's bed. Frodo stands next to Strider by the window, peering out nervously as furious Ringwraith screeches echo across the courtyard from the hobbits' room. Strider, Merry, Pippin, and Frodo march through a gloomy, overgrown forest as Frodo watches uneasily while Strider moves off into the cover of the trees, and Sam looks excited. Strider leads the hobbits through the gloom of the forest, then aerially leads Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin across the windswept moors. The hobbits suddenly stop and unstrap their knapsacks as Strider stops, casts a glance back at Sam, stares at Pippin blankly, then turns away, shaking his head. An apple is thrown to Merry, who deftly catches it, and another, aimed at Pippin, catches him on the forehead.",
    "911": "As Purvis struggles against the angry civilian, Winstead advances. Dillinger sees him just feet away gripping a pistol. Slack-jawed, Purvis relaxes his aim as Winstead lines up a shot. The bullet pierces the back of Dillinger's skull and exits through his cheek, spewing blood and tissue. Two crimson stains bloom on his shirt front, as Hurt fires twice from behind. Dillinger falls face down, eyes staring off, as blood streams from his ruptured cheek. Purvis stares, then ventures forward. As Dillinger lies dying, his lips move. Winstead removes his hat, crouches and leans his ear close to Dillinger. The agent narrows his eyes, glances at the fallen man, and withdraws, revealing Dillinger's lifeless stare. Winstead gets to his feet, his sober gaze locked on the dead man. He holsters his gun and Purvis joins his side. As the younger G-man eyes the body, Winstead dons his hat, his air stoic and grim. The older man faces him. Purvis eyes him long and steady. Winstead glances away, then looks Purvis in the eye. Marty leans in for a good look at Dillinger's body, then heads off. Polly averts her gaze. Purvis takes another look at the body. A dozen civilians from the movie house rubber-neck as they move closer to the scene. A few yards off, Anna glances over her shoulder and slips away. Before the growing crowd, a man lights a flare and holds it aloft. A few men swap grins and chat. The scene draws more Chicagoans from across the street, and more flares illuminate the area with searing light. The armed federal agents struggle to maintain order. Someone's hand blocks our view. A camera flashes over Dillinger's body. Winstead lights a cigarette and pensively looks away. More onlookers converge on the scene. Policemen help the agents manage pushy photographers. Purvis leaves the scene, silhouetted against the flares' sallow light. Behind him, the glow and the smoke fill the air, blotting the crowd from view. More civilians rush in. From overhead, we gaze down at the chaos, as we withdraw. Winstead sits at a table in a small room with white brick walls. In a cellblock, a matron escorts Billie. Clad in a simple gray dress, she wears a dull expression. As the matron ushers her to another, the prisoner maintains her dispassionate gaze. In the visiting room, the door opens. Winstead stands as Billie enters. She stares guardedly at him, then takes the seat facing his. Winstead sits. Leaning forward, he faces her with a knitted brow. Billie swallows, blinks her glistening eyes, then gives a stony nod. Billie glares coldly. Winstead opens a gold cigarette case and briefly thumbs the contents. He turns the case, offering the grieving woman a cigarette.",
    "1061": "She looks at him, shifting awkwardly, and David smiles but squirms at her discomfort, indicating that's a yes. Jenny smiles and pulls her nightie off her shoulders, and David heaves a sigh. Embarrassed, Jenny avoids eye contact, then David smiles, stands, and moves to her, pulling her nightie back on. He goes to kiss her but hugs her instead, and her arms remain by her sides until she puts them around him, and they hold one another. Sun shines on the small village as the Bristol pulls up at some old-timbered houses. Jenny stands completely aghast as the men walk away, and she and Helen walk through a cemetery, having slipped a picture in the back of the car. Jenny stops playing ball with some children and hurries over, where the picture, a map, is sitting between Jenny and Helen on the back seat. Jenny eyes him wearily as they later arrive at Danny's place. Jenny takes her bags and strides off, pausing at the cab without even looking at David, then stops angrily in the middle of the road and turns to him. He wanders over, wanting to explain, looks at her imploringly, then grins, and she can't help but grin back. He takes all of her bags, she makes a show of pulling away, but then he takes her hand and twirls her around, and they hug and slow dance in the street. On a colonnaded balcony, Danny holds up two glasses. At night, the Bristol arrives back at Jenny's house, and Jenny sits glumly in the passenger seat while David looks across at her. Wearing a tight smile, she doesn't look at him, but he smiles lovingly at her and looks down. Very slowly, they lean together and kiss, but she pulls away, and they smile, then sit awkwardly. Jenny puts her handbag on the kitchen table and shows it to her father. Marjorie stops her cake baking and goes to look at the book, while Jenny licks cake mixture off the whisk and grins to herself. At school, the girls, in their PE kits, get out for a run, but Jenny and her friends hide behind a tree smoking until the teacher arrives, prompting the girls to file out of the classroom, and Tina sticks her tongue out. Jenny enters the head's wood-paneled office, and the headmistress watches Jenny leave. At home, the dining room is in darkness as Graham has come for tea, and Jenny closes her eyes while Marjorie puts the candle-decked cake down in front of her. Jack switches the lights back on, and Marjorie drops Graham's slice of cake. Jenny unwraps the present and tries to look pleased as she shows Graham, accepting the gift with a tight smile and placing it on top of the other one. Jack gets up to answer the door, and David is laden with presents.",
    "932": "Holmes spots a bit of material, a piece of bloodstained wood, a dollop of mortar, and a stain. In his mind's eye, he sees mortar being churned and some spilt. A carpenter cuts his finger, spilling blood. Sacks are used as counterweights and a door handle is disguised as a coat peg. A mechanism turns. The workmen open a bottle of wine and some is spilled, staining the floor. Holmes eyes the coat pegs. He pulls on one of the coat pegs and a secret door opens. Watson draws a sword from a stick and cuts the rope holding the sandbag. The door swings shut behind them. Holmes lights a flaming brand. They look around the secret room and see a printing press and, on a table, sticks of dynamite. Holmes eyes a plaque reading, Imperata. Leading the way with his flaming torch, Holmes heads off down a dark corridor. They go up a flight of stone steps, push a metal grill open, and emerge on a dark street beneath a bridge. They climb up onto the bridge and look out towards the opera house. As they get close to the building, they push their way through crowds outside. Inside, the performance is underway. Sim, Holmes, and Watson enter the opera house through the stage door. As they make their way backstage, they don't notice Moriarty's agent lurking in the shadows. He gets up and, puffing on a dark cigarette, watches them go by before heading off in the opposite direction. Holmes, Watson, and Sim walk past stagehands in the wings. A couple of them try to stop them but they ignore the men's protests. Holmes spots a plaque, Imperata, and thinks back to the dynamite beside the one in the secret room. He imagines a bomb with a timing device beneath the stage. Holmes walks over to one of the stagehands and flings him out of the way. He gestures to Sim, who tosses him a knife. Holmes climbs under the stage and cuts a hole in a sheet of canvas. He looks up and sees the word Imperata is part of the print on which the statue of Commendatore is standing. Holmes is now inside the plinth. Onstage, the Commendatore points a finger at. Holmes peels away a backing cloth from the word Imperata. Inside the plinth, he finds a black chess piece concealed in the O. He picks the chess piece up and sees Moriarty sitting in a box, watching the performance and possibly him, through a pair of opera glasses. Holmes rips his way out of the back of the statue of the Commendatore and hurries across the stage to the wings where Sim and Watson are waiting beside a couple of actors in demon costumes.",
    "1205": "Lights burn in the house at night, and he's lying by the fire. He lies down next to Marley as Jenny fetches a blanket for them. Marley is lying under a tree, and he gets out of the car and runs indoors, where Connor gives him a hug. Jenny fights back tears while John takes the stuffed lamb, and Patrick tearfully hugs Marley. The boy looks imploringly at his parents; Jenny frowns in sympathy at her son's pain, and John tries a reassuring smile. He carries Marley out to the car and gently lays the old dog down in the boot. John goes to get behind the wheel as Jenny tearfully strokes her dying pet; she closes the door and presses her hand to the glass as John drives away down the winding drive through trees adorned with golden brown autumn leaves. At the surgery, John sits and waits with his hands clasped together. At home, Patrick is leafing through John's old columns, and Jenny walks in and ruffles his blonde hair. Jenny controls her own emotions as John gives into tears. He goes back into the surgery where Marley is lying on the table, runs his hand down Marley's beige coat, and strokes the dog's tail, which isn't wagging now. John holds a rear paw, rubs Marley's shoulder, leans forward, and hugs his friend, burying his face in Marley's neck, then gently strokes Marley's head. Jenny waits tearfully at home as the vet puts a hypodermic into the IV line going into Marley's leg. Patrick slots a videotape into a player, and Jenny waves to the camera holding baby Patrick in a cowboy outfit. Marley stands expectantly next to the high chair, and Jenny slips him a tidbit. Patrick stares at the TV while at the surgery, the vet pushes down the plunger on the needle. John watches Marley, and Jenny sits sadly, staring into space. On the video, John takes off Patrick's nappy, which Marley then grabs, and Patrick grins, watching as his father tries to wrestle the nappy off the dog. Jenny sits sadly in the window seat as Patrick concentrates on the old video footage of his mother laughing and a close-up of Marley, staring puzzled into the camera. The vet puts a stethoscope to Marley's chest and listens; John continues to stroke Marley's head as the vet takes off the stethoscope and turns away. The Grogans walk across their leaf-strewn lawn, John carrying Colleen on his shoulders. He lifts down the little girl as they reach a small grave by a tree; she puts the picture in the grave, and he puts his paper in with Colleen's. She takes off her necklace, kneels down next to the grave, and drops the necklace in with Marley.",
    "487": "A low terrible groan begins to rise up out of her throat, and a hand comes into the shot holding an enormous bread knife. Over it, the brief gulps of screaming can be heard, followed by the dreadful thump as Mary's body falls in the tub. Above the shower-bar, the bathroom door opens again, and after a moment, the sound of the front door slamming is heard. Lying half in, half out of the tub, her head is tumbled over, touching the floor with her hair wet, one eye wide open as if popped, and one arm lying limp and wet along the tile floor. Coming down the side of the tub, many small threads of blood run thick and dark along the porcelain. The camera follows away from the body, travels slowly across the bathroom, past the toilet, and out into the bedroom. As the camera approaches the bed, the folded newspaper is seen as Mary placed it on the bedside table beside the bed. The camera moves over to the window and looks up at the house, and as it gets there, Norman's fearful, shocked voice is heard coming from within the house. She stops, the anxiety and fear building up in her, eyes beginning to fill with worried tears. Sam studies her for a moment, then turns and calls. Bob gets the message and goes out through the back way. Sam goes closer to Lila, speaking with soft seriousness. Arbogast studies it, then speaks, nods, takes down the closed-for-lunch sign, sails it to the counter, opens the door, and goes out into the street. Norman is holding the door open, so Arbogast walks in. Norman switches on the overhead light, starts for the linen closet, suddenly pauses, turns, and studies Arbogast, who has remained standing by the door. He waits a moment, then opens the closet, starts counting out sheets and pillowcases, keeping his back to Arbogast. Arbogast takes a photograph out of his pocket, talks as he crosses to Norman. Norman glances briefly, turns away, and lifts sheets and pillowcases off the shelf, holding them close, almost protectively. He goes to the wall, flips a light switch, takes a slip of paper out of his pocket, and lays it beside the signature in the registry book, nodding and smiling nicely, as if this discovery will make Norman as happy as it is making him. Arbogast has reached him, picture extended, and Norman looks dutifully at it. Norman becomes apprehensive, starts towards Arbogast, forcing himself to remain calm and cheerful. Arbogast turns and gazes seriously at him. Norman looks up, studies the man's face, his own face showing apprehension. As he turns the car out, his headlights light up the porch.",
    "611": "He enters reception and collides with an immovable turnstile, then staggers round. Attractive women dwarf him in an elevator, and a petite brunette in a gray suit leads him into a spacious office. A be-suited man with shoulder-length silver hair stands at a window staring out over the city, and Clayton Harding turns to look at him. Sidney reaches into his shoulder bag and proffers a red tee-shirt, which Clayton slings out of an open window. A post-modern review depicts Clayton as a nude king, and Sidney's smile fades as he meets with an indifferent stare. Clayton leaps through the offending issue, and Doc suited Lawrence leads him into a private office. Sidney glances at his bright red tee-shirt and fidgets before pointing at a photograph on the wall. It's the woman whose drink he spilled in the bar. In an open-plan office, Sidney crosses to Alison and perches on her desk while she works at a computer. A co-worker in a polka dot dress frowns. With a phone to his ear, Sidney pulls over a sheet of printed photographic negatives and adjusts his specs. She hangs up, the corners of his mouth downturned, as he peers at the contact sheet through a magnifying eye-glass to see two portly middle-aged gentlemen holding glasses of wine. He hits redial, looks at the telephone receiver, and frowns. Munching a hamburger, Sidney enters the lobby through a revolving door, joined by a blond in an A-line dress. As the door starts to close, she reaches out towards a hastily approaching colleague and quickly retracts her hand as the door slams shut, narrowing her eyes disapprovingly. It starts its descent, and the doors open. She strides out in a huff to Alison, who is wearing a sharp suit, and ignoring Sidney, she opens a book and starts to read. Tight-lipped, she stares down at her book, while Alison lowers her eyes as a golden-haired woman in her mid-40s wearing expensive sunglasses steps into the lift and turns her back on them. Sidney goes to swallow a mouthful of burger but gags, and a glob of chewed burger shoots out of his mouth and lands with a splat on the back of the woman's cream jacket. As Sidney goes to wipe it off, an incredulous Alison grabs his wrist and shakes her head; Sidney and Alison hurry out, and he takes a bite of the burger. Sidney rolls his eyes as he listens in. Night falls, and Sidney gazes out through the window of a sleek black automobile as it glides through Manhattan. Alison and Lawrence seem indifferent, thumbing their mobile phones. He looks out on the gaudy lights of Times Square, turns to his colleagues, and they eyeball him, then look back at their phones.",
    "249": "She touches its sleeve, and her hand goes into its pocket, pulling out his tobacco pouch. Like a little girl playing cowboy, she spreads the tobacco on some rolling paper, imitating what he did earlier, licks the paper, and rolls it into a pretty good cigarette. Her hand reaches back into the pocket and pulls out his Zippo lighter. She slaps the lighter against her leg, trying to light it fancy-style like Vince did, and what do you know, she did it! Mia's one happy clam. She triumphantly brings the fat flame up to her fat smoke, lighting it up, then loudly snaps the Zippo closed. The Mia-made cigarette is brought up to her lips, and she takes a long, cool drag. Her hand slides the Zippo back in the overcoat pocket, but wait, her fingers touch something else. Those fingers bring out a plastic bag with white powder inside, the madman that Vincent bought earlier from Lance. Wearing a big smile, Mia brings the bag of heroin up to her face. Mia has the unbeknownst-to-her heroin cut up into big lines on her glass top coffee table. Taking her trusty hundred dollar bill like a human Dust-Buster, she quickly snorts the fat line. Her head jerks back, and her hands go to her nose, which feels like it's on fire; something is terribly wrong. Vincent dries his hands on a towel while he continues his dialogue with the mirror. Mia is on all fours trying to crawl to the bathroom, but it's like she's trying to crawl with the bones removed from her knees. Blood begins to drip from Mia's nose, then her stomach gets into the act and she vomits. Vince continues as blood and puke are down her front and her face is contorted, slack-jawed. Lance puts down his cereal and makes his way to the phone. Jody, his wife, calls from the bedroom, obviously woken up. Lance charges from the window out the door to his front lawn, and Vincent is already out of the car, working on getting Mia out. We start in Lance's and Jody's bedroom as Jody, in bed, throws off the covers and stands up, wearing a long tee-shirt with a picture of Fred Flintstone on it. As she walks into the living room, she sees Vincent and Lance standing over Mia, who's lying on the floor in the middle of the room. From here on in, everything in this scene is frantic, like a documentary in an emergency ward, with the big difference being nobody knows what they're doing. Lance looks up at Jody, and we follow Lance as he runs out of the living room into a room with a bunch of junk in it.",
    "583": "Trina smiles and looks at the passengers from her jump seat. Whip takes the phone. Nicole gets out of the car and runs up to the second floor of a small run-down apartment complex. She pulls out a key as she reaches the door, only to discover it is slightly open. She smiles at him. He stands in the doorway. She kicks the door closed. She flings her bag on a table, and it hits a box which falls and scatters its contents. She spots a syringe. Whip speaks into the intercom. He pours the contents of a small vodka bottle into a juice container hidden from the passengers' view. He tosses three miniature bottles as he grabs the spiked orange juice. He takes a long drink as Margaret exits the toilet and he goes in. In Nicole's apartment, framed photographs on the table show a younger, smiling Nicole with her mother. Nicole lightly taps the syringe. Then pushes out a small drop that slides down the needle. She tightens a tourniquet around her arm and holds the end securely in her mouth. She positions the needle and injects. Her arms relax and she lets go of the syringe. She leans back, eyes closed. The strap falls from her mouth. Her head lulls to her shoulder. Her dilated pupils shrink to tiny dots. She grabs the packet of cocaine that Kip gave her and falls on her side. The packet falls inches from her hand. Her fingers reach out, but only push it away. Her hand goes still as feet appear under the door. In the cockpit, Whip sleeps with paper covering his eyes and his sunglasses over the paper. Ken's yoke jerks away. The yoke slips out of Ken's hands as Whip struggles to gain control and the plane begins to dive. The wheels of the aircraft unfold. In the galley, Margaret grabs the phone. Margaret unbuckles her seat belt. Alarmed passengers grasp the seat in front of them as a flight attendant tries to assist someone. Cammie falls and hits her head. Cammie lies still. Whip banks to the left. The plane turns upside down. She slides the side-stick forward. One wheel gets stuck while retracting. Inside the cabin, Cammie comes to a rest on the ceiling. Trina sees a young boy slip out of his seat. Outside Georgian Gardens, a medical aide wheels Nicole beside Fran as the upside down plane flies past. Trina crawls to the boy and straps him back in his seat. A light flashes on the control panel in the cockpit. The plane turns upright, and the still-unconscious Cammie falls on some passengers. Trina loses her hold and falls against the bulkhead. Fire and smoke billow from the left engine.",
    "494": "Mr. Cunningham furrows his brow and then chuckles, while Cole's face turns cement grey. Tommy Tammisimo leads the class in a wave of snickering as Cole glances up and sees all the eyes on him. He glances at the teacher, who is still staring, and Mr. Cunningham sees the traumatized expression on Cole's face, instantly stopping smiling as his face becomes still. The class falls into stunned silence. Mr. Cunningham takes an involuntary step towards Cole's desk and moves closer to Cole, who covers his eyes with his hands. Cole's mouth is visible under his covered eyes as he stares for a second and then lowers his head. Malcolm just sits and thinks as Cole turns his head and stares at the windows. Malcolm takes in the sad vision of the boy, and Cole's face softens a bit. Cole turns from the windows and looks to Malcolm, placing it in his right hand, as Malcolm shakes his hand in circles. Cole watches his hand carefully, and Malcolm taps the pocket but doesn't open it. Malcolm opens his right hand, and the penny sits quietly in the center of his palm. Cole looks at the penny and then up to Malcolm's face, cracking a smile. Cole smiles and holds out his hand, his fingers opening to reveal the penny, while Bobby stares. Cole loses his smile, and Cole and the overweight boy stare at each other. Cole gives the boy his penny and gazes at Bobby. Tommy glances down the hall and sees Cole standing frozen, staring at the crawl space closet, and grabs Darren, nudging him to move down the hall. Cole breaks from his trance as Tommy and Darren walk up, but it happens too quick for Cole to react, as Darren and Tommy shove him backwards, and he stumbles into the darkness of the crawl space as Tommy slams the door closed. They crack smiles at each other as Cole bangs on the door, the banging going on for a few seconds, and then it just stops. Darren and Tommy look at each other and then back at the crawl space door, backing away as Cole screams in terror at the top of his lungs, his body slamming against the wood. The two boys are statues as Cole's blood-chilling yells fill the air, footsteps spiking the air as children and mothers come running down the hall, with Lynn being one of them. Malcolm is affected by his client and stares at the tired child sitting before him in the hospital bed, slowly moving the rolling chair closer to Cole’s bed. Malcolm breaks from his thoughts and looks at Cole, who watches him with unwavering attention, as Malcolm smiles. Cole takes an eternal pause while Malcolm just gazes quietly, being very still and staring back at Cole.",
    "1169": "The owl takes wing and swoops low along the misty road. As it glides silently away through the trees, an upright elderly gentleman appears out of the shadows. He has a flowing white beard and long, silky white hair, and wears a pointed black hat. A plump tabby cat sitting on a wall turns its head curiously. The old gentleman walks along the pavement and stops beneath a street light. In his hand, he holds a small metal object which he flicks open. He raises the metal object and points it at a street lamp. The light from the lamp flies towards his hand and the lamp goes out. The light from the second street lamp disappears, and then a third. When all the lights in the road have been extinguished, the old gentleman lowers the metal object and flicks it shut. He looks over the top of his half-moon glasses at the plump tabby cat. The cat gives a hiccup, and its shadow looms large against the wall. It turns into a stern-looking woman wearing a cloak and a tall pointed black hat with a large brim. A bright light appears in the sky above the treetops, the lights of a motorcycle. Coattails flying, Hagrid, a huge giant, zooms down and screeches to a halt. Twinkling eyes peer out below dark bushy eyebrows. He has a huge black beard. He hands over a small bundle wrapped in a warm blanket. As Professor Dumbledore gently places the bundle on a doorstep, a tear runs down Hagrid's cheek. The tiny baby has a jacket scar on his forehead. A boy with a jacket scar on his forehead lies fast asleep. In the cupboard under the stairs, Harry Potter wakes and puts on a pair of large round spectacles mended with sticky tape. A pudgy boy crashes down the stairs. A shadow of dust falls on Harry. The pudgy boy rushes into the kitchen. Harry comes in. Dudley stares at the huge pile of birthday presents. Dudley and his mother get into the car with a big bag of sweets. Uncle Vernon wags his car key in Harry's face. In the Reptile House at the zoo, Dudley stares at the sleeping python. Vernon bangs on the glass. Harry looks at the snake sympathetically. The python lifts its head and winks. It flicks its tongue and nods. It shakes its head. Dudley knocks Harry aside. Suddenly, the glass partition disappears. Dudley tumbles over the rail. He falls headfirst into the pond inside the snake's enclosure. Dudley sits spluttering in the pond, as the snake slithers over the wooden rail and down onto the floor beside Harry. The python raises its head and stares straight at him.",
    "619": "The locker door is plastered with photos and cuttings. She pulls out a folder and some pages fall to the floor as a boy comes by. Juno grins at her friend talking to a fat bearded teacher. In class, Bleeker swallows some Tic Tacs as Juno appears by his side clutching her folders. Another boy stands on the other side of the work table. A second girl turns up. Amanda leaves Josh open-mouthed. Bleeker suppresses a smile. Later, Juno dials a number. She vigorously shakes the phone and something falls out. She frowns at the phone. Juno throws up in a decorative urn. Juno's little sister sprinkles her food. Liberty Bell smiles slowly. Juno plods away past Su-Chin. Juno stops in her tracks. She shrugs and walks on towards the door of the Women Now Center. A punk girl sits in reception playing on her game console. Juno wanders into the lobby and steps up to the counter. Juno nods obediently. Juno takes the questionnaire clipboard to a padded leather bench and sits down. As she starts to fill in the form, she becomes aware of a black woman seated nearby crumbing her fingers against her clipboard. A woman painting her nails, another scratching her arm, another using a nail file add to the crescendo of sound. Juno drops her pen. Su-Chin brightens. They sit on a park bench scouring the paper. Leah hands pipe-smoking Juno an ad. Bleeker is lying on his bed, looking at the photo of Juno in his yearbook. His other hand is clasped around a piece of cloth. Bleeker's solidly built double-chinned mother closes the door of his bedroom. He goes back to gazing at Juno's picture and brings his class pen from behind his head. Scrunched in his fingers, he's holding the knickers she wore and discarded on the day they had sex. At Juno's house, Leah watches apprehensively as Juno paces in front of her dad and her stepmom. Mac and Bren brace themselves. Juno looks them both in the eye. Leah pulls a face. Juno meets her dad's bewildered gaze, then lets her head drop for a second before speaking. Mac shakes his head as she turns on her heels and hightails upstairs with Leah behind her. He runs his hands over his face. A slim young woman arranges some white hydrangeas in a glass vase. White cuffed hands straighten a glass photo frame. She places some aromatic sticks into a bottle. Mac with Juno beside him drives his blue Previa through the gates of the affluent looking Glacial Valley estate. With a ring on the fourth finger of her left hand, she fans out the display of coffee table magazines, straightens two monogram tan towels, and wipes a banister rail as Mac drives past a number of substantial houses set back from the road.",
    "1375": "The crowds are cheering, and people are taking bets as Harry paces nervously. Hermione stands by the tent door, whispering in before entering the tent, where they hug. A bright camera flashes as journalist Rita Skeeter approaches, but she soon leaves as Dumbledore enters. The champions gather around Dumbledore in a circle as Barty holds up a bag. Fleur takes out a little green dragon from the bag, followed by Viktor, Cedric, and finally Harry, who pulls out the dragon. The cannon fires immediately, and Harry sits alone nervously before entering the rocky arena. The crowd cheers his name as he sees the golden egg sitting alone, making a run for it, but a dragon appears, forcing him to retreat behind a rock as it flames him. Harry stumbles and falls around the arena before summoning a broom. He jumps on and flies off, chased by the dragon, which bursts through the crowd, leaving them stunned. Harry flies at high speed around the Hogwarts buildings before getting cut off by the dragon, which whips him off his broom, causing him to land on the roof of Hogwarts, hanging on for dear life. The dragon clambers across the roof, strewing tiles until Harry reaches his broom, jerks it loose, and lets go of the roof just in time before the dragon swipes at him. Falling a long way, Harry regains control and flies to an area with a bridge, flying through a gap as the dragon crashes into it and falls into the water. The crowds are mostly silent until Harry flies towards them, causing the crowd to erupt as he goes straight for the golden egg. Harry lifts the golden egg, surrounded by cheering people, and the Weasley twins have him on their shoulders. Seamus hands Harry the golden egg as Ron appears in the doorway. Harry looks at Cho, but when she looks back, he spills drink from his mouth, leading to laughter. A young boy named Nigel walks up holding a package, gazing at Harry before leaving. Hermione laughs as groans emerge from the boys listening on, while the girls seem more excited. A girl grabs Ron and pulls him up to dance, leading to a wolf whistle from the crowd. Girls instantly stand and walk forward as boys remain seated, with Neville eventually standing. Groups of girls give icy looks and turn their backs as Hagrid and Madame Maxime walk and laugh together, sharing a moment. Viktor Krum trains while a group of girls follows him around, and Severus Snape walks past, slapping Ron over the head.",
    "973": "Inside, he crosses a huge marble lobby striped with shadows, then plods up a dark staircase. Later, he stands before double doors marked Mr. Donaldson. As he goes to knock, the clean-cut Donaldson steps out. They enter a wood-paneled room through a door framed in green marble. The wall suggests an octagonal perimeter. They enter a records archive. They stop by a reference desk. The balding Burdensky opens a volume. On the opened historical pages, the circuit light pathways are unchanging. Meanwhile, David and Elise walk together. As they stroll through a park in the early evening, Elise throws her head back and laughs. Now, in the Adjustment Bureau reading room, Richardson finds Harry studying at one of the large tables. Back in the records room. With David and Elise. He runs. He easily stays ahead, running backward. She gut-punches him and runs ahead. She wins. Now ravers dance under bright flashing lights in a warehouse. David and Elise enter. David waves at partygoers. Elise loosens, then removes it. Later at a table, David swigs from a beer bottle. He shakes a guy's hand. As David and Elise talk, their faces close together, David grins. Elise jumps up and down, pumping her hands around his head. The ravers cheer as David dances with Elise. Later, she hugs him. Now they leave the party. Elise watches him with sorrowful eyes. He twitches a tender smile. He glances away, and Elise gently rests a hand on his jacket lapel. As he gives her a sheepish grin, she reaches up to his face and strokes his cheek. Wrapping an arm around his shoulders, she leans forward and presses her lips to his. David returns the kiss, enveloping Elise in his arms. Later, in Elise's bedroom, David runs his fingers through her hair. She rests her hands on his bare back, and he clasps her face as he kisses her passionately. Now he rolls on top of her in bed, his lips still pressed to hers. As they make love, he grips her hand and their fingers intertwine. David nuzzles Elise's chest. She runs a hand up the back of his neck, and he lifts his head briefly. Later, he spoons her as they sleep, his arm draped over her body. A withdrawing view of them reveals a suited man in a fedora, standing at the foot of the bed. With steely eyes, he watches the couple sleep, then turns away. Sunlight seeps between clouds and fills the sky. Elise sleeps alone in bed, the sheets beside her pushed down and rumpled. She jerks awake. Her startled look becomes relieved, and she touches her fingers to her brow. She notices the vacant spot beside her and sits up.",
    "46": "He stoops to read it. Satisfied, he recovers the foot, then moves to the other end to uncover the head. As the sheet starts to lift, she closes her eyes for a moment, then looks again. She nods. She nods again. GRANDPIERRE moves into the shot. GRANDPIERRE nods as he turns to the unseen attendant. The camera suddenly moves as the 'drawer' is slid back into the wall. Blackness comes with a loud clang and continues while the echo dies. A close shot of a desk drawer from above as it is pulled open reveals a photograph of Charles Lampert lying face up in the drawer. The scene includes GRANDPIERRE sitting behind his desk, and REGGIE sitting across from him, in an office as bare as most policemen's offices. She starts to rummage through her bag, but she pulls a package of nuts out, begins separating the shells with her thumbnail, eating the nuts, and depositing the shells in the ashtray. GRANDPIERRE watches this for an instant. GRANDPIERRE sighs, puts down his pencil, and pushes a button on the desk. He removes a cigar from his desk and inserts it into his mouth, then rips the cigar out of his mouth and slams it back into the drawer, closing it fiercely. The door opens and a policeman enters again, this time carrying a wicker basket, which he deposits on GRANDPIERRE's desk, then leaves. GRANDPIERRE peers into the basket, begins to take the items out, placing them on the desk, identifying each as he does. GRANDPIERRE hands her the letter and watches her closely as she reads it. He slides a sheet of paper and pen across to her, then starts to put the things back into the basket while he speaks. He reaches into the desk drawer, pulls out a passport, which he hands to her; the cover indicates that it is Swiss. REGGIE's hand opens it to a picture of a man—the man seen in GRANDPIERRE's photo. He hands her another passport, the cover is American. He hands her, one at a time, two more passports, his eyes still lowered. The camera pans down to feature his hands—he is methodically trimming his nails with a small clipper. The front door of the chapel is heard opening, and a shaft of daylight streams in. The short, heavy-set figure of a man is outlined against the bright outdoor light. He stands for a moment, then closes the door after him. LEOPOLD GIDEON, short-sighted, bald, in his middle forties, glances around nervously, like a barnyard bird, then walks down one of the side aisles of the chapel as he watches GIDEON, as she watches him, and GIDEON arrives at the coffin.",
    "732": "Rose gulps as she stares at the comb, and Brock kneels beside her before Rose nods. Later, a computer animation shows the Titanic striking an iceberg. Lizzie stands behind her grandmother as Rose climbs out of her wheelchair, and the crew watches her shuffle to a video monitor displaying footage of the Titanic wreck. Rose blinks and inhales sharply as the door with the ornate, leaded glass window comes into view, while in a flashback, two men in tuxedos smile and nod as they open a pair of doors with leaded glass windows. On the video monitor, grayish growth covers the window's ornate scrollwork, and Rose places her hands over her mouth before turning away from the monitor and returning to her wheelchair. Brock switches on a tape recorder as he sits across from Rose and grins, then nods. On a video monitor behind Rose, the corroded Titanic wreck transforms into a gleaming ocean liner moored alongside a dock as passengers walk up one of three gangplanks. Men and women toting suitcases make their way to the Titanic, and a crane loads an antique car onto the ship. Sitting in her father's arms, a young brunette girl watches a fleet of gleaming automobiles arrive, and a chauffeur wearing a tweed uniform and black leather gloves steps out of the driver's seat to open the car's back door. He takes a woman's gloved hand as she steps out of the car, and the brown-haired woman, wearing a white dress with thin black stripes and a large brimmed hat, gazes up at the enormous ship. A black-haired man in a bowler hat and grey suit steps out behind her and hands over money before checking his pocket watch and stepping to Rose and her mother as Rose follows her fiancee, Cal Hockley, through the crowd. A health inspector runs a comb through a man's dark hair and beard as Ruth strides ahead of Rose and Cal up the gangplank. Inside a saloon with a view of the Titanic, men smoke and drink while playing a game of cards. A brown-haired card player turns to a man beside him, and blonde-haired Jack deals Sven another card before exchanging one of his own for a card from the deck. Jack, eyes narrowed, smokes a cigarette as he peers across the table at Sven's partner with several silver coins, a pocketknife, a pocket watch, and a pair of third class tickets for the Titanic in the middle of the table. A black-haired man raps his knuckles on the table as Sven lays down his cards, and Fabrizio snatches the tickets and dances while Jack sweeps up the coins. Olaf grabs Jack's collar, and Jack closes his eyes as Olaf makes a fist but punches Sven instead.",
    "271": "Florence sits reading Dr. Spock's Baby and Child Care in a living room dominated by a large oil portrait of Nathan and Florence, gazing out from the wall over the mantelpiece. From somewhere upstairs, an infant starts to cry, causing Florence to stop reading and look up at the ceiling, while Nathan is oblivious. The baby stops crying, and Florence's attention returns to her book. As he throws out his wrist to look at his watch, a third title is supered beneath the first two: 8:45 p.m. He starts to replace the receiver but brings it back with an afterthought, and as he slams the phone into the cradle the titles disappear. Another baby starts crying, making Florence look up at the ceiling again. A close-up on the crying baby shows Hi bouncing it gently but desperately. The babies sound restless. A floor-level wide-angle shot shows a baby crawling toward the camera in the foreground, while another baby is rounding the open door from the nursery, making a mad dash for freedom in the background. Hi emerges from the nursery, stepping around the background baby and trotting toward the baby in the foreground. By the time he reaches it, the low-angle cropping shows us only his feet and calves, along with the baby and the stairway down to the main floor. He scoops up the baby and hurriedly tiptoes away toward the nursery. The baby is at the nursery door in the foreground with the staircase in the background. As Hi reaches the baby, footsteps are heard climbing the stairs. Hi's free arm scoops the baby up and out of frame just as Florence's head appears, bobbing up as she climbs the stairs. She approaches the nursery, still clutching the Dr. Spock book. As Florence enters from the hallway door, she tracks back into the room and approaches the crib. Halfway there she freezes, staring in shock. ED's POV reveals Hi approaching the car, shrugging and displaying manifestly empty hands. Hi appears at the driver's window, reaching to open the door, but Ed slaps his hand away from the handle. He tries to open the door, which Ed is holding shut with all her might, rolling up the window and locking the door. Through the closed window, a muffled, very forlorn voice can be heard. Florence is holding one of the babies cradled against her shoulder, with the baby peeping out over her shoulder, facing the window, looking. Hi's head appears in the window, looking back as he holds a finger to his lips. Florence starts bouncing the baby, patting it on the back, and Hi and the window bounce up and down.",
    "904": "He pops off his cuffs, pulls out a Tommy gun, and bashes the guard as the officer points his own shotgun through the barred door. A guard quickly opens it, and they barge in just as the escapees force their captives into the room. As the guards strip, Dillinger shakes hands with the older inmate and unlocks the steel door. The stocky escapee faces a guard, and as Dillinger opens the door, the impersonating officer steps outside. Dillinger shuts the door behind him, and outside, Red leaves the metal gate behind and crosses the open ground towards the sedan, glancing back to the lookout turret. Inside, Dillinger waits with his Tommy gun as the gang continues to dress, and one guard faces the stocky inmate who smashes the defiant law man with his pipe. A guard reaches for the younger inmate's gun, and the younger inmate shoots him, capturing the rest of the room's attention. Outside, Red walks backward 20 yards from the gate while inside, the criminals run out, leaving their hostages behind. On the lookout turret, guards take aim as Dillinger crosses through the metal gate, followed by his now partially dressed gang. As the escapees race past him, Dillinger faces the entrance and fires his Tommy gun up at the watch tower. One escapee gets shot despite a barrage of gunfire from Dillinger and his armed cohorts. Walter hurries from the gate, still limping, and his sandy haired accomplice helps him along and fires back at the tower. Inside the turret, a guard goes down. As Walter reaches the getaway car, another guard fires a rifle, and shot in the back, Walter collapses. Standing on the running board, Dillinger grabs his arm as they drive away. His body dragging across the dirt, Walter hangs onto Dillinger's arm, grimacing in pain while Dillinger struggles to keep his grip while holding onto the moving car himself. Walter looks up to his old friend and grins, then his hardened face goes blank. His grip on Dillinger's forearm gives way, and the gang leader lets him go. Walter's body slides to a stop in the dirt as the car drives off, leaving a cloud of dust behind. Dillinger lingers for a moment and climbs into the back of the moving sedan. As the sandy haired escapee shuts the door, Dillinger puts a handgun to Shouse's neck. Red drives, sitting next to the younger escapee, and Dillinger lowers his handgun and punches Shouse in the face a couple of times. He opens the car door and throws him out of the moving vehicle, and Shouse lands on the side of the road, face down in the grass. Dillinger closes the sedan's door and sits back in his seat next to the sandy-haired Pete.",
    "418": "Eddie leaves the car parked at the gas station and heads for the bar. Armstead's is a typical small-town pool hall with a bar, a short order counter, a skee-ball machine, and pool tables for small, friendly games. The few people in Armstead's this day are not playing; they sit and read the papers. Charlie and Eddie are at the bar, drinking straight bourbon. Charlie rises from his barstool, and Eddie is already at the table. Charlie joins Eddie as the game is in mid-progress, and it's Eddie's shot. He downs his bourbon, weaves a bit, bends over the table, and awkwardly pokes at the white cue ball with his stick, missing an easy shot. Several more townspeople have come in from the street and are following the play. The bartender refills the glasses as soon as they are emptied. Two balls lay side by side on the table. Eddie peers at them, trying to figure his shot, blinking his eyes to focus better. Some of the onlookers seem skeptical, but Eddie pats the corner pocket confidently, leans over, and raps out his shot. The ball banks in, and he pounds his pal Charlie on the shoulder and collapses into a nearby chair. Stung, Eddie lies across the table and sets them up himself. They toss their money on the table, and Eddie shoots, but his shot is too hard and his ball leaps over the side of the table. The bartender cannot contain his staccato laughter. Eddie pauses, smiling. Sheepishly, the bartender replaces the balls in their original positions. Eddie chalks up his cue, waiting impatiently for the bartender to return with the money from the cash register. Then he downs his drink and quickly strokes out his shot, the ball banking crisply and directly into the corner pocket. There is a cocky leer on his face as he reaches for the dollar bills. The door of the Packard coupe slams shut. Eddie Felson holds up his stuffed billfold for his pal, Charlie Burns, to see. He tosses it on the seat beside him and turns on the ignition. Henry nods, then steps up on a stool to fix the minute hand of the clock. It now stands at ten o'clock. It is twelve-thirty when Eddie Felson and Charlie Burns first enter into Ames. Only one table is in use; the hall is empty. In Eddie's hand is his leather cue case. They stand before the swinging doors and look around. They saunter over to the cashier's cage. A sign on the brass bar reads NO GAMBLING ALLOWED. Eddie's arrival is noted by Big John and Preacher, a gambler and an addict, who hang out at Ames at all hours, waiting for action.",
    "393": "The Dude is looking around at the '60s modern decor. He hands him the drink and taps his forehead with one finger. Treehorn waves this off. He is getting to his feet but sways woozily. He is joined on either side by Woo and the blond man, all three men looking grimly down at the Dude. He tips forward, spilling his drink off the table. He squints at Jackie Treehorn, who swims in and out of focus. Tied the room together. Looking up at the Dude as his face hits the glass and squishes. The title logo is a suggestively upright bowling pin flanked by a pair of bowling balls. The Dude's face is washed with a brilliant light as the corridor opens onto a gleaming bowling alley. In the center of the alley stands Maude Lebowski, singing operatic harmony to the Kenny Rogers song. She wears an armored breastplate and Norse headgear, has braided pigtails, and holds a trident. The Dude stands behind her and, pressed up against her, helps her with her follow-through as she releases a bowling ball. The lane is straddled by a line of chorines in spangly mini-skirts, their arms akimbo, Busby-Berkley style, their legs turning the lane into a tunnel leading to the pins at the end. But it is no longer a bowling ball rolling between their legs--it is the Dude himself, levitating inches off the lane, the tools from his utility belt swinging free. He is face down, his arms, torpedo-like, pressed against his sides. The Dude twists his body around, performing a barrel-roll so that he is now gliding along the lane face-up. Now his point of view looks up the dresses of the passing chorines. The Dude smiles dreamily and does a backstroke motion so that he is once again gliding face-down. He looks forward and his forward momentum blows back his hair. Coming at us, as we go through the last few pairs of legs, are the approaching pins. We hit the pins, scattering them, and rush on into black. A body drops down into the blackness in slow motion--a topless woman, squealing, her legs kicking. As she drops out of frame, leaving blackness again, three men are entering from the background, emerging into a pool of light. It is the Germans, advancing ominously, wielding oversized shears which they menacingly scissor. The Dude, now standing in a field of black, reacts to the advancing Germans. He turns and runs, fists pumping. The field of black is punctured by headlights. The Dude is running blearily down the middle of the Pacific Coast Highway. Cars rush by on either side, horns blaring. With the BLOO-WHUP of a short siren blast, a squad car with flashing gumballs pulls up.",
    "281": "Her head rests on the cushion at the far end, and she instinctively falls into an attractive pose. Jeff moves his eyes slightly to something outside the window. She is reading a book held in one hand while eating a sandwich in another. Miss Torso is lying, face down, on her divan bed. The only light in the apartment is from a reading lamp. Her back is bare, and all she wears is a pair of brief dark blue shorts. At one point, she lifts her torso up slightly to brush crumbs out from beneath her. Lisa leans forward and looks out the window to see what Jeff is referring to. She turns back to him with a blank stare. Jeff turns and looks at her, quite unaware of her surprise at his comment. He looks away from Miss Torso, thoughtfully. Lisa sits bolt upright on the divan. She reaches back quickly and pulls on the overhead light. He is beginning his song again, and it has taken on new fullness and melody. At that moment, the songwriter returns to his composing. Although it is not complete, it is farther along than before, and he plays his theme a number of different ways, trying to move it note by note to its completion. Lisa just stares at Jeff for a moment. We can see him over Lisa's shoulder. Jeff is staring out of the window again. Over this, we hear Lisa's voice. Jeff puts out a restraining hand. At last, the salesman is seen coming along the corridor. Slung over one shoulder, with his arm through it, is a large coil of sturdy rope. He goes through the living room into the bedroom. Jeff reaches quickly for his binoculars, and trains them on the salesman's apartment. Lisa, still stretched out on the divan looking at Jeff, suddenly sits upright and then, getting up from the divan, moves over to Jeff, the camera going with her. In a sudden surprise move, she swings his chair completely around so that his back is to the window. He drops the binoculars into his lap in surprise. The camera moves in as Lisa leans over Jeff, gripping both sides of his chair. Jeff tries to turn around, but she won't let the chair move. She turns the wheelchair slightly to her left so that he can see the newlyweds' apartment. A dim light burning behind them. The drawn shades of the newlyweds' apartment. Jeff looks, turns back to her, trying to suppress a chuckle. She is still staring out the window as the scene. We see that his left hand rests on the telephone receiver which is close to him. Jeff is seated in the dark, his face lit by the faint glow from the distant street.",
    "136": "The others laugh; Nehru suffers. Nehru has half risen in his seat to address Charlie Andrews, who, walking from one somnolent building to another, has stopped dead at the sight of the car. He looks around the ashram a little dismally. Gandhi sits under a tree, peeling potatoes. Nehru and his friends are sprawled out around him. Beside them, the river; in the background the business of the ashram goes on. His smile is sardonic, but genuine, theirs embarrassed and self-conscious. Gandhi has finished the last potato. He glances at Nehru then drops the potato in the bowl. He lifts the pail of peelings to Nehru. Nehru in his fine linen suit takes the pail awkwardly. His friends watch with amusement, but they too rise to follow as they head for the kitchen. He re-directs Nehru toward a trough where two or three goats are tethered, but he keeps right on talking. They have reached the trough. He meets Nehru's gaze, and for a moment something deeper than argument passes between them. Then something catches Gandhi's eye. He looks off. Ba stands, watching him, waiting. Gandhi turns. The goat is reaching for his bowl of potatoes. He pushes it away and starts for the kitchen. Nehru grins, captured by Gandhi's seriousness, and his humor. He hasn't moved, and neither have his friends. They watch Gandhi as he carries his bowl of potatoes to Ba. Gandhi plods on toward the kitchen, carrying the bowl of potatoes. Clothes are dipped in the brownish water. Ba and an ashramite woman squat by the river, washing clothes. It is long past the monsoons and they have had to come far out in the riverbed to the water. But they are laughing at their task. Gandhi sits cross-legged, watching solemnly as Shukla reaches with his fingers into a bowl to eat. The fingers are thin, half-starved, like the man himself. He looks up at Gandhi almost sheepishly. Ba sits at one side in the shadows watching him as intently as Gandhi. His voice is choked and near to tears, resonant with the unspoken agony his words mean for him and the others like him. He looks at Gandhi nervously for a moment, then puts the food to his mouth like a man who is starving, and trying desperately not to show it. The solemn intensity of her gaze reflects her identification with the man's agony. She glances up at Gandhi. The camera is low, shooting along the track toward the light of an approaching train. From its distant glow we can see that people line the platform of the small station, waiting, but we cannot tell how thick the crowd may be. The station house.",
    "894": "The older newcomer takes a seat as Purvis approaches. Horses barrel down a racetrack, jockeys crouched on their backs, while an announcer watches from a tower and onlookers crowd the rails. Among them, Billie grins, Dillinger beside her. In cheers, the horses race shoulder to shoulder. Later, outside the racetrack, Nitti and D'Andrea sit by a patio table by a grassy crowd as Nitti summons a breath, squinting in the sunlight. D'Andrea waves at Dillinger across the crowd and glances around. Later, Dillinger plumps into a chair in the grandstand with Billie sitting beside him. One row down, Pete leans closer and Homer listens too. Homer speaks up, and Dillinger faces his girlfriend, who glares at him and then drops her gaze. D'Andrea joins him and leaves, while Billie stares off. Dillinger frowns, shifts in his seat, and squarely faces Billie as she hangs her head. Billie allows a thoughtful smile, leans forward, cups the back of Dillinger's head in her hand, and presses her lips to his. He pulls away, gazes into her eyes, and kisses her again as spectators stand and cheer on the race. Now in a town, a brambly bush grows by a biro cactus and a healthy saguaro as Billie and Dillinger enter the lobby and stroll toward the front desk. A balding clerk faces them, hands Dillinger a pen, and the gang leader signs a guest register. Dillinger picks up a suitcase and heads off with Billie to a hotel room, where he opens the suitcase, takes out his Tommy gun, and cocks it. Later, he opens a window and pulls the sheer curtains closed. The gang leader takes off his suit coat and handgun, ambles to a set of closed double doors, and pushes one open to peek into a bathroom where Billie sits nude in the tub. As he opens the door all the way, she seductively slides her hands up the porcelain out of the water, then lifts one shapely leg and caresses the tub's rim with her foot, running her toes along a soap dish. As Johnny turns back to the bedroom, the door bursts open and the balding man from the front desk leads other men in, clouding Dillinger with the butt of a rifle. As another lawman handcuffs him, Billie runs out wearing a towel. Later, the lawmen lead Dillinger into a jail as more officers escort Pete and the heavyset bank robber. Pete struggles as his captors lead him away from his boss. A lawman shuts a door, showing an isolated cellblock. Inside, the officers lock Dillinger inside a holding cell and remove his handcuffs through the bars. Wearing cowboy hats, the officers head out, while Dillinger massages his wrists, gazing off. He paces forward and leans tensely on a rail attaching the cell bars one to the next.",
    "1070": "As the boys run pell-mell into the water, the Japanese soldiers advance past the Mission buildings. The refugees pick their way through the ruins of the Mission's wooden jetty as the Japanese search the buildings on the beach. Magarri runs through the shallows with his rifle, and the boys move out beyond the end of the burning jetty and start to swim, using a piece of driftwood as a float. The Japanese run down to the beach, following footprints. Magarri loads and hides behind one of the wharf's supports, gasping in fear as the soldiers approach, and takes aim. Drover and the boys arrive at the boat, climbing the ladder while soldiers fire at Magarri, who shoots back. As Magarri reloads, he looks across at Drover and the boys climbing onto the boat, then looks round at the soldiers getting closer. He drops his rifle and sprints up the beach to distract the Japanese. Drover gasps as Magarri, hit in the back, falls to the sand, and he and the boys stare helplessly as the soldiers run up to the wounded man. The soldiers raise their rifles and an officer cocks his pistol. Magarri looks towards the boat as Drover and the boys watch the soldiers move away from the body. The sail is raised and Ivan gets slowly to his feet. Flames roar into the air, and King George, watching the soldiers work in the ruin, rubs dye into his cheeks. The soldiers move slowly through the flaming, smoking ruins of Darwin as hoses spray water on the fires. Captain Dutton gets out of the truck, and in her wrecked room over the pub, Sarah looks at a photograph of her, Nullah, and Drover, before looking tearfully down at Dutton issuing orders on the wharf, his eyes filling with tears of self-pity. Bomb ships burn in the bay, and Dutton comes up to Sarah's room, where tears roll down her cheeks with her eyes closed. The boys' boat sails into Darwin as men clamber into trucks, ready to evacuate south. The small boat sails past a huge burning ship, while Sarah tearfully watches the evacuation. A black soldier stands stripped to the waist, watching the trucks. Sarah looks at the ruins of the Territory Hotel and sighs. As she climbs into the truck, the small boat sails into view by the wharf. King George is up on the wreck of the Carney Cattle Company water tower as Nullah reaches into his pocket and pulls out Flynn's harmonica. Sarah hesitates by the truck, listening, and shocked, she turns to Dutton. Drover strokes the lad's hair as he plays, while the priest conducts the choir. Drover stands at the stern of the boat.",
    "267": "As she runs for the back door and pushes through it, and as he slaloms through the wildly scattering hayseeds, Lenny bursts out. With a whipcrack effect, he looks left, then right, and jerks the bike right to where an alleyway flanks the side of the bank. Ed is running up the alley toward the front of the bank as Lenny enters, and he roars after her, roaring down the alley as the bike approaches behind her. Closing on Ed as she reaches the mouth of the alley, a plank swings into frame straight at the camera, matching action as Hi finishes swinging the plank into Lenny's face. Lenny hits the ground hard as his bike spins out from under him, riderless, twisting crazily into the street where it collapses. Lenny is rising to his feet beyond them as Hi nods encouragement to Ed, and Lenny is reaching back to throw his knife. Hi, unaware, is turning to face him, presenting the plank as the knife is thrown, and it thunks into the plank, piercing it through. Hi backs up, swinging the knife-studded plank to make Lenny keep his distance as he reaches up to unhook a chain from a ring on his vest shoulder, and the free chain drops down into his palm. Swinging the chain, WHOOSH WHOOSH, at the backpedaling Hi, the chain snakes around it and rips it out of Hi's hands. Grabbing Hi by the shirtfront, Lenny swings down and brass knuckles appear on it, as Lenny's fist swings into frame to club him forehand, then backhand. An uppercut from his heels sends Hi sprawling back as Hi lands against it, banging his head, and he sinks to the ground. Lenny is casually walking toward him, lighting a cheroot, as Hi flops over onto his stomach and starts wriggling under the car. Hi's face in the foreground as he desperately seeks escape, behind him we can see Lenny casually reaching down and grabbing an ankle. The shot is framed identically to the shot in the Arizona nursery where Hi pulled a baby from under the crib, and Lenny pulls. Hi is dragged away from the camera and out from under the car, struggling to stand up. Lenny wraps his arms around him and applies a tremendous bear hug, crushed against Lenny, his hands paw futilely at Lenny's chest. Lenny finally flings Hi away, landing in the dust, all the fight beaten out of him, tired of the fight: he saws out both shotguns. On the guns as Lenny's thumbs draw them back, he raises the guns to fire, the end of the road, he wearily lifts a hand, defensively extending it in front of him, then stops, staring at.",
    "353": "Some men are backing away, losing their nerve, while Aragorn gallops in front of his army, fixing each of his men with his eyes. Aragorn holds Andúril aloft. Meanwhile, Frodo and Sam are climbing the face of Mount Doom, where the landscape is violent, red heat hisses out of fissures, the jagged rock is razor sharp, and ash blankets the land. Red lightning forks across the sky with a deafening crack. Close on Frodo and Sam's feet dragging across the ash, their parched lips, and sweating, dusty faces. Frodo trips and falls face-first into the dust, with Sam dropping beside him. Aragorn's army is surrounded by 300,000 Orcs poised to attack. Frodo slowly lifts his head and looks up, straight up the steep slopes of Mount Doom, a huge mass of ash, slag, and burned stone. Frodo begins to crawl on his hands and knees, hauling himself a few pitiful feet before slumping in the ash. Gimli surveys the army of Mordor and looks up into the eyes of Legolas, with whom he has shared much, and the gruff dwarf smiles quietly. Sam crawls to Frodo, who lies slumped against the rock-face, and turns him over, holding him in his arms. Frodo shuts his eyes, his breath coming in gasps, as Sam looks at him with grim determination. Sam lifts Frodo onto his shoulders and starts to climb Mount Doom, his hobbit-face growing stern, almost grim, with determination. The two tiny hobbits struggle on the endless shale slopes. Aragorn and company watch as they are surrounded by a tide of Orcs. Aragorn raises Andúril in a broad sweep as he walks forward, turning to face the others with quiet resolve written on his face, looking into the eyes of the remaining members of the Fellowship. Aragorn turns, sword-raised, and charges forward; a moment of silence follows, with no one else moving. Suddenly, a shout goes up, and angle on Pippin and Merry charging forward with the rest of the men following. Aragorn crashes head-on into a line of Orcs, the blade of Andúril flashing as he hacks at them. Like a small grey insect, Sam creeps up the slope with Frodo on his back, foot by foot, as the mantling cloud swirls, revealing the cruel pinnacles and iron crown of Barad-dûr, the Dark Tower, in the distance. Sam staggers under Frodo's weight as strong ash-laden winds buffet him while he slowly climbs Mount Doom, with the plain of Gorgoroth lying 1000 feet below, wrapped in fume and shadow. A tremor ripples through the ground, and a red flame explodes into the sky, causing Sam to look up, fearful the mountain could explode at any moment. Through the thick, fume-laden air, a set of stairs can be made out.",
    "1188": "A tiny, silvery breath floats back into Sirius' mouth, and his chest heaves as he gives a great sigh. The light draws back across the lake while Harry watches the bright light fade away, leaving only the faint image of a figure standing on the far shore. He falls back beside his godfather, and they lie next to each other, sprawled unconscious on the stony beach. In the hospital wing, he pats Ron's bandaged leg and walks to the door. Hermione is wearing a long chain necklace, and she puts it around Harry's neck as well and spins its golden pendant. The room is filled with people moving backwards very fast, and she replaces the necklace. The wheels of the great clock turn as they cross the quadrangle below and run along the cloister. She shows him the pendant, and they hide. Harry and Hermione creep out from their hiding place, and Harry looks around nervously as they run towards a huge stone. Standing behind it, they look down the hill and watch themselves running along the path below towards Hagrid's cottage and the pumpkin patch. Harry and Hermione hurry down the path and hide behind the pile of pumpkins as Dumbledore, Fudge, and the Executioner arrive. She pulls him back out of sight when Hermione sees a pebble lying on the pumpkin in front of her and throws it through the window, then throws another as Harry rubs his head. Dumbledore knocks at the front door, and as the three men go inside, the back door opens. Quickly, they run into the forest and observe themselves and Ron leave the cottage and hide behind the pumpkins. Pushing aside a branch, Hermione stares at herself in the past, and the branch springs back. Hermione and Harry watch themselves and Ron run back up the hill, then they creep back into the garden and peer towards the cottage. Crows peck at Harry's feet as he steals across the garden, and Harry bows to Buckbeak, who lowers his head in return. Harry stretches towards the post where Buckbeak is chained, and a crow pecks his hand as he undoes the chain. Buckbeak won't move, so Harry hauls on the chain. Hermione throws the ferret, and Buckbeak follows them into the forest. Fudge turns as the Executioner raises his axe and splits a pumpkin in frustration. Harry and Hermione use the dead ferrets to lure Buckbeak deeper and deeper into the safety of the forest. Leaving the hippogriff in a clearing, they run out of the trees until they see the Whomping Willow in the distance, flailing its branches. Lupin points his wand, and the tree falls still before he goes down under the roots. Snape follows Lupin, and they sit down beside each other on the grass. As darkness falls, a swarm of bats flutters through the forest.",
    "350": "The Mumakil react with terror as spectral warriors climb up their sides, routing the Haradrim from their war-towers, and orcs flee in their thousands. The army of the dead swarms over the city, routing the orcs. Eowyn crawls to where Theoden lays, mortally wounded. Theoden looks up at Eowyn, his breathing shallow and his vision clouded. Eowyn smiles down at him as she gently strokes his face. Theoden is dying. The army of the dead slowly dissolves into dust and is immediately swept away by the four winds. Aragorn turns to Gandalf, who bows his head in homage. Pippin, in his Gondorian armor, looks around at the devastation, his eyes full of sadness. They suddenly fix on something, and Pippin runs through the ruin of the battle towards a small figure slumped on the ground. Merry stares unseeing at Pippin, horror and shock erasing all other memories from Merry's mind. Tears fall down Pippin's face as he looks on his friend. Pippin covers Merry with a blanket. The camera rises towards the dark orc tower of Cirith Ungol, and a light glows from the topmost window. The camera reaches the tower, dissolving through the wall into a small cold room. Frodo Baggins is unconscious on the floor. His eyes suddenly flicker, and he wakes up. Tilt up to reveal the orc and Uruk-hai, Gorbag and Shagrat, arguing over Frodo's belongings and clothes. Gorbag is snatching for the mithril vest. Frodo realizes that he has been stripped down to his underwear. He clutches at his throat; the ring has gone. Gorbag grabs for the mithril vest and draws his sword, but Shagrat kicks him backwards with his foot. Gorbag falls through a trap door leading to the floor below. Gorbag lands in the guard room with a crash, creating sudden alarm amongst the orcs and Uruk-hai stationed there. Shagrat leans through the trap door. Several Uruk-hai converge on Gorbag, and he lashes out, slashing one across the throat with his sword. The dead Uruk-hai topples backward over the parapet, landing on top of Uruk-hai and orcs in the courtyard below. Within moments, a brutal civil war breaks out between the two companies stationed in Cirith Ungol. Sam hurries towards the gate, fearful for Frodo. Sam is confronted with the sight of over 50 slaughtered orc and Uruk-hai, strewn over the courtyard. Angle on: Sam pounds up the staircase. He suddenly pauses. Several Uruk-hai are running down towards him. He grips Sting and continues charging up, screaming at the top of his lungs. Angle on: the four Uruks. They see a huge distorted shadow on the wall in front of them. They turn around and flee in terror back to the top of the stairs. Sam appears, and before the Uruk-hai can fully regain their wits, he slays three.",
    "1251": "She puts them down and is surprised to see Miranda sitting on the couch with her glasses in her hand, just staring into space. She's wearing a dressing gown and has no makeup on. Miranda has her hand held out for them. Andy holds out a folder, which Miranda ungraciously accepts. Andy's taken aback. Andy glances down at the papers in her lap, and then looks across at Miranda with sympathy. Miranda hands back the seating chart. Back in her own suite, Andy has changed into a slim-fitting low cut black suit. She studies her reflection in a big mirror and touches up the mascara on her long, black lashes. Nigel comes in and studies the outfit she's wearing. They raise their glasses. Andy and Christian in an elegant restaurant. After dinner, they stroll near the Notredam Cathedral. She swings around a lamppost. Christian kisses her. He kisses her again and again. She kisses him back, wrapping her arm around his neck. They are surrounded by bare trees adorned with fairy lights. There's a view of the Eiffel Tower from Christian's hotel bedroom window. Andy wakes up in his bed alone, and puts her hand to her head with a grimace. She rolls over and consults her watch on the bedside table. Pulled on her clothes and is hopping around about trying to put her shoes on. Andy goes to grab her jacket and knocks over Christian's bag. Christian comes out of the bathroom in a towel. Andy grabs her stuff and goes. Walking along a modern bridge over the sand, she calls Miranda's suite. Andy gets back to the hotel and pauses before knocking on Miranda's door. Miranda and Irv shut the door in her face. She's changed into a black dress with a scoop neck, a full skirt with petticoats, and wears black gloves and a silver necklace. At the event, she paces the hallway. Nigel steps down from the podium. Miranda makes her way over from the table she's been sitting at. They had gathered in a plush banqueting suite with chandeliers hanging from the ceiling. Andy spies Christian sitting with Jacqueline. Miranda kisses Nigel before taking her place. James gets up and salutes his fans. Andy and Nigel smile over at him. Nigel's excited smile fades and he looks up at Miranda crestfallen. Pretty Jacqueline beams delightedly. Nigel puts on a brave face and applauds her. Jacqueline stands. Andy looks over at Miranda incredulously. Up on the podium, Miranda smiles and applauds Jacqueline as Irv eyes her coolly. Andy glances over at Christian, who looks stunned. James preens himself smugly. Nigel fidgets in his seat.

    "687": "Octavius lies face down on the operating table, a bandage over his eyes. He spins around, and one of the limbs knocks him through a glass door. The other three break free and start moving; one grabs a woman by the leg, and a male medic is thrown across the operating room. Another limb smashes through a table, clamps onto a man's face, and tosses him across the room, while a man is smashed into a lamp and electrocuted. The nurse is dragged along the floor by the leg, and her fingernails cut grooves in the floor. A man is grabbed by the throat and slammed against the table, spotting a chainsaw as another medic is rammed into a wall. The doctor by the chainsaw reaches for it but is pushed to the floor, and the chainsaw pulls down weakly. He tries in vain to cut into the limb that's pinning him to the wall, as the other three limbs sense danger and move towards him, viewing with inbuilt cameras. The mechanical limbs move in for the kill, and the chainsaw drops to the floor on the end of the man's limbed arm. Octavius lifts his head, and using its small pincer, one of the mechanical limbs gently pulls the bandage from his eyes. Octavius opens his eyes and looks about him wearily, alarm spreading over his face as he kneels up on the operating table, the limbs rising with him. He tips back his head, and later, doors fly off the hinges. A yellow cab speeds towards him, then skids to a halt. Octavius cringes, then seems surprised when mechanical limbs lift the cab up and through the air; it lands on another yellow taxi. Viewed through the fractured windscreen of the cab, two of the limbs move up to Octavius' face, and they detect a siren, prompting Octavius to slip away. Later, with the long mechanical limbs acting as legs, Octavius is carried onto a bridge tower. The pincers spot a ramshackle pier and a derelict warehouse way below, and Octavius peers down at it. On a sunny day in his office, Jameson addresses bulky Robbie, surprised and shooing Peter away. Octavius is in the warehouse on the dilapidated pier, staring down through gaping holes in the floor as the mechanical limbs move slowly about him like mythical serpents. He looks at the reptilian limbs in desperation and stares forlornly into the water. Two of the limbs open their pincers aggressively, and all four mechanical limbs hover with their pincers open. His face strained, eyes widening, he reaches behind his head, spins back around, and the pincers near his face and move as if talking. Troubled, Octavius closes his eyes and stares hard at the floor.",
    "965": "He makes a left turn and pounds through a puddle. At the Adjustment Bureau, an aide hurries up to Thompson. At the courthouse, Adrian greets Elise with a hug. As she steps by, he gazes after her. Meanwhile, David sprints through the downpour reaching the targeted blue door. He ports through and finds himself at a service counter at the New York DMV. A bewildered customer peers at the rainy street left exposed in the open doorway. David races out a lobby door. At the Bureau, Thompson and aides cross a room stocked with hats. Thompson halts, glances at his aides plan book, and rushes off. In the rain, a sprinting David holds a hand out to traffic. He dashes across the street and climbs the courthouse steps two at a time. In the lobby, he crashes into a bystander knocking him down. His hat comes off and a guard approaches. He grabs the hat. Adrian addresses Elise's friend. On her way out, she passes a gaunt stranger in a fedora. A bailiff signals him to take it off, and he does. In the lobby, he races to a metal detector, and wrenches off his jacket and empties his pockets. He slides it along the table as he darts through the checkpoint. Leaving his other belongings, he halts under a rotundas decorated ceiling. Later he runs up a spiral stairwell. Now as Thompson meets his team in the rotunda, David races past Elise's friend outside the courtroom. He bursts into the Ladies Room. She stares at him. The gaunt bureau officer enters. David coldcocks him. He picks up the officer's plan book, and shows it to Elise. An aide with Thompson consults his book. In the warehouse officers, clad from head to toe in black, get into SUVs. Meanwhile in the Adjustment Bureau. In the courthouse Ladies Room David braces a mop handle behind a radiator barring the door. He checks its sturdiness, then checks the deadbolt. Crossing to her, he puts on the fedora. David opens the closet door and ports them onto Yankee Stadium's grassy outfield. Elise gapes at the abrupt change and setting. David rushes her to a padded doorway in the playing field wall. It ports to a stairway. Climbing it, the couple find themselves in Manhattan's business district. Back in the courthouse Ladies Room, a bureau officer kicks in the door. Thompson and his team enter glancing briefly at their unconscious colleague. Meanwhile, David and Elise race hand in hand down the bustling city street. In the Ladies Room, Thompson notes the plan room lying open on the sink counter. His aide consults his own book. With David, she shakes her head. She nods. Now Thompson and his aide emerge from the underground stairway and arrive in the business district.",
    "518": "She, too, is deep in thought and she stops at the edge of the wharf; the camera continues to move, to a group of wooden pilings nearby, lapped by the water. The piano piece ends and the film is quiet. The quiet continues as the film cuts to a close-up of a large, circular CAT-scan module in an antiseptic hospital room. A slowly moving stretcher, bearing Mickey's strapped prone body, begins to enter the round opening of the module. As the camera pulls back from Mickey, his taped head under the scan, two technicians can be seen through the window separating the scanner from the control room. One of them, sitting down, taps information into a computer while the other technician stands nearby, looking from Mickey to the computer screen. The movie then cuts briefly to the computer screen, showing an image of Mickey's skull. Scan lines bleep over the skull. The camera moves up from the screen to reveal Mickey once again, as seen through the window, silent and serious under the CAT-scan module. From Mickey's prone form, the film moves to the two technicians, as seen through the window in the scanner room. They examine the computer screen and talk indistinctly to each other. One of the men, nodding, taps more information into the computer. While they're studying the CAT-scan picture, the camera cuts to a back view of Mickey under the module. There is a science-fiction feel to this scene, as if Mickey is lying in the center of a huge, white, futuristic circle. The stretcher, bearing Mickey, slowly moves out of the module. Dr. Brooks, holding Mickey's X-rays, walks past a row of bookshelves to his light panel. He props up the X-rays. Dr. Brooks turns to an offscreen Mickey. The film quickly cuts to a close-up of Mickey's face, reacting in total despair. He closes his eyes; he covers his face with his hand. Once again, Mickey is seen leaving the building, but this time he bounds down the steps, jumping for joy. He runs swirling down the street, clapping his hands, happy with relief. Several cars pass as Mickey joyfully runs. Suddenly he stops, his hand to his mouth, reflecting. Gail sits in a chair in front of a bookshelf. Mickey, standing behind his desk, his back to the camera, his coat still on, looks out at the Manhattan skyline. Gail gets up from her chair. She walks past Mickey to a nearby cabinet. She opens a drawer, rummaging around for something. The camera follows her, leaving Mickey briefly. As Mickey continues to talk offscreen, Gail closes the cabinet drawer and walks to a file cabinet behind Mickey's desk. Gail opens the file cabinet and takes out a pack of gum.",

They tear down a road on the scooter, with Carl sitting behind the woman, Allison, wearing a helmet and clinging onto her. They weave in and out of the other traffic as she speeds up, overtaking two vehicles. Allison holds up her camera to take a picture while she veers across the road onto the wrong side. Oncoming cars swerve as they head up a tree-lined hill, and in the park by Carl's car, he pours petrol into his car and breaks into a smile as he hands back the camera to her. He gazes at her feigning surprise as she, wearing the helmet, marches over to him, presses herself against him, and kisses him hard on the lips. She draws back, leaving him dumbfounded as he gazes at her getting back onto her scooter. She drives off with a smile, and his eyes follow her as she goes. He turns back slowly, smiling to himself, then looks down at holding the Polaroid of them on the scooter in his hand. He scrutinizes the photo, nods and smiles, and his eyes dart around nervously. He puts the petrol cap back on, smiles, nods, and checks out the photo of him and Allison as Norman punches the air and smiles wistfully. Later, Carl sits in front of his computer at the bank as three guys stare at him. He clicks to enlarge another pop-up, and a corpulent woman heads over, gawking at him before beaming. Carl stamps the form with an approved stamp as a slice has been cut from the cake, and he high-fives Norman, forcing a grin. At the Bigfoot Lodge, Carl, Peter, and Rooney sit in a booth, and Carl glances at Rooney as they slam down shot glasses. Carl spits out a lime, snorts Tabasco sauce off his hand, grimaces, slams his fists on the table, and knocks over all the glasses. He plays on an arcade dance game, where the figure and arrows on the screen show him which moves to execute as he stands on a platform with arrows to the right, left, back, and front, moving his feet to the correct place to the beat. A crowd gathers to watch as he moves quickly, hopping about and spinning around, achieving a perfect score. Peter and Rooney smile and cheer as he moves nimbly, twirls with his leg out, making people duck out of the way, and finally collapses backward, where Peter and Rooney catch him. Carl snogs someone as a big burly guy approaches, and Rooney frowns. Outside, Carl is down as he crashes into a bin.",
    "1116": "Vernon lands flat on his back in a bush. He scrambles to his feet and stares angrily after the car as it disappears into the night sky. From the back seat, Ron smiles at his friend. The suburbs are left far behind. As day breaks, the car reaches open countryside. It sweeps down over green fields and trees towards a ramshackle house beside a lake. The car touches down on a narrow sandy track and bumps along it past an outhouse. Two pale pink pigs look up curiously from their sty. Harry's eyes are wide with amazement. The three brothers unlock the door and creep stealthily into the house. Harry looks around the kitchen with delight. A pan scrubber cleans a frying pan which holds itself under a running tap. Ron grabs a bun. Next to an armchair, a pair of needles hang in mid-air knitting a multi-colored garment. A young girl appears. Embarrassed, the girl disappears upstairs. Mr. Weasley joins them at the table. An old grey owl flaps wearily towards the house and hits the window. Percy takes an envelope from the owl's beak. Beside the fireplace, wearing his school cloak, Ron steps into the fireplace and takes a handful of powder. Ron disappears in a flash of green flames. Harry steps forward nervously. Harry takes a handful of powder. Standing in the fireplace, Harry takes a deep breath. Harry disappears in a flash of green flames. Mrs. Weasley looks confused. Harry shoots out of the fireplace onto a dusty wooden floor. He is streaked with soot and ash. He picks up his glasses and puts them on. One of the lenses is broken. He gets up slowly and looks around the gloomy shop, at the glass cabinets covered in cobwebs. They are all piled high with shrunken heads and skulls of all shapes and sizes. Cautiously, he moves towards a shelf and taps idly on a glass dome. Beside it, a skeletal hand with bony black fingers is mounted on a piece of marble. Harry puts his fingers around the bony thumb. The hand suddenly closes, clutching him tightly. He struggles desperately to free himself from its ghastly grip. The hand releases him, and he hurries across the shop towards the open door which leads out into the alley. Outside, he finds himself in a damp, dingy passageway. He passes a suspicious-looking man lurking in the shadows. Suddenly, a sharp-faced witch with a pointed hat grabs him by the arm. He is surrounded. He is terrified. Harry runs towards Hagrid, a giant with bushy hair and a huge black beard. In Diagon Alley, a girl with long wavy hair comes out of a shop and spots them.",
    "539": "Two Boy Scouts climb up the rocky base of the cliff and head down the passageway. As it gets dark, the temperature drops several degrees, and the light of kerosene lanterns dances on the tunnel walls ahead. The boys approach cautiously, careful to stay hidden, and see four men digging with shovels and pick-axes, with the fourth man wearing a leather waist jacket and a brown felt fedora hat. Roscoe rushes forward and gives Fedora the box, who steps toward a lantern resting on a rock and puts the box next to the lantern. Halfbreed pushes Roscoe, who jumps with excitement, while Rough Rider steps forward to look at the box as Fedora opens it and takes a bejeweled cross from the box, holding it aloft. Fedora's comrades practically salivate at the sight of it. Indy takes off his hat, looks down at the off-screen action, and continues to admire the cross before placing it on the rock next to its box and the lantern. Indy turns back to observe the men with a look of resolve, then turns back toward Herman, but watches in wide-eyed horror as a snake slithers across his lap. Indy matter-of-factly picks up the snake and tosses it aside, causing Herman to gasp. Indy grabs Herman's scout scarf, pulls him closer, releases the scarf, gives Herman a pat, and Herman dashes off. Indy sees the cross on the rock next to the lantern, and as the robbers continue to search for additional valuables, he works his way unseen within arm's reach of the cross. With Fedora looking over at the men digging, Indy picks up the cross, puts it in his pants, and begins to pull himself up a rope hanging nearby. As he climbs, Indy's feet break a wooden beam, attracting the men's attention, and the three robbers are so eager to get their hands on Indy that they almost knock each other over. Only Fedora is unperturbed; he casts a disgusted glance in the direction of his fleeing companions and sets off after Indy. Indy emerges from the darkness of the Pueblo into the brightness of day, hears running footsteps behind him, and dashes off. Rough Rider, Halfbreed, and Roscoe quickly appear and run after him. Indy jumps from one rock to another, where the scout troop horses are below, puts two fingers in his mouth, and whistles for his horse, who trots over. Indy puts the cross in his belt, prepares to jump, and then jumps into the saddle.",
    "569": "The elevator doors slide open on Men in Black headquarters. One of the Worm Aliens answers him in their native tongue and points to the counter. Edwards just stares, fascinated, but Kay grabs him by the arm and hurries him along. Inside, there are piles of sophisticated-looking devices stacked on shelves and tabletops. Edwards picks up a small yellow ball from one of the shelves. They leave the room. On the main floor, they walk briskly across the room, reaching a giant screen on the far wall. The screen displays a map of the world on which thousands of tiny lights blink in all parts of the globe, log lines of data flashing next to them. On the screens, we see live images of aliens. Bony fingers. Edwards, stunned, looks at Kay as 4-Eyes boots her onto the screen: Mean face, cat glasses. Zed, who was standing up close to the screen, walks over to Edwards, sizing him up. Zed's voice comes over. Edwards reaches out and opens a white locker, revealing a black suit hung from a hanger in the middle. On the bottom, a pair of shiny black shoes. Kay is at a computer terminal. On screen are Edwards's birth certificate, driver's license, social security card, library card, everything. Zed's voice continues. Edwards stands in a cramped white booth. He holds both his hands on a ten-fingered keypad, pressing down hard. The pad glows red, a searing sound comes from his hands, and he grimaces as more lasers instantly and (not at all) painlessly change his fingerprints. One by one, Kay deletes Edwards's identity cards. On the computer screen is Edwards' full name -- James Darrel Edwards III. Kay punches a couple keys, and the cursor begins to sweep from right to left, starting to eliminate the rightmost letters of Edwards's name. More letters are eliminated from his name. A tie pushed up. Looking slick and handsome in his extremely sharp suit, James D Edwards III -- or, rather, Jay -- steps into the doorway from the locker room. He slips on the sunglasses. The older man (Rosenberg) is carrying a cat and an ornate rosewood jewelry box. Carefully, he sets the box down and lovingly places the cat on top of it while he locks all five locks on the door to his distinctive shop. A flap of skin, now getting gray and crusty with age, hangs off Edgar's neck as he sits in the front of his Orkin van. Across the street, Edgar sees a short, older man come out of one of the jewelry shops on Thirty-Fifth Street. That finished, he picks up the cat, then the box, then waddles off down the street, one under each arm.",
    "1022": "Debbie looks down at her untouched plate. Her eyes shift to the phone and she picks it up. She scrolls through a number of pictures of her dad's family. A photo shows him huddled with his young wife, a teen boy and girl. In another photo, they stand around a soccer ball with the kids in uniform. A final photo shows him with his arm around his young daughter. Debbie pouts and slides the phone back. Debbie, Pete, and the girls sit around plates of vegetables. Debbie sighs as Sadie storms away. Now, Pete and Debbie drive down the coast. They pull up to a luxury resort. Now, they hold hands as they walk away from the beach. Later, they enter a bright hotel room. Debbie tosses her hat on the floor and hops onto a bed. Pete pushes open double doors leading to a balcony overlooking the ocean. He rushes onto the bed and kisses his wife. Now, in bathing suits, the couple jumps into a pool. Pete holds her and spins her. She puts her arm around his neck and kisses him. With their lips locked, they sink underwater. They lie in bed and share a long embrace. Pete pulls away with a satisfied smile. Pete trips off the bed. Now, they wear robes. They scarf down the cookies. Now jumping on the bed. Pete pulls up his robe and aims his butt at Debbie. They open their robes and embrace. Lying down, they passionately kiss. Now, a waiter pushes in a dessert cart. Now Pete does a magic trick. He holds a banana and oranges to his crotch. The waiter stands in shock. Debbie crawls. Debbie scurries across the floor. A starfish protrudes from his underwear. Now, they binge on desserts. She shoves it in her mouth. He sticks his tongue in her overstuffed mouth. Bits of dessert fall out. Back in the car. The hotel recedes in the distance. Debbie holds out her hand. Pete squeezes it and gives her a loving smile. They share a tender look. They turn back to the road. As they pull into their driveway, the smile fades from Pete's face. Debbie tightens her lips. Pete faces his wife. They linger in the car as Sadie and Jodi emerge from the house. Pete turns to Debbie with a cold stare. In Charlotte's bedroom. She glares at Pete. He shrugs. Pete sits in the corner. Now, Pete rides his bike with a group. At the house, Debbie enters the kitchen. In the bathroom, Pete lies back with his legs in the air. Debbie enters with an astonished expression. He takes cell phone photos of a mirror aimed at his spread butt cheeks.",
    "500": "Thelma has the phone tucked under her chin as she cuts out coupons from the newspaper and pins them on a bulletin board already covered with them. She goes through the living room to the bottom of the stairs and leans on the banister as Darryl comes trotting down the stairs. Darryl is checking himself out in the hall mirror, and it's obvious he likes what he sees; he exudes over-confidence for reasons that never become apparent and likes to think of himself as a real lady killer, making imperceptible adjustments to his over-moussed hair. Thelma watches approvingly. He's finally ready and walks to the door, giving Thelma the most perfunctory kiss on the cheek. Louise comes over and takes the phone out of his hand. They both hang up. Louise pulls out in a green '66 T-Bird in mint condition. Going into the suitcase are bathing suits, wool socks, flannel pajamas, jeans, sweaters, T-shirts, a couple of dresses, way too much stuff for a two-day trip. REVEAL Thelma standing in front of a closet, trying to decide what else to bring, as if she's forgotten something. The room looks like it was decorated entirely from a Sears catalog; it's really frilly. A perfectly ordered suitcase contains everything neatly folded and orderly: three pairs of underwear, one pair of long underwear, two pairs of pants, two sweaters, one furry robe, and one nightgown. She could be packing for camp. REVEAL Louise, whose room is as orderly as the suitcase, and everything matches. She is debating whether to take an extra pair of socks, decides not to, and closes the suitcase. She goes to the phone, picks it up, and dials. They load everything into the car, and the trunk barely closes. They get into the car and pull out of the driveway. As they drive down the street, we hear Thelma let out a long howl; she is laughing and sticks her arms straight up in the air. They are driving down the interstate when Thelma reaches for her purse and finds the gun. Louise shrieks at the sight of it, and Thelma wonders if Louise is really that naive. Louise reaches over, takes the gun out of Thelma's purse, tests the weight of it, and then puts it under the seat. Thelma puts the bullets under the seat. They are speeding off down the highway with the RADIO blaring. Louise puts in a TAPE of wild R&B MUSIC, and they are both silent for a minute. After a pause, Louise realizes that Thelma is going to revert to a teenager and continue whining unless she gives in. They pull off at a place down on the right all lit up with neon.",
    "474": "Embarrassed, Mozart bursts into a wild giggle, and Joseph helps him out as Von Strack and Bonno nod, with Orsini-Rosenberg nodding without enthusiasm. Mozart stops short with a little giggle and giggles again, while Orsini-Rosenberg looks at him sourly and the Italian faction - Orsini-Rosenberg and Bonno - laugh discreetly. An embarrassed pause ensues, and Bonno giggles in nervous amusement. Joseph is clearly pleased and nods, having wanted this result all along. Then he notices the manuscript in his hand and goes to the forte-piano, seating himself. The others, except for Salieri, gather around the manuscript held by the King. Mozart plays the first half of the march with deadly accuracy, repeats a phrase dubiously, and all the courtiers look at Salieri. Mozart plays another phrase, gradually altering the music into the celebrated march to be used later in The Marriage of Figaro, Non Piu Andrai. He plays with increasing abandon and virtuosity as Salieri watches with a fixed smile, and the court watches, astonished. Mozart finishes in great glory, takes his hands off the keys with a gesture of triumph, and grins. We see the olivewood cross, and Salieri is sitting at his desk, staring at it. Cavalieri sings her next scale, then another, and another, doing her exercises in earnest. As she hits a sustained high note, the orchestral accompaniment in the middle of Martern Aller Arten from Il Seraglio comes in, and the music changes from exercises to the exceedingly florid aria. We dissolve on the singer's face, and she is suddenly not merely turbaned but painted and dressed totally in a Turkish manner, and we are on. The house is full, watching the performance conducted by Mozart from the clavier in the midst of the orchestra. Von Strack, Orsini-Rosenberg, Bonno, and Von Swieten are grouped around the Emperor in a box. In another box, we see an overdressed, middle-aged woman and three girls, one of whom is Constanze – this is the formidable Madame Weber and her three daughters, Constanze, Josefa, and Sophie. All are enraptured by the spectacle, and Madame Weber is especially enraptured by being there at all. Cavalieri is singing Martern Aller Arten from the line Doch du bist entschlossen, and the music comes up again for the last 30 bars of the aria. All the cast is lined up on stage, and Mozart is conducting with happy excitement. Mozart bows frantically, over-excited. She moves toward Mozart with arms outstretched in an absurd theatrical gesture, then sees the Emperor, stares at him, mesmerized, her mouth open, unable even to curtsey.",
    "51": "REGGIE takes another cigarette from her pack, rips off the filter, and puts it into her mouth and points to the cigarette she just lit, still practically brand-new in the ashtray. She hands the newer one to BARTHOLOMEW, who sadly examines its mutilated end while REGGIE returns to the first cigarette. The WAITER returns with the coffee and onion soup. DYLE leaves the hotel and turns into the Place. A moment later, REGGIE comes cautiously from the hotel, first following DYLE, passing a sidewalk cafe on the corner. Then the SANDWICH-MAN and REGGIE follow. A moment later, DYLE passes a GIRL painting a canvas set up in the middle of the sidewalk, stops when he has passed her, and turns to look at her work. REGGIE, afraid she will be seen by DYLE, spins and sits at the sidewalk cafe's nearest table, her back to DYLE, which is already occupied by a middle-aged TOURIST, who looks up from his coffee, surprised. He stares at REGGIE, and she stares back. He smiles back emptily, not knowing what to make of her. REGGIE turns to look at DYLE, who has made his judgment of the painting and now moves on. The TOURIST finally finds the courage to speak, but as he opens his mouth, REGGIE, her eyes on DYLE, rises quickly from the table and leaves, leaving the TOURIST with his mouth open. He blinks, leaves some money on the table, and starts after her. REGGIE is following DYLE, and now the TOURIST follows her. She continues after DYLE, and the TOURIST hesitates but then continues following her. He goes to the curb, starts to step off, but finds the light against him and turns back in REGGIE's direction. Realizing she has to do something before DYLE spots her, she turns, takes the TOURIST's arm, and starts walking back to the cafe with him, leaving him standing there confused as she follows DYLE again. DYLE hops on the back of a bus as it pulls away. REGGIE hurries across the street, hailing a taxi. DYLE enters a building and walks to one of several windows with a sign over it. REGGIE then comes down the stairs but suddenly stops with a confused look on her face. As DYLE's turn comes, he addresses the CLERK who takes out a bundle of letters and sorts through it. DYLE stops, pondering what to do. The camera moves across an empty cabin to discover REGGIE in the third one, on the phone.",
    "31": "With him are Herr Heinze, the German consul, Captain Tonelli, an Italian officer, and Lieutenant Casselle, Renault's aide. On any occasion when Major Strasser is crossed, his expression hardens into iron. Herr Heinze steps up to him with upraised arm, and they shake hands. Heinze introduces Strasser to Renault, who salutes. Renault is a handsome, middle-aged Frenchman, debonair and gay, but also a shrewd and alert official. As they acknowledge each other, Captain Tonelli barges in front of Casselle and salutes Strasser, but Tonelli gets no further than that as Strasser turns again to Renault. They walk away from the plane, Heinze following, with Casselle and Tonelli bringing up the rear, engaged in a heated exchange of words. The neon sign above the door is brightly lit as customers arrive and go in through the front door. Again, we isolate on the neon sign before following a group of customers inside. Rick's is an expensive and chic nightclub which definitely possesses an air of sophistication and intrigue. The occupants of the room are varied, with Europeans in their dinner jackets, their women beautifully begowned and bejeweled. Sam, a middle-aged Negro, sits on a stool before a small, salmon-colored piano on wheels, playing and singing while accompanied by a small orchestra. There are Moroccans in silk robes, Turks wearing fezzes, and members of the Foreign Legion, distinguished by their kepis. Two men sit at a table, with one man's companion seemingly uninterested in his dilemma, and sympathy evidently in short supply in Casablanca. At another table, a very well-dressed woman talks to a Moor, and she has a bracelet on her wrist. At another table, two conspirators talk, and one stops abruptly as two German officers walk by. A refugee and another man converse at another table. On the way to the bar, we pass several tables and hear a Babel of foreign tongues. Carl, the waiter, is a fat, jovial German refugee with spectacles, who walks, tray in hand, to a private door, over which Abdul, a large, burly man, stands guard. Abdul opens the door, and Carl goes into the gambling room, where there is much activity at the various tables. At one table, two women and a man play cards and glance at another table. One of them calls to Carl, who laughs. The overseer walks up to a table with a paper in his hand, and we then see a drink and a man's hand, but nothing more. The overseer places a check on the table and then takes it. We now see Rick, an American of indeterminate age, sitting at a table alone playing solitary chess, as there is a commotion at the door with people attempting to come into the gambling room.",
    "168": "Another cheer rises, and when it subsides, Tyeb Mohammed stands near the back, seated with several other young men. The police half rise to look back at him, but there is a smattering of applause, and several people stand to look as well. Gandhi waits and then looks at the audience. This is the more sober Gandhi they have come to know. He looks down at the police to emphasize his point. The audience reacts tentatively but with uncertainty. Gandhi now has their attention and receives the response he wanted, a firm, mature, determined one. Gandhi holds up his hand and looks at the audience. After a moment, a merchant stands to signify his pledge, followed by Tyeb Mohammed and the youths around him. Then, throughout the theater and on the stage, everyone begins to stand until all are standing. Gandhi looks at the full theater, all standing, and takes a step forward. A prison door slams, focusing on one face, then another slam, another face, rhythmically in time with marching feet. Gandhi, Singh, and Tyeb Mohammed lead a large procession of Indian mine workers along a dirt road from a mining complex with sheds, elevator platforms, and pulleys toward a distant city. Tyeb Mohammed touches Gandhi's arm and nods ahead as a canvas-topped open touring car (circa 1910) emerges from a turning between two factory buildings and approaches them. There is little hesitation in the ranks as the car gets closer. In it, there are two uniformed policemen and a civilian, who smiles slowly. He looks from Gandhi to the miners and then looks at Gandhi sharply before smiling derisively and signaling the car off. As it pulls away, Tyeb Mohammed and Singh approach Gandhi, both wary of the man's evident satisfaction with what has transpired. Gandhi watches the disappearing car worriedly but then turns to signal the miners to move on, and they start forward. The car rides past the factory building from which it turned, and suddenly mounted police swing out from the buildings to face the procession. Tracking back before Gandhi, Singh, and Tyeb Mohammed as they move forward, fear suddenly makes their pace more labored, while tracking back before the fast-approaching mounted police with batons at the ready. Gandhi screws up his courage and marches on. Tyeb Mohammed sets his jaw in defiance, and Singh forces himself along at Gandhi's side as the mounted police ride on with batons ready. Gandhi is in the front rank of the procession, watching the horses approach, with a blunt farmer's face.",
    "396": "She goes inside; he follows. She downs a drink and motions for another. There are tears streaming down her face. He takes his hand and begins to wipe her face. She sits down; he joins her. He wipes the tears from her face with a tissue then dabs the tissue in her drink and wipes some more. Dil's face, staring at him. She allows herself to be led out. Dil and Fergus walking. Fergus stops her by the window. They walk inside. Dil and Fergus standing in the darkness. He sits her down in one of the chairs. Dil nods. Fergus takes up a scissors to snip at her hair. Her head leaps back. She stares at him. She takes a breath. Fergus begins to cut. CLOSE-UP ON DIL'S FACE as her hair is shorn. Tears stream down her cheeks. She looks in the mirror at it in the dark. Dil enters with her new haircut. She goes to turn on the light. He stops her hand. She looks at her hand on his. Her fingers close around his. She brings her lips to his neck. He lets them stay there. His hands travel up to her blouse. He begins to undo the buttons. He raises her to her feet and leads her toward the bed. She stretches languorously down on it. She turns on the bed sexily, her face to the mattress. She is wearing suspender-belts underneath her skirt. But Fergus stands and walks quietly over to the wardrobe where the soldier's things are. Dil on the bed, slowly turns. We see Fergus from her point of view, coming toward her with Jody's white cricket shirt, glowing eerily in the dark. Fergus draws her slowly up to a standing position. He wraps the shirt around her. She kisses him. Fergus leading Dil, dressed in Jody's cricket clothes, down the street and inside. From above, we see the figures of Fergus and Dil, sleeping on a double bed, both fully clothed. Fergus smokes, then puts out the cigarette. The light gradually fills the room. Fergus wakes. Looks at the bedside clock, and very gingerly rises, puts on his coat, and walks out. A car pulls up at the site. Jude gets out. She has a satchel in her hand. Fergus looking down a ladder-staircase at Jude. Fergus climbs down a ladder to Jude; she hands him something from the bag. She kisses him. Fergus looks at her expressionlessly. Fergus opens what Jude has given him--looking inside. There is a gun wrapped in an oilcloth. Fergus enters. The room is empty. He calls. He runs outside. Fergus looks up at her building, but the lights are off in her flat. The sound of feet behind him.",
    "675": "Peter stares through his dark-rimmed spectacles, then blinks. A lone figure stands on the flat roof of a tall Manhattan building. Down below, a street with four lanes of parked traffic. Across from it, another flat-roofed building. The figure is Peter, who strides with purpose away from the edge. His face full of resolve, he stops. Peter runs towards it, past the skylight jutting up, his face set in grim determination. His jaw clenched, his teeth gritted. He pumps his arms forward and back, as his pace increases and his stride lengthens. Pigeons take to the air as Peter passes. His eyes are focused on where he's going. He flings both arms back, then thrusts them forward as he leaps off the roof. His arms and legs flailing, he soars through the air. A washing line breaks his fall. He swings on it against the wall, onto the roof of a car, rolls off it, and hits another vehicle. He lifts himself up. He looks to see how far he's fallen, clutches his back, and hobbles between the cars and out of the alley parking lot. He leans on a parked car for support. John's at MJ's. MJ opens wedding acceptance cards. He kisses her outstretched hand. She studies him closely. He's lying on the sofa. He turns over and tips his head back on a cushion on the arm of the sofa. MJ, on her knees, leans over him, kissing him full on the lips, her head pointing the opposite way from his. He stretches out his left hand and holds her head still. MJ moves her head away and closes her mouth and her eyes. MJ's lost in memories. Her long hair trails down over his cheek, until MJ pulls back. She opens her mouth in a silent sigh and looks sad and reflective. MJ is sitting in a cafe with a glass front, leaning her head on her hand. Peter strolls in, and sits opposite her. He looks down as she stares intently into his face. Her eyes are fixed on him. Her face grows sad. He shakes his head. MJ purses her lips. Her eyes flit left and right. His head shakes slightly, as he gazes sorrowfully into her blue eyes. He looks at the table. She lowers her head, then raises it. Tears well in MJ's eyes. Her lips quiver. She leans forward. Peter looks up, surprised. She lays her hand on his. Her engagement ring shines brightly. Peter's eyes move up from her hand to her face. She stretches further across the table. He edges his mouth closer to hers, then stops. Her eyes are closed. Her lips offer to him. His eyes widen as a car comes flying towards the window.",
    "634": "Morgan takes Graham's hand and steps over Houdini, and they gaze down at the dead dog; Graham puts his hand on Morgan's shoulder, but Morgan brushes it away and trudges off solemnly. Graham steps up to the climbing frame and looks searchingly at Bo, who remains in a tight ball, staring down at the ground; he gently lifts her off the platform and holds her against his shoulder, carrying Bo back to the farmhouse as Merrill emerges, carrying a bowl and a bag of feed. Graham walks past him, climbs onto the veranda, and walks through the front door of the house. Merrill looks over to the climbing frame with a confused expression; he's in his early 30s with short dark hair and a boyish face. Merrill puts down the bag of feed and unties Isabel, the other Alsatian, from the veranda steps, leading her across the yard as Caroline pulls the barbecue fork from Houdini's throat. A wire wind chime in the shape of a beaming sun hangs on the veranda and swings mournfully in the soft breeze. That night, the farmhouse stands in darkness beneath a black sky. Graham lies on his side in bed, his eyes suddenly open as he stares ahead; Bo gazes at him. Graham pads across the landing to the children's bedroom, holding Bo by the hand, as they come to the open bedroom door and step into the darkened room, where Morgan lies half off his bed in an uncomfortable looking heap. Bo shuffles off to her bed, and Graham gently lifts Morgan up and lies him on his back, then walks across the bedroom and sits beside Bo on her bed. He gazes at her and looks her up and down; Bo looks at him through wide bright eyes, and a sadness falls across Graham's face as he looks at his daughter, then glances over at the bedroom window. A shadowy figure stands by a chimney pot on the barn roof, and Graham jumps to his feet. Downstairs in the lounge, Merrill is asleep in an armchair when Graham touches his shoulder, waking Merrill, who looks up at his brother in confusion. Graham and Merrill are by the front door, and Merrill opens the door; an outside light comes on, and they rush out and split up. Merrill comes to the back of the house as a dust bin is tipped over up ahead, while Graham runs along the side of the house, and the brothers meet up again at the front of the house. They stop and look around breathlessly when a sound on the roof of the house attracts their attention; Merrill keeps his gaze fixed firmly on the farmhouse roof as he paces backwards down the gloomy yard, trying to get a better view.",
    "642": "Jamal and Latika stare at each other. The guard presses the intercom and approaches to open the gates. Latika quickly moves inside the house. Jamal enters an expensively furnished marble living room and sees Latika behind the glass partition separating the room from a kitchen and approaches. She removes her dark glasses and stands expectantly as he steps from behind the partition. They both stand stock still, and she takes a sharp intake of breath. She smiles as he moves towards her, then they embrace each other tightly. Suddenly, she looks scared and backs away, and he looks at her shocked. A silver Mercedes pulls up to the house. As Javed steps into the living room, Latika puts an apron over Jamal’s neck. Javed walks straight into the kitchen and levels his malevolent gaze at Latika. He points to the game show on TV, walks into the living room, and sits down in front of a widescreen TV. He switches on the cricket game. Latika nervously prepares a sandwich for Javed. Jamal spreads a concoction of preservatives onto a slice of bread as Latika dumps a limp piece of lettuce on the plate, and Jamal and Latika exchange nervous glances. He grabs her hand. She breaks his hold, lifts the plate, and takes it to Javed. She passes in front of the TV, and Javed shoos her out of the way back to the kitchen. Javed watches the game and throws his drink. Jamal looks pleadingly at Latika. Javed, still transfixed by the cricket game, takes a bite of his sandwich, looks disgusted, and spits it out onto the plate. He walks into the kitchen, glares at Jamal, and goes back to the cricket, swearing under his breath. Latika pushes Jamal toward the door, slowly shakes her head, and pushes him out of the door. He remains in the courtyard looking back at her. Jamal takes a deep breath and raises his eyes upwards. The cricket match replays. He tenses his jaw muscles and hands back the check to the host. Jamal looks out of a train window as it races through the city. The train pulls into a large station, and he jumps off. Hundreds of passengers alight from the train and throng on the platforms. An enormous station clock shows five minutes to five. Now the clock shows five-fifteen. As Jamal moves along the walkway looking down on the platform, he scans the busy platforms and looks at the overhead clock. He rests his head on his hands in despair, then he squats down. Latika appears on the platform, looking around her. Jamal looks up and catches sight of her. He stands up immediately, and she looks very anxious.",
    "118": "Neff is in the booth dialing a number and looks around to ensure he is not watched before hanging up. The LaSalle stops in front of the market, and Phyllis steps out, entering the market and looking around. Neff moves slowly along the shelves, outwardly calm but with his nerves on edge, as Phyllis approaches from beyond him, stopping beside him a couple of feet away. Phyllis moves close to him and looks at him sharply, sideways, but as a customer comes along the aisle toward them, they move apart. After the customer passes, Phyllis draws close again and takes Neff's arm, forgetting where she is, but he pulls away. Phyllis takes off her dark glasses for the first time and looks at him with cold, hard eyes, as over Neff's face, as he looks after her, comes the commentary. Neff and Lola then climb over a low hill in the foreground under a starlit sky, with music from the Bowl playing Cesar Franck's D Minor Symphony. As he helps her climb up, the camera pans with them to show the expanse of the Bowl below, filled with a packed audience and the orchestra on the lighted shell. They sit down on the grass, with Neff sitting near but not too close to her, silhouetted against the shell lights. Neff puts a cigarette in his mouth and strikes a match, glancing at her as she begins to cry. A pause follows before she starts crying again, while over Neff's face, as he listens to the music, comes the commentary. Around 5:00 P.M. or a little later, a stream of office employees comes out of an elevator into the lobby, among them Neff, wearing his hat and carrying his briefcase. As the camera precedes him walking toward the entrance doors, he is stopped by Keyes' voice off to one side. Neff stops, looks towards the cigar counter, and moves toward Keyes, who is buying cigars and stuffing them into his pockets. Keyes bites off the end of the cigar, puts it into his mouth, and starts tapping his pockets for a match, as usual. Neff strikes a match for him before Keyes goes toward the street and out of the scene. Neff moves back into the lobby, followed by the camera, and as he reaches the elevator, he looks back over his shoulder to ensure Keyes is gone, then steps into the empty elevator, stops the machine, and sits down slowly, still holding the horn. Deeply moved, Neff sits, staring blankly at the wall.",

His hands fly to her neck, but Indy releases her and backs away, and she looks at him with a lover's pain.

Fifty kids push their autograph books for Hitler's signature, and Hitler pauses to sign them, then looks Indy's way, and they make eye contact. Hitler breaks the spell by taking the Grail Diary from Indy, opens it to the first page, and signs his autograph, then hands it back and moves on. Indy’s motorcycle pulls up to the main terminal as a Plainclothes Agent distributes leaflets bearing Henry's picture to Nazi Soldiers inside the terminal. Henry leans in a doorway reading a newspaper as Indy enters down the stairs and taps Henry's shoulder. They begin to walk toward the boarding gates, with Henry looking over his newspaper at Indy, but Indy looks out the window and is suddenly concerned, rushing across the tarmac toward the Zeppelin. Henry looks confused as everyone else with a ticket quickly produces it and waves it in Indy’s face. Vogel gets to his knees as the huge Zeppelin rises into the sky above him, revealing an airplane attached to the belly of the airship, and he shakes his fist at the rising Zeppelin. Henry opens his Diary and begins to thumb through it, looking up from it, then closes it and leans back in his seat. Indy stutters uncomfortably as Henry stares at him, waiting for a response, while sunlight falls across the table from the window, turning like the hand of a clock over the tabletop across the drinks. Indy appears puzzled as he and his father emerge from the hatchway into the belly of the Zeppelin, where the Zeppelin's elaborate metal framework is exposed. Indy and Henry hurry down the catwalk until arriving at a pair of doorways framed into the Zeppelin's outer skin, with plenty of blue sky and white clouds visible, and a small Biplane suspended from the Zeppelin by a hook and crane device. Indy climbs into the cockpit of the Biplane as Henry takes the tail gunner's seat, then they both become aware of a strange sound in the skies behind them. Two Messerschmidt fighter bombers streak out of the clouds and race across the sky, forcing them to shrink in their seats as the Messerschmidts, going three times as fast, scream past on either side.",
    "1100": "The gang drives up, and Thao eyes them suspiciously as the five mean-looking Hmong guys get out. Spider walks over to Thao and ruffles Thao's hair. Sue goes inside while Thao takes off his gardening gloves and stands with Spider and Smokie. Thao looks next door and follows them as the gang spots Walt's car. Meanwhile, Walt is in a bar with his buddies. They leave the others at the bar, and Walt makes to drink his whiskey but stops short before downing his shot in one, while Father J nods. A noise wakes Walt from his slumbers, prompting him to look out of the window where he sees torchlight in his garage. He gets up and goes over to a chest, opening it to pull out an old military rifle. He opens the breech, loads a magazine into it, cocks it, and then, rifle in hand, edges the garage door open and walks inside. He sees Thao with a torch beside the Gran Torino and as Walt advances, the barrel of the rifle knocks the overhead light, causing it to swing. By its swaying light, he aims the rifle at Thao, who backs away, stumbles, and falls backwards, tripping Walt in the process. The rifle goes off, shooting a sign on the wall as Thao runs out of the garage, leaving Walt sprawling on the ground. Thao runs to Spider's souped-up Honda in the street. Walt spits out some blood and pushes himself up. Mitch makes a phone call in his kitchen while Walt is in his garage installing window grills. Walt hangs up, and Mitch looks put-out. In his driveway, Walt lovingly polishes his dark green Gran Torino with gold trims. He buffs a wing of the car, works his way around to the bonnet, and carefully removes any marks. In the evening, Walt sits on his porch with his dog Daisy, lights a cigarette, and looks out at the Gran Torino parked on the drive as a couple of people walk by on the street. Walt swigs from a can of beer and as the light begins to fade, several beers later, he gets to his feet, calls to his dog, and heads inside. He switches on the porch light as he goes into the house and shuts the door behind him. At night, Spider's Honda pulls up on the street outside Thao's house and Spider and his cronies get out. They approach Thao and his sister Sue on the porch, and Spider tousles Thao's hair. Spider hustles Thao towards the car, but family members intervene and a scuffle breaks out. The scuffle spills over onto Walt's lush green lawn, breaking two garden gnomes. Rifle in hand, Walt marches onto the lawn and aims his gun at the squabbling guys.",
    "755": "He looks across the room, past the bed, to a second door. He stands in the doorway of a bathroom, where a boy and girl, not quite teenagers, are sitting on the floor facing each other, their wrists tied above their heads. He kneels beside the boy, pulling the plastic cable tying his wrists to a towel rail, light glinting on his wedding ring. The cable falls free, and he crosses, still on his knees, to the girl, and repeats the operation, glancing over his shoulder to the open door behind him. He silences the pair, hand out, palm down. In another larger bedroom, plain white linen curtains flap at the open window, giving glimpses of a pair of bare legs stretched out on the carpet. The curtains flap further apart, revealing a woman in a dressing gown, sitting on the floor, and leaning against an old fashioned black radiator. Her knees are drawn up. The gown has slipped partway up her legs. Her wrists are tied above her head and lashed to the radiator. Her head lulls on one side. From the other side of the room, David looks down at her and puts a finger to his lips. He crosses to the full length window and parts the curtains. After a moment, he steps through the curtains onto a balcony and walks to the edge, raindrops glistening on his rain cape. He leans on the rail and looks over. The maintenance man in orange launches himself at David from inside the bedroom. David is hurled over the balcony. He lands on his face in water. He lifts his head. The black shiny surface on which he's lying begins to crease and sag. Water forms an ever larger pool around him. He watches the rain splashing in the water in front of him as he gradually begins to sink. Over to his left, he sees a crumpled ridge of plastic sheeting begin to fold in on itself. More ridges ahead and to his right do the same. Behind him, as the sheeting slips inwards, he sees a glistening white surface beneath it. From above, the black plastic swimming pool cover enfolds him, wraps him up, and sinks into the dark water. Beneath the surface, blackness gives way to light from above, seen through a haze of bubbles, before the blackness closes around him again. His hands thrash in the bubbles reaching for the light. High above the water, a blurred shape in orange turns away from the balcony. Darkness and light alternate under the water as David struggles to free himself from the embrace of the black cover. Through the bubbles, a pole appears, poking down from a blurred figure at the pool side.",
    "387": "He wears black leather pants and a black leather jacket, open, shirtless, exposing fine blond chest hair and pale skin. One arm trails off into the water; next to it, an empty whiskey bottle bobs. Brandt releases a gale of forced laughter. Brandt nervously takes the Dude by the elbow. The Dude grudgingly allows himself to be led away, still looking at the young woman. He continues to lead away the Dude, who looks back over his shoulder. Scattered by a strike. Donny calls out from the bench. As the Dude walks back to the scoring table he turns to another team in black bowling shirts--the Cavaliers--that shares the lane. He lets the small yapping dog out of the carrier. It scoots around the bowling table, sniffing at bowlers and wagging its tail. Smokey turns from his last roll to look at Walter. Walter takes out a gun. Walter and the Dude walk to the Dude's car. The Pomeranian trots happily behind Walter who totes the empty carrier. As the two men get into the car, Walter is still smug. A large, brilliant Persian rug lies beneath the Dude's beat-up old furniture. At the table next to the answering machine the Dude is mixing kalhua, rum, and milk. A beep. It swings open to reveal a short, hairy, muscular but balding middle-aged man in a black T-shirt and black cut-off jeans. The Dude takes a swig of his kalhua. We are pushing Brandt down the high-ceilinged hallway. Brandt talks back over his shoulder. Distantly, we hear a dolorous soprano. He turns back around and the firelight shows teartracks on his cheeks. He clears his throat. Brandt hastily pulls a flimsy sheet from his clipboard and hands it to the Dude. Brandt tugs at the Dude's shirt and points him back to the hall. The soprano's singing is once again faint. Brandt's voice is hushed. We are looking across the length of the bowling alley at a tall, thin, Hispanic bowler displaying perfect form. He wears an all-in-one dacron-polyester stretch bowling outfit with a racing stripe down each side. CRASH--scattered by a strike, in slow motion. The Dude is staring off towards the bowler. We see Quintana, in pressed jeans and a stretchy sweater, walking up a stoop in a residential neighborhood and zinging the bell. The door swings open and a beer-swilling middle-aged man looks dully out at Quintana, who looks hesitantly up. He slips a little black box out of his shirt pocket. Donny has been watching Quintana. They both look up. Quintana, on his way out, looks down at them from the lip of the lanes. He is holding a fancy black-and-red leather ball satchel (perhaps a Sylvia Wein). Behind him stands his partner, O'Brien, a short fat Irishman with tufted red hair.",
    "672": "In his room, Peter, his shadow thrown behind him onto the wall, stares at his own hand held out. His back resting on a pillow, Peter stares into space, his steely blue eyes bright and determined. Outside in a dark alley with ominous clouds in the sky, Peter stands with his Spider-Man costume held out in front of him. The wind ruffles his hair as he remains still for a moment. He drops the costume, then walks down the alley and away from the dust bin into which he has consigned the last vestige of the superhero. The sun shines as Peter, with a jaunty gait, strides through the city. Peter trips on the sidewalk. He awkwardly gets to his feet, reaches into his pocket, and hauls out his spectacles. He flicks them open, puts them on, and sets off a little wet. At home, he tightens up a wheel on his moped and spins it. The wheel rolls off the front forks and bounces out of the open window. He strolls away from a hot dog man and stands at the curve. Cop cars and vans and officers on foot race off in one direction. Peter munches his hot dog and sets off in the other. In his room, he studies. Peter's hand goes up. Peter grins proudly. On the campus, Doctor Connors races up to him. Peter stops and smiles. At the theater, MJ is distracted when she sees Peter in the audience. He grins inanely. She smiles sweetly. She ignores the prompt. She turns to her costar. MJ and Peter walk down the street side-by-side. Peter, standing beside her, gazes at her earnestly. Then they both resume walking. He looks at her through doleful eyes, and she scrutinizes his features. She turns away and crosses to a yellow cab. She opens the door of the cab and, before getting in, turns to look at him once more. Peter half smiles as MJ steps into the cab, shuts the door, and watches as the cab drives away. He slips on his spectacles. At the Bugle, a headline is being composed. Jameson's on the phone. He pulls Spider-Man's mask from a bag. Out comes the rest of the costume. The disgruntled garbage man goes. Robbie fondles the mask. In his office, Jameson, in the Spider-Man costume minus the mask, leaps onto his desk, a big cigar in his mouth. He flexes his wrists as if shooting out webs. His staff peer in through the slatted blinds. Robbie shakes his head. Two girls overtake him and giggle. He smiles and walks on past an alleyway. He sees two muggers attacking a dark-haired youth. Peter turns his back away, leaving the muggers punching and kicking their fallen victim.",
    "163": "There is silence, and an air of somnolence. We see the police commissioner, Suhrawardy, two doctors, Abdul Ghaffar Khan, and some others. Nearer Gandhi, behind Mirabehn, are Nehru, Patel, Azad, and Pyarelal. Gandhi turns to Mirabehn, his face shaking, peering into her eyes. His weary eyes look at her; he looks up slowly to Azad. Gandhi looks at Nehru, who just nods tautly. Gandhi looks down, then lifts his head to Azad. The relief brings water to their eyes and grins to their faces. Nehru bends to Gandhi. Gandhi holds his hand out to him, and Nehru clutches it. Another click of a camera. He is not fully recovered, but well on the way. We get a wide-angle shot now and see that Bourke-White is shooting one of her favorite subjects again. She is enjoying the banter, as is Mirabehn, who is spinning quietly to one side of the room, and Patel, who sits cross-legged like Gandhi on the floor. Pyarelal is working on papers with him but grins at this. And she shoots him again, as he hands the cloth back to Manu. Abha is sitting next to Manu, looking at a collection of pictures of Gandhi, obviously Bourke-White's. Abha suddenly holds a picture up for Gandhi to see. It's one of him, ears wide, eyes round. Gandhi taps her on the head with his finger as she smiles. But Bourke-White has looked from Patel to Gandhi, clearly shaken by the implication in Patel's words. Abha has signaled to the cheap watch dangling from his dhoti. He glances at it, and holds his arms out. The two girls help him. She is photographing his getting-up and leaning on the two girls. He moves off, but has a sudden thought and turns to Patel. Patel nods soberly and Gandhi starts for the door, Bourke-White moving with him. He has passed her, he's in the doorway. We see the crowd at the end of the garden, where the light of the day is beginning to soften. He turns, teasing in his slightly flirtatious way with women. She shoots him against the door -- the crowd milling distantly, waiting -- then she lowers her camera. He turns; the last words have betrayed the smile on his face; they have a painful sense of truth about them. Bourke-White watches as he moves into the garden toward the crowd in the distance. She turns to Mirabehn. Mirabehn accedes gravely. Bourke-White stares at her, then turns to look out at him. Mirabehn nods, but she keeps on spinning and tries to sound cynically resigned but her innate emotionalism keeps breaking through in her voice and on her face. Gandhi is moving forward in the crowd, one hand resting on Manu, the other on Abha.",
    "1216": "The villagers have their hands behind their heads as they find armed men, and the soldiers open fire on them, causing women to cry and hide their eyes. Soldiers break into homes and drag out youths while the officer watches coolly. A soldier shoots a man dead, and then the commander addresses the village, leaving terrified women to cover their mouths. In Rambo's fort, sparks fly as he grinds round blades on a spinning wheel, his veins standing out on his muscular arms. He stops grinding, drops the blade, and runs a hand through his hair. Nearby, a rusty metal fan on a rod lies on a bench. He removes a nut from the rod, discards the fan, and replaces it with his creation, a new fan. He adds a nut to the thread at the end of the rod, reaches onto a bench, picks up a spanner, and tightens the nut. He deftly lifts the assembly off the bench and puts it down, then leaves the workshop and walks out into the rainy night air. His boat is moored below at the water's edge, and he looks down at it, where a solitary figure sits on the boat. Rambo wipes rain away from his face and walks down a wooden walkway to the boat, where Sarah is sitting under the boat's canopy. She stands, soaking wet, and he stares blankly at her. Sarah looks disappointed as she emerges from the canopy and walks past him, climbing onto the harbor. She begins to walk the length of the harbor towards the walkway, pauses, and brushes rain from her head. Rambo steps onto the harbor; she turns and stares at him before walking back towards him with an imploring look, brushing rain from her hair once more. Rambo stares at her, his face betraying no emotion. She turns away from him with a faint smile and walks back along the harbor, wearing a sodden gray hoodie and jeans, and climbs the wooden walkway. Rambo rubs his chin, runs a hand through his hair, and walks along the harbor. In the morning light on Rambo's boat as it motors along the river, Michael addresses his party while Rambo is at the tiller. Michael glances at Rambo, who affords him the merest flicker in return, as Rambo stoically leans on the tiller with both hands. Sarah approaches him, smiles, and turns away. At dusk, the boat motors around a headland, a small white glimmer appearing on the river and a cone-shaped reflection in the water thrown by the boat, which has headlamps mounted on its canopy. Michael and his volunteers doze in the boat, with Sarah nestled against Michael's chest, while Rambo's attention is caught.",
    "1289": "FLASHBACK - Juno approaches a boy hidden by shadow, who is sitting in an overstuffed chair, and she slowly, clumsily lowers herself onto his lap. A DOG barks, jarring Juno back to reality, and we see a teacup poodle tethered in the yard a few feet away from the abandoned living room set. The dog yaps again as Juno swigs from an absurdly oversized carton of juice and wipes her mouth with the back of her hand. Finally, a panting Juno arrives at DANCING ELK DRUG on the main drag of her small Minnesota suburb, Dancing Elk, and she enters the DRUGSTORE. ROLLO, the eccentric drugstore clerk wearing a polyester uniform vest, sneers at Juno from behind the counter and regards her with intense skepticism. An eavesdropping TOUGH GIRL wearing an oversized jacket and lots of makeup gapes at Juno from the beauty aisle. Rollo pulls the bathroom key out of reach, but then sighs and slips her the bathroom key. Juno races down one of the aisles and desperately shakes the stick in an attempt to skew the results. Shake. Shake. Juno walks slowly and dejectedly up the street to her house, gnawing on the Super Rope, as she trudges toward her HOUSE where the yard is a wild tangle of prairie grass and wildflowers. She stops and loops the Super Rope over a low-hanging tree branch, contemplating how to fashion a noose. In Juno's BEDROOM, decorated with punk posters: The Damned, The Germs, The Stooges, Television, Richard Hell, etc., she picks up a hamburger-shaped phone to call her best friend. LEAH's room is cluttered with the sentimental junk that certain girls love to hoard, and Leah and Juno struggle to drag a recliner across a well-manicured suburban lawn, making a formidable team. Bleeker discreetly pushes a POSTCARD to Juno with his foot, and she picks it up off the floor, reads it, then looks at Bleeker, who is watching the teacher obediently. Bleeker is putting on double socks in his Car-Bed, followed by putting on his sweat bands, and there is a close-up of Bleeker applying Runner's Glide and a close-up of a CROISSANT POCKET warming in the microwave. PAUL BLEEKER steps onto the front porch of his house for early morning track practice and is startled to discover that Juno is outside waiting for him. She has somehow arranged the living room set on the front lawn and is seated in the armchair, chewing a pipe officiously. She mounts her bicycle and waves before riding off. Juno pushes her crappy bike into the bike rack and winds a lock around it. We see Steve looking back at Juno for a brief second with mixed feelings, and we see Leah at the far end of the hallway, talking animatedly with a paunchy middle-aged teacher, KEITH.",
    "183": "The camera pulls back, revealing the blood-stained butcher knife in his hand, then further back. Mother and Father stare at the POV, at first in puzzlement, then slow, growing horror. Craning up past his parents standing there, up from the neighbor's house to a high shot of the neighborhood as the sounds of police sirens rise in the distance. Two headlights appear in the darkness, backlighting the rain that pours down on a lonely strip of highway. A station wagon hisses along the wet road surface. Next to her in the passenger seat is Sam Loomis, a clinical psychiatrist. Marion, 30, drives. He is a tough-looking man in his forties who flips through pages in a manila folder. Loomis glances at Marion as she lights a cigarette. She shoves the matches into the pack and tosses it on the dashboard. Loomis stares at the cigarette pack. They look up ahead. Standing by the side of the road is a male patient, a wild-looking man in his sixties dressed in a white gown, who stares at the station wagon. Marion slows the station wagon and pulls off to the side of the road. Loomis jumps out. Through the windshield we see Loomis rush over to the patient, stand and talk for a moment, then hurry back. Camera moves with Laurie as she walks down the residential street. She carries a large bundle of school books in her arms. Across a backyard Tommy Doyle, an eight-year-old boy with tousled brown hair and bright blue eyes, comes running with his books. He catches up with her, and they walk along down the street. They walk up to the front of the old, two-story Myers house set back from the street. Laurie holds up a key. Laurie walks through the front gate and starts up toward the porch. Laurie strolls up to the front porch. She bends down, lifts the welcome mat, and places the key under it. Through a frost window, we see Laurie bending over the welcome mat. Suddenly a dark shape, the outline of a man, leans forward, watching her. As she walks back to Tommy at the street, the shape moves to watch them, then fades back into the interior of the house. Laurie and Tommy continue walking down the street. Tommy breaks stride and runs across the street. We see Laurie walking off down the street in the distance. Close to camera, the dark shape moves into frame, watching Laurie disappear around the corner. Loomis reaches a car and unlocks it. Loomis gets in the car. Loomis starts up the car and pulls away from the sanitarium. Wynn watches him go, then hurries back into the building. Laurie sits at the back of a classroom of high school students.",
    "43": "He shakes some powder into his hand and tastes it as Reggie watches expectantly. Behind the ultra-modern glass and concrete structure of the Ecole Militaire, several delegates identified by little plaques listing their respective nations, along with their aides, sit around a large table, all wearing earphones. The Italian delegate is speaking when Sylvie jumps up, rushes next door into her booth, and shuts the door behind her. The British delegate rises to speak, continuing through the next scene, and hands her a paper, the one Grandpierre gave Reggie, which has been torn in half and scotch-taped back together. She turns back to the conference, flips a switch, and starts speaking into her headset. From Reggie's and Adam's angle, all the delegates and their aides suddenly turn, surprised, and look at the camera, from the delegates' angle. Inside the booth, Reggie and Adam can be seen heading for the door in a hurry as the delegates look at one another, confused, by the locked gate. A quick succession of shots shows a children's merry-go-round, Rond Point de Champs-Elysées with fountains playing, children's swings, Restaurant Laurent, and a balloon salesman. Adam stands by the large fountain, staring off at something as Reggie joins him, and he starts off. Between the curb and the Jardin, several temporary wooden booths have been set up, collecting quite a crowd. Into this area comes Tex, followed at a safe distance by Adam. Suddenly Tex stops, staring wide-eyed at something, neatly displayed on a counter of one of the booths. As he wheels to look at another booth, in another arrangement, he turns crazily to look at another booth, then another, with various flash shots of stamps of all sizes, shapes, and colors, as he understands. He turns to rush off and bumps smack into Adam, startling Tex, and they go off in opposite directions. As she hurries along a row of stalls, weaving around small groups of men standing together, showing each other stamps, searching in another section of the market, but it isn't, looking everywhere, suddenly she sees something. Only a small boy's elbow and part of his arm show, the rest hidden by all the legs, and she recognizes him from these fragments. She rushes to him, the camera panning with her. Jean-Louis stands looking at some stamps as Sylvie grabs him, and Reggie runs up and joins them. Jean-Louis looks in one direction, then in the other, trying to remember, seeing four of them—a red, a yellow, a blue, and a green, still attached to the portion of the torn envelope. As Reggie comes hurrying up the stairs, she goes first to Adam's room and knocks as Bartholomew, his face lathered for a shave, is on the phone.",
    "1042": "He looks down from the window at Barnes and Taylor. The Mayor waves to the crowd, then steps back from the lectern to welcome President Ashton with a handshake. Barnes sees an open window. A muzzle flash illuminates the window, and the President reels back before falling. Taylor yells to a stunned Barnes. Barnes looks back up. A bearded young man dashes to the podium. Barnes tackles him. Barnes stares down at the recumbent President. Taylor helps carry the President away. The President is loaded into an ambulance. The bearded young man. They lead him off. An exasperated look on his face, Holden turns away. They loop up on hearing the distant explosion. Barnes sees the man in the checked shirt. He runs to him and grabs his camera. Barnes points. They rewind the camera in vision. Both men stare at the LCD screen. Flames and black smoke rise into the air. The smoke clears. Barnes is lying on the ground. He regains consciousness. There is a scratch on his grubby face. Barnes hauls himself to his knees. Barnes struggles to get to his feet. There are small fires all around. A man throws a blanket over a woman whose clothes are in flames. Barnes takes in the number of people lying injured. Barnes recalls the muzzle flashes in the window. Across the plaza, Matthews, clutching a chest wound, tries to sit up. Barnes runs across to him, past the mess of twisted metal crowd control barriers. Barnes bends down. Holden staggers over. Matthews falls still. Holden shakes his head. Barnes stares at his fallen colleague. Holden looks up to see the Spanish bearded cop with a gun. Holden chases after the bearded man who has holstered his gun. Barnes looks up as a GNN cameraman runs past. Barnes reads the GNN logo and leaps to his feet. He runs to the GNN outside broadcast van and enters the gallery. Barnes stares at the bank of monitors. The director watches him. Barnes sees a still frame of him being shot. Barnes searches for the cell phone. Rex watches as Barnes keys in numbers on his cell phone. He speaks into his cuff mike. He dials a number. The PA whispers into her cellphone. Barnes' eyes are fixed on the monitor. Karen glances around and manually rewinds the tape control. Barnes looks intently at the screen, his eyes unblinking. Barnes turns and runs out of the van. The events rewind. Barnes turning to Mathews. The explosion, the shooting. Taylor at Barnes' hotel door. The time on the digital clock moves to midday. The bearded man, Enrique, a handsome man in his 30s wearing a light open shirt over a dark tee shirt and with a bag over his shoulder, marches past the protestors on his way to the plaza.",
    "1074": "Flynn is drinking rum down below and hides the bottle behind a Bible before standing sheepishly with his hands in his pockets. She looks at a loss and downs her tea cup of rum in a gulp. A herd of horses has been rounded up and thunders past the house. Sarah looks out the door in amazement and stares straight into the eyes of the Drover, who is galloping alongside the herd. Flynn laughs in delight, and Nullah leaps for joy. Sarah runs along the verandah watching the spectacle. Drover reins his horse in, stares at Sarah, and takes off again as the horses are all rounded up. She runs indignantly after him, gets off her knees, and looks him in the eye. He considers the sleek black thoroughbred leaping in its enclosure, eyes her, and walks off. She's dressed for the English countryside and trots off in a huff as they start to ride around the cattle, moving them into a single herd. She gallops after the lone steer. Back at the house, her luggage is being packed. The sun beats down on the homestead, and the windmill turns slowly as Nullah and Daisy carry items of luggage for Sarah. A truck approaches, which Nullah spots, and his eyes widen. Nullah frantically climbs to the water tank as Sing Song grabs the dropped bags, and Sarah watches from indoors while Daisy climbs with her son, staying around the back of the tank hidden from the truck. Daisy is about to get in with the boy but has to duck down and stay on the ladder to avoid being seen as the truck halts. Sarah pulls back the curtain and looks out at the cops. As the men look the other way, Daisy hurriedly climbs in after Nullah. She takes the tea tray to her as one man walks slowly towards the tank. Daisy clings in fear to the ladder inside the tank as the cop turns the water on in the pump, and more water floods in the tank. Daisy holds her hand up for Nullah to grab. Tracker crouches, while Daisy and Nullah cling frantically to the ladder, which then collapses, and they fall into the water. Daisy lifts Nullah to grab onto a pipe, and she gets a grip too, but the bar breaks, and more water floods in. The sergeant looks out at the water tower, while the Aboriginal tracker looks up and sees water pouring out of holes at the top of the tower, and more continues to pour from the tower. Daisy puts her hand over Nullah's mouth as the tracker walks slowly away and the windmill turns faster. Daisy flounders and sinks beneath the surface.",
    "1235": "Ezra sits playing the piano in the foyer of a modern glass and steel mall as people of all different ages mill in the area, going about their business. Ben stands in a shop doorway watching Ezra play, appearing deeply moved and drifting off into his own thoughts. In a diner, a couple cuddles and giggles, while nearby, Ezra, who's in his 40s, sips from a mug at a table where a pretty, blonde waitress speaks to him. Ben sits watching nearby as Susan walks off, then watches sympathetically, gets up, throws money onto his table, and saunters over to Ezra's table. Ezra, an attractive man with an aquiline nose and longish brown hair, self-consciously smooths down his hair, unaware of Ben standing over him. Ben looks down at the pie on a plate in front of Ezra, whose blue eyes are clouded, and a look of surprise crosses Ezra's face as Ben goes. In Ben's motel, a single box jellyfish floats in his aquarium as Ben sits watching it. He sits motionless in the shadowy room, then goes to pick up his mobile, checks the display, and slowly opens it. Meanwhile, Emily is in the hospital lying in bed with air tubes running from her nose, fiddling with Ben's card. She holds her mobile away from her, looks at it briefly, snuggles down in the bed, and her smile fades. She closes her eyes and smiles, then her eyes are open again and she blinks, beginning to look drowsy. Phone to his ear, Ben walks towards the main door of the St. Matthew Center. The glass doors slide apart and he enters, walks down a hospital corridor towards Emily's room, stops outside her room, and looks at her through the window as Emily lies fast asleep surrounded by machines and monitors. Ben closes his clamshell mobile phone while Emily lies on her side with her ear pressed against her phone on a pillow. Ben slowly and gently pulls the phone out and shuts it, then stands looking down at her tenderly, puts Emily's phone on the bed, draws up a chair, and sits at her bedside, staring down at her peaceful but bruised face as she continues sleeping. Emily, asleep on her side, wakes, blinks drowsily, rubs her eyes as she slowly comes to, sits up a little, freezes, then sits up fully. She stares down at Ben, slumped back in the chair beside her bed, fast asleep. Removing the oxygen tubes from her nose, Emily watches Ben, then slowly reaches out and caresses the back of one of his hands with her fingertips.",
    "313": "Evan is terrified. Then Lenny suddenly moves back and begins working on the model again, his eyes a million miles away. Furthermore, the walls behind him vibrate, slightly worse than before. Evan, Kayleigh, Lenny, and Tommy, all thirteen, watch the mailbox across the street with intense anticipation. When Evan comes to in this memory, the lit cigarette absently drops from his mouth and nestles into the folds of his shirt. The mailbox. Suddenly a car appears from down the street and slowly pulls into the driveway. Mrs. Halpern, 24, an attractive young mother, gets out of the car and walks to the mailbox. Mrs. Halpern walks back to the car. Evan looks on in horror and suddenly clenches his teeth in pain and silently swipes the front of his shirt, sending the lit cigarette to the ground. He pulls up his shirt revealing a fresh burn mark on his stomach. Andrea shakes her head. Evan nods, but something gnaws beneath the surface. Evan hastily hunts through his journals, tearing up the room looking for a certain book. Thumper, lying on his bed, quietly watches Evan with growing concern. Thumper jumps off the bed and snatches the journal away. Thumper begins scanning the journal entry. He hands the journal back to Evan. Evan opens it and begins reading it silently. His hands begin to tremble and he slams the book shut in defeat. Evan pulls into a parking lot of a country diner. Evan is about to enter when he spots Kayleigh coming out of the kitchen with a tray full of food. Her boss stares back in aggravation. Kayleigh's face turns beet red as she bends down to clean up the order. As she brings the mess inside the kitchen, a customer pinches her ass. Evan closely studies her reaction to the offense. She flinches uncomfortably but then composes a smile for the customer. Evan backs out uncomfortably. Kayleigh struggles with the zipper of a shabby coat as she exits. Evan steps out of the shadows. She's startled at first, but eventually recognizes him. A smile flickers across her face and she allows herself to be hugged. Kayleigh nods and they walk down the street. She reaches into her pocket, pulls out a pack of smokes. Evan nods and scrutinizes her face with his next question. Kayleigh stops walking and crushes her cigarette. Kayleigh begins to tremble. Tears flow. Kayleigh runs, stops and turns back to Evan. She turns and runs away. Evan, tired and depressed, sits on the lawn nearby, fingering the new burn scar on his belly. Evan enters his dorm. He ignores Thumper, who sits on Evan's bed sucking furiously from a gurgling bong. Evan puts a towel under the door.",
    "1272": "The three friends hang onto the dragon's horny spikes, with Hermione on one side and Ron and Harry on the other as it takes flight, clumsily buffeting rooftops and chimneypots before soaring into the air with the Thames winding far below. The wind ruffles their hair as the dragon flies off, heading west along the river. They soar through clouds towards it, with the dragon's outstretched wings barely moving as the currents of air carry it along. They fly low over the river, and as they plunge deep into the water, Harry sees an image of Voldemort. The dark lord attacks a bank guard, and a finger recoils from a glowing ring, Tom Riddle's scorched diary, and the Horcrux locket as Voldemort spins and Harry surfaces. More images of Ron destroying the locket with the Sword of Gryffindor follow, prompting the dark lord to roar. Harry sees Hogwarts School, a dark-haired woman, and a banner with the eagle of the House of Ravenclaw, followed by the two-handled gold cup as Voldemort frowns, eyes staring, then turns uneasily. After surfacing again, Harry swims towards the shore and all three clamber out of the water onto a rocky outcrop, where they put on dry clothes. Meanwhile, Voldemort stalks amongst dead bodies in Gringotts Bank and speaks to his snake while the Malfoys stand nearby. Eyes wide with horror, Narcissa watches Voldemort and the snake as Griphook lies dead, still clutching the Sword of Gryffindor, which glows and slowly vanishes. Night falls in snowy Hogsmeade as Hermione, Ron, and Harry apparate nearby. The three friends run off while Death Eaters scour the village; two search a covered market, looking under stalls and lifting covers while the three fugitives crouch down, out of sight. Hearing the call, the two Death Eaters race from the market, and the trio runs up a set of narrow steps to reach a locked, barred gate. Beckoned by a shadowy figure, Harry moves to a doorway and enters, with the others following him down a staircase. They enter a stone-walled room lit by a solitary oil lamp, where Ron looks puzzled as Hermione and Ron see a painting on the wall—a moving portrait of a thin-faced girl with long, brown hair. Next to it, Hermione spots a mirror and sees Harry's face reflected back at her, noticing the bottom corner of the mirror has a piece missing. She looks surprised and turns to Harry, who inspects his own piece of mirror, which shows the back of Hermione's head. As Harry compares his shard with the missing section of the broken mirror, a bearded man comes in and sets down food and drink. Harry glares at Aberforth, who stares at Harry, then addresses the portrait. The girl in the portrait nods, turns, and walks away into the painting past trees and bushes as Hermione steps towards Harry, her eyes fixed on the painting.",
    "383": "The scene begins as we top the rise and the smoggy vastness of Los Angeles at twilight stretches out before us. It is late, and the supermarket is all but deserted. We are tracking in on a fortyish man in Bermuda shorts and sunglasses at the dairy case. His rumpled look and relaxed manner suggest a man in whom casualness runs deep. He is feeling quarts of milk for coldness and examining their expiration dates. The Dude glances furtively about and then opens a quart of milk. He sticks his nose in the spout and sniffs while a woman waits with arms folded. The Dude has his Ralph's Shopper's Club card to one side and is making out a check to Ralph's for sixty-nine cents. A small black-and-white TV next to her register shows George Bush on the White House lawn with helicopter rotors spinning behind him. The Dude is going up the walkway of a small Venice bungalow court. He holds the paper sack in one hand and a small leatherette satchel in the other. He awkwardly hugs the grocery bag against his chest as he turns a key in his door. The Dude enters and flicks on a light. His head is grabbed from behind and tucked into an armpit. We track with him as he is rushed through the living room, his arm holding the satchel flailing away from his body. Going into the bedroom, the outflung satchel catches a piece of doorframe and wallboard and rips through it, leaving a hole. The paper bag hugged to his chest explodes milk as it hits the toilet rim, and the satchel pulverizes tile as it crashes to the floor. His head is plunged into the toilet. Hands haul the Dude out of the toilet. The Dude blubbers and gasps for air. His head is plunged back into the toilet. The hands haul him out again, dripping and gasping. His head is plunged back in. The inquisitor hauls the Dude's head out one last time and flops him over so that he sits on the floor, back against the toilet. Looming over him is a strapping blond man. Beyond, in the living room, a young Chinese man unzips his fly and walks over to a rug. He starts peeing on the rug. The Dude gropes back in the toilet with one hand. The Dude's hand comes out of the toilet bowl with his sunglasses. The blond man stops to unzip the satchel. He pulls out a bowling ball and examines it in the manner of a superstitious native. The Dude puts on his dripping sunglasses. The blond man drops the ball, which pulverizes more tile. The two men look at each other. The Dude pulls his sunglasses down his nose with one finger and peeks over them.",
    "1137": "Ron peeks around a corner, and across the street behind him, Harry stands inside a small doorway. A woman in a neat business suit approaches, and Ron pretends to tie his shoelace as Harry casts a spell, causing the woman to faint. Ron helps Harry carry her inside, where they place her beside two unconscious men. Hermione plucks a hair from the woman's head, and they each hold a cup of Polyjuice. Harry morphs into Albert Runcorn, a man with dark hair, peeks out the door, and steps out, followed by Ron as the tall man with auburn hair and a mustache, Reginald Cattermole, and then by Hermione as the businesswoman, Mafalda Hopkirk. Inside, Harry and Ron, minus Hermione, join the men who are standing in lines outside cubicles. An older man pushes past, and Ron enters a cubicle while Harry waits for the next one. Harry enters his cubicle, shuts the door, looks up to see Ron, now Reg, peering over the dividing wall, looks at the pedestal, then at Ron, who frowns. Harry stands on the edge of the toilet, steps onto the bowl, pulls the chain, and is flushed spinning down the loo. He emerges in a green fireplace and steps out into a long tiled corridor, with Ron emerging further back along the corridor. Everyone is walking in the same direction, and Ron and Harry join them. Ahead, Harry sees guards in uniform, and two guards apprehend a man walking behind him. He joins a nervous-looking Hermione, both in their morphed shapes of Mafalda and Albert. A statue shows muggles being crushed, and Ron has joined them as they enter a lift. Yaxley, a Death Eater with a fair pigtail, addresses Ron, then walks away as the gate closes. The lift hurtles backwards, then shoots up, and when the gate slides open, Harry pushes Ron out to stand in a circular atrium. The lift reverses, descends, and two men scuttle across in front of Ron. The gate opens onto Umbridge, who steps in and turns to Harry. With stiff robotic movements, Harry gets out of the lift as the gate closes, then looks round at Hermione while the lift backs away and descends. Harry wanders along a curved corridor, passing a large open-plan office where clerks with wands flick copies of a booklet from their desks into trays. He passes with a herd of minions carrying papers, and an eyeball rotates in a peephole. Harry glances around, drops a small black object onto the floor that develops legs and feet, and it scuttles away, multiplying as it goes. Each one produces a horn and a white up-key on top, and they scatter among the desks in the open-plan office, erupting and causing a diversion.",
    "909": "Farther along the bulletin board, Dillinger finds black and white photos of himself. Others show more buildings, including photos of the Little Bohemia Lodge, the wrecked Ford, and a pair of confiscated Tommy guns, which he views after lowering his sunglasses. He crosses to a bulletin board showing mug shots of Billie, and the last mug shot of Dillinger himself remains unstamped. Dillinger lowers his shades and meets his mug shot's stern gaze. As he rounds a corner, he spies a group of agents around the radio, but one man glances over, and unrecognized, Dillinger moves on. In a cinema lobby, a fair-haired agent scans the surroundings while using a public phone, while elsewhere, another agent ends a call and shakes his head looking across the street. At the wheel of a parked car, Madala looks to Purvis, who is seated shotgun. A shaving kit lies open on a small, round table illuminated by a lamp's modest light, with a handgun beside it. Facing a mirror, Dillinger drags a razor down his lathered cheek, finishes shaving, and opens his pocket watch to eye Billie's photo and the time. He shuts the watch, puts it away, and pockets the gun. Parked near the Biograph, Purvis tensely rubs his thin-lipped mouth as a few anonymous patrons mill into the theater at the box office. The agent looks away, shifting his anxious gaze, then gets out of the car and paces down the sidewalk. He stops, turns, and puts his back to the cinema as a man arrives with two blonde women, one in a conspicuous orange skirt. Purvis blinks, looks over his shoulder, and spotting the trio, he looks away. Entering the packed house, the crime boss leaves Anna at her seat, then proceeds down the aisle with Polly to find adjacent seats as opening titles appear on the screen. In the packed audience, Dillinger stares intently at the screen through his spectacles. Outside, Purvis addresses his agents, pats Winstead's shoulder, and the team splits up. In the movie house, the crowd watches figures on screen playing hockey, followed by Clark Gable washing his hands in a men's room. Another character walks in, and Dillinger gazes at the screen with a boyish smirk as Gable shoots the man. Sitting on her own, Anna turns, peeking nervously over her shoulder, then faces the screen again, her chest heaving. Outside, agents take their positions as Winstead and Hurt duck into a storefront's recessed entryway. In the movie house, Dillinger watches the screen with a furrowed brow while leading lady Myrna Loy stares with her mouth agape. Dillinger gazes at her with a knitted brow and clenched jaw as the exotically pretty actress in a fur-collared coat wears a pensive expression. Later, she shifts her sober gaze and, later still, turns away from a door clad in black.",
    "1257": "On stage, a band who wears seahorses on their heads performs, and Carl turns to look as Allison walks onstage. Carl shakes his head incredulously as Allison plays a keyboard, wearing a spangly mini top hat. Carl stands with his hand on his heart, grins, and gazes at her. She pouts at the crowd, then furrows her brow. Carl sits at the bar with a bottle of beer, and smiling, Allison sashays up beside him. Carl sits at the bar, smiling and waiting as she glances over and beams. He looks down, and later they walk in the middle of a dark street, reach her scooter, and wrinkling her nose, she smiles as they both smile. Carl throws himself into bed and sets an alarm clock, which he then puts on his bedside table and switches off his lamp. He scowls at his phone, answers it, and switches the lamp on again. Early morning joggers stretch in front of a large observatory with three domes as a car races up the hill and comes to a halt. Carl climbs out, cans of energy drinks tumbling out when he opens the door, and he removes a can stuck to his shoe. He runs over, punches the air, bounds off, and sprints down a hill with the others jogging behind. They take snaps on their cameras while Carl leaps onto a bench by a couple hugging, snaps them with his phone, then darts off again. The group jog along a pathway on a hillside and find Carl collapsed on the ground, his eyes closed. Allison squats to start snapping Carl, and everyone else does the same. Allison and Carl stand together at the top of the hill as Carl downs a bottle of water, gasps in air, pretends to write notes, and nods thoughtfully. She slaps him across the arm. Carl and Peter eat in the garden of a restaurant, where Carl downs a glass of water. A Persian woman is present, and Carl picks up a basket that Peter's food was in. Peter stands to kiss Lucy, and they sit while Faranoush beams at her, and Lucy stares, flabbergasted. Norman opens his front door, and they're dressed as Harry, Ron, and Hermione. The others stare as guests play a game of mock Quidditch, and Carl smiles. The first Harry Potter film plays, and Norman gazes at the screen and waves. Carl and Allison stand up to leave, and Carl freezes as the party guests clap. Norman lets them out, and Carl and Allison zoom down a dark street on Allison's scooter, with Carl sitting behind her with his arms around her waist. The scooter wobbles unsteadily as Carl is driving, and he smiles nervously, eyes something on the other side of the street, and grins. Carl and Allison hurry towards a chain-link fence that has a gate which is locked.",
    "772": "Isaac stops for a security scan, and inside the opulent suite, he sits opposite a Saudi prince who holds an electronic document and wears a pair of sunglasses, with the tech reflected in them, before removing them. Meanwhile, a group of workers roll a storage crate through a darkened exhibition hall, opening it to reveal a replica of Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa which they use to replace the original. A man shines a torch on the hanging replica, highlighting Mona Lisa's mouth. A TV broadcast shows a Mayan temple as Jackson, a handsome, dark-haired man in his 30s, leaps off his couch, rushes into his bathroom to clean his teeth, answers the phone on his way out, silently curses his car, and walks out of the garage. He gets into a stretch limo with dark windows and drives off past the surface, noticing a jagged crack in the road as kids jump over it. Jackson arrives at his ex-wife Kay's house, while in San Francisco Harbor, people on a ship list up and down dramatically. As passengers stumble when the boat's hull crunches into the docks, ship stewards help them up while Harry and his friend Terry scan the area, frowning. Laura wakes up in bed, answers her phone, and in another location, Roland is driving when the back of his car explodes, flipping it forward and engulfing it in flames. Jackson's limo rounds a corner on the way to Yellowstone National Park. Inside the Oval Office, Wilson looks across at Anheuser as Laura enters with a newspaper featuring a story about Roland's death. She turns on the TV, ignoring Adrian, while Wilson eyes Anheuser who gets up to leave, and Adrienne follows before sitting heavily on a sofa. President Wilson sits in front of her, putting his hand over hers. At Yellowstone Park, Jackson drops his daughter Lily's hat over a fence and climbs after it, followed by Lily and her brother Noah along a sparse trail to a clearing with a parched lake basin. They head down to the cordoned-off, bubbly, marshy basin surrounded by big tripods, and approach a dead, rotting stag. Someone amongst the trees on a hillside watches them through binoculars, with steam rising from the lake bed around Jackson as he takes his kids' hands and a convoy arrives in front of him. The watcher in the trees is a man named Charlie Frost.",
    "367": "Mr. Soggybottom pulls a revolver out of his clown suit and loads a silver bullet just as Edward finally succeeds in throwing the beast off and rolls to his feet. The hell hound squares back on its haunches, growling and ready for another leap. Mr. Soggybottom sheds a clown tear and aims the revolver at the dog, but at the last moment, Edward moves just as Mr. Soggybottom fires, and the bullet catches Edward in the shoulder, knocking him down. The carnies gasp as the dog, licking its chops, approaches the helpless Edward, who feels the ground around him, looking for some kind of weapon. He finds only a small stick and waves it at the dog, ready to strike it. Like magic, the dog's whole demeanor changes, and it bounces excitedly, ready to play fetch. Seeing an opportunity, Edward throws the stick as far as he can, and the dog bounds after it, returning a beat later with the flaming stick, which it drops at Edward's feet, its tail whipping back and forth. Edward throws the stick again, and the dog takes off in a new direction. Exhausted from playing fetch all night, Edward throws the stick into the woods, and the still-spry dog goes after it. It's gone for a long time, long enough that Edward becomes concerned, so he follows it into the woods, finding Amos Calloway standing up behind a bush, buck naked and hairy, with the stick in his mouth. Amos takes the stick out as Edward approaches, and Edward tosses him his jacket to cover his privates, then Edward walks away and starts running, as he has to get there as soon as possible. Meanwhile, Amos sits down and scratches his ear with his foot. The scene descends on the main quad, finding Edward Bloom dunking his head in the fountain, then changing out of his grubby shirt into a new one, just out of the package. It's the mid-1960s, but by the conservative dress of the passing students, it could be any era. Edward stands with a bouquet of daffodils in front of a half-open door, through which we can see the edge of a young woman, talking in hushed tones with another girl we can't see. Finally, a decision is reached, and the door opens to reveal the woman of Edward's dreams, Sandra Kay Templeton, who is effortlessly beautiful, pure, and simple as sunlight. He can't believe he's finally reached her and half-laughs, nervous, which makes her laugh, not sure what's going on. Sandra is overwhelmed and all she can finally think of to say is put her hand on the door frame, where we see a diamond on her left ring finger. Watching Sandra, Edward's heart falls 20 floors, but he tries to suppress the reaction and put on a brave front.",
    "27": "At first only the turrets and rooftops are visible against a torrid sky. The facades of the Moorish buildings give way to a narrow, twisting street crowded with the polyglot life of a native quarter. The narrator's voice fades away. A police officer takes a piece of paper from the typewriter, turns to a microphone, and reads. An officer blows his whistle several times. There is pandemonium as native guards begin to round up people. A police car, full of officers, with siren blaring, screams through the street and stops in the market. Some try to escape but are caught by the police and loaded into a police wagon. At a street corner, two policemen stop a white civilian and question him. The civilian pats his pockets and brings out his papers. The second policeman examines them. Suddenly the civilian breaks away and starts to run wildly down the street. Jan and Annina Brandel, a very young and attractive refugee couple from Bulgaria, watch as the civilian passes. They've been thrust by circumstances from a simple country life into an unfamiliar and hectic world. A shot rings out, and the man falls to the ground. The policeman frantically searches the body, but only finds Free French literature. A European man, sitting at a table nearby, watches the English couple more closely than the scene on the street. A middle-aged English couple sit at a table just off the square and observe the commotion across the way in front of the Palais de Justice. The European walks over to the couple. The police van pulls up. The rear doors are opened and people stream out. Suspects are herded out of the van and into the Palais de Justice. At the entrance, the arrested suspects are led in by the police. He puts his left arm compassionately around the Englishman and reaches behind the man with his right hand. The Englishman seems to be taken aback by this sudden display of concern. As he pats both his breast and pants pockets he realizes there is something missing. The plane swoops down past a sign atop a building at the edge of the airport. As the plane lands a swastika on its tail is clearly visible. It taxis to a stop as a group of officers march into formation in front of it. Behind them stand a detail of native soldiers keeping guard. In the group is Captain Louis Renault, a French officer appointed by Vichy as Prefect of Police in Casablanca. When the plane door opens, the first passenger to step out is a tall, middle-aged, pale German with a smile that seems more the result of a frozen face muscle than a cheerful disposition.",
    "1011": "The Queen stares at the stag, transfixed, as it lowers its head to eat some grass. She continues to stare, then looks to her right and back at the still stag. The Queen turns again to her right and then back to the stag, which has vanished from sight, breaking into a smile as she casts her gaze skyward and dabs tears with a handkerchief, wiping her nose. Later, Tony stands before a mirror, putting on a tie, while video footage shows the ground covered with flowers and members of the public gathered around an arrangement of candles. Tony is then seen addressing some members of the public. As the Queen sits watching TV, Prince Philip enters, and the Queen looks from him to the TV. She gets in bed, removes her spectacles, and Prince Philip climbs in next to her. On Thursday, Tony sits in bed watching TV. Newspapers are strewn over the Queen's bed as she removes her spectacles, wearing a worried expression, and Tony raises his eyebrows. Outside Balmoral, the Queen walks with Corgis, later walking back with them running after her. Entering the kitchen, the staff stop working and leave as a servant places a phone on a table, which the Queen stares at for a moment. Later, in the kitchen, she sits back and tugs at her scarf, and Robin enters behind her. In a corridor at Balmoral, the Queen paces outside a door while the Queen Mother stands up, and they walk in the garden together, with the Queen stopping for a moment. Later, the Queen sits on a sofa in the study, sipping a glass of iced single malt, as a gillie on the misty hills hands a mobile phone to Prince Philip. Charles enters the study as the Queen sits on the sofa with her back to him; he turns and leaves, and the Queen remains seated. The gates of Balmoral are opened by two men, and Range Rovers emerge, flanked by bodyguards. Flash photography captures the moment as the doors to the Range Rovers open and the Queen emerges with Prince Philip, Charles, William, and Harry. They walk to the large collection of flowers outside the gate, observed by a large crowd. Tony is seen reading paperwork, glancing at the TV, smiling, and then walking to the kitchen table to playfully mess up one of his sons' hair, as the Royal Family continues to look at the flowers, watched by onlookers.",
    "1071": "She runs down the pier as the boat draws alongside. Nullah and Sarah peer through the smoke. The boy stands up on the prow of the boat and grins. He jumps up and down excitedly and runs off the boat onto the jetty. He runs up the wooden steps to the upper level of the wharf and sprints through the smoke towards Sarah. Nullah points and she turns slowly. There in the smoke stands the Drover. Their eyes meet and they walk slowly towards one another. Drover frowns in disbelief, then smiles and they embrace. They cling to each other, tears running down their cheeks. They break apart and look joyfully at one another, then kiss. Nullah runs up and hugs them both. Drover grins happily. The army sergeant sounds the horn of his truck and smiles. Dutton stops and stares at Sarah, Drover, and the boys. He's taken aback by her hug. The sergeant stomps up to the young priest. Fletcher grimly watches the boys, streaming towards the trucks. Sarah rests her head on Drover's shoulder and caresses his cheek. Dutton turns to them. Dutton smiles tearfully. He nods and walks away. Fletcher strides angrily towards the truck the boys are getting into. Dutton's the last on. The tailgate is raised and the trucks head off. Fletcher runs through the devastation, watched from the water tower by King George. Sarah's walking with Nullah. King George looks in horror as Fletcher grabs Bull's rifle. King George raises his arms in his magic-man stance as Fletcher advances with the rifle. King George watches Fletcher closely. Sarah smiles as Nullah runs towards the pub. Fletcher stands on top of a pile of wreckage and aims the rifle. Sarah spots the danger and, at the pub, Drover sees Fletcher. Drover runs for the boy. King George pulls a pipe off the water tower. Fletcher grimaces and Drover falls to the ground with Nullah. King George's pipe has run Fletcher through like a spear. King George glares at him. Drover strokes his hair. The unconscious boy's eyes flicker. Nullah grins. Fletcher tries to aim the rifle at King George. Fletcher winces and drops the rifle. Sarah reaches Drover and Nullah. Fletcher tries to speak and then collapses over a piece of wreckage. Sarah cuddles Nullah. Sergeant Callahan checks Fletcher's pulse. Sarah and Drover gaze into each other's eyes. They kiss, tenderly. Callahan walks away from Fletcher's body, across the wrecked King Carney cattle pen. Smoke hangs in palls over the destruction of Darwin. Drover drives the car in the sunshine, with Sarah and Nullah asleep next to him. Sarah picks up kindling for a fire in a field next to a river. She straightens and stares.",
    "186": "Annie's car pulls away. Behind Brackett, Sam Loomis walks up the street, and Brackett smiles as Loomis approaches. As they talk, the camera slowly moves around them, revealing a view of the street as Loomis' station wagon moves by. Through the blowing trees, the full moon rises in the night sky. Annie's car moves down a quiet residential street and pulls up in front of a two-story house set back from the street: the Doyle house. From the front seat of the station wagon, we see Laurie get out of Annie's car, say goodbye, and walk up to the Doyle house. Annie's car then makes a wide U-turn and starts down the other direction, with the station wagon pulling forward to follow her. Annie stops three houses down and pulls into a garage, while the station wagon stops several feet away. The shape gets out of the station wagon, staying close to the camera, obscuring himself from view, and glances down the street as gusts of wind blow the costumes of children going house to house. The shape moves, and the camera tracks behind him as he walks toward the Wallace house, stopping in front as Annie comes out of the garage and walks to another two-story frame house: the Wallaces'. The front door opens, and through the front room windows, we see Annie talking to the Wallaces as they put on their coats. The camera and shape quickly move behind a tree to hide from sight. The Wallaces step out of their house and walk to the garage as the shape steps out from behind the tree and stares at the house. Annie and Lindsey Wallace, a pretty little nine-year-old, stand in the doorway framed by the hall light. Annie closes the door. A police car pulls up in front of the Myers house amid the sounds of wind and chirping crickets. Brackett and Loomis get out and stand by the front gate. Inside, Annie turns on the TV, goes to the mirror on the wall, and begins to brush her hair. Looking down the side of the house, Loomis and Brackett walk up to the front porch. A broken, rusted rain gutter clangs back and forth against the house in the wind as the front door slowly opens. Brackett and Loomis stand in the doorway of a totally dark house. Brackett's flashlight comes on, illuminating the two men as they move through the house, with the camera tracking them. Suddenly, Brackett stops and trains his flashlight on a small object in the corner of the room. For a moment, Brackett doesn't speak.",
    "620": "He slows down in front of one house with a triple garage and box tree on the front lawn and pulls up onto the driveway. As the woman carefully adjusts the buttons on her pristine white cuffs, Mac and Juno, wearing everyday casual clothes, stroll up to the double-fronted door flanked by two slim furs. Mac wipes his feet on the doormat. The woman with neatly combed long dark hair opens the door with a bright smile. Juno slaps Gerta's profit hand. Vanessa purses her lips. Vanessa looks penetratingly at Juno. On the staircase, Juno, in her loose checked shirt over jeans, passes a lineup of post photos of Mark and Vanessa in white. She wanders into Vanessa's en suite bathroom and contemplates herself in the large mirror above the basin, smoothing the front of her hair. There are several expensive-looking bottles and jars grouped around the basin, next to a white orchid in a pot. Opening one jar, she scoops out a finger full of cream and dabs it on her face. Then she does a bodybuilder-type snarl and pose. Picking up a bottle of perfume, she sniffs it and sprays her wrist, rubbing it against the other wrist. As she comes out of the bathroom, she collides with Mark. Her eye lights on the guitar. Mac points to some apparatus. Vanessa smiles proudly. Mac's attempted conversation is met with a baffled look. Then, he and both women look up towards the sound drifting down from the floor above. With a brittle smile, tall slim Vanessa hurries upstairs to find Mark and Juno duetting on guitars. Mac is looking at some forms. Mark closes the front door with a wry smile. Vanessa presses her hands together as if in prayer and lets him fold her in his arms. Vijay speeds up, leaving Bleeker alone on the running track. Two boys pass him as he slows to a walk. At school, a grey-head starkly built woman in a mauve cardigan sits behind the desk, looking disapprovingly at Juno bulging. The woman grudgingly signs a pink form and hands it to Juno. Juno smiles sweetly and comes out into the corridor. A technician spreads gel across Juno's distended belly with an ultrasound scan head. On a monitor next to her, Juno watches moving patches of light and dark take on a recognizable shape. Leah and Bren sigh with delight. Bren's lips tighten. With a look that could kill, the ultrasound technician leaves the room. In her room, with its walls covered in drawings, Juno lies on her bed, her legs propped up on cushions, gazing at the ultrasound print. She blinks thoughtfully and moments later is driving Mac's blue Previa out to Glacial Valley estate past its immaculate houses and lawns blanketed in snow.",
    "626": "Holding the knife at belly level, he twists the long wide blade until he's looking at his own reflection in the polished steel. Glancing up, he reaches forward and positions the knife at a downward sloping angle at the base of the door. Turning the knife in different directions, cans, bottles, and boxes of food are reflected in the blade. Graham withdraws the knife and puts it down on the floor beside him. Then, frustrating himself on his belly, he makes to look under the door again. Having second thoughts, he grabs the knife and kneels up, setting the knife back down on the worktop. He rises to his feet and, head bowed, strides determinedly out into the hallway. Stopping in his tracks, Graham turns and marches back in, seizing the knife. He lies on his stomach by the pantry door. A clawed hand shoots out from under the door. Startled, Graham bangs his head and drops the knife. Retrieving the knife, Graham slices off the creature's fingers. Startled, the flock of birds springs from the maize fields, scattering and flying away. Later, Graham returns to the farmhouse, locking the door behind him, hurriedly checks the handle, then walks off past the open living room door. He stops dead and stares, seeing Bo, Morgan, and now Merrill on the sofa wearing silver foil cone hats. Without flinching, Graham turns stiffly and goes to sit on the stairs. Merrill sits still with his hands on his knees. Graham links his hands together. Merrill turns to Morgan. Graham makes a pained frown. Putting one hand on the post at the bottom of the stairs, Graham pulls himself wearily up and plods into the living room, moving up to the sofa. Bo holds up one arm. Graham does the same. Morgan and Merrill raise their arms. Graham eyes them uncertainly. All three. Merrill and Bo lower their arms, Morgan settles himself back down on the sofa. Graham hesitates a moment then steps forward, and sits beside his son on the end of the couch. Morgan peers up at his father. Merrill stares blankly ahead. He sighs. Now, in broad daylight, Merrill leaves his converted barn holding a large white cotton sack. A cigarette in one hand, he jogs down the grey-painted wooden stairs on the side of the building then trudges across the lawn towards the farmhouse. As he takes a drag on the cigarette, his attention is drawn to the field of maize. Merrill throws the cigarette butt to the ground, then slows to a gradual stop. Dumping the cotton sack, he reaches down, picks up a stone, and launches it into the field of maize. He stands immobile, watching the crop with anxious expectation.",
    "220": "Delmar whistles appreciatively and lurches threateningly to his feet as Everett scrambles up, watching the white-robed people following in the wake of the tenor. There are more and more white robes drifting through the woods, all of them strangely oblivious to the three men. The endless stream now drifts through the foreground, the background, and the campsite itself. We are booming down to reveal a minister in the foreground who stands belly-deep in the river, easing a white-robed man back-down into the water. Behind him, a line of robed singers lengthens steadily as people stream out of the woods. Pete, Delmar, and Everett emerge from the woods and gaze down at the river as white-robed people continue to drift past them. Delmar wades out into the stream, cutting in line, and reaches the minister, holding his nose as the minister incantates over him and lowers him into the water. Nearby, a smoldering twig fire burns while a bloodhound on a leash circles into frame, its tail fiercely wagging. We follow it as it waddles over to an empty tin of Dapper Dan pomade, nose to the ground and straining against its leash. Everett drives, shaking his head with a forebearing smile, while Pete, sitting next to him, and Delmar, in back, are both dripping wet. He shakes his head and laughs as a thirtyish black man in worn go-to-meetin' clothes stands on the shoulder, waggling his thumb at the passing car. The man grabs his battered guitar case as the car pulls over and trots up to the open window. Everett looks at the man in the rearview mirror as he pulls out, and Tommy shrugs, causing Everett's eyes to narrow as he studies the man. The car pulls into the parking lot of a single-story cement-block building with a hundred-foot antenna and a handpainted sign. As the men get out of the car, Everett snaps his suspenders and strides up to a portly middle-aged man who wears dark glasses and holds a white cane. Everett grimaces, thinking, as the three singing convicts form a semi-circle behind Tommy, who plays his guitar into a can microphone, performing a hot and harmonized version of 'Man of Constant Sorrow'. When they finish, Everett whoops and slaps Tommy on the back just as a caravan of two oversize cars pulls into the lot, and Tommy and the three convicts burst out of the station door, whooping it up. A sixty-year-old man in enormous seersucker pants held up by suspenders and the outward pressure of a blooming belly gets out of the first car, as Delmar waves a fistful of money at him. A big shambling man of about thirty follows him out of the car.",
    "298": "Stella takes a handful of oil and slaps it on Jeff's back, and he winces. She hits him with some more cold oil, and he winces again. Jeff gives an exasperated look. The camera pulls back as she helps Jeff to a sitting position, and he buttons on his shirt. The camera moves in as she helps him into the wheelchair, listening to him with exaggerated attention. He stops as he notices her attitude. Jeff now looks out to see what has happened to the old lady and the man with the flowers. The elderly lady is now asleep in her deck chair, her face covered with the Herald Tribune. Jeff's eyes travel up to the ballet dancer's window, where dreamily and methodically, she is brushing her long copper-colored hair. She is sitting near the window looking into an upright mirror. His eyes are suddenly turned in another direction, sharply to his left, where a shade has gone up, and a man, obviously a caretaker, is raising a window with some effort. Having accomplished this, he turns back into the room, and we now see him approach a young man and woman who are standing just inside the doorway. He is now looking at the windows of the apartments nearest to him. He hands a key to the young man and then obligingly brings in two suitcases which he places on the floor beside them. He gives them a studied but agreeable nod, then departs. We now see that the girl has a small hat with a veil and an ornate corsage pinned to her light blue tailored suit. The boy, who like the girl is perhaps twenty years old, wears a dark blue serge suit and a grey felt hat. Quickly they are in each other's arms, kissing passionately, crushing the girl's corsage and pushing her hat back a little. They part, the boy laughs nervously, and takes a furtive glance out toward the corridor. He looks back into the room and beckons her to come out. She follows him wonderingly. For a moment, both are lost from sight. When they reappear, he is carrying her in his arms over the threshold. He sets her down, closes the door, and they kiss again. Then slowly and significantly, she looks toward the open window. They part, still holding hands and looking into each other's eyes. He releases her hands, goes to the window and pulls down the shade, as she is reaching upward with both hands to unpin her hat. There is a soft, understanding look on Jeff's face, and he gives an involuntary sigh. He is unaware that Stella is now standing behind him. He freezes, turns slowly to look up at her. The camera makes a short sweep around the neighborhood showing that some of the rooms are now with their lights on.",
    "856": "A car comes from the opposite direction of a swarm of flies and screeches off the road towards a diner. Charlie sees it from a window and runs outside as the others watch the car stop. Jeep spots Charlie, and the door opens with Michael stepping out. He sees Charlie, clutching her belly, running towards him as Jeep runs beside her. Charlie slows down while Michael stares at her. Michael opens his mouth, teeth clenched, while Bob keeps a pump-action shotgun aimed at him. Michael sees a body, tilts his head, and snatches the pump-action from Bob. Kyle points his pistol as Michael holds the shotgun at Bob's forehead, causing Bob to close his eyes tightly. Percy comes outside, and Bob screws up his face as Michael keeps the shotgun in place. Jeep and Charlie watch transfixed. Michael takes his left hand off the barrel, keeps the right holding the shotgun, and then hands Bob the gun. Michael goes to the car's boot, opens it, and takes out assault rifles, handing them to Kyle, Bob, and Jeep. He rushes past Jeep and Bob, heads to Charlie, and hands her a pistol. Charlie watches him stride towards the diner as Audrey and Sandra come out. The wind rises, blowing dust around. Bob stares down the road and then moves as Jeep keeps his eyes on the road and runs to the diner. Inside, they barricade the doors; Jeep pushes an office desk against the back door, and Kyle looks out through blinds. Michael picks up an assault rifle and stands beside Jeep, casting a nervous glance at him. The lights go out, and a torchlight beam illuminates the diner with Bob shining one at Michael, who looks up at the ceiling. Bob leads the way through a skylight to a metal ladder and steps onto a metal walkway in front of the diner's unlit neon sign, with Percy, Kyle, and Michael accompanying him. They see a light in the distance, which turns out to be an ice cream van. Kyle and Bob turn to Percy, who steadies a rifle with his metallic hand. As the van approaches, in the diner, Audrey peeps out through the blinds, and Jeep is there with a big torch. The Frosty Treats ice cream van pulls into the forecourt and stops. Audrey joins her mom on the floor beside Howard, while Charlie ducks behind the counter with the pistol Michael gave her, and Jeep stays close by. The others on the roof watch as the driver gets out, revealing two long, bony hands clinging to the door frame as the ice cream man with a blue forage cap emerges.",
    "1383": "Sensing something in the shadows across the street, he rises, turns back, and slowly draws his wand. Then he sees it—something big, darker than the shadows which conceal it, with wide, gleaming. Harry steps back, afraid to look, his wand outstretched, and he trips, tumbling over the forgotten trunk. The tip of his wand blazes; bang! Twin beams of blinding light spear the night. Stan eyes Harry suspiciously and nods slowly. As Stan grabs Harry's trunk, Harry peers into the shadows across the street—now simply shadows—and climbs aboard. Inside are only beds. In one bed, a disheveled wizard grunts and turns over in his sleep. Bang! Ernie rockets away, and the beds as one slide six inches to the rear. Harry drops onto the bed nearest him and peers up at the chandelier swaying directly above his head. Beyond the windscreen, oncoming traffic whips past in a blur. Stan, huddled in an armchair, peeks over The Daily Prophet, eyes Harry coolly, then disappears once more. Stan grins with sinister delight, showing bad teeth, as the Shrunken Head cackles with delight and Harry peers out the windscreen, watching London careering by. Sure enough, directly ahead, a little old lady is crossing the street. Ernie hits the brakes hard, and Harry flies forward, palms to the window; the brakes pinch down, the bus stops inches from the old lady, and Harry flies back onto his bed. Bang! The bus rockets forward once more. As Harry rights himself, he notices the headline of Stan's Daily Prophet: Escape from Azkaban! Below it, a sunken-faced man with long, matted hair glowers from a moving photograph. Harry shakes his head, still staring at the man's face. Harry nods, and as he does, Black's eyes shift. Just then, a pair of double-decker buses sweep directly toward the Knight Bus. Before he can scream, the entire Knight Bus squeezes down and shoots the gap between the two onrushing buses. The Shrunken Head winces. As the Knight Bus rockets off, Tom and Harry are revealed; Harry glances up and reads the sign above: The Leaky Cauldron. Tom drags Harry's trunk inside, then pauses, and with a flick of his wand, silences the car alarm. Harry trails Tom through the quiet room, where the bartender glances up, his gaze lingering perhaps a bit too long. A solitary wizard reads a book while, at his elbow, his coffee cup stirs itself. Tom leads Harry upstairs, and as Harry follows Tom inside, he finds a snow-white owl (Hedwig) perched atop a chair. Harry turns and finds a pinstriped silhouette (Cornelius Fudge) at the window, staring at the ghostly shadows beyond. Harry's reflection shivers in the glass, but the man doesn't turn. Tom takes a position against the wall, fishes a pair of walnuts from his pocket, and—crack—crushes the shells between his palms.",
    "400": "Fergus enters with a tray and some breakfast, where Maguire is sitting stock-still, and Maguire shakes his head twice and looks hard at him before rising and dragging Fergus out the door. Maguire then goes back to the house where Jody is sitting with the hood on again as Fergus enters without saying anything. Fergus takes a plate, brings it toward Jody, lifts up Jody's hood to expose his mouth, and begins to feed him, saying nothing and shaking his head before feeding himself and then feeding more to Jody. Jody chuckles under his hood as Fergus walks toward him and pulls off the hood, causing Jody to smile up at him and Fergus to laugh. She pulls the hood down over him and whacks him with a pistol, after which Fergus lifts the hood a bit to reveal Jody's mouth bleeding and looks moved. Fergus walks toward him, their faces close as he searches for her picture. The door opens to reveal Maguire with another man, and Fergus turns toward them. Fergus walks toward Maguire, and the other man walks forward and takes his seat, with Maguire, Jude, Fergus, and others around. Maguire lights a cigarette, and Fergus looks at him and nods, then turns back as Fergus leaves. Fergus takes his place in the chair beside Jody, who begins to laugh under the hood. Fergus takes out a cigarette, lights it, and lifts up Jody's hood so he can smoke while Fergus watches him puff the cigarette, the hood just above his lips, and then Jody coughs but keeps the cigarette in his lips. Fergus gently takes the cigarette from his mouth, remaining silent with wet eyes as the farmhouse is covered in mist. Maguire opens the greenhouse door and clicks the chamber of his gun while Fergus has a gun in his hand. Fergus takes Jody, with his hands tied behind his back, by the elbow, and Jody rises as Fergus leads him through the door past Maguire. Fergus turns with sudden fierceness and pulls Jody through the fields, pushing him through a copse of trees with the gun at his back, and then pulls the hood off. Jody looks around him with a cut lip from where Jude struck him and is prodded on by Fergus with the gun; Jody stumbles forward while Fergus is cold and businesslike. Jody suddenly sprints, loosens the ties on his hands, frees them, and runs off like a hare, causing Fergus to scream in fury after him, aim, change his mind, and run. Fergus gains on him, stretches his arm out, but Jody sprints ahead again as if playing with him, laughing in exhilaration as Fergus pants behind him, wheezing and almost laughing.",
    "577": "She is shocked, embarrassed, pleased, and conflicted, experiencing an instant and wide spectrum of emotions. Joe is happily confounded by all the interaction. Joe hears Susan's question but, as he studies her, doesn't answer. Drew reacts to this allusion of intimacy. Joe rises, follows Parrish to the door, and stops, then pivots and follows Parrish out the proper door. Parrish turns back to the bedroom. Joe tests the springs. Coyle regards his peanut butter sheepishly, and Joe raises the spoonful of peanut butter in a kind of toast to the staff. A spectacular indoor Olympic pool with a window commands views of the skyline. Susan is swimming laps, looking very professional in a black Speedo suit, and Joe wanders in, still licking his peanut butter. He observes her, but she is unaware of him; however, as she makes a barrel turn, his shadow falls over a reflection from a window, and she aborts her lap, looking up to see who it is. Susan climbs out of the pool, gets halfway up the ladder, and points to a stack of towels. Joe turns to the towels, but one hand is occupied with the spoonful of peanut butter; he shifts it to the other hand, can't manage the huge Turkish towel one-handed, so he implants the spoon in his mouth, lifts the towel with both hands, and presents it to Susan. Joe continues to nibble at his peanut butter until he finishes the spoonful. He shifts the spoon from hand to hand, starts to stick it in his pocket, and realizes this is inappropriate. Susan holds her hand out to him, he places the spoon in it, and she sets the spoon on the table with the towels. She watches, fascinated, as Joe licks his gums, enjoying every last bit of his spoonful. Parrish regards Joe, noticing the tie is a sorry mess now, a batwing of silk stretching across his collarbone. Parrish is startled and regards Joe carefully. Silence follows as Joe considers the point, and Parrish quickly crosses to him, undoes the tie, and begins tying it for him. He completes the tying of Joe's tie with some difficulty, adjusts it beautifully on Joe's collar, then spins him around in front of a mirror. Joe, catching sight of his own appearance, rises to the balls of his feet, quite taken. They stride on, cutting through the crowd, with Joe all at home in his new surroundings, but Parrish just the opposite, uncharacteristically uncomfortable, phrases forming on his lips but unspoken, then suddenly he blurts out. Jennifer wheels and heads right back to the office as Parrish arrives at the door to the Board Room. Parrish hesitates, nods, conceding the point, reaches for the doorknob, and enters, with Joe following right behind him.",
    "261": "Similarly producing a long wooden match, biting down on the cigar, and dragging the kitchen match along the unfinished wood surface of an expensive bureau, leaving an ugly black scar, the match erupts into roaring flame, crackling as it is lit, from the inside of the office. The name on the pebbled glass is a backwards Nathan Arizona. There is the shadow of a man approaching the door, and muffled voices. The door swings open and Nathan stands looking in, his middle-aged secretary hanging at his elbow. Nathan is staring toward his desk where the Biker sits with his back to us, jackboots propped lazily on the desk. His head bobs and ducks, as if he is following some movement in the air in front of him. Eyes on the Biker, Nathan slams the door shut behind him, looking for some reaction, but the Biker still does not react to Nathan, not even bothering to give him a glance. His eyes continue to follow some phantom movement, and when the Biker speaks, it is still without looking at Nathan, and in a surprisingly soft voice and mild, unhurried manner. He takes a drag on his cigar. SMALLS is pleasantly shaking his head, while Nathan is looking at him stonily. Quick as a flash, the heretofore languid Smalls bolts forward, his fist stopped an inch short of Nathan's nose, his index finger and thumb pinched together, holding the leg of a struggling fly that he has just plucked from the air. He flicks the fly away, and Nathan stares grimly at Smalls then swivels to punch numbers on a telephone. Nathan swivels back, looking up, and his speech stops short. The office is empty. A whipcrack effect builds to the cut, and he has been slumped over the kitchen table, asleep. Hi looks up as Gale and Evelle are smiling down at him. Hi takes the envelope that he was slumped over, with \"to Ed\" written on its face. There is a harsh knock at the door and all three tense. Hi is staring as the knock comes again. He goes to the door, pulls back its shade, and peeks out, looking at Glen evenly. Hi is suddenly nervous and urgent, taking one step down and holding out a calming hand as Glen takes two nervous steps away and reassures himself by resting a hand on the door of his station wagon, while Hi stops short. Glen smiles, spits on the dirt in front of him, and Hi's face is set in rigid dismay as Glen gets into his car, slams the door, and the car squeals off. Hi looks back at the trailer as a slat in the window blind drops back into place. He opens the door as Evelle is already emerging from the bedroom with the baby in his arms.",
    "430": "Eddie walks over to the water cooler, and his face is buried in his lap as Charlie massages his back. Behind him, in the washroom, is Fats, washing his face and hands. Charlie gets Eddie a bottle, while Bert and Henry watch Eddie coldly. A drunken, exhausted Eddie nods, looks up at Bert, grins maliciously, and takes a drink. Charlie starts to put away Eddie’s cue stick. Fats emerges from the washroom, dries his hands, and looks at Eddie and then at Bert, who nods. Henry helps Fats into the jacket with the carnation still in the lapel, and Eddie grins at this. So does Bert. Fats opens his palms for the sprinkling of the talcum powder, rubs his hands together, then takes out his cigarette case. Bert smiles in appreciation. Eddie grabs the leather case out of Charlie’s hands, rises, and confronts Fats almost scornfully, then looks down at his own dirty, disheveled shirt. He and a smiling Bert exchange glances as Eddie moves to put on his jacket. Charlie confronts him, and Eddie puts a bottle into the pocket of his jacket and returns to the table to screw together his cue stick. The sight of Fats makes him laugh again, and everyone stares at Eddie as he scratches his head, alone with his private joke. Eddie abruptly tosses his cue case away, and a worried Charlie picks up the case and stands by mutely, watching Eddie disintegrate. Eddie leans over to shoot, then turns away, laughing loudly to himself, while Fats watches him soberly, patiently. From a high angle, Fats is shooting, and Eddie is asleep on a stool against a wall, with even Bert dozing. The shots go in, and Eddie bangs his head against the wall, knocking over a bottle as he tries to get up off the stool. The noise startles him, and Charlie watches sadly. Eddie gropes through his pockets and comes up with a few crumpled bills. Fats rises and tosses his cue on the table, and Willie gives him the stake money. Fats confronts Eddie, steps by him, and heads for the coat rack, slapping the stake money into Bert’s hand as he goes by. Bert returns the money to his billfold, wordlessly. The blinds are drawn and the light strikes Eddie in the eyes, but still he stumbles after Fats, holding his money out before him, pleading. He bangs against the corner of the table and falls onto the floor. Fats hears him go down and pauses, turning to see Charlie rush to Eddie’s side. After a moment, Fats continues on toward the door. Charlie slaps Eddie’s cheeks as Bert, Sausage, Willie, and Preach step around the body on their way out. Eddie is lying on his bed staring at the ceiling, the crashing of pool balls sounding in his head.",
    "760": "The boy's mouth turns down, and he sulks silently, staring blankly ahead. Behind him, the door opens, and a woman enters. She pauses, hands on hips, then walks towards him. They are both reflected in the curved screen of an old TV, so the edges of the room look distorted. She stands beside him, arms folded. The woman crouches beside the boy, looking into his face. The boy turns and looks at her. She stands and folds her arms again. He's hunched forward, head down. The boy lifts his head. The boy goes to the window. Outside in the sunshine, children are playing in a park with a high chain-link fence. An oblong box with purple wrapping is propped on the seat of a bench facing him. Children chase past the bench, as the boy walks slowly towards it, holding on to the fencing for support as he negotiates the two steps down into the park. He sits on the bench and picks up the purple package with his good right hand, undoes the white ribbon around it, and tears at the paper. Inside is a brown cardboard box. The boy pulls off the lid, folds back purple tissue paper, and stares down. In the box is a comic, upside down. Very carefully, the boy turns the comic around on its bed of purple tissue. The cover features a heroic figure in a yellow cape fighting a powerfully built creature, half-man, half-beast, against a backdrop of New York skyscrapers. The woman sits gently beside the boy. The boy continues to stare down at the comic. She looks away and back at him. He glances up at her for a moment. As he looks down again, the words and colors fade, leaving a more detailed black and white version of the comic cover. The dark-haired young man in a suit and tie, whose face is reflected in the glass over the drawing, nods. The young man grins. Elijah limps across the gallery using a cane. Elijah turns back to stare at the man. As he does, David strides towards the gallery with Joseph a few paces behind. Inside, Elijah is walking away from the door and doesn't look around. Elijah turns. They're sitting in an office. Joseph gazes up at his father. Joseph looks from David to Elijah, then gets up and goes. Elijah, in a shimmering, purple, silk suit, gazes at David. David looks around as Joseph returns. David is sitting up on a bed, a pillow behind his head, reading the paper. Joseph is asleep, lying across him, his head on David's chest, one arm flung around him. David lowers the paper and glances at his son. He closes the paper and very carefully slides out from under the sleeping boy.",
    "357": "Aragorn and Arwen look on Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin as they stand before them. The four hobbits, dressed in their old clothes, clean and mended, bow their heads. Aragorn raises his hand and drops on one knee, kneeling before the hobbits, his head bowed, followed by all assembled there. Tears spring into Frodo's eyes as he clutches Sam's shoulder, and 4000 people pay homage to the courage of two little hobbits from the Shire. The camera rises into the air away from the crowded citadel until Minas Tirith becomes a speck in the landscape, dissolving into the parchment map of Middle-earth, slowly drifting across the map towards the west, revealing Hobbiton bathed in a warm sunset as Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin ride into shot on ponies, past Odo Proudfoot who shakes his head at the strangeness of their appearance. Frodo brings a round of drinks to the table, and nearby, a huge fuss is being made of a large pumpkin which has been brought in to be shown off. The four friends look at each other, a world of experience now separates them from their fellow hobbits. Seated at a long table, the four friends raise their glasses. Sam's eye is suddenly caught by Rosie Cotton who is serving behind the bar. Sam steels himself and leaves to go and talk to Rosie. Frodo, Merry, and Pippin exchange smiles as on a beautiful sunny day, Sam and Rosie are married, with their dearest friends gathered around them. Rosie throws a beautiful bouquet of flowers, and it's caught by Pippin who smiles in embarrassment. Frodo walks through Bag End to his study, hunched over a desk, to reveal Bilbo's red book open on Frodo's desk. He is writing in the last chapters in careful neat handwriting. Frodo turns back the pages, revealing: There and Back Again -- A Hobbit's Tale, by Bilbo Baggins. He writes below it as Sam Gamgee calls out from the door. Frodo winces with a sharp gasp of pain, puts the pen down, and clutches at his shoulder. Sam has entered the room and stands behind Frodo. He is drawn and pale, and Sam is at a loss for words. On a cold winter's morning, out of the fog rattles a small covered wagon; Gandalf is at the reins. Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin are waiting on ponies for the wagon, all wearing their grey elven robes. Gandalf arrives in his cart, and the wagon trundles along at a sedate pace. Sam, Merry, and Pippin ride behind, leading Frodo's empty pony. Frodo is sitting in the wagon with his arm around his uncle Bilbo. Bilbo is extremely old and frail, dozing, his head slumped, and Bilbo's eyes flutter open.",
    "849": "The possessed clamber and crawl over the van, scratching the windscreen with their fingernails. Charlie picks up a machine pistol, but Michael stops her, takes the machine pistol, and picks up an assault rifle. Bob and Jeep pull the planks away from the door and open it as Michael walks out, guns blazing, causing the possessed to drop dead. A couple run at Michael, and he batters them away, then pulls out two pistols and shoots more. He gives another one a kick, shoots him, and lays into a couple more by the van. Michael takes a nozzle from a fuel pump, sprays gas over the back of the van, and lights it, causing the possessed to flee as the van is engulfed in flames. Inside, Audrey cowers fearfully and moves over to the passenger seat as Michael smashes the driver's window, grabs her hand, yanks her out, and they run off before the van blows up, throwing them into the diner. Charlie fills a jug with water and turns to see the boy, causing her to drop the jug as he slashes the front of her shirt with a big kitchen knife. Charlie recoils and holds up a metal tray as the boy stabs at her, and the knife sticks in the tray. His hands slide down the blade, and the knife drops to the floor as the boy stares at his bloody hands. Charlie lowers the tray and kicks him over as Michael clambers in front of her and aims his gun, but the boy has disappeared. The lights go out, plunging the place into darkness, and Michael runs over to where the boy was. Bob and Jeep come over, shining a torch on the ground, revealing a trail of blood. Jeep aims his torch beam up, following a trail of bloody handprints across the ceiling until the trail stops dead. The boy appears behind Bob and tries to throttle him, but Michael grabs the boy and hurls him away, and Jeep shoots him. Charlie bends forward, grimacing, as Michael stares at him and holds Charlie's hands, with Audrey at them both. Bob steps out onto the roof to join Jeep as Michael keeps holding Charlie, her mouth gaping. The building shakes, and up on the roof, Bob and Jeep stare out into the darkness as bright light flashes all around, illuminating hundreds of possessed standing motionless, staring at the diner. Charlie's mouth gapes as Audrey gently lifts the baby, smiling incredulously, wrapping the bloody child in a towel, and offering it to Charlie. A tear rolls down Charlie's cheek as she faces away from the child. Audrey carries the baby over to Sandra, who stares at it, frowning, but then smiles and nods. Behind her back, Sandra twists her hands within the ropes bound around them as Audrey and Michael exchange a look, and he shakes his head. Sitting behind Charlie, Michael leans to her with a sincere expression.",
    "485": "Mary walks slowly to the window, realizing that the terrible voice is coming from the house behind the cabins. The camera follows her to the window, and once there, we see the light is still on in the upstairs bedroom, and the voice is coming from that room. Mary stands by the window, listening with mounting distress, concern, and sympathy. She turns her face away, gazing sadly at the little empty room, then turns to look out the window. We see Norman coming down the path, carrying a napkin-covered tray. Mary looks at him for a moment, then turns quickly, goes to the door, opens it, and goes out onto the porch. Mary pauses outside the door, about to start forward when Norman comes around the building, walks along the porch past the office, stopping only when he is close to her. He stares with painful embarrassment at the knowing look in her eye. She begins to back into her room, and Norman starts to follow but hesitates as he sees the total picture of an attractive young woman and a motel room. Bringing down the tray of food, in defiance of his mother's orders, is about the limit of his defiance for one day. Without waiting for approval or disapproval, he turns and hurries to the office. Mary looks after him, her face showing amused sympathy, then follows. Norman looks about, tray in hand, sees there is no reasonable place to spread out a supper. He turns and sees Mary standing in the doorway. As Norman goes about spreading out the bread and ham and pouring the milk, we follow Mary across the room. She notices the paintings on the wall; nudes, primarily, and many with a vaguely religious overtone. Finally, Mary reaches the sofa, sits down, and looks at the spread. Mary begins to eat, her attitude a bit tense. She takes up a small slice of ham, bites off a tiny bite, and nibbles at it in the manner of one disturbed and preoccupied. Norman gazes at her, at the tiny bite she has taken, smiles, and then laughs. Mary looks at him, with some compression, and smiles. Norman turns slowly, looking at her with a striking coldness. The fury suddenly dies, abruptly and completely, and he sinks back into his chair. Mary watches the troubled man, almost physically pained by his anguish. She goes out of the parlor. We see her from Norman's viewpoint as she crosses the small office and goes out into the night. He goes into the office and looks at the book. He goes back into the parlor with a mystified expression. Norman turns his ear from the direction of the sounds, seems to be fighting an impulse to listen, or more than listen.",
    "1131": "Lying on the ground, Ron lowers his head as Scabior scrutinizes Harry's disfigured face; Harry's face is bloated, and his right eye is closed. Scabior grips Harry's collar as they walk the path towards the Malfoy Manor house. Scabior releases his hold as they near the gate, with Hermione and Ron close behind, each escorted by a Snatcher. Bellatrix Lestrange waits eagerly behind the iron gate as Scabior pulls back Harry's fringe to reveal the scar on his forehead. Bellatrix has Harry on his knees in front of the Malfoys and looks expectantly at Draco. Narcissa Malfoy pulls Lucius back and points at Hermione when she spots the Sword of Gryffindor held by a Snatcher. Bellatrix is hurled backwards as her wand shoots out a snake which twists round Greyback's neck, and a whip coils around Scabior, dragging him along the floor as Scabior and Greyback stagger away. Bellatrix grabs Ron, and Peter Pettigrew, Wormtail, locks Harry and Ron in a cellar. They run to the gate and clutch the bars as a figure emerges from the gloom of the vast, crypt-like cellar, and Ron's deluminator lights a lantern. Hermione is pinned to the floor as Bellatrix sticks her wand in Hermione's arm. Ollivander, the wand-maker, is present, and Harry holds the piece of broken mirror, looking into it and seeing someone else's eye. Ron's deluminator absorbs the light as Wormtail returns, pointing his wand at the goblin, Griphook, who stands beside Ollivander. Griphook walks towards the gate, looks back, then climbs the stairs. Ron flicks on the deluminator, and as the light returns, a small figure apparates. Dobby stands between Luna and Ollivander and takes their hands; the three disapparate. The cellar is dark, and Wormtail opens the gate but is struck from behind and falls on his face. Dobby waits holding Wormtail's wand, and the Snitch flies to Harry from a fallen Snatcher. A strand of hair falls onto Hermione's coat as Bellatrix cuts Griphook with a dagger and looks down at Hermione. Ron has a wand, and Harry catches Bellatrix's wand and aims at Lucius. Bellatrix has Hermione, holding a dagger at her throat while grinning. Harry's back to normal as Lucius glares at Draco, who freezes, and with a sneer, his father pulls up his own shirt sleeve to reveal the Dark Mark tattoo on his arm. Lucius raises his right hand, about to lay it on the mark, as Bellatrix presses the dagger against Hermione's throat. They all look up as high above, Dobby unscrews a chandelier. Hermione runs into Ron's arms, and Harry snatches the wands from Draco and stuns Lucius, also magicking Narcissa's wand away. Dobby stands on a balustrade, his arms outstretched, and the trio and Griphook with the Sword of Gryffindor grab hold of him. Bellatrix flings her dagger towards them as they disapparate, and the dagger vanishes with them.",
    "542": "Thunder explodes in the distance as lightning flashes, while the Mercedes-Benz drives into the courtyard of a formidable stone castle. Indy reaches into the back seat to retrieve his bullwhip, and he glances up at Elsa's beret, which she adjusts. A butler walks to the door and opens it to reveal Indy and Elsa standing outside in the rain, with Elsa now wearing Indy's fedora and Indy wearing Elsa's beret. Indy, followed by Elsa, steps inside, shaking the water from his overcoat, and as he does so, he pushes past the startled butler, pulling a handkerchief from the man's pocket. Elsa follows, taking off her coat, while Indy sneezes hard and dabs at his nose with the handkerchief as Elsa looks on in amused amazement. The butler falls against a wall tapestry, sliding down to the floor, unconscious. Indy and Elsa move cautiously and quietly down the wide, vaulted hallway, creeping past a room full of Nazi soldiers who are working around a large table with a map atop it, and Indy reacts to the sight of them. Indy and Elsa continue down the hallway, with Indy carrying a gun in his hand and his whip hanging from his belt. He steps to a closed door and listens, then points out an electrical wire, studies the situation for a moment, and decides to enter one of the other doors. He knocks at the door, but there is no response, so he looks back at Elsa and enters. The room is dark and empty, and Indy throws open the window shutters to look out at the rain coming down in sheets. There is a wide ledge beneath each window, but below that is a sheer drop. Indy leans out the window and wraps his bullwhip around some wires that protrude from the castle wall above the next window. He swings from the window to a stone gargoyle and then takes hold of the bullwhip with both hands, pushes off with his feet, and swings toward a shuttered window with his feet extended, crashing through the wooden shutters as a clap of thunder disguises the noise. Indy crashes through the shutters and glass into the room, stunned and sinking to one knee as his father, Professor Henry Jones, steps out of the shadows. Indy gets to his feet, and now they look at each other, pressing themselves against the wall, with Henry still holding a broken vase in his hand. Indy steps to the window and looks down while Henry moves to a lamp to hold the vase under the light for a closer look, all the while focused on the broken vase.",
    "1229": "A square of his chest is bare beneath a sheet as Emily is wheeled down a hospital corridor on a gurney. Dr. Briar comes to see her in an operating room, and Dan weeps. A surgeon lifts Tim's heart out of his body and carefully passes it to a colleague. Dr. Briar and her colleagues are operating on Emily as a medic opens the door of the operating room to let in another medic who is carrying Tim's heart in a stainless steel bowl. Emily, anesthetized and wearing a theater cap, lies on the operating table. There is a golden, dream-like image of Emily and Tim sitting in the shade of the tree and entwining their fingers. Emily's new heart lies still in the open cavity of her chest while Dr. Briar looks up at the monitor, which is flat-lining. The heart begins to beat, and Emily lies peacefully on the operating table, eyes closed. The real Ben sits miserably in Tim's motel room, staring at a wall of newspaper cuttings about the crash. There are also photos of the people Tim helped and an article on Ezra. Ben sifts through envelopes, each of which has the name of a person Tim wanted to help, including Ben's. Ben hands Emily a list of the people written on the back of a photo of Sarah and a photo showing Tim standing at Holly's hospital bedside. In her garden, Emily weeps as she reads Tim's letter to her. Glum and pensive, Emily lies in a bathtub, and her head and shoulders are framed by the water. Emily slowly submerges herself so that her ears are beneath the water and lies with her eyes closed, listening. Wearing a delicate summer dress, Emily walks in a sunny park and approaches a children's choir singing in the open to an audience of adults who clap along. Ezra is playing the piano, and Emily watches and looks moved. When the songs ended, Ezra points the audience's standing applause towards the choir and rises, bows, then gestures to the choir again. Emily watches intensely through wide, gentle eyes and cranes her neck to keep track of Ezra as he leaves the stage and moves effortlessly towards members of the audience. Emily walks over to Ezra as he chats to some of the children in passing. He turns to her confidently; he's no longer blind. Emily shakes her head, her eyes begin to fill with tears and glisten. Emily nods and blinks back tears as light dawns in Ezra's eyes. He smiles gently, and Emily smiles through her tears, which roll down her cheeks. Ezra gazes at her incredulously and shakes her hand, and another big tear rolls down Emily's cheek.",
    "1143": "A merman prepares to attack, but Cedric appears with a transparent bubble of air over his mouth and nose, using his wand to free Cho, which scares off the merman. Cedric taps his watch as Harry nods and draws his wand to release Hermione, but a sharp, pointed trident is held at his throat. Harry turns as the open mouth of a grinning shark, which has human legs and arms and wears red shorts, looms towards him. The shark flashes past, bites through the rope, and swims off with Hermione. Harry takes a firm grip on Ron's arm, then looks at the girl with long, fair hair floating alone. He looks cautiously at the merpeople hiding in the weeds and uses his wand to release the little girl. As the time approaches eight minutes to 12, Cedric and Cho are the first to the surface and swim ashore. Meanwhile, Dumbledore and Crouch hurriedly descend the stairs of the pavilion. Hermione appears on the surface with the shark, which immediately transforms its head into Viktor Krum. Wrapped in a dressing gown, Fleur watches the water anxiously. As Harry struggles towards the surface with Ron and the little girl, he notices his hands are no longer webbed and is suddenly attacked from below by a horde of vicious little squid-like grindylows with sharp teeth and many legs nipping at his ankles. He tries to kick them away and releases his grip on Ron and the little girl, pushing them up towards the surface. As he clutches his neck, hundreds of the creatures attack him, almost suffocating him with their tentacles. Struggling to fight them off, he pulls out his wand, and sparks fly, stunning the grindylows and sending them flying in all directions. Harry then sinks to the bottom. As the clock strikes twelve, Ron and the little girl bob to the surface, and Fleur leans out over the water, stretching out her hand. With his gills now gone, Harry drifts helplessly, looking up at the patch of light above his head, and with a last desperate effort, raises his wand and rockets out of the water onto the landing stage, gasping for air. Fleur kisses Harry and Ron and wraps a towel around him, while Dumbledore puts his wand to his throat and Karkaroff is furious. Harry is with Crouch as wild-haired Moody glares at Crouch with his mad, rolling eye and flickers his tongue. Crouch stares back into Moody's scarred face, then walks away looking confused. Moody swigs from his hip flask. The scene shifts to the forest at night, where Harry sees a black hat lying on the ground and clutches the scar on his forehead. A man lies on his back among the fallen leaves, heaped-in and lifeless. Harry approaches Professor Dumbledore's room, finds the door closed, and Moody opens it.",
    "782": "Jane starts her day by going to the bathroom to moisturize her hands and then does some work on her laptop. Shuffling papers, she glances at the door before doing sit-ups and cleaning the cooker in rubber gloves. Jane struggles with her emotions, and the next day, the sisters arrive at Hell's hardware store. Jane lets the door close on Tess as her father stares disapprovingly at Jane's agonized expression. While Tess and George flirt in his office, Jane frowns upon seeing Kevin's name in her filofax, then decides to dial Kevin's number. Kevin grins and hangs up, while a youngster with a baseball glove enters, and Pedro frowns. They arrive at the Department of Parks and Recreation Youth Sports ground, where Pedro grins at them from the baseball field as Jane rolls her eyes in disbelief. A large bunch of yellow flowers is delivered, and Jane hands them to Tess with a tight smile. Later, she brings paperwork to George's office, grinning as he happily talks on the phone, but her smile fades at the sight of pictures of him and Tess. They all have dinner at Jane's father's house, where she unhappily stuffs her face with food as Tess chatters and the men smile. At her apartment, Jane finds Tess and George kissing on the couch and, feeling crushed, leaves them to it and goes out again. She attends a leather and bondage wedding, wearing a spiked leather collar, trying to be in a party mood. Jane flicks the heavy metal devil horns at George and Tess, who do the same as they grin. When they kiss, Jane looks mortified as Casey catches her eye. George holds up two ties for her approval, and he nods tight-lipped as she knots the tie. She smiles after him and heads back to her desk. In the evening at the office, Jane tidies away files on George's desk and finds his wallet underneath. After consulting his appointments, she sighs and leaves. A taxi pulls up outside a restaurant, and Jane gets out. Tess looks stunned, and Jane is at a loss. A small white box is tucked in the dog's collar, which contains a diamond ring. He slips the ring on her finger, and they kiss as Jane stands helplessly nearby. It's a wedding dress, and Jane later meets up with Kevin in a bar, where she looks pleased with herself. He takes her hand, and Jane stares in shock across the Central Park boating lake before they return to their yoga. There's a meeting at the New Warsaw bakery, where Kevin claps, and Jane, who looks tearful, pulls herself together. Kevin looks down a street past a shop and up the steps to Jane's building.",
    "833": "The real cat leaps from a sideboard. A photograph appears. He reorientates the phone screen and throws a food wrapper out of the car window. Harken jogs up in a mismatched designer track suit. Preoccupied with his iPhone, Dale doesn't see him. Harken picks up the wrapper and glowers. Dale spins around. Harken collapses. Dale plunges an EpiPen injection into Harken's chest. Kurt looks out of a bedroom window. They see Dale pounding Harken's chest. Kurt unwittingly drops Bobby's mobile as they hurry out. He drives the long needle into Harken's neck as Kurt and Nick leg it out of the house. A car pulls up. He comes to. She kisses Dale. Harken snatches the EpiPen. Nick and Kurt walk together. Dale screeches up in Kurt's Volkswagen. Traffic streams along a highway as night turns to day. The guys stride down a supermarket aisle like they mean business. Nick finds rat poison. He compares two brands, Rat Attack and Rat Out. He opts for the Rat Attack. Kurt tries out some binoculars. He hones in on a tight backside and smiles. Lowering the binoculars, he sees that the ass belongs to a guy holding a yucca plant. Kurt blanches and returns the binoculars to the shelf. Dale happens upon jars of peanuts. There's an offer on, three for one, $2.49. He fills his basket with jars. The guys leave. Dale is laden with three carryout bags of nuts. The guys get in their separate cars. Kurt reverses his white sedan, making way for Dale and Kurt who close in on the same narrow gap and stop. Kurt falters, then drives in front of Nick and circles the two cars to bring up the rear. As Nick drives off to the right, Dale goes to turn left, blocking Kurt who brakes jerkily. The sun sets beyond the city limits and day turns to night. The guys park outside the houses of their assigned bosses. Dale waits outside Harken's. Two Thai sex workers leave Bobby's. One was a man dressed as a woman. Bobby goes back indoors. Kurt spies Julia through binoculars. She goes to the boot of her car. As she bends over to retrieve a bag, Kurt ogles her backside. As sultry Julia heads indoors, Kurt's phone rings. Seeing a light come on in Harken's place, he shuts the player and pays attention. In a walk-in wardrobe, Harken sniffs one of his wife's dresses and roots through her handbag. He walks into the lounge. Harken's gray mackerel striped tabby cat is stretched out under a chair, purring up Bobby's phone. Harken grabs the phone and brings up a profile of its owner, complete with name, photograph and details. Dale ducks down in his car seat as Harken drives past in his SUV.",
    "1294": "Inside, we see Vanessa sitting alone at her perfect dining room table, drinking a glass of wine. Vanessa takes a sip and continues to let the day's events sink in. After a beat, Mark comes down the stairs to join her. Mark nods and sits down. There's a loud knock on the front door. Mark opens the door. He squints and sees Juno pulling away in the van. He holds it up. We can see there's writing on the back. Vanessa takes the note from his hand and turns it over, examining it. A porch light's been left on for her, and the place looks cozy and inviting. Juno parks her car and walks up to her house. She picks a crocus from the unkempt garden near the porch and sniffs it. She lifts her shirt and tickles her belly with it. Mac is alone at the kitchen table going over the family finances while drinking one of Bren's weight loss shakes. Juno enters. A wave of realization crosses Juno's face. Juno presses Bleeker's hand against her belly. Juno lets out a genuine shriek of pain. The doctor reveals Juno's baby boy above the sheet. Juno looks at the baby in awe, then her eyes begin to flutter and she passes out. Paulie Bleeker is running as fast as his legs can carry him on the Dancing Elk track. There's a very sparse crowd in the bleachers. As Paulie approaches the tape, his envious teammate Vijay looks on. The fifteen or so people in attendance cheer. Paulie breaks the tape, winning the race. Bleeker looks out at the bleachers, scanning them for Juno. Bleek takes off running toward the parking lot without stopping to explain. The nurse turns and addresses an unseen spectator. A nurse reaches into one of the maternity ward bassinets and gently lifts up a swaddled newborn baby. It looks like it was handwritten on the back of a Jiffy Lube bill. We move to the door and get a view of Vanessa's bedroom. We see her lying in bed with a burp cloth draped over her shoulder, feeding the baby. For the first time ever, Vanessa looks disorganized, unshowered -- and incredibly happy. There are formula bottles on the bedside table and a bassinet pushed close to the bed. Obviously, she hasn't been away from the baby for a single moment. It's a sparkling summer afternoon. She waves goodbye to Bren, who is playing in the yard with two Weimaraners. She looks happy, but older. She looks almost as happy with her dogs as Vanessa looked with her baby. Juno wheels her bicycle out of the detached garage. She's obviously not pregnant anymore. Her guitar is slung over her shoulder in a gig bag.",
    "847": "Sandy reaches into his pockets and comes up empty, then looks at Diana. He walks back to the bench, sighs, and shakes his head. Diana looks away somberly as Sandy gazes down at his pants. He sits beside her, kicks off the shoes, looks down, and pulls out a wad of cash. At the salvage yard, they pull out of the lot in an old, run-down Chevy Caprice. At the bus station, the skiptracer limps in and takes a sip from the juice pouch, tossing it on the ground as he walks over to the ticket booth. The attendant recoils from the skiptracer's bloody face. He looks around the empty station, then sees the attendant with the hand out, twisting his wrist, and writes down and hands the skiptracer a slip of paper as the skiptracer holds his gun up to the window. As he backs away, a bullet rips through his neck and shatters the glass. Paolo's thugs approach with silenced pistols. The skiptracer holds his neck wound as Julian takes the address. Maricol looks at the attendant and holds her finger up to her lips, and the booth window falls apart. Now, Sandy and Diana cruise down the highway toward a bridge. In the car, Sandy's hardened gaze fixes ahead as Diana sits on her side facing him. He swerves the car, smashing her head on the window, and swerves again. Later, they cruise over the Mississippi River into St. Louis, where the Gateway Arch stands tall over the city. At a gas station, Sandy fills up as Diana emerges from the car, and Sandy looks up thoughtfully. Diana falls in the lobby, and the security guard hurries over. As he rubs Diana's leg, a businessman enters the executive fitness center, and Sandy glances around, then slips inside the closing door. Sandy watches the man place his suit in a locker as the guard rubs Diana's butt. The businessman closes his locker with the code and leaves. Sandy quickly approaches, puts in a code, and opens the locker. He glances back with a smile. Now, in a dapper suit and red tie, he strolls through the offices with Diana. They spot a balding man behind a desk. Diana and Sandy exchange a look; she faces the man, shielding her mouth with her hand, as he lifts his phone and Diana backs away. He stares into Ken's eyes with his brow raised. On a security monitor, Sandy enters the code, and our view lowers inside the records room as a glass door and metal gate slide open. Sandy and Diana briskly enter, and pulling equipment from her bag, Diana hard-lines her credit card burner into the network as Sandy searches the shelves, finding Cornish's records in a box.",
    "351": "Sam runs into the tower to find Frodo struggling against his bonds as Gorbag climbs back into the room. Gorbag grabs Frodo's hair and pulls his head back, exposing his neck, and pulls out his sword, ready to cut Frodo's throat. Suddenly, Gorbag gasps as Sting is rammed into his back by Sam, and Gorbag falls dead. Frodo is humbled by Sam's unswerving loyalty, and Sam quickly cuts Frodo free. Sam pulls the ring from his pocket, and Frodo looks at Sam amazed as his eyes drop to the ring. Sam hesitates, and tension instantly builds between them as Sam seems strangely reluctant. On the soundtrack, the hum of the ring builds as Sam drops the ring into Frodo's palm, and Frodo sags in relief. He puts the ring back around his neck, looking at Sam with pain in his eyes, while Sam's plain hobbit face is full of compassion. Sam's resolve hardens, and a new strength takes hold. Frodo and Sam, now dressed in foul-looking Orc gear, turn east and walk over the summit of Cirith Ungol into Mordor. They stop dead, seeing Mount Doom 50 miles away, across the barren Gorgoroth Plateau, where the mountain is erupting streams of ash and lava high into the air, lighting the low cloud blanket of Mordor with a flickering orange wash. With immense trepidation, Frodo and Sam head down the steep path into the dark kingdom, as two tiny figures in a bleak, foreboding landscape. Before them lies the Plain of Gorgoroth, and their eyes are drawn to the ominous silhouette of Mount Doom. Frodo's eyes travel down towards the hundreds of fires which glow on the plains beneath them, where thousands upon thousands of Orcs are encamped. Their eyes are drawn to a dark looming shape, and a red light seems to sweep across the plain—the Great Eye of Sauron! Sam cannot see what Frodo sees, and gently, he urges Frodo on. Meanwhile, Gandalf stands in the tower hall, turns, and crosses the hall to reveal the presence of Gimli, Legolas, Éomer, and Aragorn, who has his back to Gandalf. Gandalf remains troubled and worried. Gimli sits insolently on the seat of the steward, and Gandalf looks across at the dwarf, his face ashen. Aragorn turns around suddenly, and Gandalf looks up sharply at him. At this, Gimli chokes on his pipe, and Éomer steps forward. Aragorn, wearing a breastplate emblazoned with symbols, rides at the head of a column of 500 foot soldiers from Rohan and Gondor, leading them from the ruins of Osgiliath, while Gandalf, Legolas, Gimli, Éomer, Merry, and Pippin ride directly behind him. Great armies of Orc and Uruk-hai stream across the plains from Mordor, invading the volcanic wasteland of the Gorgoroth foothills. Frodo and Sam, still disguised in the Orc armour, slide down a scree bank and land on the road below.",
    "740": "Celia is brought a drink as Jolene runs up onto the stage, while Minnie and Aibileen exchange a look and Mrs. Walters smiles gaily. Celia shimmies up behind Hilly, and as Hilly tries to stop her, she rips her sleeve. Hilly's look of horror is followed by a patronizing smile, as Celia suddenly looks pale and weaves her way through the tables. Minnie slips away. Later, Hilly is at the bottom of the stairs, saying goodnight to her guests, and Hilly grimaces angrily as her mother parades her pie at shoulder height like a waitress, while Mrs. Walters and a male guest walk off. The next morning, Celia shakes her head despairingly, prompting Minnie to move towards her and, like a schoolteacher, points Celia to a seat at the base of the bed and closes the door of the bedroom. Celia shoots Minnie an appalled sidelong glance. At her house, Aibileen and Minnie are smiling at Skeeter's manuscript. Elsewhere, Skeeter drops her bag on the floor and walks into her mother's bedroom where Charlotte is sitting on her bed without a wig, sewing a sampler. Charlotte takes off her specs and stares at her. In flashback, Charlotte poses with her medal and winks at Constantine, who nods approvingly by the door. At the lunch following the medal ceremony, Constantine serves each lady in turn under Charlotte's rather anxious gaze. Charlotte glances towards the door and then at Constantine, who has not heard the knocking. Constantine sees her going to the door, and Charlotte glances over her shoulder, shuts the fly screen, and Rachel's face falls as she barges in. The guest of honor looks appalled as Charlotte weighs up her options and swallows hard. Rachel leads her mother away by the hand, both of them looking back at Charlotte in disbelief as they go through the door onto the porch. Constantine turns and looks back at Charlotte through the fly screen, and Charlotte's brown eyes meet her gaze for a second before looking at the unforgiving faces of the Daughters of America seated at her dining table. The frail, old servant won't be moved, keeping her uncomprehending gaze directed at Charlotte, who shuts the door in her face. Constantine, in a smart cream dress and navy hat, is packing her suitcase, tossing a cross to the door of her bedroom, and tracing her fingers along the lines on the door where she had marked Skeeter and Rachel's heights as they grew, finally arriving at the top. In the present, Skeeter sheds bitter tears, shakes her head in numb disbelief, and Charlotte, her own eyes welling, covers her mouth with her hand, seeing Skeeter's unhappiness. Finally, Skeeter drives the blue Cadillac slowly along a dirt road and peers through some trees at a single-story, white clapboard house, its roof overgrown, standing in a small clearing.",
    "639": "Morgan fetches a video, and Graham stares wide-eyed at the screen. Now seated, Morgan uses his inhaler beside Merrill, while Bo is at the other end of the sofa beside her dad. All four of them are hypnotized by the TV, on which sit two glasses of water. Later, in the dim light, Graham and Merrill remain transfixed, while the children sleep. Graham stares ahead and meets Merrill's gaze, who looks away as his smile fades, and Graham appears somber. Uneasy, Merrill ponders this before recalling something, causing his face to brighten a little, and he grins. Graham watches the TV while Merrill looks at him and then nods. Graham gives a knowing glance to his brother, who, looking forlorn, returns his gaze to the TV. Graham stares vacantly as his eyes meet Merrill's, who shakes his head. With conviction, Graham stares piercingly at Merrill, looking almost angry, his features taut and eyes glistening as he turns to face the TV. Merrill looks down thoughtfully, then turns to the TV as well, and they watch together with blank expressions, as if in a trance. Now, a fresh-faced Graham, dressed in black and wearing a white dog collar, drives slowly down a country road at night. Ahead, the lights of emergency vehicles flash, and Caroline stands in the road, waving her arms above her head. His face long, Graham pulls to a stop and climbs out as Caroline walks up to meet him. Graham wakes up on the sofa, scanning the room with glazed eyes as light floods through the windows into the comfortably furnished room. He heaves himself into a sitting position and remains still for a while before spotting a black cable snaking across the polished dark wood floor. Hoisting himself to his feet, he follows the cable across the room into the hallway, discovering it leads into a closet under the stairs. Graham opens the door to find a bleary-eyed Merrill sitting perfectly still, staring at the TV, and he looks up, a little surprised. Uncomfortable, Graham leaves, and the doors shut. Later, Graham, in a blue dressing gown, pads out of the bathroom drying his ear with a towel, frowning as he goes to a window and looks into the empty garden with its swings, climbing frame, and picnic bench. Hearing a voice, Graham raises his eyebrows, walks along the landing, and enters the children's room, where Morgan and Bo sit on a bed wearing pointy, cone-shaped hats made of silver foil. They look up as Morgan holds a book open and Bo points to her hat. Graham enters, sits down between his children on the bed, peers down at Morgan's book, and Morgan closes it.",
    "86": "They look towards the departed PREACHER as JOHN has taken charge. He speaks very quietly, but calmly and cheerfully, as to an invalid. He starts down the rustling coal-heap, helping PEARL down, and they achieve the cellar floor. Meanwhile, PREACHER looks under the bed, and o.s., PREACHER'S footsteps come down stairs; JOHN leads PEARL carefully past a rake, a hoe, and a shelf-prop, and they crouch down beside an apple barrel. PREACHER'S footsteps cross kitchen o.s. Both look sharp towards the cellar door o.s. The door opens; PREACHER'S head, carrying a candle in holder, illuminates a white-washed wall and stairs, and he clop-clops nearly to the bottom of the stairs. ICEY's voice cuts cheerfully across his descent as she appears at the head of the stairs, her voice crackling with authority. After a short pause, the children, covered with coal-dust, emerge into the light and climb the stairs, with JOHN's head hung in defeat. As they enter the kitchen, we PULL BACK. JOHN looks to PEARL and we PAN HER IN as PREACHER'S hand named LOVE moves through her locks. We PAN with PREACHER and ICEY as they move towards the door, and he watches ICEY leave, o.s., as she goes away along the path outside. PREACHER, his back to us, watches her a moment, then turns, wondering what to do next. We begin with a HEAD CLOSE-UP of BIRDIE as he rocks, and PULL BACK; he is rocking and drunk. A bottle stands beside the picture, and he turns and speaks to the picture. His hands grip the edge of the chest on either side of the picture, which we now see. BIRDIE picks up the bottle, his hand and the liquor tremble, and the bottle falls from his hand onto its side on the edge of the chest. The reverse angle of the opening shot shows BIRDIE rocking heavily as liquor gurgles from the bottle to the floor. PREACHER sits at the head of the table with JOHN standing to his right, around the corner of the table, expressionless and immobile until he speaks. The table is loaded with good food as PREACHER, well-fed and at leisure, dabs his mouth delicately with his napkin, folds it, puts it in a ring, and folds his hands, waiting. PEARL frowns and puts her finger in her mouth, remembering he twisted her arm. PREACHER slaps the table; his eyes crackle and PEARL starts to snivel. He brings out the knife, and PEARL shakes her head for no. He touches the spring; the blade flicks open, and he lays the open knife on the table. PEARL thinks the knife is a toy and crosses behind JOHN to pick it up, her mouth quivering as a large tear brims in her eyes. She sniffles and wipes her eyes with her free fist.",
    "816": "Alicia joins the group, cringing as she holds the flouncy purple dress, while Alette considers and then hands Alicia Rebecca's bag, leaving long-legged Alicia holding it. Alicia slams it down, slumps next to it, narrows her eyes, opens the bag, and picks up the mobile. Rebecca nervously emerges from the changing cabin wearing the purple dress, and Alette nods as Rebecca smiles at her reflection in the mirror and looks at the label of the dress. Alicia watches with a smug smile. In the bridal shop, Rebecca, in a pink maid of honor dress, is blindfolded, and the petticoat is blue and green. Suze spots a Barney's carrier bag. As Rebecca runs down the street with two store bags, a black car draws up and a tall, silver-haired woman in a beret gets out. Rebecca runs into the meeting where the silver-haired woman sits down, looks around at the group, and holds up Rebecca's shopping bag. The group arrives at a thrift shop where Ryuichi raises his hand, and a basketball player picks Rebecca up and shakes her. She runs back to the thrift shop, encountering a surly girl in a wheelchair. Graham switches on his TV as Jane elbows him with excitement, and the studio audience looks at him. Rebecca covers her face as Smeath’s jaw drops and Tarquin chokes on his cereal while Smeath waves the list of excuses at the studio audience. Rebecca gives Luke a helpless look, her eyes brimming with tears, and shuts her eyes, bowing her head at seeing Luke's disappointed face. Luke then strides out of the TV studio as Rebecca miserably wanders home in her purple dress and Yves Saint Laurent coat. Suze bursts out of the front door to meet her, and a bag lady with a shopping trolley passes by in a pink dress with a green and blue petticoat. Rebecca searches for an explanation, her face crumpling as Luke pauses, derailed by his own feelings. Graham and Jane’s mobile home pulls up outside Rebecca and Suze’s building, and Mr. West eyes Luke while Ryan smiles unpleasantly. Luke looks blown away as Rebecca, now a tiny dot, wanders along a wintry lake shore. Jane and Graham are by their mobile home; Jane brings out a book, and Graham joins Rebecca by the lake shore. Rebecca shoots him a look and, looking up at her dad’s jowly face filled with fierce love, she smiles. He puts an arm around her, and she lays her head on his big barrel chest as tears roll down Jane’s face as she watches her husband standing facing the lake with his arm around Rebecca. At home, Rebecca finds a note from Suze and glumly steps into the room, looking at all the clothes piled up on the bed.",
    "946": "Holmes looks into the corridor, steps into a compartment, and shoos the elderly couple out of their compartment. A soldier opens a crate, takes out a Maxim machine gun, fixes it onto its tripod, and loads the belt-fed ammunition into the breech. The weapon is cocked, and the soldier opens fire, with bullets ripping through the walls of the first class compartments, showering Watson and Holmes with debris. Watson closes the exterior door and sees Holmes lying down. Holmes pulls Watson down beside him, lights a pipe, and hands Watson a pistol. The lipstick Holmes put in the machine gun belt jams the gun. Watson shoots through the hole created by the machine gun bullets, hitting a soldier who drops a grenade. The soldier realizes he's inadvertently pulled the pin out of the grenade, which then drops back into a bag full of grenades. The grenades explode, blasting the train in two. The train rattles on through the night as Watson and Holmes sit in the ruined lavatory of their carriage, which is at the end of those still attached to the engine. A flashback to her falling from the train is followed by Mycroft appearing in a boat. Holmes, whose face is smeared with lipstick and eye shadow, waits awkwardly for the answer while Watson smiles ruefully at the mention of Paris. Black smoke belches from the funnels of a paddle-steamer as it leaves the white cliffs of Dover behind, with Watson and Holmes, now out of disguise, on the steamer's rear promenade deck. Watson takes Irene's monogrammed handkerchief out of Sims' bag, glances at Holmes, who takes the hanky, walks to the railing, sniffs it, and then looks out to sea. Watson watches Holmes closely as Holmes looks down at the hanky, glances over his shoulder at Watson, and casually tosses it over the side. The paddle-steamer approaches the French coast. A flier posted on a wall in Paris advertises a lecture by Professor Moriarty. Inside a grand building, Moriarty is signing a copy of his book on asteroids for an admirer, hands it back, and as another man approaches, a bearded agent sits beside Moriarty and passes him a note. Moriarty looks at the note, puts it in a leather covered notebook, signs another book, turns to his agent, and the agent takes two tickets from his jacket pocket before leaving. Outside, the agent wanders over to a rough looking bloke leaning against a wall.",
    "408": "Ben and Elaine are walking along in front of one of the outside animal cages, with Ben a step or two behind her. Carl strides up to them, takes the pipe out of his mouth, and puts it in his pocket, reaching out to take Elaine's hands. Carl frowns and looks over Elaine's shoulder at Ben, who smiles and steps forward to grasp Carl's hand. Carl steps back and puts an arm around Elaine's shoulder. The three of them look at each other for a moment. There is another KNOCK, and Elaine is standing in the hall. Ben nods, moves in behind her, and puts his hand on her arm as several boys gather in the hallway trying to see into the room. Ben edges through the door into the hallway, opens the door a little way, and they all try to see in. The boys start back to their rooms, leaving Mr. McCleery and Ben standing and looking at each other for a few seconds before Mr. McCleery turns away, walks down the hall, and starts down the stairs. Ben turns and goes back into the room where Elaine sits in a chair, watching him as he goes to the bureau, takes some shirts from a drawer, and puts them in the suitcase before going back to the bureau. He gets down on his knees to look under the bureau, then returns to the bureau to get some socks and underwear, carrying them to the suitcase. He goes back to the bureau again, opens a drawer, takes out some T-shirts and the beer can, and carries them to the suitcase. Elaine gets up, goes to the door, and opens it, walking out and shutting the door behind her. Ben crosses to the window, and through the window, we see Elaine walking away, the length of the street until she disappears. Ben is asleep in his bed and suddenly sits up, standing in the darkness by the door. He gets out of bed, goes to her, and they kiss. She shakes her head, nods, goes to the door, opens it, and steps into the hall. He goes to the door as students move quickly from building to building. Ben is walking alongside Elaine as they move up the steps of a classroom building. Ben pushes through a lot of students to keep up with Elaine as they walk down a corridor with open doors on each side to classrooms with students filing into each of them. Elaine turns into one of the doors, leaving Ben in the hall as all the classroom doors close, and he leans against the wall.",
    "265": "Hi and Ed are raising their heads, facing forward, and do not see Lenny approaching again through the rear window as he saws out his second shotgun. Hi looks around, reaches, and pulls Ed down beneath him just as KA-BOOM! - the second shotgun roars and the back window spits in. As Lenny roars past the back window, he casually flips something in, and below them, something bounces into and around the leg well - Lenny's grenade. As the two front doors fly open, Hi and Ed spill out - Hi from the driver's side, heading for the far side of the road, and Ed from the passenger side as she dives for cover behind a parked car. Beyond her, KABOOM! - their car explodes and bounces, pouring black smoke, and the explosion flings Hi to the ground in the middle of the street. Looking up the street, Hi sees Lenny wheeling his bike in a U-turn; he is not finished yet. Hi lies flat on his back, woozily shaking his head, and he weakly raises himself on his elbows to look down the street, down the length of his own body, where his legs stretch away in a V. Crashing down from a wheelie, Lenny's roaring bike is almost upon him, aiming up the middle of the V, so Hi rolls as the bike roars by, reaches, and snags a chain on Lenny's passing boot. Dragged several yards before the boot shakes him off, Hi is left on his stomach in the middle of the road. Hi looks up the road as Lenny is again sluing the bike around, smoking as it skids around in the foreground, completing its turn; boom up Lenny's back to reveal Ed stomping straight up the street toward him - unarmed, unafraid. As Ed closes in, Lenny's arms rise into frame, and with a roll of his wrists, two knives appear in his hands. On his stomach, Hi sights down the gun toward Lenny as Ed steps into his line of fire, blocking Lenny, and raising an arm to stab. Ed stoops to scoop the baby from the car seat, revealing Hi behind her as he fires, and Lenny, drilled by Hi's bullet, drops its knife. The exit wound spurts, not flesh and blood, but a brief jet of fire, and quick as a flash, Lenny hurls the other knife at Hi. The knife stings the gun out of Hi's hand as Lenny bends to scoop up the knife he dropped. As Ed runs toward the bank, clutching Nathan Jr. to her chest and bursts in, the floor is littered with obedient hayseeds. From where Hi lies prone, BANG: the front door bursts open before Lenny's roaring hog, which sails off a step into the sunken atrium and lands with a CRASH amidst the hayseeds.",
    "303": "Lisa slowly helps Jeff to lobster from the main dish, and shooting over Jeff's shoulder we see beyond him the divan-bed upon which Lisa is stretched out. A faint shade of disappointment is seen on Lisa's face; but she quickly recovers and looks down at the table. There is one light burning behind Lisa's head, and Jeff looks at her soberly. She pulls up a chair and seats herself at the card table, where we observe that two small lit candles adorn the table, and the rest of the room lights are out. The brightness drains from Lisa's face, and she lowers her eyes slowly toward the table as a fierce discussion is in progress. Lisa gesticulates with her hands, body, and legs, and Jeff raises both his hands. Lisa draws back one leg and points a finger challengingly, then stretches out on the divan while Jeff begins to get angry, eventually becoming definitely angry. She looks at him for a moment without speaking, and after a moment of silence, Jeff says earnestly, as if remembering some old experience. Shooting over Lisa's shoulder, and down her body, we see Jeff in the chair beyond. Lisa turns on her side, and stares into the room angrily, realizing she is getting nowhere. We see Jeff's hand coming to the foreground with a restraining gesture as Lisa, still looking out into the room and without turning, speaks. She turns at last and looks across at him, then starts to rise from the divan, the camera panning up as Jeff looks across at her with some concern. Lisa moves away from the camera into the center of the room, saying something as she begins to move around the room assembling her possessions preparatory to leaving. From Jeff's viewpoint, we see Lisa pause in the act of gathering her things together, get her stole, and Jeff's eyes follow her up the steps toward the door. Jeff starts to say something then thinks better of it and remains silent as Lisa turns in the half-opened door. Jeff tries to be pleasant and offhand, while Lisa stands in the open doorway, continues smiling, and then closes the door softly behind her. The pleasantness on Jeff's face slowly melts into baffled discouragement. A low camera captures Jeff's head in the foreground with Stella just behind him, working on his back. She attacks the sore muscle vigorously, stops massaging, reaches for the oil, and hits his back with a palmful of cold oil, which takes his breath away. She helps him to a sitting position, hands him his shirt which he proceeds to put on, and then helps him into the chair, the back of which is to the window.",
    "160": "Nehru crosses and kneels so that he is almost at Gandhi's eyeline, causing Gandhi to take his eyes from his writing and look, almost moved to tears at the sight of Nehru. Gandhi's hand shakes a little as he holds it out to him and turns to pat their joined hands with his other hand with effort, eventually seeing Patel. Patel sits near the head of the cot, placing the three of them on a level. Outside the canopied area, Bourke-White is crouched, with her camera framing the three of them. Gandhi smiles and reaches to touch hands with him, then shakes his head. However, Nehru feels he has an antidote for that despair, which Bourke-White captures, showing the sense of elation on his face. From her discreet distance, she lowers the camera, holding it against her mouth, waiting for Gandhi's response. Gandhi nods to Nehru, accepting the news with sad wistfulness, and glances at Patel, recognizing with him that their belief they could talk Gandhi out of the fast was deeply misplaced. Nehru turns back with no confidence, only concern, while Gandhi smiles, pain etched in his eyes, and touches Nehru's hand. Nehru stares at him, feeling sudden fear that Gandhi means it, and Patel, Mirabehn, Azad, Bourke-White share the same realization. An outside broadcast truck is parked among the usual crowd, which has grown larger, including more women. The crowd spreads from Gandhi along the street, pressing against walls, staring and terrified to move. Among them are the frightened, apprehensive faces of Godse, with Apte and Karkare nearby. Nehru stands, staring at them all, his face seething with anger. On the cover is an image of rioting men fighting diagonally across a cut-out of Gandhi on his cot. Mirabehn rises, leaving the magazine at her feet, and moves to Nehru and Suhrawardy as Azad ushers them into the canopied area, while Abdul Ghaffar Khan sits quietly in the background. Mirabehn speaks softly, and Nehru looks across at Gandhi. The doctor, testing Gandhi's pulse again, glances back at the two—offering no encouragement—and moves away. Nehru moves to the side of the cot, where Gandhi smiles weakly and holds out a hand, but he is in pain. Gandhi looks up at Suhrawardy, who nods, then back at Nehru, smiling whimsically and touching him again, though there is no change in his attitude. Nehru looks at him hopelessly as a huge crowd and some smoke from distant buildings are visible, indicating they are still in Calcutta, and all is not yet at peace.",
    "896": "Five cars follow the motorcyclists along a dim street, and in Dillinger's car, the criminal stares off glumly before smiling out the window. Dozens of civilians line the street, cheering, and the gang leader raises his shackled hands to wave. A young man rushes toward the window as Dillinger's eyes gleam while other fans wave excitedly, and he gives a coy, half-smile. Later, the convoy drives onto a bridge, passing a set of raised barricades. In the courthouse, a deputy shoves through a crowd of journalists toward a counter, where a plainly dressed woman paces in an office. She strides out to the crowd, and as arriving lawmen lead Dillinger inside, cameras flash and the robber skeptically furrows his brow. An officer unlocks Dillinger's wrist restraints, and a chubby lawyer puts an arm around Dillinger, who rests his elbow on the man's shoulder. The female sheriff glowers as Dillinger shrugs his brows and swaggers off, escorted by deputies. Later, a guard unlocks a cellblock door and a deputy guides a portly lawyer inside. The lawyer nonchalantly follows a second guard farther ahead. A hulking black inmate strides past a row of cells into a common room where Dillinger reads a newspaper. The hulking man leans to Dillinger's ear, and Dillinger scowls toward his cell, then heads over as the hulking inmate positions himself just outside and waves to two prisoners. Dillinger faces the bars at the back of his cell, with the lawyer, Piquett, sitting in a corridor on the other side. Piquett sits back and heaves a misty sigh in the cold air. In a courtroom, Piquett sits at a counsel bench as a deputy escorts Dillinger in shackles. Piquett faces the deputy while the judge folds his hands thoughtfully, and Bob turns away with a humorless look. As the crowd rises, Dillinger winks at Piquett, who steps away, and as the deputy approaches, Dillinger lowers his gaze. Later, outside the jail, a cluster of National Guardsmen stands watch by a waist-high wall of sandbags, while inside, prisoners mill about the common room. As a few deputies and guards work in a front office, a janitor enters. Later, he hangs up his coat, and a guard unlocks a barred door, raising his baton to a second metal door just inside. The guard looks through a peephole and unlocks the door for the janitor, who carries a mop and bucket, crosses a hallway, and waits for another guard to open another barred door. In the common room, Dillinger tilts his head and clenches his jaw as the janitor enters and the guard shuts the door behind him. Dillinger coolly glances over his shoulder, the janitor sets down his supplies and heads over, and Dillinger grabs Cahoon by the back of his jacket, pointing an odd, waxy gun at his head.",
    "1313": "Even at the late hour, there is heavy traffic throughout the station. David's eyes dart up as the slick-haired man turns the corner at the information booth, and he watches him for a beat. David watches the teenager with baggy jeans hanging off his hip as he walks and greets a group of identically dressed friends. David turns his hands back in and seems shaken. He takes a couple of deep breaths as he gathers himself, then steps back to look around. He bumps the shoulder of a man standing behind him, taking a sudden breath like someone punched him in the solar plexus. The enormous glassy-eyed man takes hold of the screen door handle and turns it as the man inside the house grabs the door handle on the inside to stop him. The man inside the house uses all his strength to keep the door from opening, but it opens slowly anyway. David stands frozen in the train station, his face almost unreadable, standing less than a foot away from the man he bumped, and they are shoulder to shoulder. David's eyes slowly move from the ground over his right and then finally onto the man, who is huge, at least three inches taller than David, with massive shoulders and wearing a one-piece orange uniform. The man in the orange uniform leans over a trashcan next to him and removes the full trash bag within it, replaces it with a fresh one, throws the full trash bag into a gray plastic bin with wheels, and starts pushing it. Four identical gray bins sit outside the door, and the huge man disappears with his bin inside. David waits, staring hard at the double doors, and then they open as the huge glassy-eyed man in orange emerges carrying a bag over his shoulder, now wearing a baseball hat with his uniform. He heads toward a back exit, and David lets him get about twenty feet away before deciding to follow him. The man in the orange uniform walks in the driving rain down a residential city block, almost all the lights in the middle-class homes he's passing are off at this late hour. The orange figure turns the corner onto a block of modest standalone homes, walking slower, and looks around carefully as he moves. He turns into a driveway of one of the homes, stops, and pulls a wad of mail out of the mailbox. David stands with the hood of his security coat covering his head and face, standing in the shadows and watching silently as the man in the orange uniform looks over his massive shoulder before turning a knob and entering the white paneled house through a familiar side door with a screen on it.",
    "505": "In perfect lip sync is. There is a TIGHT SHOT of Darryl's face going deeper and deeper into a state of shock, and TIGHT SHOTS of Hal, Max, and others all looking intently at the screen, which displays a VIDEO IMAGE of Thelma boldly ordering a cashier to fill her purse with money. As the cashier loads the purse with bills, Thelma takes beef jerky from the display and adds it to the purse while pointing a gun at the cashier. Thelma and Louise are in the car driving, and Louise notices the speedometer touching 80 mph, so she lets her foot off the gas, looking a little nervous. Thelma howls like a dog and drinks from a little bottle of Wild Turkey. As they drive next to a truck, the truck driver smiles and waves at them, and they smile and wave back. He then flicks his tongue at them, causing Louise to scream. They both pause for a moment, and as the sun sets, the T-Bird drives deeper into the vast desert. Darryl sits in the hallway as two officers lead J.D. down the hall with Hal, Max, and other plainclothes officers following. Hal thinks for a moment, looks to Max, who agrees and opens the door for the others to leave. Hal and Max make eye contact before Max closes the door, and Hal sits down across the table from J.D. They sit there for a moment, then J.D. shifts in his chair. Hal opens the door, allowing Max and the others to straggle back in, and the TV is ON with the place in a mess. As the phone RINGS, Darryl, Hal, Max, and other cops spring into action, donning headsets, turning on tape recorders. Darryl picks up the phone while Hal, Max, and others gesticulate wildly. Thelma hangs up the phone, leaving everyone disappointed as they take off their headsets and turn off tape recorders, looking at Darryl like he's an idiot. Darryl holds the phone in his hand as Thelma and Louise stare at each other intently. Louise steps up to the phone and again everyone springs into action while Darryl fumbles with the phone, giving Hal and Max a look as if he's got everything under control. Louise hangs up the phone and all are busy trying to trace the call. Darryl returns to his recliner, still in shock. Louise stomps back to the car with Thelma following doggedly. A moving van pulls in and parks in the background. Louise stops as she is about to get in, faces Thelma, who is standing on the other side of the car, yanks open her car door, gets in, slams the door, and fires up the ENGINE.",
    "721": "Jack leads Rose and his friends down another corridor and up a stairway to another locked gate, where at the top, a steward addresses a small crowd from behind it. Jack grabs the gate and shakes it, then rushes over and pulls on a wooden bench nailed to the floor, with Fabrizio and Tommy helping Jack pull up the bench. They charge forward and ram the gate, do so again, and Jack, Rose, and other passengers pass the steward, with Tommy punching the steward. On the boat deck, passengers swarm around the remaining lifeboats as Lightoller pushes away a group of men, and a man knocks a woman off the deck, grabbing onto the side of the lifeboat and dangling high above, while a sailor pulls the woman on deck. Lightoller lifts a revolver, waves the gun at the group of men, and turns toward a young sailor, while loading his revolver as Lowe boards the lifeboat. On the other side of the ship, Cal and Lovejoy peer down as Murdoch supervises the lowering of a lifeboat, and below, one lifeboat is lowered onto another sitting in the water but unable to detach, while in the lower lifeboat, a man labors to cut the ropes connecting the two boats. On the other side of the ship, Lowe stands in a lifeboat as it is lowered, waving his revolver at men on the decks as they try to jump into the boat, and Cal and Lovejoy turn as Lowe fires his gun in the air, with Cal following Murdoch toward the bow. Meanwhile, Jack, Rose, Fabrizio, and Tommy arrive on the upper deck, running to the side of the ship, where Jack stands up on the railing and gazes toward the bow, and as he steps down, Rose stops the mustached Colonel Gracie. Jack, Rose, and the others run toward the bow, while as the band plays on deck, a passenger bumps into one of the violinists, causing Hartley's brow to furrow. As the band resumes playing, Jack, Rose, Fabrizio, and Tommy run past, elsewhere, Murdoch and several seamen load a small boat, with Murdoch glancing around, then turning to a sailor. Cal slips money into Murdoch's pocket, and Murdoch glances down at the cash, exchanges looks with Cal, and walks off. On the port side, Lightoller loads passengers into a boat and shoots into the sky; in the crowd, Jack turns to Tommy, who moves off through the crowd. Meanwhile, Lovejoy approaches Cal, who stands beside the small boat called a collapsible, and Cal glances away as Murdoch turns to Cal and Lovejoy while Ismay helps load the collapsible. Cal stares at the collapsible, then blinks, turns, and walks off.",
    "511": "As he reaches the door and turns to look back at her, Alyssa pounces on him, grabs his face, and locks lips with him, big time. He drops his keys and embraces her. There they stand, by the side of the road, drenched, kissing. Banky carries a bag in one arm and pulls out his keys with the other. He picks up the mail on the floor and jams them into the lock, opening the door. He closes the door behind him and shuffles to the kitchenette, passing by the blanket-covered, slumbering forms of Holden and Alyssa, who are out cold in each other's arms. The place looks a mess - like a couple of people were engaged in some tremendous activity. Then he freezes. He looks down again, and drops his jaw and his carton of choco, which hits the floor with a pop. They look at one another, then at the flabbergasted Banky. Holden and Alyssa shoot straight up, eyes struggling to focus. Banky blinks, then shuffles toward the door again and lets himself out. Banky sits on a curb, staring into the distance; Holden saunters up and sits beside him. He follows Banky's gaze, and Banky shoots him a glare before walking away. Holden shakes his head. At an all-girl gathering, Tory, Nica, Dalia, and Jane help Alyssa finish an issue of 'Idiosyncratic Routine'. Tory letters a page, while Nica and Dalia lay-out the artwork, and Dalia drinks wine. Alyssa buries her face, giggling, and they all cackle. Alyssa tries to laugh with them, but Dalia stares at her suspiciously. All four girls stare at Alyssa, a bit horrified. Holden and Alyssa lie in each other's arms, moonlight bathing them. She smokes, and Holden looks down at a book, shakes his head at Banky, and flips it open to a page showing Alyssa's senior year photo. Cut to Cohee Lundon in the parking lot of Food City, addressing the camera. Back in the office, Holden stares at Banky, grabs him, and pins him against the wall, then releases him. Banky brushes himself off. Holden and Hooper peruse laser discs when a young black kid approaches Hooper, holding a comic book, and after the kid leaves, Hooper slips back into his real voice. On the ice, players skid into the corner, and the crowd around Alyssa and Holden goes wild. Player One checks Player Two into the boards hard; Alyssa is into the game. Player Two scrambles to his feet, throws down his gloves, pulls Player One's helmet off, and punches him in the face before yanking at Player One's jersey and gut punching him. Holden's face looks really sour. On the ice, Player One staggers a bit, quickly rights his jersey, and lunges at Player Two, landing a barrage of his own punches.",
    "1126": "The tiny tent is spacious inside. Harry sits beside a table piled with camping equipment. Hermione crouches by a bunk bed, listening to the radio. Harry leans back in his chair, deep in thought. Her knees drawn up to her chest, Hermione stares blankly at Ron's radio. He crosses over to her. He holds out a hand. Her face solemn, she takes both his hands and pulls herself up. Harry puts his arms around her neck. He unfastens the locket. He throws it onto the lower bunk. His eyes fixed on hers, he draws her away from the radio. She looks pale and wistful. Still holding her hands, Harry starts to move to the music. They twist back and forth and she half-smiles. Hermione grins and they start to move a little more imagistically. He spins around. They both smile and spin. His puts arm around her, they dance more closely. They hold their hands again. Laughing, they start to jive. Hermione spins into his arms. Harry leans his head against her. She rests her chin on his shoulder. They turn slowly, holding each other close. Hermione's smile fades. They stop dancing. They meet each other's gaze. Hermione sighs and walks away. Harry watches her go. Hermione sits reading on the flat-topped rocks. Inside the tent, Harry lies on a bunk, his arms folded, idly watching the snitch hovering above his head. He reaches out his hand. The fluttering wings slow then fold away. Harry draws the snitch down and holds it against his mouth. He looks at it. Writing appears on the golden surface: I open at the close. He hands it to her. She puts down her book and studies the writing. Harry sits beside her. A triangle containing a circle, with a vertical line through it. She frowns at the drawing. She ruffles his hair and smiles at him. Harry nods and grins after her, as she walks away. A few snowflakes drift past. They apparate in a quaint, snow-covered village. Wearing winter clothes, they wander down a deserted street. She takes his arm. Two villagers come out of an inn behind them. A little gate leads into the churchyard. She turns to him. In the graveyard, surrounding the church, Harry and Hermione study the name on the graves. The snow gently falls. Hermione stops at a grave marked with a horizontal slab. She brushes snow from it with her gloved hand. Carved on the slab is a triangle containing a circle, with a vertical line through it. She wipes away more snow and finds a name engraved underneath. He is standing at the far side of the graveyard. He looks down at a plain, upright gravestone.",
    "1104": "Karen hands Mitch the phone, and reluctantly, Mitch answers it. As Mitch hangs up, he looks troubled. Walt stares into the distance with a frown and looks down at some hospital admission forms and test results. During the day, Thao carries a bundle of garden waste out to the front of his house while Walt watches from his porch as Spider's car comes slowly down the street. Thao sees it and goes back into the garden. Walt lights a cigarette as the modified Honda cruises slowly by. Smokie stares out of the car, and Walt mimes shooting him, to which Smokie responds by giving him the finger. Thao watches the exchange of gestures. Later, Walt opens his front door to Thao, and Walt is working under the sink in Thao's kitchen as the ceiling fan gyrates unsteadily. In his garage, Walt works on the fan with Thao, who folds his arms. Walt doubles up, and Thao sees he's coughed up blood. Thao nods at the Gran Torino, and Walt follows his gaze to the green V8 muscle car. Thao nods, and Walt grins. Down in his basement, Walt is busy moving an old freezer on a sack truck, attempts to get it up the stairs, but finds it hard going, and tugs away, then gives it up as a bad job. Thao opens his door to Walt, and they go down to Walt's basement, where they heave the freezer up the steps and get it outside. Thao rubs his neck. Sue finds Walt on his back porch as Thao washes the Gran Torino on the drive. She shrugs, then glances at Thao and goes to get one. Walt looks over at Thao. Later, he watches Thao working in the garden, gets a cigarette, and a lighter. Thao and Walt get out of his pickup truck and go in the barber shop. Thao goes out and comes straight back in. A gun. Martin takes a seat, and Thao comes back in. Walt and Thao drive up to a building site in Walt's old white Ford pickup, park up, and wear work gloves. They leave Tim's portacabin, and Tim sits back down at his desk. Walt's pickup truck pulls up outside C.M. Young Hardware and Lumber Store. Walt and Thao get out, go inside, and look around. Walt makes his way over to a shelf with what he's looking for, a tape measure, and a tool bag. Walt holds his hand out, and Thao shakes it. As they head off, Walt winces slightly, and carrying his new stuff, Thao gets off a bus and jogs down a back alley heading home. As he trots along, he sees Spider's Honda coming the other way. The car pulls up, and Spider and his four cronies get out, with Smokie stubbing a cigarette out on Thao's cheek.",
    "1264": "With one hand, Harry stems the flow of blood from Snape's neck and holds the phial to Snape's cheek, catching his tears in it. Harry removes the phial from Snape's cheek, grips it, as Snape studies Harry's face. Harry's lips tremble, Snape's eyes glaze over, and his head lolls to one side. Hermione briefly glances at Ron, then looks down at the floor. Harry stares at the dead Snape as the surface of the water starts to ripple and the building trembles. Harry steadies himself against the glass wall, while Ron holds onto the door and Hermione clasps her hands to her ears. Fred Weasley is injured as Hermione and Ron, distressed, stand a little way behind Harry. It's still dark, and pockets of fire burn throughout the school and grounds as the three friends make their way back up the path to the courtyard. Ron pushes open the doors of the Great Hall, and the three are confronted by piles of rubble. Further in, they see students and staff; two students carry someone out on a stretcher. Ron spots something and hurries forward with Hermione following, while Harry stands frozen in the doorway. Slughorn is tending to the wounded Filch and turns. Harry passes a long line of people being treated, witnessing Professor Trelawney and Padma Patil pull a blanket over a dead body. He sees the Weasleys up ahead, with George weeping, clinging to his father, and desperately hugging Ron. Fleur comforts Bill, and Molly, distraught, kneels beside Fred's body, stroking his hair. Ron joins Her, sobbing helplessly while Hermione stands at a distance. Harry watches the grieving family and glances to his left, seeing the bodies of Nymphadora and Remus lying side by side on stretchers, Remus' little finger resting on hers. Professor McGonagall limps towards Harry, who, without seeing her, turns and strides out of the Great Hall. He enters Dumbledore's old, undamaged office; as he steps further in, covered doors to his right open of their own accord and a stone pedestal slides out. Harry crosses to the pedestal, lifts out a shallow silver basin, and gently spins it through the air. It floats towards the desk at the far side of the room, and he follows the spinning Pensieve to the desk where it lands lightly. Holding the phial containing Snape's tears, Harry removes the stopper and empties the contents into the basin, causing misty black swirls to appear in the Pensieve. Harry sinks his face into the bowl, and the swirling black clears to reveal a meadow with two young girls, Lily and her sister Petunia, facing each other. Lily opens her palm to reveal a daisy growing in it, and an equally young Severus Snape emerges from a large tree trunk as Petunia runs off.",
    "670": "Set against a moody blue sky with towering white and gold clouds, a woman in Grecian-style robes holds aloft a shining torch as pages of comic magazines appear, followed by a spider's web behind letters that break up and vanish from the screen. Images of the principal actors are displayed, showing Peter Parker and his new muscular body, then as the prototype Spider-Man and the wrestling green cage. Peter fails to stop a thief and is seen kneeling by his dying uncle, leading to the beginnings of the Spider-Man costume, followed by more titles. Spider-Man stands over Norman Osborn as Harry walks into the room, and Peter Parker is at his Uncle Ben's graveside. Peter walks away from MJ in the graveyard, later gazing at a poster of MJ, the face of the parfumerie Emma Rose, while working as a pizza boy. Peter gazes blankly amid traffic at a standstill and, on his moped, weaves his way through cars and yellow cabs as a taxi pulls out in front of him. Stacked on the back of his moped are pizzas. A taxi stops in front of him, and he swings around it, seeing the lights change as a bus passes in front. He looks up at the clock, and another minute ticks by. Now on foot, Peter runs into an alley, ripping off his crash helmet as a guy watches the alley entrance. Out swings Spider-Man with the pizza, soaring through the skyscrapers high above land. He spots two kids running onto the street with a huge truck coming their way, tosses the pizzas, and swings down to pluck the kids away from the truck, setting them gently on the ground. A man steps onto a balcony and turns to see the pizzas on the balustrade, teasing out a slice as Spider-Man swishes past, grabbing the pizzas. Spider-Man then lands on a nearby building. The man goes to eat the pizza slice, but it’s whipped from his hand by a web. Inside the building Spider-Man landed on, a receptionist sits at a desk in a hallway with black-and-white checkered flooring and looks around upon hearing a noise, seeing a cupboard door opening. From it emerges Peter, carrying the pizzas, as brooms fall out behind him. Chewing her gum intently, the receptionist watches as he struggles to push the mops and brushes back inside, and with one final thrust, Peter pushes back the brooms and slams the door. He picks up the pizza boxes and notices something stuck to the top—it's some spider's web. The receptionist eyes him curiously as he pulls the stretchy, silky substance off and stuffs it in the back pocket of his jeans. He then strides up to the desk and lays the pizzas on it.",
    "503": "Louise slams the closet door, causing Thelma to jump. They are silent for a moment with Thelma staring down the road. She puts her finger down on the receiver as Louise hangs up the phone and walks away towards the front of the store. Thelma comes out of the front of the store, and Thelma and Louise look at each other while this sinks in. Thelma walks around to the side of the building to the phone as Louise goes into the store for a chocolate Yoohoo. Darryl is mad, but he's still watching the game. Thelma is trying not to cry and she's trying to be strong. Neither one of them say anything for a moment, and she hangs up on him. Thelma has tears running down her face and she is watching the ground as she storms back to the car. She makes a loud grunt as she slams into someone that she did not see, and both people are knocked back a few steps from the force of the collision. She notices how blue his eyes are and now she wants him to come. He starts to walk away from the car. Just then Louise comes out of the store and sees Thelma talking to this guy, and for one moment stops dead in her tracks as she takes this in, then continues toward the car. Although her face is basically expressionless, it’s possible she might kill Thelma. The Hitchhiker just nods and starts walking towards the road. The guy does seem really nice and Thelma is really frustrated that Louise wouldn't give him a ride but decides not to confront her. Louise lowers the top and backs the car out. They watch him walk away as Louise pulls out of the parking lot onto the road. They pass the Hitchhiker, who smiles and waves, and they drive down the road. There is a tight shot of the Hitchhiker as the smile fades from his face. Thelma looks sulky while Hal goes over a list of every registered green T-Bird in the state, with names scrolling by as Hal stares blankly at the screen and the name LOUISE ELIZABETH SAWYER scrolls past. They are clear of the town, and Thelma is like a dog with a bone, just won't let it drop, while Louise looks very shaken up. She keeps her eyes on the road but she's holding the steering wheel so tightly, her knuckles are white. Suddenly, she reaches over and locks her door. There is an extreme closeup of Darryl's face and J.D. is looking down the road, way off in the distance.

Sparks fly as they struggle desperately to overcome each other while Harry controls his quivering wand with both hands and Voldemort's face is twisted with hatred. Streaks of light burst all around, illuminating the dark sky, and the ghostly images of Voldemort's victims appear, first Cedric, then Bryce, the old caretaker killed in the mansion. Harry's father and mother appear at his side, and his father speaks. Breaking the connection, Harry grabs Cedric as the cup flies into his hand, and Voldemort howls with frustration. Harry lands with Cedric in the arena, and the spectators go wild. Fleur senses that something is wrong, Dumbledore gets up and tries to pull Harry away, but Harry clings to Cedric's body as Mr. Diggory bursts through the spectators and weeps over Cedric's body. Moody pulls Harry up and helps him away as the students stand, stunned into silence. Still in a state of shock, Harry walks into Professor Moody's room, and Moody slides shut the iron lock on the heavy wooden door. Harry stands in a trance, pale and shaking, clutching his arm as his clothes are torn and his face is bloody. Moody pulls up a stool and sits him down in front of the fire, revealing Harry's deep gash, and grips Harry's arm. Moody's face twists with agony as he opens his hip flask but finds it empty, then runs into the next room and searches feverishly among bottles in a wooden box, but they are all empty. Moody stands in the doorway behind him, searches the shelves, and glares at Harry with his mad eye before grabbing Harry's arm and sucking Harry's blood from his fingers. The door bursts open, and Moody is flung hard against the stone wall as Dumbledore grabs him, and Snape pours truth serum into Moody's mouth. Moody looks towards the locked trunk, Snape points his wand, and the lid flies open. Then six more trunks open, one inside the other, and Dumbledore, Snape, and McGonagall peer into the trunk, down a deep shaft, where a figure with one leg and one eye lies far below. Snape sniffs the flask, and they turn and watch his face and body start to twist with violent convulsions as he wrenches off the leather patch with the mad, rolling eye and flings it down, transforming into a younger man who lashes out angrily. It's Mr. Crouch's son who lunges at Harry as Barty reveals the dark mark. Dumbledore uncovers Harry's wound, and Snape presses his wand hard against Barty's cheek as Barty narrows his eyes and flickers out his tongue. The entire school is assembled in the great hall, and Dumbledore finds Harry packing his case in the boys' bedroom.",
    "743": "Mrs. Walters watches TV as she has her lunch, and Skeeter arrives and joins the young women, hugging Elizabeth and then Hilly, who bites her lip. The bridge is now in full swing, with Skeeter playing with Hilly, Elizabeth, and Jolene. Hilly kicks Jolene with her stilettoed foot and smiles blithely. Skeeter goes on and lowers her eyes awkwardly. In the kitchen, Aibileen answers the phone, while platinum blonde Celia, in a yellow playsuit, rings off as her husband creeps up behind her, nuzzles her neck, and bends her backward by the edge of their swimming pool. Mrs. Walters has dropped off in front of the TV, and as Aibileen goes to take her plate, she takes another mouthful. Skeeter smiles at Aibileen, who is replenishing the ladies' glasses, while Elizabeth notices Hilly squirming. Aibileen listens passively, and Skeeter watches her, knowing Aibileen has heard every word, then looks down at her lap. Later, Hilly and her friends are standing by their cars, and Skeeter is inside, watching them through a window. She wanders across to Aibileen, who is clearing up, and Aibileen looks across with the same passive expression as before. Skeeter's attention is drawn to the voice on the TV as she hands Skeeter a piece of paper, and Elizabeth gives her a thin, cool smile. Skeeter pulls up outside a columned portico two-story house, and with her jacket over her arm and her briefcase in the other, she walks past a black servant trimming a box hedge at the front entrance, hurrying into the hall and up a wide, wooden staircase. She finds her mother, Charlotte, sitting at her dressing table in an evening dress and an elfin brown wig. Charlotte, with a cigarette in one hand, scoots off to the bathroom, pulling off the wig next to several wigs on stands, and grimly eyes her own limp and thin hair in the mirror. Skeeter slumps down on a sofa, looking annoyed, as Charlotte comes out in a brown bob, waiting for Skeeter's approval, and steps out of the green dress, while Skeeter scowls at her reflection. Her mother zips her up roughly, then sits Skeeter down. At dinner, Charlotte pats Carlton's hand, Robert Phelan takes a sip of bourbon, and across the table, Charlotte looks awkward, while Carlton, wearing a stiff smile, glances from one parent to the other. Skeeter fixes her eyes on her mother, who is concentrating on her soup, and as Skeeter storms away from the table, Phelan frowns lamely. His tall, angular wife pats him on the shoulder and leaves the room. Skeeter, striding down a pathway, stops, the sun outlining her long, ringleted hair as she gazes mournfully at a stone bench under a weeping willow tree, and in her mind's eye, she sees herself as a young, teenage girl sitting morosely on the bench.",
    "517": "She runs into the building; the taxi drives away. Evan, his back to the camera, walks to the front door and opens it to Hannah. Through a doorway, Norma can be seen sitting on a chair in the kitchen. She wears a robe over a slip and stockings; she's drinking. Evan stands in the doorway looking at her; he doesn't go in. Norma reacts, turning to her daughter. Hannah, however, has her back turned. She is busy taking charge in the kitchen as Evan speaks. She takes some pills out of a cupboard and hands them to her mother with a glass of water. The camera moves to Evan, who continues to tell his story, ignoring his wife's outburst, as he walks away from the kitchen doorway into the den. Evan walks over to the piano, where several framed family photographs sit in a line on its top. He picks one up as Norma speaks offscreen in the kitchen. The camera moves back to the kitchen as Norma talks. She is still glaring offscreen at the doorway where Evan stood moments before. She holds the water glass and the pills. Evan is back in the doorway, listening to Norma, getting more and more angry. As he makes a retort, he starts to walk back to the den and his piano. Hannah goes back to Norma; she takes the glass of water away. Hannah, choosing to ignore Evan's remark, hands her mother a cup of coffee; she puts her mother's hands on the cup. Norma sips her coffee, softly sobbing. Hannah, reacting, walks away from the counter and, capping the bottle of pills, puts them back in the cupboard. The camera moves in on Hannah's face as she reflects, her voice heard over the screen. The camera leaves Hannah's face as she continues to reflect; it moves to the den, to the row of family photos on the piano: one of a present-day Evan and Norma, others where both Norma and Evan are young, beautiful, hopeful. The film cuts back to the kitchen. Norma stands up; Hannah takes her coffee cup and sets it on the counter. She puts her arm around Hannah's shoulder. Mother and daughter walk out of the kitchen. Norma chuckles. They stop at the entrance to the den. Evan can be seen playing the piano as they continue their conversation. Norma chortles. Hannah laughs, touching her mother. They walk over to Evan at the piano. Norma leans over the piano; Hannah looks off into the distance, deep in reflection. The piano music continues in the background as the movie cuts to Lee walking along a wharf by the waterfront. The wind blows her hair; she hugs the Edward Estlin Cummings book to her chest.",
    "647": "Maman kneels at the entrance and strokes Salim's foot, waking him up and handing him a Coke. Jamal also wakes and is given a Coke, and Maman pats him on the back, smiling. The boys grin and gulp down their drinks. A minibus drives through lush countryside, full of scruffy street kids gazing out the windows. The bus arrives at a large, dilapidated residence where numerous children play in the yard, some on crutches and others on swings. Salim smiles, and the children on the bus jump around excitedly. Maman watches as the children are fed a hot meal, while Jamal catches Maman staring at the new arrivals. In the evening, Maman lines up the new children and closes his eyes, listening to Arvind sing before patting him on the head. Arvind moves back in line, and Salim steps out to sing, but Maman screws up his face and buries his head in his hands. He strikes Latika and punches Punnoose's thighs as everyone laughs. The next day, Salim sits with Punnoose in the bus, intently watching a group of kids on a Mumbai street, then approaches the gang of children, claps his hands, and slaps a giggling child before snatching a baby from her and pretending to drop it in front of Latika. The gang of children run into the busy street, some limping with crutches and others with missing hands, shaking containers at people to beg for money or food. Latika, wearing an eye patch, begs at a stationary car window. At midnight in Maman's compound, Jamal points at some dried chillies, and Latika, wearing rubber gloves, picks up and crushes them in her palms. She sneaks into the dormitory, where all the children are sleeping, finds Salim sleeping naked under a thin sheet, and carefully stuffs the chillies over his groin before sneaking back to her side of the dormitory. Salim jerks awake and dashes to the tap, dousing his groin in cold water, while Punnoose wakes up and points at Latika. Jamal and Latika giggle and smile at each other. A bearded henchman lights a candle as Arvind sings for Maman, who holds up his hand. Punnoose shakes a bottle into a cloth and quickly smothers Arvind's face with it. Salim looks on, eyes wide and mouth agape, as Arvind collapses and Punnoose lifts his limp body to a table. Salim obeys, while the bearded man burns a sizzling liquid in a spoon over the flame.",
    "1024": "Sitting on the toilet, Pete plays a game on his tablet. Debbie opens the door, dressed in a slinky outfit, and, leaving, she carelessly slides the door shut, but it bounces back open, prompting Pete to flip her off. The scene shifts to a club, where later, they face several men. He removes a partial, which Desi puts in her mouth, then drapes her arms around Debbie, who laughs as the younger woman pulls her clothes. Desi returns the partial to a man with a shaved head, who snaps them in and smiles. At the Belasco, the crowd springs to its feet as aging rockers take the stage, with many seats unoccupied toward the back and the balcony. At the bar, Pete wears a furrowed brow, while Ronnie gives them a cowed wave. At a dance club, Desi and the hockey players surround Debbie as she pumps her fists, and later, the two women writhe sideways across the floor like MC Hammer. Desi sways between two hockey players, and later, Debbie snakes side-to-side behind the younger woman, twirling her long, sweaty hair. A tall, boyishly handsome hockey player with a blonde beard dances with the two women, then does air claws with Debbie, and later, he sits with her, his mouth hanging open before he smiles. At the Belasco, the band sits at a table while roadies clear the stage, and the two rockers leave, patting each other's backs. In his car, Pete sits with his eyes glistening and his mouth twisting in a sob. He hangs his head, squeezes his eyes shut, then lifts his head back, his chin quivering, and his gaze calms as he swallows hard, but he bursts into tears all over again. Meanwhile, Debbie's car pulls up at an upscale apartment building, where a doorman stands out front, and Debbie stares at her awkwardly while nodding, and Desi gives a proud smile. Later, Pete lies on the bed using his tablet as Debbie enters, her smile fading as she stands before him with her sweater open and a nipple exposed. Pete glances between his tablet and Debbie several times, eyes her up and down, and then closes the tablet case. Debbie covers herself and walks away, while Pete remains in bed, fully clothed with sneakers on, and then grabs the tablet. Debbie reenters, fully clothed, glaring at Pete as he sits. She raises a brow and nods. In her room, Charlotte plays her keyboard as Debbie slowly shakes her head. Pete's mouth hangs open as he glares at his wife, and Debbie nods with a disheartened gaze, putting her hands on her hips and looking at the floor. Pete stares forward as she walks away, and Debbie raises her arms, then leaves the room. Lying between her parents, Charlotte sucks her fingers.",
    "708": "The marketing guy slaps various slogans onto a whiteboard then smiles cockily at the grouchy newspaper editor. Jameson calms down and speaks into an intercom. Jameson looks through the window at his assistant and points to one of a dozen pill bottles. She nods. He opens it. He forces a calm face and presses the intercom. He smiles graciously at the marketing guy. Brock slips into Jameson's office. Puffing on a cigar, Jameson waves Betty away dismissively. In Times Square, a billboard displays the letters NY followed by a heart and a picture of Spider-Man. A silver-headed man comes up alongside him. Peter ponders. With a friendly smile, the man goes. Later, Harry's doddery old manservant, Bernard, embraces his young master. Peter hands Harry an old basketball. Peter steals the ball off Harry and bounces it back to him in the lavishly-furnished hallway. Grabbing the ball from Harry, Peter turns into Norman's study and stares at the chaise longue and remembers laying Norman's dead body on it. Harry looks at his father's portrait. Peter tosses the ball to Harry and knocks a vase over. Harry nimbly catches the vase in one hand and the ball in the other. Peter looks concerned. Mary Jane strides into the theater where she's working. She comes through to the auditorium and her step falters. Another actress is going through her moves on stage. The actress spots Mary Jane at the back of the auditorium. Sitting in a sea of empty seats, the producer and director follow the actress's awkward gaze. The director puts on a fake smile. The producer looks unconvinced by his own suggestion. Mary Jane's blue eyes well up and she turns and walks away. The artistic duo return to their seats. Outside the theater, a crowd has gathered. Mary Jane's glum expression melts away. She smiles as they applaud. Her smile quickly fades as she realizes the crowd is not for her. She looks up at Spider-Man swinging by with barely-failed resentment. She hurries through the crowd as her name is covered up on the theater front with the name of Andrea Rubin. Peter is standing amidst the delirious crowd, smiling to himself, drinking in the adulation. A marching band cuts through, with workers waving placards and balloons. Brock approaches Gwen in the throng. Peter snaps Mary Jane. She forces a cheery smile as he walks off. The smile drops as she watches him disappear into the crowd. Elsewhere, stoney-faced Flint is lumbering along the street. He tilts his head. Some grains of sand seep out of his ear. He brushes them off his shoulder as he passes through cops. The cops race to the front and back of a large tarpaulin-covered lorry.",
    "564": "Kay pulls out a box of matches and strikes one on the side. He raises it to his cigarette, but as it draws close, the match goes out with a sharp. Kay looks up, sharply. Above him, Tony, the counter guy, is stuck to one high corner of the ceiling by an enormous wad of viscous, dripping fluid. He's dead, a frozen look of terror on his face and the can of Raid still clutched in his hand. Laurel is at the end of her rope. Jay's smile vanishes and his jaw drops as he figures it out. He starts to reach for his gun. Kay races into the morgue just as the examination table explodes into the air, revealing Edgar, who was hiding beneath it. Now everything happens at once. Jay leaps back and draws the Noisy Cricket, Kay pulls out his series four deatomizer, and Edgar holds his shotgun under Laurel's chin, using her body to shield his own. Edgar backs away with Laurel, further into the morgue, toward a glass window that looks out at the base of an air shaft. Jay and Kay advance, slowly, cornering him. And with that he turns, leaps -- and crashes right through the window, into the air shaft. Edgar, still clutching Laurel, explodes up over a railing. Jay and Kay duck into the air shaft and look up -- too far to climb, and the walls are smooth anyway. And Jay starts running down the street, where dozens of cabs are waiting at the intersection. He's running from cab to cab, pounding on windows, scaring the living shit out of people. Jay and Kay rush in from the door under the World's Fair mural, and head toward the main display screen; all around them, the MIB staffers are in frenetic activity in response to the threat from above. Just then, a loud alarm wails. At the main viewing screen, a green line shoots out from the Arquillian ship, striking a region of planet Earth -- headquarters, where every bell, whistle and light imaginable is going off. Viewing the screen, it now reads. Kay and Zed both look up at once, scowling. They follow his gaze, up, over the computer terminals. There, on the wall in front of them, where it has loomed for the entire movie, is the enormous mural of the 1964 World's Fair grounds. Most prominent in the mural are two tall towers that rise dramatically from the ground, topped by the two flying saucers from the very first alien contact. As they stand there, wide-eyed, staring at it, we -- the real-live twin towers on the actual fairgrounds in Flushing Meadows. A taxi screeches to a halt at the edge of a fence a hundred yards away.",
    "938": "Watson yanks out the large splinter of wood, and Holmes drinks the contents of the vial Watson handed him. It appears to have no effect, but suddenly, Holmes opens his eyes wide and stares around wildly, then leaps to his feet. Holmes relaxes a little as Watson examines his foot, and Watson smiles wistfully for a moment. Watson tosses down a medical instrument and looks down thoughtfully, exchanging a surprised look with Sim, then regards Holmes for a moment before leaning back against the side of a boxcar with a resigned expression. In Switzerland, an imposing castle is perched on a mountainside, saddling a massive waterfall. Delegates are arriving at the castle, expanding their back falls, which tumble hundreds of feet vertically down the mountainside. A horse-drawn sleigh arrives with Moriarty aboard, who has an elegant figure with a top hat and overcoat. He gets out of the sleigh and goes into the castle, where the Maitre D' has a book containing photos of all the delegates and identifies and welcomes him. Moriarty steps forward. In a ballroom, elegant couples in evening wear or military dress uniform dance across the floor. Holmes, Mycroft, the others, and Watson stand at the edge of the dance floor, all wearing white tie and tails. Samantha is wearing a deep red dress. Holmes holds his hand out, Sim takes it, and they step onto the dance floor, whirling around in circles along with the other couples. Holmes looks a bit out of place, his face unshaven and heavily bruised, as he observes the other people in the room. He notices details like a man's hand resting on the hilt of a sword, a woman's necklace, a man's medals, a military man holding a wine glass, and an eye crossing a white uniform. Holmes scans the people's faces until his eyes settle on a man in a black uniform with a facial scar. Holmes looks thoughtfully at Sim, steers her back over to Watson, and gestures to him. Arm in arm, Watson and Sim take to the dance floor while Holmes works on the man's face, and a man is chloroformed. Watson nods as Holmes walks over to a footman in 18th-century costume with a white parted wig and hands him a letter. The footman nods and takes it as Holmes leaves the ballroom. Watson walks over to Sim and whispers in her ear, and she looks surprised. Meanwhile, Moriarty chats with a delegate wearing an orange sash when the footman approaches him and hands him Holmes' letter. Moriarty reads it and looks around in concern.",
    "1387": "Snape waves the moth away, blows out a candle, and a slide show begins, displaying an ancient woodcut of a horrific beast at the front of the room. Ron frowns down at his book while the class stares mutely at a slide of an attacking werewolf; Hermione waits desperately for someone to respond to Snape's question. The moth flutters by Harry, releasing a tiny cloud of moth dust into the air, which Harry lifts his palm to. Meanwhile, Malfoy's parchment reappears, and Harry stares at it, observing a crude caricature of himself in Quidditch robes being struck by lightning repeatedly. Later, Harry opens his eyes as Ron, Fred, George, and Hermione slowly come into focus, standing at the foot of his bed in the hospital wing. As Harry edges up against his pillow, a nurse in the background removes the spokes of an umbrella from a Hufflepuff player's neck, prompting uncomfortable glances. Someone tips a bag of splintered wood and twisted twigs onto his bed. As Harry stares, a gentle wind can be heard, then Harry shakes his head in response to Lupin's question and sets Hedwig free of her traces. As she soars into the sky, Harry and Lupin watch from the lake's edge. The great doors open and Fred and George enter, dropping the Invisibility Cloak to reveal a cross-looking Harry. Fred slaps a worn roll of parchment into Harry's hand, which he unfurls to find it blank until George touches his wand to the parchment, causing intricate ink lines to surface and spread like veins. Harry reads the curious words at the top. A trapdoor lifts, and Harry's eyes appear as he pulls himself up, but a door bangs open. Quickly, Harry hides and watches a man's boots descend the stairs as Malfoy's eyes shift and regard Hermione with disgust. Suddenly, SPLAT! Malfoy takes a snowball to the grill and splutters. Malfoy glances about in confusion when two more snowballs hit him. Hermione and Ron glance about uneasily as Crabbe and Goyle start for them, but then FLUMPH! their knees buckle and they fall headfirst into the snow. Draco begins to back away fearfully, eyeing the mist, when his ski mask is pulled over his eyes, he's spun about, kicked roughly, and sent stumbling over the rise and out of sight. Ron and Hermione stand frozen, exchange a nervous glance, and dash off, but go flying and land on their pants in the snow. As they sit up, they hear laughter, and Hermione's eyes narrow in suspicion. The Invisibility Cloak drops to reveal a grinning Harry, who is smiling as the trio trudge through the swirling snow.",
    "918": "In the hallway, Barton sees the rugged man behind him. The stranger stops. Behind Barton, the stout, baby-faced man steps into the hall and shoots him. The G-man lurches and falls. In the street, Purvis turns. The shooter and his rugged associate leave. Outside, Purvis races toward the building. Baum whips out his gun, then peers at a car parked in the alley. Inside, Purvis enters the hallway and raises his gun. He advances cautiously. Purvis stops, looking down. Glancing whirly ahead, he crouches. Purvis' mouth drops open as he stares downward. On the floor, a blood pool spreads beneath Barton. As the wounded man twitches feebly, Purvis watches with a clenched jaw. His expression grows solemn. He glares down the hall. He rises, leaving a lifeless Barton. Outside, Baum sees two men hurrying down the alley steps. The baby-faced shooter raises a Tommy gun. The G-man ducks behind a wall as bullets pepper its surface. Scrambling out, he takes cover behind a garden planter. As the two criminals get into the parked car, Baum pops up and returns fire. The car pulls away. Back indoors, Purvis bursts into the apartment. He ignores the panic maul and leans out an open window. As the car below quits the alley, Purvis shoots, then hurries out of the apartment. Outside, two agents pull their car up as their superior exits the building. Purvis stops, staring with his mouth agape. The agent shifts his rueful gaze. With a slow, deliberate stride, Purvis steps closer to his men. Purvis' frustrated gaze scans the agents. His breath puffing visibly in the night air, he steps away. A bank's doors open. Three men in long coats enter. Our gaze drifts up to find Pete between Dillinger and a heavyset thug. The two leaner men split off together. Pete encounters a guard, sucker punches him, and bangs his head against the counter. Without breaking his stride, Dillinger draws a gun in each hand. The bankers all obey. Pete shifts his aim. A banker leads Dillinger to a vault. Now in his office, Hoover talks on the phone. Hoover shifts his resentful gaze and works his jaw. In Chicago, Purvis grimly lowers the phone, then shifts his troubled gaze. A locomotive pulls into a station. Puffs of brake steam blast the unfazed travelers and workers on the platform. The heavy wheels slow to a halt. An older, smartly dressed man with wizened features disembarks flanked by two associates. He peers down the platform through beady eyes. The three newcomers make their way down the platform, suitcases in hand. Travelers mill about on the vast terminal's marble floors. The three arriving men pause, taking in their surroundings. Now at a shoeshine stand.",

Harken watches from behind his desk as Nick picks up the tumbler of whiskey and glugs it all in one go. It spills down his chin as he drains the glass. At the dentist's, bearded Dale is assisting his attractive boss, Julia, with a patient. A spraying device. She sprays Dale's crotch. Julia stands up. She administers gas. Kurt's boss, Jack, opens his car door. Jack drives away from the chemical company. Kurt spins around. Kurt is with Dale. Kurt spots a hot chick. The premises of Comnidyne.

Nick glares stony-faced as Harken creases up. Harken turns back. Harken steps closer. Harken turns and walks away. Brow furrowed, Nick looks at the floor. Kurt shows up for work at Pellit and Sons. As he takes off his jacket, Jack's son, Bobby, scoots back in his black leather office chair and glowers. He's short with a goatee, a high forehead, and wispy, thin comb-over. He scoots back into the office. Kurt goes through to him. A guy in a wheelchair. She's practically nude. Julia locks Dale in. She's wearing nothing but lacy knickers, stockings, and suspenders beneath an open lab coat. She smirks. He sidles nervously to a chair and sits down. She slowly runs her fingers along his beard and then his chest. She clutches his balls. She lets go. He frantically rattles the handle of the locked door. He exits. Night, at the bar. Kenny takes the cash they offered and goes. Dale is filling out a form in the dentist's office when he suddenly has his eyes covered. Julia gives smiley blonde Stacy a hug. They turn to a troubled-looking Dale, who forces a smile. Off they go. Stacey is gassed. Julia dives for Dale's crotch. A tablet computer. She holds it up. Compromising photos of Julia faking a variety of sex acts with an unconscious Dale. Doggy style. She winks and leaves the room. Exasperated, Dale's eyes rove in thought.

Barnes strides past them. Taylor follows him to a car. They all move to cars as President Ashton emerges from the elevator. The President gets into the car by which Barnes and Taylor are standing. They follow him in. The convoy, headed by the two motorcycles, sets off from the underground garage. Behind the motorcycles is a police car, then two four-by-fours with their tailgates open. Then two stretch limos with more vehicles bringing up the rear. Armed police line the route. Armed men in uniform are on rooftops and behind barred gates. In the Presidential limo, Taylor grins. Protesters grow rowdy as the motorcade passes them. The convoy stops by a statue of Pizarro at Spain. The Secret Service agents spill out. His car door is opened. Taylor and Barnes climb up. Barnes scowls as he scans the press photographers. His narrow face is permanently grim as he turns from the cameras and walks around the car to join Taylor and the President. Taylor and Barnes lead the way. The President is behind them. Holden and Matthews bring up the rear. Taylor glances across at Barnes as the group makes their way to the plaza. They emerge through an archway of the crowded plaza. The President strides towards a child in its mother's arms. He shakes the baby's hand. He greets the flag-waving crowd, grasping hands as he passes. Barnes spots a man wearing dark glasses slip his hand into an inside pocket. The man's camera drops to the ground. The presidential party continues, Holden replacing Barnes at the front. Barnes now behind the President. Two soldiers on the roof. President Ashton climbs red-carpeted steps onto a podium placed in the middle of the plaza, which is filled with a flag-waving, cheering crowd free from protesters. The balding man now walks to a lectern. Barnes and Taylor stride across the podium and stand facing out towards the sea of yellow and red flags. Standing amongst the crowd is a chunky man in a blue and white checked shirt. He holds a video camera. Barnes notices a curtain twitch on an upper floor. Taylor follows Barnes' gaze. Barnes goes to speak into a mic in his cuff, but stops. Barnes' eyes are fixed on the window and the curtain. He speaks into his mic. Taylor and Barnes exchange a look. Barnes sees the man in the checked shirt pointing his camera at the upper floors behind him to where Barnes saw the fluttering curtain. The man turns back around checking his camera.",

Edward curves around the tall bushes that hide the front door and steps onto the porch. The boards squeal and creak, but he continues on. A cat screams out from a broken wicker rocker. Catching his breath, Edward reaches the front door. The doorknob is ancient brass with two projections that look like horns. Yet Edward extends his hand, reaching closer and closer before he finally, impossibly fast, the door opens, revealing an old woman with a patch over her left eye. She looks like she's been dead for years, but too stubborn to lie down. Zacky and Don Price wait for Edward, each moment more convinced he's already dead, but suddenly, he's back at the gate. The old woman steps out of the shadows behind Edward, flipping up her eye patch. When their flashlight beam hits her left eye, it shines with a hellish glow. We rush in on Zacky, who is paralyzed by what he sees. An old man -- Zacky -- stands on a wobbly stepladder, changing a lightbulb. Suddenly, the ladder gives way and he falls, dead. We rush in on Don Price as twenty-year-old Don Price falls face-forward on the tile, face mushed in the grout, very much dead. Don and Zacky both tremble with fear, the latter has tears in his eyes. The brothers suddenly bolt, still standing next to the old woman, Edward smiles. Edward helps her back inside. He could leave now, but curiosity gets the better of him. The old woman turns to him slightly, still not facing him. She smiles a little, a crooked grin of broken teeth, then turns leaning her face right in front of his. On a silent count of one, two, three, Edward looks into the eye. This time we don't cut, instead we hold on Edward as he witnesses his death. He stares transfixed, perplexed and amused. The old woman nods, heading back to the house. Dr. Julius Bennett (85) enters from the foyer, still winded from coming down the stairs. He judges her belly and leans close to her, whispering in her ear. She smiles, surprised but not doubting. Coming out from the kitchen, Will slowly climbs the stairs. They creak with every step. The wall is filled with family photos of happier times, mostly pictures of Will starting when he was an infant and ending at his wedding. As he climbs the stairs, we can see him growing up with every step. A crack of sunlight spills around the half-open door at the end of the hallway.",

In the garage, Jeep is cleaning the cot, and Bob strides over, sees the old cot on a bench, and stares at his son. They're outside as Jeep glares at his father, who shakes his head. Jeep looks down and away from Bob, then glances at his father, who screws up his eyes, and Jeep lowers his eyes. Bob pats him affectionately on the cheek, and Jeep watches his father go. As Bob enters the diner, Howard turns to him, and Bob holds his thumb and forefinger close together. He sees static on the television screen, and outside, Jeep's attention is drawn to something down the road. Jeep steps forward and glances at the horizon, where an anomalous-growing dark cloud fills it. Inside, Bob steps up on a chair to examine the TV set, while Jeep looks in the opposite direction, finding another encroaching black cloud dominating the horizon there. Others look at the screen, and Kyle proffers money. Percy switches on a radio and tries tuning it in, as Charlie's eyes venture to the TV. Sandra gets to her feet, and all six of them are still as they stare at the TV, four standing, with Audrey and Howard sitting. Kyle is on the phone in the back and removes his hat when Bob had switched off the television. In the garage, Jeep is looking at the apparently pristine top of the Beamer's engine block and its air intake, feeling hopeless. An old white Ford Sedan turns off the road and heads towards the petrol pumps, passes them, and draws to a halt outside the diner. The driver's door opens, and the wheels and stanchions of a Zimmer frame are plunked on the rocky ground as an elderly woman with white hair and a pink cardigan emerges from the car, walks a little, then shuts the door. Jeep looks curiously around as the old woman's shadow is cast on the diner door. She opens the door and shuffles in with the aid of the Zimmer, and Kyle and Percy glance around. Charlie spots her as Audrey glances up at the old woman, who grins and looks over at Howard and Sandra.",
    "977": "As he passed his door's room, the old man calls out to him. Grainy footage of him getting zapped. Benjamin stares at doors who looks around thoughtfully. Benjamin walks on up the corridor. He stops outside the door to his room and stands looking pensive. It's dark as Benjamin walks up outside Thomas's house and knocks on the door. A servant walks to the front door, pulling up his braces. The servant opens the door and directs Benjamin up the stairs. Benjamin opens the door of Thomas's room and goes inside. Thomas is asleep in bed. Benjamin gently shakes him. As the very first rays of dawn light creep across the sky, Thomas's car pulls up outside the country house. The chauffeur and Benjamin get out of the car. As Benjamin walks around the vehicle, the chauffeur helps Thomas out of the car. With the sky tinged orange, Benjamin wheels Thomas along in a wheelchair. They come to a halt. The chauffeur waits in the car and pulls his cap over his eyes. In front of the lake house, Benjamin lifts Thomas out of the wheelchair and carries him over his shoulders down to a jetty which leads out into the waters of the vast lake. He carefully sets Thomas down and lowers him onto a wooden seat. Benjamin pats Thomas on the shoulder and takes a seat behind his father. Thomas sits looking out across the expanse of water towards the dawn on the far horizon. He nods to himself as he takes in the view. Thomas closes his eyes and sighs. He and Benjamin are silhouetted against the rising sun. An assortment of buttons is swept off a table into a jar. Thomas lies dead on a table. An undertaker places the jar of buttons on Thomas's stomach. Benjamin and an elderly Queenie visit him as he lies in an open casket in an ornate chapel at rest. He holds out his arm. She takes it. The exterior of the majestic theater on Broadway, a yellow cab pulls up outside the theater. Benjamin gets out clutching a bunch of flowers. He pays the cab driver and goes into the theater. Benjamin steps into the darkened auditorium. On stage, a woman in a headdress is lifted up by two men who exit stage right. Certain beautiful with a long plaited ponytail, Daisy takes to the stage with her dance partner. Benjamin watches as the man raises her aloft like the thicker head of a ship against the painted backdrop of a stormy ocean. Benjamin, no longer wearing spectacles, takes a seat and stares fixedly at them as the dancer turns gracefully with Daisy reclining in his arms. The spotlights shift to follow their movements as they prance left and right.",
    "684": "A convertible smashes into a chasing police car, which is drawn alongside, then heads straight for Peter. Peter leaps in the air over the convertible, completes a backwards somersault, and lands, poised. The car chase is still on. One of the guys in the convertible pumps a shotgun. The leading police car spins. The second hits it. The third swerves to avoid it. It catapults into the air and drops towards a group of bystanders. It stops, suspended above them. Cowering, they all look closely at the squad car seemingly hanging in midair. It's caught in a web. Spider-Man swings past. Spider-Man slips between the cab and trailer of a truck as he pursues the convertible. Spider-Man soars, dives, and weaves to avoid the bullets being pumped directly at him. He fires two web pulls. He lands on the car's boot. He ensnares the men's weapons in their hands and tosses them over an overhead light, the men still attached. On stage, MJ stares at Peter's empty seat. Peter screeches up to the theater in the convertible. Peter leaves the car, then enters the theater. Peter bends down to tie his shoelace, watched by the usher, then straightens up. His tie is crooked. The usher in a waistcoat and dicky bow points to his tie. Peter straightens his necktie, then steps forward. He produces the ticket. The usher folds his arms. Peter walks to the door, then turns back. The usher gestures, locking his mouth. Peter looks at his ticket and glares at him. Peter sits on a stoop opposite the theater. A nearby street musician plays. Peter watches her, then closes his eyes and shakes his head incredulously. He steps forward, watching expectantly. MJ comes out through the stage door. A girl comes out after her. Peter smiles contentedly. Peter's smile fades as he sees the guy kissing MJ. Peter watches a police car fly past, followed by a few more. His attention returns to MJ. Then he looks down sadly and moves off. MJ and her man walk off, arm-in-arm. MJ looks around briefly as if expecting to see Peter, but there's nobody there. Peter enters a steam-filled backstreet. He breaks into a run, then tears open his shirt to reveal the Spider-Man costume. He pulls on the red mask, leaps into the air, casting a web line to pull himself up. Later, a group of squad cars weave their way down a wide city street. Above them, Spider-Man swings from building to building. Hanging mid-swing, he flicks his wrists. He falls 10 stories, landing on some metal. He hauls himself up from the now dented pipe. He takes off his Spider-Man mask and examines his wrist.",
    "224": "Everett gives her an ingratiating laugh and ostentatiously fans some of his money, while she watches him do so. The big man, who appears as she leaves, stops chewing and slowly raises his napkin to his lips to give them a dainty pat. Big Dan chuckles as he draws up a chair, and Everett rises and digs in his pocket. As the three men start to move off, Big Dan gives Delmar a tilt of the head and a crinkling smile. Meanwhile, Pappy O'Daniel sits smoking a cigar, nursing a glass of whiskey, and soliciting the counsel of his overweight retinue, narrowing his eyes at him, wondering what he's getting at. Pappy whips off his hat and slaps at Junior with it, glaring around the table, as Eckard grunts and starts to rise, only for Pappy to whip him back down with his hat. Eckard, upon settling back, looks around the table and helpfully relays information. The car boosted from the general store has been pulled off the road and parked a few yards into a field littered with bluebonnets and rimmed with moss-dripping oak, where Everett, Delmar, and Big Dan sit on a blanket around a large picnic hamper. Big Dan is just sucking the last piece of chicken off a bone, tossing the bone over his shoulder, belching, and sighing. Delmar is pleased and embarrassed, rising to his feet and tossing down his napkin. He reaches up and with one hand easily rips a stout limb off a tree, casually stripping its twigs. He swings at Delmar, who staggers back with a grunt, as Everett wears a puzzled smile. Though stunned, Delmar is faster to size things up and charges Big Dan, wrapping his arms around him. Big Dan rears back and whacks at his head, while Everett remains puzzled but willing to be instructed. Big Dan walks awkwardly over to Everett with Delmar still attached to him like a hunting dog locked onto a bear, taking a break from whacking at Delmar to deliver a blow to Everett, which catches him on the chin and sends him reeling. Big Dan bear hugs Delmar and tosses him away, whacking Everett into a semi-conscious heap and then pawing through his pockets. He walks over to Delmar, who is on the ground moaning, and kicks him several times, taking Delmar's shoebox and flipping off the top to reveal a bed of straw with the toad resting on it. He pokes around the straw with his finger, finding nothing else inside, as Delmar, moaning, looks blearily up through swollen eyes. Big Dan has the toad in his enormous fist, and Delmar moans through cracked and bloody lips as Big Dan squeezes the frog, crushing it, and tosses it away against a tree.",
    "686": "The sphere begins to spin as Rosie approaches Octavius and smiles, with Octavius smiling back and taking a pair of dark goggles from her. He puts the high-tech goggles on and taps keys on a control panel. Laser projectors mounted at the top and bottom of each curved pillar fire slender yellowish beams through the tiny sphere, causing it to glow and spin faster until it suddenly expands into a fiery ball resembling the Sun. An old scientist speaks to Harry while the mechanical arms grasp an energy field surrounding the glowing sphere. Peter looks down and sees a paper clip lift off the floor, shooting towards the fusion machine, as the air ducts and hanging lights swing towards it. Peter stares up, bathed in an orange glow, while Octavius, looking a little flustered, taps on the control panel again. Necklaces and other personal objects get sucked into the sphere, and Octavius peers around at his anxious-looking wife as Peter moves away and Harry looks around. Metal panels are sucked off the walls, an arc of white-hot energy blasts out of the sphere, cutting into the ceiling, and an equipment unit rolls towards Harry until Spider-Man swings him to safety. Spider-Man then leaps onto the ceiling as Octavius looks up and swings a mechanical arm at him, knocking him against the wall. A small energy arc leaps out from the sun's sphere, causing the windows to implode and shards of glass to fly towards Octavius' wife, her face reflected in one of them, heading straight for her eye. Octavius sees her slump to the floor, and an arc of energy surges from the sphere, short-circuiting the inhibitor chip. Spider-Man leaps over to the far cables, tugs on them as sparks fly out, and Octavius' body stops shaking and drops to the floor along with the mechanical arms. The power cables come away, and Spider-Man backflips onto the floor as the sphere implodes, bursts into a cloud of fiery particles, and implodes again, filling the land with darkness. Emergency vehicles arrive at the scene, with two singed scientists leaving the building, while Harry trudges onto the street with an angry expression. An Oscorp exec is present as Rosie's dead body, covered on a stretcher trolley, is wheeled over to an ambulance. Without a scratch, Peter wanders out of the building. At a hospital, medics are about to operate on an unconscious Octavius when the doctor points to graphics on a screen, showing Octavius' mechanical limbs suspended from the ceiling. The doctor starts up a circular saw but stops, hearing a sound, and looks up to see a pulley hanging from the ceiling swinging. Edgy, the doctor prepares to cut one of the limbs, but as he lowers the blade, he sees something reflected in another medic's goggles.",
    "558": "Indy grabs a crowbar and fends off two sailors who attack him from the sides. He sees that the Cross is about to be swept overboard and lunges for it. He snatches up the Cross only to be knocked down to the deck by a giant wave. Indy struggles to his feet, managing to avoid the giant fuel drums sliding across the deck around him as several more drums come his way. Indy turns around and pummels two sailors with one punch, then sees a large Stevedore's hook above him and climbs up on crates to reach it. He grabs hold of the hook and uses it to swing all the way across the deck, narrowly avoiding a huge wave behind him, before jumping into the rollicking ocean, still holding onto the Cross. On the ship, a giant fuel drum rolls wildly, falling directly onto a crate of TNT, causing the entire ship to blow, sending an enormous orange fireball into the sky. As bits of debris fall from the sky like rain, Indy bobs up in the water amid the debris, holding the Cross in his hand. He grabs for something to keep him afloat. Students walk along brick, tree-lined paths, while dressed in professorial tweeds, Indy stands before his class, where there is laughter. Marcus Brody approaches Indy's classroom and peers through the window in the door to see Indy completing his lecture. Brody enters the lecture hall and stands at the rear of the room as Indy stands at his desk and students begin to disperse. A pretty coed puts a note on the desk as Brody approaches, and the last of the students leaves the lecture hall. Indy removes the cloth-wrapped Cross from his desk, places it on the desk, and takes off his glasses as Brody examines the Cross. Indy gathers up his books and makes his way toward the door, turning back toward Brody, now holding the Cross. Indy takes the term papers then turns to enter his private office, where he goes to his desk and finds a thick envelope with a foreign postmark on it. Indy stuffs his mail into his coat pockets, goes to the window, slides it open, and steps out into the garden. He escapes through the garden and walks briskly toward the street, smiling and enjoying his freedom. As he arrives at the curb, a long black Packard sedan pulls up before him and three men step out. Indy is ushered into a large Art Deco apartment and left alone amid numerous museum-quality artifacts displayed around the room. After a moment, Walter Donovan enters from across the room, and during the brief time that the door is open, we hear a cocktail party going on in the next room with voices and soft sounds.",
    "1113": "Lockhart flies upwards, hits the roof of the cave and falls. The cave roof starts to collapse. The passage between Ron and Harry is completely blocked. Harry peers through a tiny gap in the rocks. Lying on the ground, Lockhart smiles vacantly. He picks up a stone. Ron grabs the stone and hits him over the head with it. Harry climbs over fallen rocks. Holding his wand in his hand, he starts to explore the cave. On the wall ahead, he sees a circular hinged door decorated with a pattern of snakes. He goes towards it, and starts to speak. One snake glides around the circumference, unlocking the mechanism. The heavy metal door swings open. Holding his wand as protection, Harry walks warily through the circular opening of the long and narrow tunnel. He climbs down the few rungs of a short metal ladder and jumps off at the bottom. He finds himself in a long, damp chamber. Ahead of him runs a wide paved path lined on either side by huge carved snake heads, their stone mouths gaping open. Harry walks towards the massive carved head of a bearded man illuminated with a green light. The head is reflected in the water beneath. He sees the still figure of a girl lying on the wet stone floor. He runs towards her and kneels beside her. Her face is pale and her eyes are closed. Harry looks around and sees Tom Riddle in the shadows. He picks up Harry's wand. Harry gets up and holds out his hand. He writes fiery letters in the air with Harry's wand. Harry stares at him. They glare angrily at each other. They both look up. The phoenix drops something into Harry's hand. The handsome bird swipes away down the chamber. Harry unrolls the crumpled sorting hat and looks at it in surprise. Riddle stretches out his hand. The mouth of the huge bearded statue starts to open. Harry watches in fascinated horror as the huge stone mouth opens wider and wider. A gigantic serpent slithers out. Harry drops the hat and runs. The serpent splashes through the water beneath the statue. It slithers ominously after Harry, who trips and falls. Harry cowers, protecting his head, as the serpent prepares to strike. Fawkes suddenly reappears. The phoenix flies at the serpent's head, flapping its wings; the brave bird pecks repeatedly at the other creature's huge yellow eyes. Riddle calls out angrily. Fawkes swoops off. Harry scrambles to his feet. He backs away as the serpent thrashes his head. The serpent feels his footsteps and lunges forward. Harry makes a dash for it. He splashes through a shallow pool with the huge serpent close behind him.",
    "1101": "They straighten up. As Smokie stares down the rifle's barrel, he reconsiders. Spider lets go of Thao, and he and his buddies retreat to his car. Walt keeps the gun trained on them as they go. Thao rejoins his family. Walt heads back into his house. Sue, Thao, and the others go back to theirs. Walt is at the kitchen sink. Hearing something, he picks his rifle up from beside his cooker and goes out onto the porch to investigate. He looks surprised to find some of his neighbors laying gifts of food and flowers on his front steps. The Hmongs leave. Walt stares at the platters of food with distaste. He puts them all in the trash. He sees more of his neighbors approaching with gifts. He intercepts Sue and Thao. He looks sheepishly at Walt. Walt marches back to his house. Sue, her mother, and Thao get back to theirs. Sue turns back to look at Walt. Father Janovich finds Walt sitting on his porch, smoking his cigarette. Walt gets up. Father Janovich nods slightly. Walt is at the barber's. Sue is with a white boy, Trey. They approach three black youths. As the black guys hassle Sue and Trey, Walt pulls up at the junction in his pickup. Walt watches thoughtfully. Looking uneasy, Walt drives across the junction. Walt pulls up beside them. The black guys notice Walt. Walt steps out of his pickup. Chewing on a plug of tobacco, he squares up to the three black guys. He spits. Walt points his finger like a gun. He cocks his thumb. The guys hold Sue back. Walt pulls a Colt .45 pistol. Trey hurries off, and Walt puts his gun away. He turns to the black guys. He turns back to his pickup. Walt looks menacingly back at them. He gets in the truck with Sue in the passenger seat. Walt drives off in a leisurely, unhurried fashion. Walt nods thoughtfully. Walt sits down on his porch with a newspaper. He sees the elderly grandma from next door looking over at him. He picks up his glasses and puts them on to read the paper. He looks down at Daisy. Disgruntled, he looks across the street at a white woman unloading groceries from her car. She drops them. Three passing Hmong youths make no attempt to help her. One of them mimes shagging her. He sits back down as Thao helps the woman. Walt puts his glasses down and picks up a mug. He takes a drink. Walt looks over at the old lady next door, and she gives him a nod. With big buttons. Cigarettes. Walt looks furious. Walt puts away a photo of his wife.",
    "617": "She looks at the floor. He raises his glass, then turns away, popping the fangs back in his mouth as he makes his way through the crowd. Alison has her back to him. A morose Sydney sits alone at the table, his goblet-like glass in front. Vincent and Elena sit in the back. Elena winds the window down. Vincent leans forward. Sydney steps back from the car window and knits his hands together by his chin. Drenched by the rain, he stares at them with window glides up. Elena smiles at the driver. The car pulls away, leaving a dispirited Sydney at the roadside, his hands clasped together, as if in prayer. His long cape hangs in a puddle on the pavement. He looks up at an electronic billboard from which Sophie stares at him. She blows a kiss. Breathing heavily, he hangs his head as the rain beats down on the dark street. In Clayton's office, Sydney smiles. Dressed in a sharp pin-striped suit and dark glasses, Sydney sits opposite Vincent in a sushi bar, hurriedly taking notes and smiling enthusiastically at Vincent's comments. Elena goes through Sydney's article, editing out the parts she doesn't like. She hands it back to him. He nods with a grateful smile as he looks it over. Sydney stands behind Elena and a dark-haired woman as they airbrush Vincent's publicity photographs on a computer. They digitally remove a pimple. Sydney takes a copy of Sharp's magazine from a news kiosk on a street corner. He flips through it to find his article. A broad smile spreads over Sydney’s face. Sydney works at his computer in an office, his own. Over time, it fills up with various gift baskets. A female property agent shows Sydney around a spacious apartment. Someone hands Sydney a gift box at his desk, the new Omega Speedmaster watch. He takes off his old watch and flings it. Sydney's name is taped on a number of guest lists. Getting on like a house on fire, Sydney and Clayton share a joke in the lift. Wearing a white robe, Sydney sits in a steam room. A wide smile plays on his lips. Alison reads an article on Sydney in a magazine. She's sitting at a restaurant table. Lawrence joins her. On it is a white Russian cocktail. He reads over her shoulder. Lawrence removes his arm from around her shoulder, picks up his drink and takes a sip. As he walks away, Alison glances down at her novel and frowns. The exterior of Sydney's apartment building. Alison is inside the building. Wearing a stripey robe, Sydney opens his door. Alison nods. Alison throws her head back with a sigh as he fetches some documents.",
    "199": "He turns his back to Zuzu, pretending to be tinkering with the flower, sticks the fallen petals in his watch pocket, rearranges the flower, and then turns back to Zuzu. George puts the flower in a glass of water on the table beside her bed. They whisper. Mary comes in and picks up the phone. George enters shot and stands listening to her, then snatches the phone from Mary. She puts a restraining hand on his arm, but he shakes it off. She cannot know that George's tirade against Mrs. Welch is really a tirade against the world, against life itself, against God. Mary succeeds in wresting the phone from George's hand and speaks quickly into the phone. But the telephone is suddenly alive with a powerful male voice calling. Mary once more tries to take the phone from him. But before he can think of an insult to top Welch's, we hear a click on the phone. He yells at Tommy, noisily playing with his vacuum cleaner, and Janie is still practicing at the piano, monotonously. The room has suddenly become ominously quiet, the only sound being George's labored breathing. George goes over to a corner of the room where his workshop is set up—a drawing table, several models of modern buildings, bridges, etc. Savagely, he kicks over the models, picks up some books, and hurls them into the corner. Mary and the children watch, horrified. George looks around and sees them staring at him as if he were some unknown wild animal. Mary and the children stare at him, stunned by his furious outburst. There is silence in the room until Janie breaks into sobs. The sight of Mary and the children suffering is too much for George, so he looks around him, then quickly goes out the front door of the house. Mary goes to the phone and picks it up. Potter is seated at his desk, his goon beside him, signing some papers. George is seated in a chair before the desk, without a hat or coat, covered lightly with snow. George turns and starts out of the office as Potter picks up the phone and dials. George is out of the door by now. The camera moves closer to Potter. George comes out of the bank into the falling snow, crosses the street, tugs at the door of his old car, finally steps over the door, and drives off. The place is an Italian restaurant with a bar, the bottles sparkle, and there are Christmas greens and holly decorating the place. It has a warm, welcoming spirit, like Martini himself, who is welcoming new arrivals. There is an air of festivity and friendliness, more like a party than a public drinking place.",
    "434": "Charlie puts on his hat and leaves. Eddie empties his glass and slaps it on the shelf next to Sarah. She pours it out, saying nothing. Sarah hands Eddie his drink without looking him in the eye. She pours herself a very stiff drink as Eddie moves about restlessly. Sarah drinks her drink. Still drinking, she turns to him. They embrace and kiss one another without putting down their glasses. The room is a mess and Sarah is drunk. She sits on her knees on the floor, pecking at the keys of her typewriter with one finger. Her bottle and her glass are beside her. A bare-chested Eddie is in the kitchen behind her, tossing empty cans and bottles from the sink into a garbage bag. He carelessly wipes the sink, then throws down the dishrag and goes to the closet, pulling out his leather case. Reaching for the bottle, Sarah abruptly lurches forward over her typewriter, and knocks the bottle over. Eddie stares at Sarah as she sways limply on her knees, unmindful of her open robe. Eddie picks up the bottle and sets it before her. Taking her ashtray, Eddie rises, runs his hand through her hair for a moment, and then carries off the ashtray and empties it in the garbage bag. Sarah, still hopelessly drunk, is sprawled out on her bed, futilely attempting to dial a telephone. Eddie, in a clean shirt and pants, watches her. He sets the bottle down near the typewriter and notices the sheet of paper stuck in the typewriter's carriage. He bends down to read it. She falls back on the bed. Eddie pulls the paper out of the carriage and reads it. He thinks for a moment, then angrily crumples the paper in his hands and throws it at her. Eddie walks off. Eddie gives her a look, then lowers his eyes. Eddie turns and slaps her on the cheek. He reaches for his jacket. As Eddie pushes through the glass doors to the front room of Johnny's bar, he looks around at the unused pool tables, then goes to the bar. A man in a business suit comes out of the back room and joins him at the bar. The man looks to the bartender for his answer. Eddie takes his beer to the back room. The poker game is in progress. Four men are playing. One of them is Bert Gordon. His glass of milk is beside him on the table. He takes note of Eddie's presence with a quick dart of his eyes. Eddie takes a seat next to Bert. As the cards are dealt, Eddie steals a glance at the man he has come to see.",
    "1230": "Ben's smart saloon pulls up outside an olive green clapboard house with a white picket fence. A black and white Great Dane stands barking at him in the garden. Ben gets out of the car, and locks it with a remote. Dressed in a smart suit and tie, Ben goes to the fence but stops short and stares at the dog. A neighbor who is gardening spots him. Ben parks on an upper story of a car park, which looks onto St. Matthew Medical Center. Ben enters the center and goes to a blonde middle-aged woman on the reception desk. Ben's in a lift. He stands aside as two doctors wearing stethoscopes get in with him. Ben holds back the door. Emily gets in. They all face the front. Then Ben turns and studies Emily for a long moment. His expression concerned. Emily, who is slender and wearing a nightdress, gets out of the lift and walks listlessly down a hospital corridor. Ben waits and stops the lift door closing with the briefcase he's carrying. He gets out of the lift and follows Emily at a discreet distance. He stops at double doors and looks through the glass panes in them. He sees Emily, who is wearing UGG boots with her nighty, shuffle down onto a ward. Ben follows her. Emily's image blurs. She passes a reception desk, then rounds a corner and disappears. Ben approaches the desk. Ben smiles and gives the stout nurse a brief wave as he heads away. His smile fades as he walks. A clip attached to Emily's forefinger attaches her to an electrocardiograph machine. 30-something Emily lies asleep in her hospital bed in shadowy light. Ben stands in the doorway watching her intently. His expression sad. As she stirs, Ben makes a swift but calm exit. Emily glimpses him. She sits up and stares after him. Emily frowns and looks puzzled. Ben's car is parked in the dark, wet night. He sits at the wheel, deep in solemn thought as the wipers sweep back and forth. Ben addresses colleagues in a small conference room at Apogee Aeronautics. He points to a rocket model. Ben checks a message on his BlackBerry. Ben drives a Corvette sports car. He enters the beach house and puts down his things. She's on the patio, looking out to sea. Ben lies lethargically on his couch, staring at his mobile phone on the coffee table. He picks the mobile up. Ben snaps his mobile shut and throws it down. Ben drives his saloon along the sunny coast road from the beach house. He pulls up in a parking spot outside a large institutional-looking building with the stars and stripes hanging over the door.",
    "336": "DEAGOL pulls on his rod, but is hauled overboard and disappears underwater with a splash, while SMEAGOL leans over the boat. DEAGOL turns to look at him with a smirk on his face. SMEAGOL moves towards DEAGOL, and then jumps on him, strangling him and ripping the glittering ring from DEAGOL's limp hand. SMEAGOL slips the ring onto his finger, descending into madness as his body twists and distorts, becoming a creepy, shriveled wretch, and finally crawling into a dark cave beneath the Misty Mountains. A grim landscape, covered in thorn bushes and the scars of recent fires, surrounds the dark Morgul Valley as it disappears up towards the mountains. FRODO and SAM are in a filthy culvert; SAM twitches in a restless sleep, but FRODO is awake, his hand trailing down to the chain around his neck. A sudden hiss startles FRODO, who quickly hides the ring as GOLLUM peers at them with gleaming eyes. SAM stirs, looks at FRODO, who shakes his head. SAM then looks at the dead, brown twilight. The days are growing darker when the ground suddenly quivers, and a rolling, rumbling noise echoes down the valley. SAM shoots GOLLUM a hostile look and turns back to rummage in his knapsack, holding up a piece of dried lembas bread to FRODO. FRODO looks at SAM questioningly. FRODO and SAM follow GOLLUM, clambering through bracken and over jagged rocks, as he leads them on a winding, torturous path. Meanwhile, GANDALF leads ARAGORN, LEGOLAS, THEODEN, and GIMLI through dark woodland as the moving forest of Fangorn opens before them, creating an avenue of trees that allows access along the old Isengard road. A thick, humid mist fills the forest, and as the forest separates ahead, the ruins of the great stone wall, cracked and splintered into countless jagged shards, are revealed. Far off, half veiled in swirling steam, stands the tower of Orthanc, unbroken by the storm, with pale waters lapping about its feet. Two small hobbits, MERRY and PIPPIN, sit on the smashed wall with a feast of breads, meats, and wine spread before them. They puff on long pipes as they lie back in the sun. MERRY cuts PIPPIN off before he can respond, as GANDALF, ARAGORN, LEGOLAS, and GIMLI stare at the sight before them. GANDALF leads the company through the flotsam and jetsam floating upon the muddied waters surrounding the tower. TREEBEARD, the giant ENT, strides towards them, alarming all but GANDALF, who stares up the long length of the dark tower as the old ENT nods his head wisely. PIPPIN's eye is caught by something glowing with a golden light in the muddy waters. ARAGORN turns as, quick as a flash, PIPPIN has jumped off his horse and picked up the Palantír.",
    "685": "He leaps over the edge of the building and peers down at the street below. He tries to fire a web, but again nothing happens. He looks down at the street way below and waddles slightly. He pouts and frowns. Later, a man with a dog is waiting for an elevator. The doors open and the man is about to enter when he pauses, seeing a fully suited Spider-Man standing casually inside. Looking Spidey up and down, the man steps into the elevator and presses a floor button. Spider-Man looks down a little self-consciously. The man nods understandingly. The man puts his card back in his pocket. Spider-Man looks away from the man, then bows his head and stares at the wall. The man looks up at the floor display as it changes from 10 to nine. Spider-Man leans forward and presses a button. Later, Peter traipses down a deserted sidewalk. He passes a wall which has been plastered with MJ's perfume ads, showing her soft, pretty face. He looks at the images briefly, then carries on going, a preoccupied look on his face. He's dragging his broken moped along behind him. Peter sits doodling in Doctor Connors' class. He's drawn his face, half Peter Parker and half Spider-Man. On a pay phone outside, MJ comes home. MJ looks peeved. MJ gazes hopefully at the phone. She turns away. Peter slaps the phone, then shakes his head incredulously. Talking into the receiver, he looks up and shakes his head. He hangs up. Guests have gathered in Doctor Octavius' lab. Peter and Harry are amongst them. Octavius pulls off a dust sheet to reveal a device with four long mechanical limbs. He peels off his gray lab coat. He steps onto a platform, then taps keys on a freestanding control panel. The metal harness snaps into position around his waist. A mechanical spine curls up onto his back. A blue computer chip at the top of the synthetic spine glows, then a series of pins slide into his skin. He grimaces. His audience gasps. Octavius concentrates hard and stares up at the ceiling. The four metal limbs begin to move, rising up like snakes. On the end of each arm is a pointed pincer which opens out. Octavius reaches out his own arms. The four mechanical limbs hover above his head. Peter's eyes are wide. Equipment units are wheeled aside. The lights go out. Across the room stands a machine with a base from which four curved pillars rise. Octavius controls one of the mechanical arms. The pincer retracts. A much smaller pincer opens. A tube rises from a panel. The small pincer plucks a tiny sphere from inside it. The small pincer releases the sphere, which floats in the air between the four pillars of the machine.",
    "1094": "Bella walks up to Zus who is sitting on a log. Her dark hair cut short and wearing a grey wool coat, she sits down on the log, and they exchange a brief smile. Zus offers her a sip from his hip flask. She meets his playful expression with a shrug, and then a smile. She takes the flask and drinks from it. He looks, then lowers his eyes. His dark eyes hold her in his gaze, and she nods faintly. This time, she looks Zus straight in the eye. Tentatively, he raises his hand and touches her cheek with his fingers, gently pulling at her bottom lip with his thumb. She takes hold of his hand with her hand and places it on her right breast, discretely covering his hand with a coat and holding his gaze. Elsewhere, Aron and his friend, Rachel, tramp through the spindly birch trees. In the distance, they spot Kissely the milkman running ahead of a unit of armed men in black uniforms. The two youngsters dive behind a rock. Zus and Tuvia, their guns up and ready, urge the men and women to flee. And Benzion in a fur hat leads them across a shallow stream. Kissely and the policemen with guns arrive at the camp. One of the Bielski group carries a goat across the stream. A woman stumbles and falls into the water. Zus helps her up. Carrying bags and baskets, the people scramble up a slope. Tuvia and other men with guns scoot back down the hill to take up positions behind trees. The Russian policemen and helmeted soldiers come into view below them. Zus, Tuvia, and the others fire. One wounded soldier is helped away from the stream. The bearded milkman cowers behind a tree. Zus stops to reload. The policeman looks back at his half a dozen men. Zus hits the milkman's arm. Tuvia unleashes a salvo of bullets. The policeman skulking behind a tree calls to his men to go. Tuvia watches them retreating through the trees. He and the others stride forward in a line, and Zus reloads. Tuvia's cheeks tighten as he ponders his brother's words, but he runs off after the others. The displaced community of men, women, and children clutching their bundles of possessions, some in hats and coats, others in flat caps and jackets, many of the women with shawls on their heads tramp through the forest, dwarfed by the tall, thin, bare trees. They come out onto a meadow of tall grasses wafting in the breeze, walking almost in single file, like black shadows moving across the landscape. Tuvia and Ben Zion, behind them Zus with Bella by his side, lead the way out of the wood.",
    "1167": "Professor McGonagall and Ron help Harry to Dumbledore's study, where Ginny is present with the twins, and Dumbledore turns from the moving portraits to face Harry as Professor Snape approaches from behind. Snape takes Harry down to his storeroom, raises his wand, and Harry's body goes rigid; he gasps in agony as his mind fills with terrifying memories. The wind sends a flurry of snowflakes in all directions, and the snow begins to settle on the towers and turrets of Hogwarts School as the screen turns white. Children throw snowballs outside the London house, where the kitchen is decorated for Christmas, and Mr. Weasley is brought in, looking battered and bruised, sitting in a wheelchair and wearing a paper hat. Standing in the doorway, Sirius raises his glass and winks, donning a knitted jerkin. Harry finds a room where the walls are covered with a tapestry sewn with names and faces, the house elf startles him and skulks off, and Sirius's image has been burnt away. Sirius embraces Harry and hugs him affectionately before Harry joins Hermione. Sirius looks back at the family tree and his own obliterated face, then closes the door. A gray sky is reflected in the river as Hogwarts School stands high on the cliffs above. Harry chats with Cho as they walk through the courtyard until Hermione finds them, prompting Harry to turn to Cho and then hurry off with Hermione. Harry, Ron, and Hermione run down the hill towards Hagrid's cottage, where a faint plume of smoke rises from the chimney, and they hide as Umbridge comes out wearing a fluffy purple coat over her pink dress. She sniffs, wrinkles her nose, sprays herself with perfume, and then sprays a cross on the cottage door. Inside, Hagrid's face is red and bruised, holding a raw steak to his eye while the huge dog gobbles it eagerly, as the wind blows wisps of straw across the room and Hagrid looks out of the window. A flash of lightning reveals a snake tattooed on a man's arm that twists and writhes. A woman with wild hair runs her tongue over a snake tattooed on her arm, hears an explosion, and escapes through a gaping hole while wearing striped prison clothes. Dementors circle high above the prison, a colossal triangular tower surrounded by an angry sea. Neville slowly closes the newspaper at breakfast, as a cozy fire burns in the Room of Requirement. Harry joins Neville, who is looking at a photograph stuck up on the mirror, the photograph that Sirius gave Harry at the station, which includes Neville's parents as part of the group. Harry nods reassuringly and looks at his own parents. A horse, an otter for Hermione, a dog for Ron, and Luna produces a hare, which leaps joyfully over their heads, while Harry grins proudly as the chandelier begins to shake.",
    "280": "He listens and plays the recordings again, but decides they are no good and returns to his carpet sweeping. The camera pans farther left to the salesman's apartment where there are no lights burning behind the drawn shade of the bedroom, but the living room and the kitchen are lighted. The camera continues its pan to the left, including the couple who sleep on the fire escape in the hot weather; the man is in the act of laying out the mattress. His wife, slightly younger and a peroxided, faded showgirl type, is also wearing pajamas with a fluffy handkerchief in the left pocket. She leans over the railing holding onto the rope which leads to the dog's basket now on the floor of the courtyard. The couple, upon closer inspection, reveals the man is balding and middle-aged, and the woman, having been a one-time siffleuse, calls to the dog with a clarion and melodic tone. The man is wearing striped pajamas. The little dog emerges reluctantly from the shadows and steps into the basket, which begins to move upward as the camera follows it. When the basket reaches the fire escape, the camera pans on to the apartment of Miss Torso who is in the bathroom brushing her long hair, her thoughts seemingly far away. The camera drops down to the apartment below, occupied by the elderly lady with the hearing aid, who is hard at work on a piece of abstract sculpture. We see her activities inside the apartment for the first time as she wears a short smock, her legs still bare. Her sculpture takes the form of a piece of mahogany through which a simple hole has been carved. The camera moves on much farther to the left and eventually rests on the newly-weds' apartment with the shade still drawn. It moves on and at last passes through Jeff's window, coming to rest on the two big heads of Jeff and Lisa. Her lips brush lightly against his cheek as she speaks, sitting on his sound knee with her arms around his neck. She starts kissing him but then gives up trying to interest him in romance and moves back from the embrace. Lisa stands, straightens out her dress, stretches a little, then turns to the divan, apparently not too interested in Jeff's observation about the salesman's life. However, her expression is disturbed as she watches Jeff. We see that Jeff's apartment is in darkness, faintly lit from the distant light of the neighbors' window. Jeff is thoughtful for a moment, then relaxes and smiles a little as Lisa stretches herself out on the divan.",
    "228": "Furniture, torn mattresses, and pillows lie scattered as feathers fly when he turns a corner and Szpilman comes into the courtyard. He stops, his face blank, seeing the bodies of Jehuda, Mrs. Zyskind, their two sons, and the toddler lying outside the door. Szpilman steps across the bodies, moving into a place where papers and pamphlets are strewn all over, and the mimeograph is smashed. Szpilman enters, stands surveying the devastation, shuffles along, and comes to a cafe. He goes inside to find a shambles and wanders through the upturned tables and broken chairs. He stops, looks about, turns, and makes for the door when he hears an urgent hiss. He turns sharply and tries to find the source of it and sees Benek hiding under the platform, beckoning to him. Szpilman hurries over and crawls on his back until he's beside Benek, who replaces a plank, hiding them from view. Thin slivers of light illuminate the cramped space where the two men lie on their backs. Szpilman can't continue, and Benek nods in understanding. In bright sunlight, Szpilman and Benek march in a column, four abreast, under the command of two Jewish foremen and guarded by two German policemen, as they are marched out of the ghetto gates. Street traders with baskets full of wares, such as fruit, vegetables, fish, and tins of preserves, engage with women who bargain and make purchases in a lively, colorful scene where dealers in gold and currency call monotonously. Szpilman tries to communicate with Janina, whose profile is to him, but she doesn't see him, so he goes back to work. The German policemen wander to one of the stalls to buy fruit, and, at that moment, two Jewish workers dash to another stall to buy bread. Szpilman glances across the square and sees that Janina is still at the stall. He makes a decision to jump down and rush toward Janina, but he stops dead when he sees that Janina is no longer there. Szpilman and Benek, as before, march towards the ghetto gates in the demolition column, four abreast, under the command of the Jewish foremen and guarded by the two German policemen. A little later, Szpilman is seen mounting the ramp with a hod full of bricks on his back when the noise of airplanes overhead signals a swarm of Russian bombers amidst anti-aircraft fire and puffs of exploding shells. The workers look up, and so does Szpilman, causing the bricks to slide off his hod, crashing to the ground. An SS man, nicknamed Zick-Zack, approaches Szpilman with a whip. Szpilman goes to him, and Zick-Zack, enraged, grabs him by the hair, presses his head hard between his thighs, and beats him mercilessly. After enduring a dozen or so strokes, Szpilman falls forward, lying in the dirt. Zick-Zack nods, satisfied, and two Poles, without armbands, one being Bartczak, drag him away to a wooden hut, which stores wood, nails, tools, paint, and metal brackets.",
    "128": "The redcap goes up the steps into the car. Neff laboriously swings himself up onto the box and from there up on the steps, keeping his head down. Meantime, Phyllis is holding the attention of the conductor and porter by showing them the ticket. Phyllis nods and takes the ticket back. Neff has reached the top of the steps. She goes up after him and gives him the ticket. They are now close together. She kisses him. The redcap comes from inside the car. Redcap descends. Phyllis kisses Neff again quickly. She runs down the steps. The porter picks up the box. He and the conductor get on board the train. Phyllis stands there waving goodbye as the train starts moving, and the porter begins to close the car door. Phyllis turns and walks out of the shot in the direction of the parked car. Neff and the porter. The conductor is going on into the car. Neff is half turned away from the porter. He holds the vestibule door open. Neff hobbles through. Most of the berths are made up. As Neff hobbles along, another porter and some passengers make way for the crippled man solicitously. Neff hobbles on through. Four or five passengers are reading or writing. Dark except for a little light coming from inside the parlor car. Neff has come out and hobbled to the railing. He stands looking back along the rails. Neff stands silent. He starts patting his pockets as if looking for something. Jackson takes out a small bag of tobacco and a packet of cigarette papers. He rises and exits into the parlor car. Neff turns slowly and watches Jackson go back through the car. Then he moves to one side of the platform and looks ahead along the track to orientate himself. He gives one last glance back into the parlor car to make sure no one is watching him. He slips the crutches from under his arms and stands on both feet. He drops the crutches off the train onto the tracks, then quickly swings his body over the rail. Neff is hanging onto the railing. He looks down, then lets go and drops to the right-of-way. The camera stops. The train recedes slowly into the night. Neff has fallen on the tracks. He picks himself up, rubs one knee and looks back along the line of the tracks and off to one side. Close beyond the edge of the right-of-way, the silhouette of a dump shows up. Beside it looms the dark bulk of the Dietrichson sedan. The headlights blink twice and go out. He starts running towards the car. He runs a little awkwardly because of the improvised cast on his left foot.",
    "1184": "Harry makes a grab but Malfoy spins out of reach, and Malfoy flings the Remembrall away with all his might. The glass bowl flies over and over in the air as Harry steers his broom, soaring towards a high stone tower. Upstairs in her study, Professor McGonagall sees Harry hackling towards her window, and just in time, he turns a neat somersault and catches the Remembrall, then tosses it victoriously into the air. Professor McGonagall steps to the window and looks down into the courtyard as Harry rejoins the cheering first-years, while Malfoy and his cronies snigger. Still carrying his broomstick, Harry trails after Professor McGonagall, who walks toward them, purposefully, and stops outside a classroom. The twins are there, and Hermione shows Harry a name on a Gryffindor Trophy. They go upstairs, and the staircase swings into a different position on the opposite wall. Harry opens the door at the top of the stairs, and they see a statue covered in cobwebs. A torch flares, and the caretaker's scary red-eyed cat watches them run down a torch-lit corridor. Harry struggles with the latch, and taking out her wand, the door opens and they rush through. Filch, the caretaker, holds up a lantern and peers around suspiciously, while in the middle of the room is a gigantic dog with three enormous heads and three sets of sharp, glistening teeth. The children rush for the door, and one of the slobbering heads is so enormous, it completely fills the doorway, but they slam the door shut. Daylight comes, and Oliver and Harry carry a trunk out into the school grounds. They set the trunk on the grass, and Oliver takes out a large, red ball. Chained down, two brown balls struggle to escape. Oliver gives Harry a wooden bat and then unchains one of the brown balls, which shoots straight up, above their heads, almost out of sight. Harry swings the bat and knocks the ball high into the air, flying over the head of a statue on the battlements before the ball returns. Oliver catches it, but the brown ball knocks him to the ground. He struggles with it and with great difficulty, forces it back into the trunk and fastens it down with a strong chain. He gives Harry a tiny, golden ball with delicate, golden wings that spring out of the snitch, and it flutters above Harry's head. Ron flicks his wand, and Hermione flicks her wand. A white feather rises from the desk and floats across the room towards tiny Professor Flitwick, who is standing on a pile of books. Seamus' face is smudged with soot, and a smoldering feather sinks onto the desk. Crossing the courtyard, Hermione hurries past, while the Great Hall is lit with flaming torches, and candles flicker and glow from the mouths of grinning pumpkins, which float above the heads of the students.",
    "960": "Jack gets back in the Jeep and, now on a main carriageway, unwittingly motors past Donnie, Joe, and the boys who are driving back to town. Donnie takes a sharp right onto a rough track through the trees, and as it's getting dark, they arrive back into town, driving until they reach Lillian Middle School. The boys leave Donnie in the car park and scramble over a chain link fence, running to a storage trailer. Joe begins prying a padlock on the trailer with a tire iron, and Martin opens it to reveal papers and rolls of film inside. They break into a classroom, where they find a photo of him and look at the footage. Scientists and military men are seen examining the wreckage of something big. Carrie puts a tape in a player, and on the film, Woodward is grabbed by a tentacle. Suddenly, Air Force soldiers burst in on the boys. In the car park, Donnie sits in the car smoking a joint, oblivious of the military activity around him. The soldiers march the boys into a corridor, where Colonel Nelec approaches them and finds Carrie's explosives in a rock sack. Nelec eyes Joe, and Overmyer finds Joe's mother's locket on him and takes it. The soldiers shepherd the boys onto a bus in the car park, and sitting in his car, Donnie watches as they're driven away. He gets on his CB radio. Still in Air Force uniform, Jack makes his way through the evacuation center, where a boy recognizes him, and he finds Preston reading a magazine. Meanwhile, the super eight footage of the alien is present. On the bus, Overmyer hands Colonel Nelec some paperwork, and the boys watch anxiously from a holding cell at the rear of the bus. Something hits the side of the bus, jolting it onto two wheels, and it continues along the road for a short way before righting itself, though one of its tires blows out. The driver brings the bus to a grinding halt on a remote road. Nelec hands a rifle to an apprehensive-looking Overmyer, and the senior airman driving the bus hesitates before reluctantly opening the door. Outside it's pitch dark, and clutching the rifle, Overmyer cautiously makes his way along the aisle of the bus towards the open door. As he nears the door, Overmyer stops, and a tentacle reaches into the bus, grabbing Overmyer and slapping him against the walls of the bus. The rifle goes off, hitting the window of the boys' holding cell, and Overmyer is dragged outside. Martin vomits as the senior airman restarts the bus's engine and it lurches into life. As he stamps on the throttle, the bus is tipped onto its side.",
    "270": "A squad car, its siren wailing, kicks up dust as it roars into the foreground. Hi and Ed are seated on folding chairs facing an agent's desk. Hi wears a sport coat over his Hawaiian shirt, and Ed is in her dress blues. The agent looks, with a deadpan, from the file to Hi, his face still deadly neutral, then looks back down at the file and unfolds the accordioned rap sheet, revealing it to be a couple of feet long. Ed stares vacantly out the passenger window while they are driving. Hi looks from Ed out to the road. Over Hi's shoulder, he stares listlessly at himself in the mirror, a razor held forgotten in one hand, his face half-lathered and half-shaved. The bedroom is somewhat messy. Ed sits on the edge of the bed, also staring listlessly, her police uniform on but not yet buttoned, and her hands lie palm-up in her lap, like two dead fish. Hi works while his sweaty gum-chewing colleague stands idly by. Alone in his Chevy, he looks to the side at a 7-Eleven. Hi and Ed sit listlessly watching TV; Ed perks up reacting to something on TV. Hi notices her reaction and also sloughs off his stupor to watch a newscaster silently reading copy. Behind him, news footage of five nurses holding infants. Watching intently, Ed reaches her hand out to Hi, and he takes her hand in his. NATHAN ARIZONA, a stocky middle-aged man in a white polyester suit, gestures expansively with his white cowboy hat toward a one-story warehouse store with a football stadium parking lot, chroma-keyed in behind him. A businessman takes his newspaper and releases the machine door as he turns to leave, and Hi snags the door before it closes and takes his own five-finger discount copy. He flips the paper over to look at the headline, which reads: Arizona Quints Go Home. A pull back from the paper shows Hi and Ed reading it together at home. They look from the paper to each other. In the middle of the desert, we float in toward Ed who is seated, waiting, in the driver's seat of Hi's Chevy. Hi enters the frame and cinches down a ladder that is tied to the roof of the car, with pieces of red flag fluttering at either end of the ladder where it sticks out beyond the car. Hi gets in the car and it starts down the long, winding road leading away from the trailer, kicking up dust. Tableau of a couple at home. Nathan Arizona is on the telephone, his stocking feet up on an ottoman.",
    "917": "Dillinger wriggles his opened pants downward as Billie, kneeling over him, unfastens her dress and pulls it off over her head, revealing a silvery blue slip, then leans over on top of Dillinger. Glimpses of Dillinger thrusting into Billie from behind are interspersed with their nuzzling face to face. A recent flashback shows them arriving ecstatically, and another flash shows Dillinger kissing her mouth as his face withdraws down her chest. Later, as they cuddle, they share a warm smile, and later still, Billie strolls in her slip to a window. Open suitcases occupy every inch, filled to the brim with neatly packed clothes. Billie caresses their contents, then rejoins Dillinger in bed, laying her head on his shoulder. Rolling over to face her, he strokes her cheek and neck, his thumb gently rubbing her graceful jaw line, while his gaze pours over her face. He grins, and Billie gazes dreamily at him. He gives her another smile, and his thumb caresses her cheek in a gentle rhythm, followed by a puckish grin. At the telephone exchange, Baum stands with a listening piece to his ear and a hand-held mike at his lips. Later, the Pierce-Arrow pulls up to a curb, with Purvis driving and Baum at his side. Two other G-men approach the luxury car, and one of the street agents looks to his young partner, who bows his hat. Purvis faces Baum, points, then gets out and faces the young G-man. Purvis leads them across the street towards a building, and inside, they enter a long, dim hallway. Purvis leads Agent Barton to a door, then readies his hand on his gun as they prepare, dwarfing their trench-coated forms. Purvis lifts his knuckles to the door, which opens to reveal a young demure house dressed, with strawberry blonde hair framing her face in a curly bob. Purvis steps toward the doorway, and as he enters, Barton lingers in the hall. At a table, a stout man eats, and the baby-faced man nods. The woman steps away and returning, shows off her shoes and holds out the opened wallet as well. Purvis eyes it and gives a nod, then leaves, shutting the door. The woman looks wearily to the stout gentleman at the dining table. Now Purvis and Barton enter a stairwell, with Purvis hurrying downstairs and rushing from the building to run across the street to agent Baum. In the stairwell, Barton peers through a window in the door, squints, steps into the hallway, and lets the door swing shut behind him. From the stairwell, our gaze lingers on the door, then drifts over to a set of elevators. One of them opens, revealing a tall man with rugged features who steps off and heads for the door.",
    "813": "There's a stampede involving handbags, shoes, and gloves, all available for the taking, during which she puts down the tall pinkie boots that a woman grabs and snatches from her. Rebecca jumps on the woman, and later at home with her head slumped, she sits contemplating the mountain of shopping bags in front of her, including the Gucci boots. A message from Luke demanding the outline appears on her laptop, and she looks at her watch before slumping down at her desk. She idly pulls a coat from one of her bags, with her face folding as she reads the label. Rebecca looks at an empty photo frame on Luke's desk, while Luke regards her with a twinkle in his eye. Hayley brings Rebecca a note, and Luke picks up the phone. Hayley rushes back in as Rebecca, like a woman possessed, clambers onto the slippery boardroom table on all fours, propelling herself at the phone. Later in Luke's office, with Hayley present, Luke looks earnestly into Rebecca's face, glancing dubiously at Hayley, and Rebecca smiles meekly. She later opens a letter at her desk. At her home, Rebecca's smiling dad magics a coin from behind her ear and puts it into her outstretched hand before plunking himself down on an easy chair that tips back, causing Rebecca's expectant smile to freeze. A recreational vehicle crashes around the corner with Graham at the wheel, making Rebecca's face brighten. At the office, Wilson is looking at an Asian Web page while she wears a flirty, fishing-for-something kind of expression. Suze is trying on a frothy white tulle wedding dress as Suze's mom tries on her veil. Yawning with exhaustion, Luke steps into a lift to join Alette swathed in fur and leggy Alicia, before Alette sweeps out, and Alicia trips and falls into Luke's arms. In Miami, Florida, home to sun-kissed beaches and a marina full of private boats, Luke and Rebecca are at a magazine conference, after which Alicia goes off in a huff. Smiling women crowd around Rebecca, who grins across at Luke as his eyebrows shoot up with amusement, while a waitress hands her a cocktail, and Rebecca notices the man's name tag. A bony-faced, sandy-haired man appears, with whom she nose-nuzzles in Eskimo style before Luke leaves her to it, and she peers blankly at Janne. Luke oversees Janne waiting for an answer, leading her to slap Janne's face. Alicia, pouring champagne, misses the glass as she watches in horror, while Rebecca answers her mobile and glances around furtively on a breezy terrace, taking a deep, deep breath. She takes a man to a men's store where he slumps on a seat and shoots her a look, making her recoil. She then straightens his bow tie, helps him with a black tuxedo, and sits down to face him before he pulls her onto the dance floor, puts one arm around her waist, and clasps her right hand in his left hand.",
    "629": "Merrill stares wearily up the staircase, climbing the first two steps, and gazes in horror at the unsecured hatch door in the attic. Merrill and Graham pull the children down the hallway into the kitchen, and Morgan's terrified eyes focus on the gap at the bottom of the front door as green gray fingers appear underneath it. Graham hurries down some stairs into the gloomy basement and slams the door shut. He turns suddenly and presses his ear against the door, his hands pushing against it, with its olive green paint peeling. Graham looks down at the doorknob, grabs it as it starts to turn, and holds it tight with both hands, resting his head on the door. Merrill spots a pickaxe, and as he yanks it off a high shelf, he smashes the light bulb, plunging the basement into darkness. Morgan turns on a torch, stares down into its bright beam before looking around, and points it at the door. Graham and Merrill push hard against it, the pickaxe now firmly wedged under the doorknob, and Graham turns to put his back against the door, shielding his eyes from the bright torch beam. Morgan slowly directs the torch beam around the basement, starts to walk past a cluttered workbench, and the light falls on Bo, crouched on the floor, who waves lamely at Morgan. Merrill finds another flashlight and directs its beam around the walls of the basement, illuminating old wooden shelves supporting neatly-arranged pickling jars, bowls, ski boots, roller skates, and disordered clatter. He spots a dusty old radio on one shelf and tunes the dial on the front. They go around to face the door, and Graham pushes his hand against the door lit by Morgan's torch. He then turns to face the others, the pickaxe holds in place as the doors hit, and Graham stares thoughtfully at the door. Morgan sets the white-headed silver torch on the ground and rolls it across to his father. Merrill walks over to Graham, and Graham and Merrill move slowly in different directions, working their way around the rough stone walls, passing a dry and faded flowery hanging on a hook and a wire-framed basket hanging on another peg. They come towards each other again, their torch beams picking up the coal chute with a rolling turning grill across it and Morgan standing in front of it. Merrill and Graham stand and stare at him, stunned, as a clawed hand pokes through the grill and grabs Morgan's throat. Graham drops his torch as he rushes to rescue his son, and as he runs away from the coal chute, he kicks the torch which rolls around to pick out Bo's legs, poking out from beneath her silky blue dress as she presses herself up against the wall.",
    "1196": "Harry sees something swirling around inside the crystal ball, and as he moves closer and peers into the mist, he sees the face of Sirius Black. A hand claps him on the shoulder, and bemused, Professor Trelawney gazes at Harry. With a worried look on his face, he runs out of the room and hurries away down the circular staircase. Outside, in a ruined part of the castle, crows alight on the fallen masonry. Hermione, Harry, and Ron peer through a ruined archway at a man wearing a black hood, sharpening the curved blade of a huge axe. They leave the school, walk through the cloister and into the grounds, where Malfoy and his cronies are on the slope above Hagrid's cottage. Furious, Hermione threatens Malfoy, her wand at his throat, and he's terrified. As she turns away, Malfoy smirks, but she turns back and punches him full in the face. Malfoy and his cronies make a run for it, and she smiles at Ron. Ron, Harry, and Hermione run down the steep steps cut into the grassy slope towards Hagrid's cottage, finding him gazing sadly out of the window at Buckbeak, who is chained to a post in the pumpkin patch. A line of dead ferrets is hanging nearby, and he feeds a small creature, opens a small blue tin, and takes out Ron's rat. Another pebble hits Harry, and they look out of the window to see Fudge, Dumbledore, and the Executioner making their way towards the cottage. Hagrid ushers them out, and they peer out of the back door as, at the front door, Hagrid welcomes his guests. Harry, Ron, and Hermione escape from the cottage and run down the garden path, hiding behind a huge pile of giant orange pumpkins. A crow lands beside them as they anxiously watch the cottage. Hermione spins around and peers into the forest, and they run as fast as they can away from the cottage and up the grassy slope. Buckbeak watches them go, and Harry glances back at the hippogriff still chained to a post in the pumpkin patch, then follows his friends. Halfway up the hill, they stop and look back towards the cottage, seeing smoke rising from the stone chimney. Dumbledore, Fudge, and Hagrid come out of the cottage with the Executioner, who walks across the garden carrying his sharp axe over his shoulder. He moves through the pumpkin patch towards Buckbeak, and they watch horrified as the Executioner raises his axe and the huge blade swings down. Hermione hides her face on Ron's shoulder, putting her arms around his neck. Suddenly, Ron drops his rat, blood on his finger, and chases the rat, with Harry and Hermione following him. Ron catches Scabbers and slumps down near the Whomping Willow with its twisted trunk.",
    "34": "Strasser looks up from the book, and Rick reaches over to take the book from his hand. Rick looks up from the book and gets up, walking away toward the gambling room. A couple enters the front door—Victor Laszlo, the Czech resistance leader, and a very pretty young woman in a simple white gown, Miss Ilsa Lund. The headwaiter approaches them, and as he takes them to a table, they pass by the piano, where the woman looks at Sam. She is so beautiful that people turn to stare, and Sam, making a conscious effort, keeps his eyes on the keyboard as they go past, though he steals a look in her direction afterward, appearing to know her. Berger, a slight, middle-aged man, observes the couple from a distance. The headwaiter seats Ilsa, and Strasser and Renault look up at them from their table. Laszlo sits opposite Ilsa and surveys the room while Berger walks up to their table. Carefully lifting something up, Berger holds it for their view, then sits down with them as Ilsa tries to warn him. Berger, taking the cue, sighs and puts the ring away as Renault approaches the table from behind Laszlo. Ilsa's manner is friendly yet reserved, her voice low and soft. Renault sits down, and Ilsa glances in Sam's direction. Suddenly, Renault jumps to his feet as Strasser enters, bowing and smiling pleasantly, but neither Ilsa nor Laszlo shows the slightest recognition. Strasser waits to be asked to seat himself, and Laszlo stands. Strasser looks sharply at Renault, only to see a noncommittal smile on his face, and then Renault and Strasser bow shortly. Ilsa smiles back at Strasser, although her eyes remain troubled. On the floor, Corina strums a guitar and starts her number, while Laszlo looks around with apparent casualness. He notices Strasser and Renault whispering together and sees Berger at the bar, so he rises and goes off. Ilsa's troubled profile is evident, and while Corina sings, Sam gives a worried glance in Ilsa's direction, which Ilsa notices. At the bar, Berger is sipping a drink as Laszlo walks up and casually takes a place next to him. Laszlo takes the ring and looks at it, and Berger shakes his head. Laszlo quietly absorbs the shock and stops when Sacha brings a drink to him. Corina finishes her song, and the crowd applauds enthusiastically as Ilsa sits alone at her table. Sam sits down, ready to play, and begins a number nervously, seemingly waiting for anything. He looks very uncomfortable and even more scared now. Of course he can. Ilsa starts to hum.",
    "803": "Bassam gets out and gives Ferris the finger as he walks down the track. Ferris also gets out and stands by a wall in the surveillance room, while Bassam continues along the track with Nizar. Ferris takes out his cell phone and looks at it, noticing something glinting in the sky, which is the Predator drone being flown to a higher altitude. Nizar gets in the front of the vehicle, and Ferris, sitting in the back, eats an orange. Nizar looks down anxiously, then looks away, opens his mouth, and gazes ahead thoughtfully. Nizar unzips his coat, takes out a computer disk, and offers it to Ferris, who then watches the disk on his laptop, revealing Al-Saleem on screen. Ferris makes a call on his cell phone to Hoffman, who is sitting on his yacht moored by a jetty near his large house, while Hoffman's wife comes out of the house. Ferris hangs up, puts on his shades, and walks down the track to join Bassam and Nizar, aiming his gun. Hoffman sits staring at a surveillance screen showing Ferris and Bassam, both using cell phones, watching Nizar ride along a busy street in a town on a moped. The guys shoot Nizar, who falls, and four men pick up the injured Nizar, carrying him to the back of the van. Ferris aims a pistol and shoots Nizar in the head before running away. The surveillance screen shows the scene from above, and Hoffman takes a call from Ferris, who is walking with Bassam. Bassam and Ferris drive along a dirt road, stop at the top of a hill, and Bassam reverses the vehicle a few feet. Ferris creeps up behind some rocks, takes out his binoculars, and looks down at a collection of stone houses, where a man stands by a fire burning CDs and cassettes. Ferris radios Bassam, who retrieves a rifle from the back of the four-by-four. Wearing traditional robes, a jacket, and a skull cap, Ferris walks down the hill towards the Iraqi by the fire, while Bassam gets down by some rocks, setting up the rifle's stand. The man at the fire sees Ferris and frowns as Ferris speaks Arabic and looks around. Bassam uses a telescopic sight to view Mehdi, a bearded man, as he walks out and then shoots him. Ferris kills the man by the fire, and when another man pops up from behind a wall, Bassam shoots him. A young man runs out of the house shooting, and Bassam drives down and makes a call. Ferris throws a grenade into a courtyard, runs in shooting, and exchanges fire with the young man. Meanwhile, two choppers fly towards the scene as the young man peers out from behind a wall.",
    "931": "The scene opens with a page of parchment featuring the Warner Brothers shield, followed by the text \"Warner Brothers Pictures, a Time Warner company.\" The page then turns to reveal a set of interlocking V's, indicating Village Roadshow Pictures. Another page turn reveals L shapes and a set of two broken squares with a small square in the center. A pocket watch on a chain lies on a desk beside typewritten sheets, on top of which is a magnifying glass. At the typewriter sits a man in his late 30s with dark hair and a neat mustache. A marquee in front of a cathedral erupts in flames as smoke billows out over bodies on the ground. A man in a frock coat carries a brown paper package under his right arm, and as he passes a woman in a wide-sleeved outfit, he transfers the package to her. The woman is Irene Adler, who is pretty, dark-haired, and wears a hat perched jauntily on her head. Sherlock Holmes, disguised as an Oriental man, lies on a mattress in the street smoking a pipe. He sits up, grabs handfuls of rice and coffee beans, and places them in a bag. Irene strides through the open market, where a man ahead of her tosses an apple. She walks down steps, stops, and twirls. Holmes walks up to her and takes her arm, swapping a loaf for the package. He pulls her aside, and she glances round at them before leading him by the hand into an alley. The swarthy man who was tossing the apples steps out in front of them. Irene takes the package back from Holmes, leaving him with the loaf. The swarthy man studies Holmes' shabby disguise and whistles. Holmes removes his spectacles as three men facing him close in, slapping the bread away and ripping off his fake, droopy mustache and ill-fitting wig. The swarthy man grabs Holmes by the neck and throws him against a fence. Holmes responds by kicking the man, punching him, and throwing rice in one of the thug's faces. He ducks as another throws a punch that instead hits his colleague. Holmes fights back, but is eventually pressed against the slatted wooden fence with chains wrapped around his wrists. As the leader closes in with a crate, Holmes spits coffee beans into his face and manages to duck beneath the crate swung at him, then kicks an attacker to the ground. The group steps back as they notice two uniformed policemen on the beat, and Holmes slumps to the ground. The swarthy man tosses coins at him, does a little skip, and starts to whistle again as the peelers walk away. Holmes remains crouched on the ground as if in a trance.",
    "1097": "Six silver interlocking V shapes of decreasing sizes are followed by a scene outside a large Catholic church, where a hearse and several cars are parked. Inside, a balding man plays the organ while a small congregation sits in pews towards the front of the grand church. An older man named Al rises from his seat, walks past a coffin draped in a white sheet, and approaches a tall, hard-faced elderly man standing beside it, Walt Kowalski. On a table in front of the coffin is a photograph of an attractive middle-aged woman. Al shakes Walt's hand and returns to his pew. Four casually-dressed teenagers—Daniel, David, Ashley, and Josh—walk up the aisle, each kneeling and making the sign of the cross. Ashley, a pretty girl with red hair wearing a short top that exposes her pierced belly button, causes Walt to grimace. Josh, a thin boy with fair hair, is last to kneel and make the sign of the cross. Walt watches the kids with narrowed eyes, his expression tight-lipped, as his middle-aged sons, Mitch and Steve, turn to each other. Walt stands motionless like a stone statue while Mitch gives Steve a withering look, and Mitch's wife, Karen, shushes them. Walt looks down wearily, his thin gray hair combed to one side, as a young priest in a flowing white surplice steps up to his lectern beside the altar. Ashley sits texting on her cell phone. Outside, the Stars and Stripes flies on a pole at Walt's modest clapboard house, where inside, mourners help themselves to food. In the basement, Daniel, David, and Josh open a trunk and look at some war photographs before Steve follows Walt, who wears a permanent frown, as Walt heads down to the basement. Steve, tubby and in his 40s, looks put out. Hearing Walt coming, the boys quickly shut the trunk and rush over to a couch to sit down, but Walt ignores them, picks up two metal folding chairs, and goes back upstairs. Holding her cell phone, Ashley looks at her mother, Karen, before approaching Walt, who's unfolding the chairs. After rolling her eyes and receiving a beckoning from Karen, Ashley trudges back to her seat. Walt exits out the front door with his Golden Labrador, opens a pouch of chewing tobacco as he descends the front steps, and watches people go into the neighboring house. He pops some tobacco in his mouth, stares at the house with narrowed eyes, spits, and wanders away. In the large garage, Ashley smokes beside a pristine Ford Gran Torino muscle car, its cover partially pulled back. Walt pulls open the garage door, allowing sunlight to flood in, as Ashley drops her cigarette and blows out smoke.",
    "1091": "At night in pouring rain with the collar of his jacket pulled up, Tuvia stands staring at a cottage in the clearing, his lips pursed. Inside, Berniski, his wife, and two sons who were with him at Koscik's house, are having dinner. They all look towards the door as Tuvia walks into the room. Berniski jumps up, and Tuvia draws the gun. Berniski shrugs lamely. Cowering, Berniski sinks to his knees. One son stands up. Tuvia dispatches both sons, then Berniski, and then Berniski dies. Tuvia looks at the woman without remorse as she mourns before him, her hands splattered with blood, and he goes, stumbling through the dark forest, making his escape. At dawn, Zus, sleeping in a makeshift tent, awakes with a start, a bottle of vodka by his legs. Groggily, he looks at the sleeping people all around him, picking up the bottle, he staggers to his feet, then notices smoke from a small fire. Tuvia sits broodily staring into space, and Zus hands his brother the bottle. Tuvia takes a slug, and Zus examines the revolver, counting the number of bullets. A fleeting smile passes between them. Zus hands back the gun. Sharpening a spear, Zus looks up in surprise as Tuvia comes back to the camp with more refugees. A pretty brunette walks by and gives Tuvia a long look. Later, two men are sawing a log, another lays branches onto the roof of a shelter, and Zus hammers a beam. Malbin, hammering a nail, drops the log he's holding, narrowly missing Zus. Malbin turns to Tuvia. Zus frowns at the girl with a beret. Lazar and Laila walk off, everyone looks around. Two young men enter the camp, one wielding a rifle. Zus puts his hands up. The brothers stiffen, and Zus eyes them steadily. Peretz meets his gaze and slowly shakes his head. Zus walks away, stumbling into the undergrowth. He throws up by a tree and sinks to his knees. Tuvia follows him and watches his brother convulsing with grief. Zus bangs his head against the tree trunk, and Tuvia grabs him from behind and wrestles him to the ground. Blood seeps from the wound on Zus’s head. He frees himself from his brother's grasp. The two newcomers, Peretz and Jacov, are talking to Asael. Tuvia runs off to Zus. Tuvia looks at Asael, who averts his gaze, and then back at Zus. A full moon gleams in the dark sky. Zus shoots the man. Zus shouts. An elderly Russian runs out to his blazing truck, and Zus dispatches him. Together with Tuvia, Asael, Peretz, and Jacov, he tosses the old man's body into the burning bed of the truck. A pinprick of light punctures the darkness. Peretz, running along a dirt track, joins the others hiding in a ditch.",
    "828": "Cal hurries into the bar, clearly hypnotized by his move and his good looks, she forces herself to take a step back. He surveys it, studying the bar and various men and women chatting and flirting with one another. Wet from the rain, he steps further into the bar. In his bedroom, Jacob leans over Hannah, who lies back on the bed. He kisses her, kisses her again, and leans down to kiss her again. Still wearing his trousers, he lies between her open legs, then he pulls away from her and flops onto the bed. In the garage, Hannah sits in the massage chair, wrapped in a sheet. They lie on the bed laughing, and he smiles. Jacob licks his lips and nods. Jacob has fallen asleep with his glass in his hand. Hannah takes the glass, puts it on a chest of drawers, then pulls the sheet up over him. She gazes at him and smiles. She props herself up in bed, leans over, kisses him on the cheek, then lies back down resting her head on his shoulder, nuzzles into him, and closes her eyes. Cal's brow is knitted as he talks on the phone. Cal sits at the bar drinking on his own as the bartenders clean up. Cal looks over at a balding guy opposite him of a similar age, who sips his drink through a straw. The guy notices Cal eying him and raises his brows in acknowledgment. With a sad expression, Cal picks up his mobile. In a restaurant, Emily's phone rings, and she hangs up. Heading back to her house, David leans in and kisses her. The door opens, and they both nod awkwardly. David glances at Jessica and smiles, then heads off. Jessica has her arms folded and grins as Emily heads in. Jessica shrugs, shakes her head, and strides off. Emily goes in and shuts the door behind her, holding a clutch bag in one hand and a bunch of flowers in the other. She tosses the flowers on a chest of drawers in the hall, but she passes Robbie, who sits on the stairs watching her, without noticing it. Someone pedals furiously on a bike. At home, in her room, Jessica gets out a camera from her drawer, and he has the bunch of flowers with him. Studying her reflection in a mirror, she dons mascara. It's Robbie pedaling through the night. Jessica brushes out her long, dark hair and sweeps eyeshadow across her lids. She applies a peachy-colored lipstick to her lips, presses them together, then pouts in the mirror. She puts the camera on a shelf in her room. The light on it flashes as she stands a few feet away in her dressing gown.",
    "1056": "The curricle continues on its way, with Mr. Collins perched on the back. Now, he's standing in the parlor as Jane, Lizzie, and Mary enter. The three girls sit down. Jane and Lizzie rise from their seats. Lizzie and Jane have sat back down again, and Mr. Collins regards the three girls with condescension. The three sisters are now standing, watching him coldly. Having backed out of the parlor, he makes his way over to the curricle outside. With a sympathetic shake of the head, he climbs up into the carriage. Lizzie and Jane have come out to see him off. They wave him off. As soon as the coast is clear, Kitty peers out from behind a wall. She bustles over to the house. Lydia is sitting, looking out of a lead-paned window, humming happily to herself. She glances over at Wickham. Wickham smiles. At Longbourn, Jane runs up the stairs. She bursts into Mrs. Bennet's room. Jane wafts the vial under her mother's nose. Mr. Bennet arrives home in the pouring rain. Jane and Lizzie are waiting for him. He steps inside, takes off his top hat and black cloak, and heads into his study, closing the door behind him. Jane and Lizzie are watching him with some concern. The two sisters exchange worried glances. Mr. Darcy is wandering through a cobbled street, bustling with people and horses. He makes his way down the crowded street, looking slightly lost. When he reaches a corner, a young beggar girl stops him to ask for money. As he searches his pockets for coins, he asks her for directions. She indicates the road he should take. Finally, he finds the house he's looking for and bangs on the door. As the door opens, a woman looks shocked to see Darcy. Her housekeeper quickly tries to shut him out. The Bennet sisters are still sitting in the parlor. Jane puts down her book and is just going to pour the tea when Mr. Bennet comes in. All four girls look at him expectantly as he takes a seat. Kitty is sobbing. Seeing Kitty's distress, Mr. Bennet's face falls, and he leaves the room. Meanwhile, Mr. Darcy is back out, searching the darkened streets, clutching a piece of paper in his hand. He gazes up at a house. Lydia, meanwhile, is getting more and more bored by the minute. She gets up off the bed and wanders over to the window. Wickham's drinking wine. A young man is galloping along on horseback in the bright sunshine. The housekeeper peers out of the window at Longbourn, and seeing the messenger arriving, quickly hurries out to meet him. He pulls a letter out of his saddlebag, dismounts, and gives it to her in exchange for a few coins.",
    "1021": "They slowly drag out of view as Sadie focuses on her homework. Playing air guitar, Charlotte advances toward Sadie's bed, then retreats to the doorway and flings one arm out. Her sister ignores her, and leaving the door open, Charlotte sulks away. Now, Debbie steps out of a side door and opens a trash bin. She breaks up a pack of cigarettes and throws them away, overturns a small pouch into the bin, and goes back inside. Pete comes out the same door with a plate carrying three cupcakes. Setting it aside, he opens the trash bin and overturns a large jar of candy, then throws the cupcakes in one at a time. Pete pauses at the last cupcake and takes a deep breath, unwraps the cupcake, and takes a large bite. He starts to throw the rest in, hesitates and takes another bite, chewing blissfully, he holds the remainder over the trash. Pete leans in, devours the treat, and throws the last bite away. Now, he jogs on a treadmill with electrodes dotting his bare chest. In another exam room, a technician positions Debbie at a mammogram machine while a doctor stands close with his hand up Pete's hospital gown. In another office, now she sits in a dentist's chair. Now, Pete's doctor snaps on a latex glove as Pete leans over a table, and his doctor bends close from behind, thrusts his finger out of view, and works it around. Now, Debbie sits with her feet in stirrups as two women enter separately and the doctor winks. Now, at home, Debbie joins Pete in a sitting room. Trying the sitting room door, Charlotte finds it locked, and Debbie moves away. Now, a gray-haired man steps out of a modest house as Pete approaches while a plane passes overhead. They hug, and now they sit in a living room. Pete smiles tightly as his dad cuddles the little blonde boy, and two more boys arrive identical to the first. Pete follows him out back and sprays the boys with a hose. Pete sighs and follows his father back inside, swallowing hard as his eyes widen. With his lips apart, his dad drops his gaze then looks up, and Pete's dad follows his middle-aged wife to the backyard. Now, in an upscale restaurant, Debbie approaches the hostess and points to a balding man wearing a jacket and tie sitting alone, who browses a menu at a table for two. Debbie stares at him as she takes a deep breath and rolls her shoulders. Later, he takes a bite of food, raises an eyebrow, and she shakes her head with a sad smile, then lowers her gaze. He takes out his phone, steps away, leaving his phone on the table.",
    "655": "The balcony starts to collapse, prompting Peter's webs to pull two people away from falling masonry, while MJ is stranded on a swaying piece of the balcony. Peter runs through the crowd, pulling at his clothes to reveal the Spider-Man costume underneath them. A pillar crashes onto a police car, and the glider returns to the balcony where the Green Goblin holds a pumpkin bomb that incinerates the board members. Harry is struck by a piece of masonry and knocked out, as the Green Goblin glides up. Spider-Man swoops down, kicks the goblin from the glider, and the goblin lands on top of a marquee. The glider shoots into and out of a hot air balloon. A little boy stands rooted to the spot as the world unity festival hoarding falls towards him, but Spider-Man rescues him. Police converge on the Green Goblin, who easily punches them with his fist. Spider-Man swings in front of the Green Goblin and throws a punch, but the goblin catches his hand and kicks Spider-Man in the chest, driving him backwards until he stops against a lamp post, which crashes onto a passerby. The goblin leaps back onto the glider, now fitted with guns, and pursues the running Spider-Man, firing at him. A missile narrowly misses Spider-Man, who leaps onto a large inflatable. Hearing MJ's screams, Spider-Man jumps from inflatable to inflatable, using one shaped like a kangaroo as a trampoline. As he bounces towards the balcony, the Green Goblin on the glider grabs him from behind, crashes him against a stained glass window, and repeatedly smashes his head against it. Spider-Man elbows the goblin in the face and breaks free. The two fight until Spider-Man falls towards MJ. The goblin descends on the glider, but Spider-Man shoots a web into the goblin's face and cuts an electric car cell from the underside of the glider. As the goblin escapes, MJ falls from the balcony. Spider-Man dives after her as she plummets towards the ground, catching her in his arm. The web attached to the balcony holds just in time, and they spring back up in the air. Spider-Man swings MJ to safety above the crowd below, and they continue high above the streets of Manhattan as people watch. MJ wraps her arms tightly around Spider-Man, looking around in wonder and awe at the experience and with him. They swing past the twin spires of St. Patrick's Cathedral and land on the roof garden of Rockefeller Center, surprising a canoodling couple. Spider-Man prepares to leave, somersaults off the roof, and MJ rushes over to see him swinging back and forth over the streets.",
    "970": "David averts his gaze, his lips parted, then shifts his eyes and shrugs. Charlie glances away and eyes David, who presses his lips in a disappointed line. Our view then hovers above a stately, high-ceilinged reading room, where a center aisle separates dozens of large tables arranged perpendicularly to it. The mustached adjustment officer sits at one table with his hands folded, and as men quietly work at other tables around him, some writing in slim books of their own, he shifts his contemplative eyes, then rises and walks down the aisle. Next, rain falls on the sidewalk in front of a ragtag neighborhood bar; inside, David sits at the bar writing multiple iterations of Elise's phone number on a napkin. The mustached officer sits beside him, and David glances down, shifting his jaw and glaring indignantly at Harry, who glances skyward, then over his shoulder, and lays a ticket on the bar. As Harry stands, David takes the ticket, and Harry dons his newsboy cap and leaves. David stares contemplatively at the ticket. On a ferry, passengers ride inside a covered seating area, and a couple at the handrail gaze out at the city skyline. David finds Harry leaning against the railing at the boat's stern, gives a nod, and gazes at the city. David then heads down a crowded sidewalk and as he walks amid the flowing pedestrians, the screen fades to black. David lies on his back in bed and gazes out a window with a faraway look, sunlight bathing his face as he rests his hands on his stomach. Shifting his gaze to the clock on his bedside table, he reaches over and turns off the alarm, then drops his head back on the pillow, his chest heaving. Our view sweeps down the front of his towering apartment building as David exits, briefcase in hand, and starts down the sidewalk. In Madison Square Park, dead leaves litter the ground, and David makes his way across, then waits at his bus stop. An M6 pulls up and he climbs aboard, sliding his pass through the reader and pausing in the aisle, his hopeful eyes finding the empty pair of seats occupied three years earlier by Elise. He heads to them and sits as the bus pulls away from the curb. Outside, sunlight yawns across the side of a high-rise, and David gazes out his window at a passing scaffold creating a canopied sidewalk by a construction site. A short distance ahead, he notices a dark-haired woman striding down the sidewalk. As the bus cruises past, he sees that it's Elise; Elise turns down a street behind the bus as it pulls over, and David hurries off and races back up the sidewalk after her.",

CLOSEUP UNCLE BILLY'S LEFT HAND reveals pieces of string tied around two of the fingers, obviously to remind him of things he has to do. He opens the door of his father's office and enters. George's father is seated behind his desk, nervously drawing swirls on a pad. He is a gentle man in his forties, an idealist, stubborn only for other people's rights. Nearby, in a throne-like wheelchair, behind which stands the goon who furnishes the motive power, sits Henry F. Potter, his squarish derby hat on his head. He looks tired and worried. The goon pushes his wheelchair closer to the desk. The following dialogue is fast and heated, as though the argument had been in process for some time. George stands irresolute a moment, aware of a crisis in the affairs of the Bailey Building and Loan Association, but more keenly aware of his personal crisis. George cannot listen any longer to such libel about his father. He comes around in front of the desk. He pushes George toward the door. As George passes Potter's wheelchair, he pushes the old man's shoulder. The goon puts out a restraining hand. George proceeds toward the door, with his father's hand on his shoulder. George and his father are at the door. Bailey closes the door on George and turns back to Potter. George stands outside the door with the capsules in his hand. Gower is talking on the telephone. George stands in the doorway. Gower hangs up the phone and turns to George. He grabs George by the shirt and drags him into the back room. Gower starts hitting George about the head with his open hands. Mary is still seated at the soda fountain. Each time she hears George being slapped, she winces. George tries to protect himself as best he can. George falters off, cupping his aching ear with a hand. Gower looks at the large brown bottle which has not been replaced on the shelf. George pulls the little box out of his pocket. Gower savagely rips it away from him, breathing heavily, staring at the boy venomously. He tears open the package, shakes the powder out of one of the capsules, cautiously tastes it, then abruptly throws the whole mess to the table and turns to look at George again. The boy is whimpering, hurt, frightened. Gower steps toward him. But this time Gower sweeps the boy to him in a hug and, sobbing hoarsely, crushes the boy in his embrace. George is crying too. Across the counter stands Joe Hepner, the proprietor of the store, showing a suitcase.",
    "1324": "Michael slowly approaches Gabriel. Jeep gives it some gas, but the engine's not catching. A dark shape pounces onto the hood of the car. The light catches it, revealing the disfigured face and beard of a shopping mall Santa Claus, his oversized belly gruesomely distended. Gabriel raises the mighty mace above his head. Michael closes his eyes. Buzzing surrounds them. Gabriel moves gracefully through the destroyed diner, toward the source of the clicking. He steps behind the counter and finds Bob lying in a massive pool of blood. It takes the creature a moment to realize that the clicking sound is coming from Bob's silver Zippo. Bob is focusing every last ounce of life in his body to lighting that lighter. Bob looks at Gabriel. And with one last brush of his thumb, Bob's trusty Zippo. Gabriel's eyes go wide as the tiny flame dances in front of the stove's broken gas line. Gabriel spins and runs like hell as the gas explodes. The massive explosion rocks the slow moving vehicle. Jeep swings the gun around. Blam! Gabriel takes one in the shoulder, but it doesn't slow him down. Audrey desperately tries to load a flare while avoiding Gabriel's grasp. Jeep can't get off another shot without the risk of hitting Audrey. Gabriel is almost entirely in the car now. Audrey swings the flare gun toward Gabriel, but he knocks her hand aside just as she pulls the trigger and the flare goes off inside the car! Jeep ducks. The car swerves madly. The flare ricochets through the cabin, lighting it up like the Fourth of July! Gabriel lunges for Charlie just as the flare bounces off the windshield - ping! - and nails him right in the face, setting. And that gives Jeep the chance to swing around and fire. He holds onto the car with an iron grip. Starts to pull himself back in. Jeep pulls the trigger again and click. Brings it up to fire, but he's too fast! Whack! Gabriel knocks her into the side of the car with a sweep of his hand. Now he's clawing his way unobstructed toward Charlie again. Charlie pushes herself and the baby down on the floor in front of the passenger seat. Jeep punches it. The speedometer leaps ahead. Gabriel lunges over the passenger seat, grasping for Charlie, his ferocious hand only inches from her and the baby, when Audrey leaps onto Gabriel, pulling him away from Charlie just in time. The intertwined bodies of Gabriel and Audrey hit the road with a sickening crunch and roll into a ball of fire. The Cruiser spins out of control, swerving off the road and careening into a large rock formation.",
    "379": "As we circle behind them, we look down at Ashton, a tiny town in a tiny valley, where Karl smiles, but then it fades into a certain sad suspicion. Karl thinks for a moment, then they shake on it. In a single shot, Karl cuts his hair with hedge clippers while Edward cuts up a surplus army tent to make him a shirt. Spirits buoyed by the high school marching band, all the good citizens of Ashton are gathered to see off Edward and Karl, with a few tears amid the familiar faces. Edward ducks a bit so the Mayor can put the key around his neck, and the crowd cheers. With that, Edward and Karl start walking, waving as they go, with only Don Price, smoking on the corner, not sad to see Edward leave. Many townsfolk come onto the street to hug Edward or shake his hand. As the crowd parts, he finds himself face to face with an unnamed person. The ruckus slows and quiets, as if a strange spell has been cast, and she motions for Edward to lean down so she can whisper something to him. Although we're very close, we can't hear her voice, and the advice only succeeds in confusing Edward. We tilt up from the road to reveal Edward and Karl walking out of Ashton, each wearing a backpack with all his earthly possessions. Edward and Karl come to a bend where the paved road veers left, and an overgrown dirt road runs straight, blocked with signs and warnings of danger. Karl looks at the dirt road, wary and a little paranoid, but perks up even though it means more for him to carry. The road is overgrown but not altogether creepy, with the sun still shining and the birds still chirping. The road narrows to a rough path, with spikes of sunlight breaking through the thick canopy, catching particles in the air. Coming around a bend, his pitch drops as he sees thick, thorny vines growing across the path, and he stops, realizing for the first time that the birds have stopped singing, and the forest is dead quiet. He looks back the way he came, but Edward presses on, carefully stepping through the thorns. Just then, a cawing crow swoops down and grabs the hat right out of his hands. Edward tosses the sign and forges ahead into the spiderwebs. Edward emerges from the forest, brushing the last cobwebs off and shaking the spiders from his shirt, with one stuck in his sleeve, requiring him to dance to get it out. Even then, he keeps twitching, convinced another one is left behind. At his feet, the gravel road has returned, smooth and dusty and comforting.",
    "1219": "Volunteer James gives a sermon under a canopy with the aid of a translator while a man with a camcorder records the event. Another volunteer provides medical care as Sarah passes by and walks up wooden steps into a hut where young people sit in a waiting area, some with missing limbs. Inside, Sarah finds Michael with another patient lying on the floor and hands Michael a roll of bandage to bind a stump where the shin should be; the patient writhes in pain, and Michael gives him a comforting pat. Sarah looks down at them, then at the waiting patients where a very small boy has only one leg. Suddenly, the village is attacked with rocket fire as a rocket is primed, and Sarah hands a child to its mother. The rockets, fired by the army, blow a man to pieces as Michael roams with a child in his arms. Rockets hit the paddy field destroying a wooden hut, and Sarah cowers under a hut while the army enters the village with weapons blazing. A volunteer carrying a child in each arm is cut down, and the children are dragged from him, with one shot and the other bayoneted in the stomach while his face is held down by an army boot. A woman is shot, another abused, and a third dragged away by her hair. In slow motion, a volunteer in a baseball cap tries to outrun the rocket fire, but is hit, severing his legs below the knee. A man kneels before a pair of soldiers with weapons as soldiers hack off villagers' limbs. A soldier with a flamethrower sends a plume of flame into a building, causing villagers with clothing on fire to run from it and roll in the dust, while a small child is torn from its mother and tossed into the burning building. Sarah runs as Michael is rifle-butted and the villagers run across the paddy field. The truck with a machine gun on a tripod arrives, massacring the villagers in mid-flight. Sarah is accompanied by a mother and a child who run with her, but the mother is shot in the back and drops to the ground. From the truck, the cool commander watches the carnage while his subordinate blazes away. Partially caught by a blast, Sarah tumbles into the water of the field as the commander pulls on his cigarette. More villagers run towards the truck as their bodies are torn apart by bullets and gunfire picks off survivors. Sarah looks up just as two soldiers grab her by the arms; she tries to fight them off, but they haul her to her feet and drag her away by the scruff of her neck. In the truck, the soldier in charge of the machine gun pivots to and fro in search of victims.",

As the guard opens the door, Dillinger pushes Cahoon away and slams Brian into the wall. The hulking inmate covers Cahoon's mouth. Dillinger spins Brian to the next door, pointing the waxy weapon at his back. Brian refuses. Dillinger pokes Brian with the gun. He shoves Brian to his hulking accomplice, who still restrains Cahoon. Dillinger eyes the door. He kicks it open and hits the guard in the face. Max tumbles down a flight of stairs with Dillinger close behind. His accomplice holds a pipe in his raised hand as he pushes Brian behind Dillinger. Using Max's keys, Dillinger opens the next barred door then forces Max to stand in front of a metal door. The guard on the other side peeks through then unlocks it. As he opens the door, Dillinger shoves him into Max, and his accomplice hits Brian with his pipe. Dillinger rushes into the office and holds his gun to the warden's neck. He pushes the warden into the hall while his accomplice restrains a deputy. As Dillinger jams the barrel of his gun into the warden's neck, the warden spins the dial on a safe door. Dillinger steps into the closet-sized safe, discards his fake, waxy gun, and grabs a pistol from the wall. He steps out with a rifle and hands a machine gun to his accomplice. The warden glances back as the accomplice leads him away. Dillinger grabs a hat and coat from a nearby rack. He puts them on and tosses a jacket to the other inmate, who grabs a hat from the rack as he ushers the deputy out behind Dillinger. With his rifle raised, Dillinger cautiously opens a metal door in the hallway. His accomplice follows close behind with one hand clutching the deputy between them. They make their way into a garage where a mechanic works on a police car. Dillinger reaches into one of the cars and rips out its ignition wires. He strides to the Ford V8. Outside, four officers talk to each other on a porch, their guns perched casually against their shoulders. The sleek Ford passes undetected in the alley beside them. At the front of the jailhouse, the National Guardsmen mill about by their sandbag wall. As Dillinger drives through the town, he nervously shifts his eyes back under the tipped-down brim of his fedora. The jailhouse mechanic sits beside him while his accomplice rides in back with the deputy. Dillinger notices three National Guardsmen strolling down the sidewalk. He stops for a red traffic light on a corner where more National Guardsmen stand together talking, their guns strapped over their shoulders.",
    "318": "In the flickering firelight of the Noldorin forge in Eregion, molten gold pours from the lip of an iron ladle. Three rings, each set with a single gem, are received by the high elves—Galadriel, Gil-galad, and Cirdan. Seven rings are held aloft in triumph by the dwarf lords, and nine rings are clutched tightly by the kings of men, as if holding-close a precious secret. An ancient parchment map of Middle Earth shows Mordor as the camera moves slowly across it, seemingly drawn by an unseen force. Teasing shots reveal Sauron forging the One Ring in the chambers, with the fiery lava reflecting off the ring as fire writing emerges on the plain band of gold. The One Ring falls through space and into flames, as a great shadow falls across the map, closing in around the realm of Gondor, whose people flee their homes, pursued by armies of hideous orcs. Isildur, son of the King of Gondor, leads an army across the plains of Dagorlad, commanding rank after rank of elven archers. Orcs retreat before the army of the Last Alliance, as Elendil holds aloft the great sword Narsil. The huge, dark figure of Sauron, bearing the One Ring on his finger, looms over the field of battle and lays waste to the armies of the Last Alliance. With desperate courage, Elendil leads a charge, but the black mace of Sauron lashes out, and Elendil's body falls like a crumpled rag doll. Isildur cradles the body of his father in his arms as the shadow of Sauron falls over him. Isildur snatches up the broken blade of Narsil and severs Sauron's fingers, causing the One Ring to fly from his body and disappear. Isildur picks up the severed finger and removes the One Ring, transfixed. At Gladden Field, Isildur leads a small column of men through darkening woods, the One Ring glinting on a chain around his neck, until suddenly arrows fly in an ambush by orcs. Isildur materializes underwater as the Ring slips slowly from his finger. Ripples of light play across Isildur's pale face, and he is dead. The Ring falls through the murky waters of the river, and the waters of the Anduin River lie dark and undisturbed. Silt swirls as a thin white hand reaches down, grasping the Ring, and opens to reveal one ring. Bathed in cold moonlight, the world lies dark and still in an unsettled quiet before the storm. In the gloom of a mountain cavern, a murky pool of water sits in the darkness, and the shadowy outline of an emaciated figure is seen. Unseen by its keeper, the Ring falls to the muddy floor of a mountain tunnel, where a small hand, fumbling in the dark, closes over it. A youngish-looking Bilbo Baggins peers down at what lies in his hand, perplexed by what he has found. Frightened, Bilbo quickly pockets the One Ring and hurries on.",
    "52": "Reggie is on the phone, followed by Dyle also being on the phone. She opens the door of the cabin and starts out, stepping out of her cabin and looking into the others. All the cabins are occupied except one, which she looks inside, noticing the receiver hanging by its cord, swinging back and forth, leaving her confused. Meanwhile, Dyle and Scobie stand together waiting for the elevator, with Scobie clearly holding a gun in the pocket of his raincoat. The self-service elevator doors open, one or two passengers come out, and Dyle and Scobie enter, followed by a young girl who starts in after them. Scobie reaches out with his metal hand and presses the top button, and the doors close. As Scobie follows Dyle out of the elevator, Scobie looks around and notices an open door at the end of a short hall. He and Dyle approach it, with the camera following, and through the door, which Scobie closes behind them, is a flight of stairs leading up to a second floor. Dyle yawns wide, then gets to his feet, and starts up the stairs, followed by Scobie. Dyle stops at the door, opens it, and the stairs continue up to a spectacular view of the Paris rooftops and the city lights beyond. Dyle and Scobie come out onto a level portion of the roof. On the street side, the roof angles down abruptly into a steep, slate-covered pitch, broken only by two widely separated oval-shaped dormer windows. Dyle turns and looks, seeing nothing behind him but a sheer drop to the street, and moving quickly, he lashes out and hacks Scobie's gun hand with the side of his palm, causing the gun to fall to the roof. Dyle follows through by punching the large man full in the jaw, but instead of falling, Scobie wraps his arm around Dyle, holding on tightly until his head clears. To Dyle's amazement, he is lifted into the air, unable to break the bear-hold, and is carried toward the edge of the roof. Dyle works his arms between their two bodies and suddenly flails them out with all his strength, breaking the hold, but at the cost of his coat and the flesh on his back as Scobie's metal claw rips through both, leaving a wound extending from the center of Dyle's back to his shoulder. Both men look around for the gun, spotting it simultaneously and leaping for it, both landing short of the mark. They grapple with one another, each trying to break free and reach for the gun. Two hands, one real and one metal, inch toward the gun as the battle goes in Scobie's favor, whose weight and strength begin to tire Dyle, now on his back, trying to stop Scobie from crawling over him.",
    "832": "The guys consider for a moment as Nick stares down, brow creased, before taking the briefcase. Nick is at work when Harken harangues an employee within earshot of him. Nick takes a pen and slides it down his throat, causing himself to vomit into his wastepaper basket. After wiping his mouth, Nick picks up the plastic bin and heads out. The guys drive down a leafy, suburban street and gaze over at a large house as Kurt grins. Night falls, and chewing on snacks, they all share a look. They get out of the car and quickly hide as Bobby's garage door swings open. An orange Pontiac Trans Am tears out and drives off down the street. Nick and Kurt roll under the slowly closing garage door, with Dale bashing into it, causing the door to open again. Inside the house, they see tasteless artifacts and a deep tray of cocaine about the size of a CD case, which he drops, resulting in a cocaine cloud hanging in the air. Kurt enters the bedroom where there's a large Japanese style portrait of Bobby brandishing nunchucks and pockets something from the dresser. Nick, wearing a short-sleeved T-shirt, watches Dale pick up the tray, while Kurt uses his sleeve gloves to turn the light on in Bobby's on-suite bathroom and spots Bobby's toothbrush. Kurt takes the toothbrush from its holder, slides it down his ass crack, and has a good scrub before putting it back. Dale's hoody is dusted with cocaine, and he tries to sweep it off while Kurt picks up Bobby's razor and pops it down the back of his trousers. In the open plan living space, Nick dumps the contents of a Dustbuster vacuum into the cocaine tray, now full of dust, cocaine, and debris, remaining stony-faced. Kurt finds dental floss as Dale sniffs and flexes his jaw. Kurt finishes up in the bathroom, turns the light off, and leaves for the living room, where he slaps Dale, and Dale rolls his shoulders. Street lamps illuminate the darkened street as they drive on and pull up outside Harken's palatial home to park in the shadows. Approaching the front door, they climb over a low hedge and peer in through the windows when something catches Nick's eye. He takes a rock from a plant pot by the door, tosses it to Kurt, and takes a key from the rock. They enter the spacious hallway where a portrait of Harken with his wife and their cat hangs in the lounge. The cat leaps onto Nick's shoulder and bolts as Dale sings along to the radio in the car. Kurt and Nick start across the landing, where life-size cat figurines rest on small podiums, and a porcelain cat's face hangs on the wall.",
    "230": "Bogucki gently knocks on the door and enters with some clothes. He gazes at Szpilman, whose eyes remain closed, and holds up a towel. Szpilman lifts himself out of the bath and dries himself. In the next scene, the ceramic stove is visible as Szpilman's ghetto clothes, torn into strips, are being stuffed into it and burned by Janina. Szpilman, now wearing Bogucki's suit and clean-shaven, watches the clothes burn while spooning hot soup into his mouth, as Janina adds the last strip of clothing. Later, a rickshaw carrying Szpilman and Bogucki travels along the dark streets and halts outside a store. As soon as it stops, the store's shutters are raised, and Bogucki escorts Szpilman to the door, then quickly returns to the rickshaw, which moves off fast. GEBCZNYSKI shakes hands with Szpilman, ushers him inside, and pulls down the shutter. Gebczynski's store is stocked with sanitary furnishings and supplies, including lavatories, basins, baths, and taps. He leads the way, picking up a cushion and blanket as he goes, and Szpilman follows him down dark, shadowy stairs lined with shelves of taps, washers, and pipes. Gebczynski guides Szpilman to a specific set of shelves, puts aside the cushion and blanket, and starts to push at the shelves, which slowly move to reveal a secret compartment. He helps Szpilman into the compartment, hands him the cushion and blanket, and then pushes the shelves back into place, hiding Szpilman. In the cramped space, Szpilman cannot quite stretch fully and, with difficulty, places the cushion behind his head and starts to cover himself with the blanket but stops when he sees something. Later, Szpilman and Gebczynski wait with others at a tram stop as a tram approaches and halts. They board the tram apprehensively, pushing through the rear section packed with Poles until they reach a chain and sign separating the sections. In the German section, only three or four passengers, some read newspapers while others look out the windows, consciously avoiding eye contact with the Poles. Szpilman tries to remain inconspicuous as the tram continues on its way. Eventually, Gebczynski and Szpilman go up the stairs to a landing and door, which Gebczynski unlocks, allowing them to enter. Inside is a charmingly furnished bed-sitting room with a comfortable divan. Gebczynski leads the way in, while Szpilman glances around, goes to the window, and looks out to see a section of the ghetto wall below, with a narrow street inside the ghetto leading to deserted buildings.",
    "299": "The CAMERA PULLS BACK into Jeff's apartment until his head fills the screen. He is asleep. A shadow of some other person creeps over his face. His eyes start to open. He looks up. The screen is filled with the eyes, nose, and mouth of a woman coming nearer and nearer to the CAMERA to kiss Jeff. The face is more or less in shadow, with a faint light coming onto the profile from the window. The girl kisses Jeff firmly, but not passionately. Then her head moves back an inch or two. She speaks. The two big profiles fill the screen. It moves down until the lips move out of the bottom of the screen, leaving just the eyes filling it. The CAMERA FOLLOWS HER quickly to another lamp. She gets a little farther away from us so that we now see her down to her waist. She turns on the second lamp, and the light shows us that her beauty is not alone in her face. The CAMERA PANS HER over to a third lamp which she turns on. She is now full figure, beautifully groomed and flawless. Her dress is high-style fashion and dramatic evening wear. Jeff looks across the room at her. She does a professional model's turn in the dress, showing off its features. Jeff replies. She laughs pleasantly. She looks down at the long mahogany table beside her, which is littered with a number of his personal effects. Her own handbag is also on the table. As she talks, her eyes scan the table as if she's looking for something specific. Lisa finds what she has been looking for, picks up an old and cracked cigarette box, and examines it as she talks. She turns to look at him and moves toward him, carrying the cigarette box. Lisa faces Jeff in the chair. She turns around quickly and dashes to the door, dropping the cigarette box on the table as she passes, THE CAMERA PANNING with her. She goes up the two steps, stops, and turns back to Jeff. She reaches for the doorknob and turns it. She swings open the door and stands to one side. Framed in the doorway is a middle-aged waiter wearing a white linen pea jacket with a red collar. His reaction is one of tender amusement. He smiles, nods, and enters. He's carrying in one hand a large portable warming oven, and in the other hand an ice bucket containing a bottle of wine covered with a napkin. He goes down the stairs as she follows. He hands her the wine bucket, and she places it on the table. THE CAMERA GOES with both of them as he moves toward the kitchen and she moves to a small bar set in the wall cabinet.",
    "851": "They deflect off Gabriel's steel breastplate. Gabriel rises into the air and swings his mace, crashing it into furniture. Michael wallops. Gabriel leaps over his wing and gets swept with a machine pistol. Gabriel shoves the spike in the middle of his mace into the barrel of the gun. Michael shoots and is blown back against the wall. Gabriel attacks. Gabriel slams the mace against the wall. Michael clutches the shaft of the mace. Gabriel sets the spiked end spinning. He pushes it towards Michael's face. Michael shoves it away, and Gabriel punches him. Michael punches Gabriel, grabs the overhead TV, and hurls it at Gabriel. Gabriel punches Michael to the floor. Gabriel grabs Michael by the throat, lifts him up, and punches him. Michael wallops him back and twists his arm. He flings Gabriel over and kicks him in the face. Gabriel forces Michael over a worktop and pins him down. He wields a hammer. Michael dodges the blow. Gabriel spins and slashes Michael across the chest. Michael looks down at his ripped shirt. Gabriel punches him in the face. Gabriel lunges with the mace, but Michael blocks the blow. The mace flies out of Gabriel's hands. Michael punches and kicks Gabriel. He gets on Gabriel's back, with his arms around his neck. Gabriel flies upwards and batters Michael against the ceiling. Michael keeps his arms held tight around Gabriel's neck. Michael holds on tight. Gabriel reaches down and picks up the mace. Gabriel holds the mace to his side and twists it. A blade shoots out, stabbing Michael behind him. Michael flops back onto the floor, his mouth wide open. Michael lies with his arms outstretched, eyes wide open, twitching slightly, a bloody wound in his chest. Gabriel turns and stares down at Michael. Tears glisten in Gabriel's eyes. Michael's bloody lips twitch. His eyes close as he expires. A golden light spreads over him. A tear runs down Gabriel's cheek as he watches. The bright light engulfs Michael, then vanishes taking him with it. Gabriel turns to go. As Jeep drives through the light, Charlie turns and looks at him. Black lines and symbols spread up his arm. Gabriel slowly steps through the wrecked diner holding his mace. He goes behind the counter where Bob is laying amongst the wreckage. Bob holds his lighter out to a gas tap at the base of an oven. He looks up at Gabriel. He sparks up a flame, igniting the gas. Gabriel takes flight as flames engulf the diner and the possessed outside. Jeep drives along a desert highway. Charlie sits on the passenger seat, cradling her baby and smiling down at him. Jeep frowns at Charlie. Then they both look ahead.",
    "595": "Holding a small tin and a pair of scissors, he attempts to cut a piece of plant as it waves its vine-like tentacles. Harry walks past and spots him, then approaches and gives Slughorn a fright, after which he walks away. Slughorn glances around furtively as Harry walks up a grassy hillock, with Slughorn lagging a little way behind. Ahead, he sees Hagrid, his dog, and Harry by the corpse of a colossal spider, and Harry demonstrates with his fingers. A bit of spider breaks off, and Slughorn drops it on the ground, then looks up at the giant Hagrid, bows his head, and closes his eyes. In Hagrid's cottage, Harry applauds the tipsy duo, with Hagrid's eyes closed and his head tilting back until it thuds against the high-backed chair, while Harry grins. Slughorn looks across the room at Harry, but his smile fades as Harry gulps and stares at the old man with the scar on his forehead. He stands up, and wide-eyed, Slughorn gazes at the boy standing before him, blinks, and his eyes moisten. Slughorn presses the tip of his wand against his temple, closes his eyes, then pulls the wand away, revealing a wisp of vapor, the memory. His hand shaking, he holds up a small test tube; as he inverts the wand, Harry steadies Slughorn's hand, and the memory drops into the container. In his study, Dumbledore pours it into the pensive, and the memory begins with the hourglass. The teenage Tom Riddle turns away from Slughorn and walks towards the fire, hands behind his back, fiddles with a ring on his finger, and then turns to face Slughorn, who looks into the boy's cold eyes. The memory ends, and Dumbledore holds up a hand to silence Harry. Looking troubled, the professor walks away from the pensive, crosses his study, and sinks down onto a short flight of steps. Dumbledore hurries to his desk, holds it up, and Harry touches the ring, which spins. Images of the teenage Tom, the boy in the orphanage, the pebbles on the window ledge, the postcard of the coast, and Voldemort flash by, and then the ring stops spinning. Harry flexes his neck as Dumbledore moves around the desk and looks closely at him, while Harry breathes deeply. Snape abruptly leaves the astronomy tower, and descending the stairs, he meets Harry, who has overheard his exchange with Dumbledore. Snape stops in front of Harry for a moment, then continues his descent. Harry climbs up to the upper platform, rubs his chin self-consciously, and they walk to the balustrade. Harry nods, hesitates, and places his hand on Dumbledore's arm, and they shoot off the tower as white-tipped waves roll towards a pinnacle rising out of the sea, where Harry and Dumbledore stand on top of it.",
    "610": "Over an adjacent street to the sound of gunshots, the taxi drops him and his luggage up the street with shops with graffiti'd shutters, where he stares up at a rundown tenement building and then lowers his eyes to see a grimy kebab shop by the name of Kebab Palace. Mrs. Kowalski leads Sydney into his grotty studio apartment, where inside, she slaps him and leaves with her nose in the air. Tiles on the dance floor light up as he struts from one disinterested group of girls to another, waving his hands, moving his pelvis, wiggling his backside, and leaping about, until the girls retreat from him wildly and stop. He puffs out his cheek and walks off as the dance floor lights up again. On the street outside, Sydney passes a leggy blonde in a green, and he glances over his shoulder to see her enter a bar with a red wood-paneled exterior. Turning on his heel, he hastily follows her inside, and as the blonde heads for the bar, Sydney enters and adjusts his jacket before confidently sidling up beside her. Affecting a suave smile, he takes his seat facing her and leans on the bar, but he gags on his drink and turns back to the leggy blonde before turning his back on a second woman with pretty, flaxen hair. The blonde leaves, and Sydney takes out the newspaper clipping as he spills her drink, soaking her notebook, and as the woman puts her phone away, she gathers her belongings and glares at him with a furrowed brow. Bobbie, a buxom brunette in a zebra print dress, takes Alison's seat, and Sydney nods with raised eyebrows. Back at Sydney's sparse, undecorated apartment, Bobby staggers off into the bedroom like a schoolboy, while Sydney takes a record, flings it over his head, and then replaces it. Sydney thrashes out power cords on it and flails wildly until the record suddenly stops, and he turns at the stop to see Bobbie's naked and points as Mrs. Kowalski slaps him. They turn to look at Bobbie, and their eyebrows shoot up in unison. Sidney wakes at 7:00 AM to the sound of his alarm clock, grimacing as he fumbles around and turns it off. Sunlight streams in through a bedside window as he yanks the cord of his venetian blind, which clatters down on top of him, and he tumbles from the bed. He spits in the sink and sips urine-colored water from a glass, only to spit it out over the mirror. In a gray tee-shirt and boxer shorts, he raises a blind in the living room, while half asleep under a blanket, Bobbie adjusts his genitals. Sydney strolls through Times Square in a tee-shirt, where garish billboards compete with towering glass-walled office blocks, with a tower with glass-walled offices reaching high in the sky.",
    "988": "Daisy crawls into the makeshift den, and Benjamin follows on his hands and knees. Kneeling beneath the table, Benjamin strikes a match and carefully lights a candle, whose warm glow silhouettes them behind the white drapery. Daisy smiles. She gingerly reaches out to touch his smiling face. Benjamin holds her gaze as she touches his stubbly cheek. Miss Fuller whisks up the sheet, exposing them. Daisy obeys. Miss Fuller scowls at Benjamin. Wearing a nightgown, she starts up the stairs, using her cane. Dejected, Benjamin leans out of the den with his head hung. Queenie comes up from the basement in her dressing gown and catches sight of him kneeling in the shadows, staring at the floor. Suddenly resolute, Benjamin rises, resting on his cane. She embraces him. She gently strokes his back and kisses him on the forehead. She scratches her head thoughtfully as he walks away. Benjamin hooks his cane on the end of his bed and gets in. Old man Daws is in the bed opposite. Grainy old footage shows the lightning striking him. Sepia footage of Mr. Daws collapsing by a mailbox follows. Lying in his bed, Daws exhales a cloud of wispy, white cigarette smoke and stares off in thought. Benjamin turns onto his side and sinks down beneath the covers. Smiling, Oti takes a step back, then turns and walks briskly out of the door. Straight-backed and without the use of a cane, Benjamin goes to a window and peers out through narrowed eyes. Carrying a suitcase, Oti crosses the road below, bathed in the orange glow of a streetlamp. A woman with a dog sits beside Benjamin at a piano. He joins in, and they play together. Benjamin washes himself in the bath. He stares down. Caroline leaves Daisy's bedside. On TV, Hurricane Katrina is shown. A nurse arrives. They stand by a window at the foot of the bed. The nurse strides off to assist a colleague, and Caroline drifts over to the empty bed beside her mother's. Cast in cold, blue light from the window, she takes her hands out of the pockets of her dark body-warmer and sits cross-legged on the mattress with the diary in her lap. Mr. Daws sits beside him on a bench. Grainy footage shows lightning striking Mr. Daws in a field, sending up a plume of smoke. A man approaches them on the dock. The captain glances around. Benjamin looks at a young guy. Benjamin stands up. The bearded captain wears braces and a peaked cap. He nods. Benjamin boards the tugboat Chelsea. The captain leans out of the wheelhouse. He swabs the decks. In the wheelhouse, Mike leans towards Benjamin. Mike squints thoughtfully. Benjamin wears a searching expression.",
    "1211": "They head into the forest, and BN now leads the escapees as they mount a rise. Lewis treads on a hidden land mine, and Diaz clamps a hand over his mouth as more troops dismount from the back of the lorry. The lorry moves on. Louis is wide-eyed in shock as Diaz whispers to him while Reese looks about. Michael cuts at the bloody wound, and Louis bites on a cloth. Soldiers get off a lorry with the tracker dogs, which are set after the scent and they lead their handlers in a rapid pursuit, followed by a large body of their colleagues. Rambo, Sarah, and School Boy run up a rocky slope, but Sarah stumbles in the dirt, prompting Rambo to run back to help her up while School Boy moves up front. Michael and the mercenaries carry Lewis on a hastily-constructed stretcher, and the dogs lead their handlers. On the rocky path, School Boy stops to listen in a craggy crevice as Rambo starts to tear a strip from Sarah's shirt, which he ties around his boot. School Boy tosses Rambo an explosive while Lewis' party looks around in horror. The commander's truck stops, and via a walkie-talkie, the commander screams orders at an armed patrol boat on the river. The grey patrol boat flies the Burmese flag, and the captain signals to his helmsman, who fires up the engine. A handler offers a tracker dog a sniff of clothing. Rambo runs through the undergrowth with a strip of Sarah's clothing on his boot, and the troops seem to be gaining on him as he runs through a carpet of dry brown leaves. A lorry pulls into a clearing and more troops dismount. Rambo heads through the forest at full tilt, skidding to a halt beside a gnarled tree where he takes the claymore explosive and launches it in the limbs of the roots. He glances in the direction of his pursuers and rips the clothing strip from his boot. He pulls a round metal disc, which is fastened to the body of the mine by a piece of twine that he ties around the cloth, and with another glance in the direction of the dogs, he pulls a priming pin from the bomb and covers the explosive with leaves before taking off into the forest. The dogs and their handlers halt by the bush, and a small dog with beady eyes, tan fur, and a white beard sniffs around leaves and ferns, causing the handlers to look at each other. One of the soldiers looks along the tree, where the rusty grey shape of the Tall Boy Missile is lodged in the ground and leaning against the branch, prompting the wide-eyed and terrified handlers to quickly pull the excited dogs away as a soldier kneels to inspect the ground.",
    "147": "Gandhi struggles to turn, and Mirabehn helps him. When he turns we see that his face is wet with sweat from the dry heaving and his hands and arms are quivering and he cannot stop them. She looks at him nervously, then pours a glass from the pitcher. She turns back, and propping up his head, helps him to sip. Gandhi swallows with difficulty. He pauses, letting his head fall back and she lowers it down to the mat again. He tries to smile. Mirabehn looks daunted by his intractability. Gandhi signals her down to him. She bends so she is looking at the floor and he is speaking almost into her ear. We intercut their faces, very close, as he speaks. During the very last of it Mirabehn has turned her face to him, touched with emotion. She starts to pour water from the pitcher into the glass again, then she turns suddenly, her attention caught. Her point of view. The doorway. Nehru stands in it. Kallenbach and Desai are a step or two behind him. It is a victory. Gandhi's face cracks into a tearful grin. And Nehru chokes with emotion and laughter at the same time. He buries his head on Gandhi's hand, clutching it to him. Bright sunshine. A little boy is pulling a goat by a tether. He turns with a bright smile. Gandhi is walking, holding Ba's shoulder for support with one hand, and Mirabehn's with the other. Nehru stares at him and the policemen with growing incredulity. It stops Nehru. He looks at Gandhi and sighs in unmastered frustration, but he moves to Gandhi's side. Gandhi turns to Mirabehn. He laughs and Nehru struggles to join in the joke. A quiet hum in a packed courtroom. Armed sepoys line the wall. Featuring Judge Broomfield and the clerk. The Judge is flipping through documents on the case, a troubled frown on his face. At last, he shuts the folder and nods to the clerk. The clerk turns and says in a moderately loud voice. The sergeant-at-arms turns and moves to the door at the side of the bench. The courtroom immediately falls silent. The sergeant-at-arms opens the door -- a moment -- and Gandhi enters slowly. He has recovered a bit more, but he still moves slowly. As Gandhi enters, he lowers his glasses, places them on his desk, and rises, facing Gandhi. Featuring two English court reporters. One nudges the other in astonishment, signaling off toward the judge. The clerk, confused as well as astonished, sees the judge standing, facing Gandhi in respect, and dutifully, he too stands. A disbelieving exchange of glances, the sound of others standing around them. The whole court rises, the astounded reporters the last of all.",
    "814": "He steps forward, and she grasps his shoulder, tossing back her long, straightened hair before stepping back as he steps forward. Her high-heeled, sandaled feet fall in with his dance step, and holding both her hands in his, he twirls her towards him, twisting her arms across her waist. Keeping their heads still, they move around in a circle, and she unravels from his hold, whacking his cheek with her fan and slapping his face with her long, tossing hair. They resume their initial position, holding waist and shoulder, and whirl altogether. She leans back seductively and flicks the fan, and Luke looks both startled and pleased as she flutters her eyelashes at him from behind the fan. He spins her again, and breaking from his hold, she dances an improvised solo, waving the fan in front of her chest, waist, and bottom. Luke smiles awkwardly and claps his hands vaguely to accompany his unpredictable dancing partner. Suddenly, she disappears, only to reappear behind him, swaying wildly from side to side, waving the fan in front of her. He tries to reconnect, but she whacks him again, then settles back in his arms. Later, they walk back to their hotel, where Alicia, sipping champagne on a sofa in the lobby, uncrosses her legs and struts towards him. She strokes and kisses his cheek, while Rebecca turns away, trying to mask her disappointment. In New York, Rebecca sits glumly in the back of a Yellow Cab as it crosses Times Square. Her chin resting on one blue cashmere-gloved hand, she answers her mobile and then dives to the floor of the cab, finding her black and white dress. Suze is propelled across the room and buried under an avalanche of clothes as Tall D. Freak smiles at his neighbor. Rebecca, wearing her sample blue gloves, faces the group. At home, Rebecca runs to the fridge and frantically searches through the freezer, bringing out a huge block of ice with a credit card in the middle. She smashes the block onto the counter and the floor, banging at it with a yellow stiletto heel and then a thicker wooden heel. She holds the smaller block to the floor and wrestles with it, using two hair dryers to melt it down, and eureka! Armed with the card, she goes to the store and spots a cute melon-shaped bag. It's the group leader, and Rebecca waves at Lainley, as the group leader clutches a shoe to her forehead. On the night of the ball, Luke, Alicia, and Rebecca ride up in the lift, with Rebecca in a beaded black and silver jacket. Alicia glances down at her and smiles as the lift doors open onto a sumptuous ballroom.",
    "372": "It's late, and Edward is pensive as the first raindrops hit the windshield, prompting him to turn on the wipers. Suddenly, a deluge descends, and it's like being caught in a waterfall, the rain is that loud. He puts on the handbrake, and just as suddenly, the sound changes from pounding to softly splashing as the world becomes close and echoing with the car underwater. The tires are still on the road, but where there used to be air is now water, and three catfish swim in front of his headlights. Realizing his plight, Edward tries to remain calm as water trickles in through the crack between the window and the door, but very slowly. For now, he's fine. That's when he sees her, The Girl in the River, swimming outside the car. While we never see her face exactly, she remains just as beautiful, just as mysterious, as the first time we saw her. She puts her hand to the windshield, and he puts his up to meet hers and smiles. It's morning, and the sun shines brightly with birds chirping and trees dripping, the grass shining, still wet from last night's rain. The car balances precariously ten feet up in an elm tree. He pulls out a key and rubs it off; it's the Key to the City he lost years ago. Carrying his busted suitcase, a tired Edward walks toward a one-street town in the distance, passing a rusty sign. Amazed and disbelieving, Edward walks down the center of the road with no cars coming from either direction. He looks up to find his faded shoes still dangling from the power line, along with the rest of the town's. We look around the town, on and off Main Street, and slowly move through a foreclosure auction to find Edward watching. Two very corporate men in suits stick out among the bidders as Edward pitches his plan to Norther. In various shots, Edward is expressive and passionate as always, talking to Ping, Jing, and Amos Calloway. Edward climbs out of his car, the road having literally stopped. Although the sun is shining, it can barely penetrate the trees' thick canopy. In the distance, he sees a shack so old it's nearly fallen, and he walks toward it, the marshy ground squishing up around his feet, soaking the hems of his trousers. Edward knocks on the half-hung door, which swings open by itself, revealing an inside nicer than you'd think, a real home. With her back turned to him, Jenny Hill plays the piano, and without turning, she speaks and keeps playing. Jenny stops playing, her piece not quite finished, and turns to face him. Edward still doesn't recognize her, and hearing it put that way is strange to him. He looks at her, puzzled and surprised.",
    "321": "The HUM OF THE RING seems to grow louder in Frodo's ears as Gimli suddenly stands, excited, and rushes forward, swinging his axe down on the ring. The axe shatters with a deafening crack, and Gimli falls backward, staring in disbelief at the ring, unharmed. Frodo winces as an angry image of the fiery eye hits him, making him slump in his chair, clutching his forehead, while Gandalf looks at him with concern. Stunned silence follows, and the council sits with downcast eyes, as if a great dread has descended on them. Boromir addresses the council in a quiet voice, and Gimli leaps to his feet. Frodo, motionless, experiences angry faces, shaking fists, accusatory fingers, and his eyes move across to the ring, as the hum grows louder in his head. The screen fills with an image of the Ring, streams of blood flowing across its surface, and flames flicker within the Gold Band. Frodo, breathing rapidly and caught in the grip of his hideous vision, with a huge effort or will, tears his gaze upon the ring and suddenly stands, speaking in a strong, clear voice. A sudden silence occurs as Frodo looks around at the astounded faces. Boromir looks at everyone, then walks towards Frodo, and looks towards Elrond and Gandalf. Frodo stares in wonder as the Greatest Fighters in all Middle-earth stand at his side. Merry and Pippin jump up from behind another bush as an old sword slides out of a shabby leather scabbard, its polished, well-tended blade glittering cold and bright. Bilbo offers Sting to Frodo and unwraps a small shirt of close woven mail. Frodo peels off his shirt, revealing The Ring on the chain around his neck when suddenly a shadow passes across Bilbo, and for a split second, he becomes a wrinkled creature with a hungry face and bony, groping hands. Frodo pulls away, shocked, and the shadow passes. Bilbo slumps into a chair, his head in his hands, faltering, his eyes filling with tears as he sobs, and Frodo moves to comfort him. The Fellowship climbs the long steep path out of the cloven vale of Rivendell, and they trek through a land of deep valleys and turbulent waters, with the Misty Mountains rising sharply to their left. Sam is at the campfire as Gimli manages to corner Gandalf. Boromir thrusts, catching Pippin on the hand, who then throws down his sword, kicks, and lunges at Boromir, tackling him to the ground, followed by much laughter. Legolas' eyes are fixed on a distant dark patch that darts about the sky like flying smoke in the wind, while Gandalf looks at Aragorn and turns to the others, gesturing towards a high mountain pass. The Fellowship clamber through rock and snow as Frodo slips on some shale and the Ring falls on the ground. The ring gleams in the snow as Boromir's hand picks it up by the chain, and he stands with the ring dangling before his eyes.",
    "108": "Forrest stands next to George Wallace and listens as some Alabama policemen and citizens clap their hands while National Guardsmen stand at attention with their weapons in front of them. Forrest walks through the crowd, noticing two black students being led toward the schoolhouse. The young black girl drops one of her books, and Forrest steps past the policeman to pick up the book from the ground. He steps out from the crowd and brings the book up to the girl. A coach looks at the television, where Forrest is seen standing at the schoolhouse door. He looks around and waves as an assistant coach looks at the television and then at the other coaches. The football coach and two assistant coaches look as Forrest dries himself off with a towel after stepping from the showers. In color footage, Governor Wallace is mingling in a crowd when gunshots are fired, wounding him. Some men wrestle the shooter as Wallace lies wounded on the ground. Forrest sits on a bench as a black woman looks at him, with a white woman and a baby sitting to the left. A bus pulls up to the bus stop, and the black woman looks at her watch, then gets up and steps over to the bus. The white woman sits closer to Forrest. Later, Forrest sits outside Jenny's dorm in the rain holding a box of chocolates, looking at a car that pulls up as a song plays on the radio. Inside the car, Jenny is with a boy, leaning back against the passenger side door as they struggle to get comfortable. Billy gets back in the car and pulls away as Jenny steps toward Forrest. Forrest holds out the box of chocolates, and Jenny grabs his hand, leading him toward the dorm. They sneak to Jenny's door, unlock it, and step inside. Jenny pulls a robe off her sleeping roommate's bed and hands it to Forrest, who sits on Jenny's bed. She picks up a towel and walks back toward Forrest, drying the water from her hair. She takes off her slip and sits on the bed next to Forrest, wearing only her bra and panties. Forrest looks at Jenny as if he's never seen a woman in her underwear before and looks down at her breasts. Jenny realizes he is looking at her, leans over, and puts her head on his shoulder as a song comes over the radio. Jenny hugs Forrest, laughs, and kisses him on the cheek. They hug on the bed, while Jenny's roommate pretends to be asleep but listens, horrified, with her eyes open.",
    "817": "She slumps down and gazes miserably at a photograph of herself and black-haired Suze laughing together. In his office, Luke picks up the empty photo frame from his desk and looks at it with a sigh, adding it to the other personal things he's put in a cardboard box. Alicia appears at his door. Graham brings Alette a cup. Jane can't do tiny, and all eyes are on her as she cuts a millimeter slice. Alette's perfectly made-up eyes blink, and she gives a Gallic shrug. Luke is in a bank. At the shopaholic meeting, the door bursts open, and group members put up their hands. At Dantay-West, Allon, the receptionist, gets an email about a sale and auction by the girl in the green scarf. At her desk, Haley looks at her inbox, and her eyes widen as she's holding a piece of paper behind her back. Luke leans over and snatches it from her; it's the attachment Allon forwarded to all employees. He keeps the ad and looks at it with a sober expression while the shopaholics group are getting the auction items ready. With crazed eyes, Haley jumps out of a cab and dashes to join a queue of women standing outside the church building where the sale is taking place. Graham is on door duty, Allon is first in line, and Graham demonstrates a red ensemble. D. Freak is on hats, and Miss Korch produces the green scarf. Haley sends a text. Rebecca suddenly seems hesitant; she grabs back the scarf, walks towards the blonde purchaser, and places it in her outstretched hands, looking at her intriguingly. Jane and Graham look on proudly as the blonde, smiling coyly, waves the scarf at the applauding women. Rebecca looks distraught. Later, Graham counts the takings. Derek Smeath strides into his office, and the staff watches him pass with po-faced curiosity. He looks back at them through his old-fashioned, black-rimmed specs, and his pace slows. An employee, seeing him draw near, ducks into an unseen office. Smeath, scowling, wipes his mouth and turns to the door of his own office, where Rebecca is at his desk, and all the money is in jars of coins. It's the day of the wedding, and a photographer on the decorated front steps of the church snaps the maids of honor arranging Suze's wedding train. One of them wears blue, the other pale green, and the third is in red. A figure in pink hurries up as Suze turns around and looks coldly at Rebecca, who, wearing a pink tulle veil, looks imploringly at Suze. She turns towards the street, where the bag lady, standing with her trolley, twirls around in Rebecca's favorite pattern jacket. Suze's eyes mist over, and with a relieved smile, Rebecca whips off her spotted shrug.",
    "827": "The gentle golden glow of a street light shimmers on the rain-slick road as people with umbrellas hurry into a restaurant where Hannah, her boyfriend, other colleagues, and Liz sit around a table. Whilst her colleagues laugh, Liz signals to a waiter while Hannah looks disappointed. Liz gapes over at the couple with wide eyes and an anxious expression as Hannah eyes her boyfriend searchingly and steps in close to him. He raises a hand, and she grabs a guy's drink and gulps it before heading off, marching out and high-fiving Liz on the way. Hannah strides through the rain to a bar where Jacob is flirting with a blonde 20-something woman. Frowning, Jacob turns and smiles at Hannah curiously. Rain-drenched, she storms over to him, grabs his face in her hands, and kisses him hard. Slowly, Jacob reaches around her waist, pulls her to him, and lifts her gently off the ground, still locked in a passionate embrace. After some time, Hannah pulls away, looks him straight in the eye, and Jacob smiles happily. Hannah nods curtly and kisses him again before Jacob puts her back down, and she drags him out of the bar while the woman he was flirting with earlier stares at them incredulously as they leave. Hannah stands in the living room of Jacob's apartment, watching the rain through the tall glass windows, as Jacob pours liquor onto a sugar lump in a glass, crushes the lump with a pestle, pours in more liquor, and adds some ice cubes, grating some orange peel into the drink. A stylus lowers onto a record, and Jacob goes into the living room carrying two drinks to where Hannah stands in her knee-length black dress, fidgeting nervously. He hands her the glass, and she glugs down her drink at top speed, cringes, shakes her head, and grabs the other drink off Jacob, starting to gulp that down. She gags and hands back both empty glasses, as Jacob heads over to a coffee table to put them down. Hannah does a nervous twirl while Jacob takes off his jacket and sits down, squeezing his hands into fists. He points to himself, nods, and smiles before taking off his top to reveal a tanned, muscular torso with a six pack. Hannah scrutinizes him as he looks down at himself, and she touches and gawks at him. He smiles smugly, and she limbers up, runs at him, and he lifts her up. Her legs flop before she lifts them up, and slowly he spins around, then stops. She lowers her legs, and he lets her fall into his arms so she's pressed up against his body, sliding gently down until her feet touch the floor as he presses his forehead against hers.",
    "858": "On the roof, Kyle watches as the intruders slope off. They trudge away from the diner. Michael clutches on to Sandra, who sinks to her knees. Jeep helps Charlie up. She looks apprehensive as Michael approaches. Kyle leads in the others from the roof. Audrey tries to console her mother. Bob grimly strides forward. Michael stares at the others. He turns to Charlie. Her smile fades when she sees his somber face and steadfast gaze. Charlie closes her eyes. He loads an assault rifle, turns, and walks away from them. Outside, intermittent bright flashes illuminate the horizon. Kyle is on the roof with Percy. Kyle glances down at Percy, who is crouched low, leaning against a ledge. Percy looks around at Kyle. Percy turns away and leans a rifle over his arm. Kyle looks awkward. Percy watches as Kyle places the gun on the ledge. Kyle shakes his head. Percy blinks and glances down. Tears fall from his eyes. Kyle raises his head, then turns to stare at Percy beside him. Downstairs, Bob turned on the grill, then lights a cigarette with his lighter. He takes a deep drag, then breathes it out. He picks up a can and drinks from it. He looks across the room at Sandra, whose hair, which had been pulled tight, is now loose. He sets a beer down in front of her. Having wiped the top of the can, she gazes at it, then drinks. She sets it down on the table. Sandra buries her head in her hands. In the storeroom, Jeep looks at Michael curiously. Jeep takes a claw hammer off a hook. Michael hangs his head. He walks over to Jeep. Jeep stares frowning at Michael, who wears a benign expression. Michael leaves a thoughtful-looking Jeep. Bob stands on the roof, leaning against the wall. He drinks beer from a can and puffs on a cigarette. Wind whips through his hair. The sky is filled with dense, gray clouds. He flinches at the sound and looks out at a bank of gray mist. Michael stands on the roof, looking pensive. Michael stands on a roof, silhouetted against bright sunlight. He has wings. He's with an elder angel, Gabriel. An army of angels flies overhead. Michael slowly steps across the roof of the diner. The two children swings are blown back and forth by the wind. The strings of light bulbs shake. He drops his beer can. As gray mist rolls in, Bob is sitting by the wall dozing. Sandra is lying on the floor next to Audrey. She wakes and looks around anxiously. She sits up. Hearing the voice, she looks around. She slowly walks through the diner with her arms held stiffly away from her sides.",
    "1122": "Harry gets out of bed, covers his eyes, and blows his nose on his filthy garment, then hits his head with the medicine bottle. Harry grabs Dobby, but Dobby clicks his fingers and disappears. Harry jumps back into bed as shadows appear in the doorway. A patient is carried in on a stretcher and lifted carefully onto a bed. Professor Dumbledore takes the camera from Colin Creevey's stiff fingers and opens the back, and the film explodes. Hermione prepares a potion, and a ghostly girl in a school uniform shouts in Ron's face, then hovers high above their heads, zooms into a cubicle, and dives head first down the lavatory pan. In the Great Hall, a long platform has been erected, and Lockhart strides along it, tossing his cloak to a group of excited girls. Snape steps onto the platform, and Snape and Lockhart draw their wands and solemnly salute each other. They bow, turn, take a few steps away, then turn again and face each other. Lockhart hurtles backwards down the platform, gets painfully to his feet, and beckons to Draco who steps forward. Looking worried, Lockhart passes Harry, and grim-faced, Harry and Draco approach each other, standing face to face. Draco glares, they salute each other, then turn and walk away. The watching students hold their breath in anticipation as Harry and Draco face each other along the platform. Harry is somersaulted backwards, and Draco smirks at his cronies as Harry scrambles up and points his wand, making Draco's smile fade. Draco is spun in the air, and as he crashes onto the platform, Snape hauls him to his feet and pushes him back towards Harry. Draco points his wand, and a large snake appears in front of Harry, uncoils itself, and moves towards him. Harry backs away, the snake flies into the air, then falls again, raising its head menacingly. Harry moves slowly towards it and starts to speak. The snake fixes its gaze on a boy in the crowd as Harry speaks again. The snake moves closer to the boy who backs away, and Harry speaks again. The snake turns its head, staring at Harry, closes its mouth, and is reduced to ashes. Harry frowns and looks around the hall to find everyone staring at him. Harry runs into the Gryffindor Common Room followed by Ron and Hermione, looks from one to the other, and in a classroom, students are working quietly at long tables. Harry looks up from his books to see two girls staring at him curiously, and he glances across at Ron and Hermione, who both give him an embarrassed smile. A group of students at another table look away quickly as he turns towards them.",
    "934": "As the gypsies walk the horses along a narrow track, one of them rears up, and they look up to see Holmes astride his pony on a higher track above them. They gallop after him, catching him up, and they follow him. It's getting dark as they arrive beside a lake, with a town sitting in the distance across the water. Holmes talks to Watson as they stand beside the horses, and Sim, Watson, and Holmes exchange nods before Holmes and Watson head up. They crouch low in the darkness as six armed guards march past, and once it's all clear, they get to their feet. Holmes pulls a face, and Watson takes the folded-up piece of paper from Holmes and sets off. Holmes crouches, takes another sheet of paper from his pocket, and starts to write. Across the complex, Watson lurks outside the closed telegraph office, glances around, then kicks the door in. At the munitions factory, Holmes climbs over a barred gate and leaps to the ground, while in the telegraph office, Watson pushes open a glass-paned door. Holmes scurries through the munitions factory yard and hides behind a wooden beam. People walk past the telegraph office, and Watson dons a cap and taps out the message given to him by Holmes. Holmes walks along the side of a row of wooden crates, passes a rack of large upright mortar shells, goes to a metal door, opens it, steps inside, stops, and stares at the room containing a number of worktables with machinery. He strolls through it, notices something, stops by a shell, screws open its tip, and lifts it up to find a glass container attached to the metal tip, containing a yellow liquid. Holmes sniffs it and puts it down, continues to wander through the machine room, and comes to another metal door with a glass window in it. He peers through it into a command center where an operations tabletop is covered with a map and models on blocks, including a model machine gun and a sniper rifle, and sees drawings of a semiautomatic pistol, a revolver, and an automatic light artillery gun. On the wall map, there is an image of a cannon times 35,500 and an image of a heavy gun times 15,000. Watson leaves the telegraph office and comes down the steps as Holmes enters another room. Holmes closes the door, walks across a balcony towards a metal rail, leans on the rail, and gazes down into the dark interior. In the dim light, he sees row upon row of artillery shells, and as the lights come on, he sees the full extent of the number of shells. Holmes turns to Moran and throws down his pistol.",
    "1247": "Andy goes in and leans on the desk and pokes her forehead, causing her face to brighten, and he reads her smile. In a huge clothes storeroom, made over and looking fabulous with her freshly fringed glossy hair and an elegant black jacket and trousers on, Andy strides past Serena and Emily and gets the phone while Emily glares at Serena. Nate leaves the restaurant he chefs in, pulls on his jacket, and heads down the street, walking straight past Andy, who is leaning against a car waiting for him. He stops and looks back, taking in her new look from top to toe, noticing the Chanel boots, the slinky jacket, the gold necklaces, the lipstick, and the sleek hairdo. Andy walks to the subway wearing a stylish green coat and shades, with white gloves on and a cute bag, and on another day, she walks the same route with a black coat on, an orange hat, and a different designer handbag. Now, she emerges from the subway in a white coat to match her beat cap with yet another desirable handbag on her shoulder. Andy runs into work across the foyer in heels and a chic black coat, her dark hair scooped up in a bun. Now, wearing a gorgeous flowing black outfit with knee-length boots and a long pendant necklace, Andy is arranging magazines on Miranda's desk when Miranda arrives and takes in Andy's outfit before continuing her call. Nate and Lily are in her restaurant, and there is a bag for Lily as Andy's mates giggle, and she walks out. Andy gets out of the back of a sleek black car and makes her way to a loft in a fashionable apartment building, rings the bell, then sashays down the hall in her black outfit with a big pendant necklace and approaches a sophisticated looking couple, who hand her a black portfolio. They go to the bar, where suave James hands her a glass, and a handsome curly-haired guy approaches Andy. Andy puts down her glass, smiles, and takes her leave, while Christian watches her go. Miranda is in her office going through James Holt's portfolio, wearing a crisp black suit and her shock of grey-white hair is expertly coiffured. In the anteroom, Emily points at Andy, who hurries into the office in a smart black mini dress with white colors and cuffs, while Miranda purses her lips at James' red dress. Leaving the showroom, Andy follows Miranda back at the office, dealing with the key as Emily approaches Andy's desk. A car drops Andy off, and Andy falters in the foyer as there are three closet doors to choose from, while various different tables in the foyer have flowers on them. Andy looks up the spiral staircase and sees the twins looking over the banister rail on an upper level.",
    "66": "The Clerk turns away abruptly and hauls down the northwest valley volume, opening it. It's huge and there's a lot to go through, and the print itself makes him squint. The book shows TRACT, LOT, PARCEL, and even a METES AND BOUNDS designation where the description of the land parcel is long and hopelessly involved, with descriptions like '6000 paces to Rio Seco, thence 7000 paces to Loma Linda, etc.' These descriptions are old and faded, but in the owners' column, there are numerous freshly typed names pasted over the prior owners. The Clerk turns sharply around, and Gittes looks a little surprised. The exasperated Clerk reaches around, rummages, and slaps a ruler on the desk. Gittes goes back to the stacks with the ruler, opens the book, and places the ruler not horizontally but vertically. Beside the OWNER column, he places the ruler, looks toward the clerks, then swiftly rips down the page, tearing out a strip about two inches wide containing the owner's name and property description. As he tears, he either sniffles or coughs to cover the sound of the paper being ripped. Amidst a hall of shimmering dust and heat, parched and drying groves, and narrower roads, Gittes parks at the edge of the field. He is hefted half off the ground by two younger Farmers who spin him around, going through his clothes, tossing his wallet, his silver cigarette case, etc. Gittes is badly banged up and half out on his feet, with his back to the Red Faced Farmer, leaning against the back of his car, breathing heavily. The Crippled Farmer pokes him rudely in the back with his crutch, causing Gittes to turn sharply and look up at the Red Faced Farmer. The paper's on the ground, and he picks it up. The Big Farmer takes a swing at Gittes, who kicks him squarely in the nuts, knees him in the jaw after he's doubled up, and hits him solidly. The Crippled Farmer takes careful aim and brings his crutch down on the back of Gittes' head, knocking him to the ground where he lies still beside the Big Farmer who is writhing in agony in the dirt. Gittes is staring down while lying in the screened-in porch of the farmers, with his wife, the Red Faced Farmer, the Big Farmer, and the dog present. He has dried blood down the side of his face from his nose, a huge mouse on his cheek, and his clothes are torn in a couple of spots. He looks out and says nothing. Evelyn is driving, and Gittes pulls out his cigarette case, takes one, and offers one to Evelyn, who refuses. It's almost evening. He pulls out the obituary column he'd folded up earlier in the day.",
    "794": "Willie and his companion knock back their drinks, and Willie puffs on his cigarette. She nods and looks at his glass, pours him another shot and then one for herself. They down them in one, and she gives him a coy look. Willie gets into his beaten-up old car. After the festive fornication, Willie leans against the car having a smoke, while she gets out and faces him. He half-smiles and nods, and she gives him a smile and heads off. Once she's gone, the moody-looking Indian guy from the bar runs over and shoves Willie, and Curly Head Fat Ass pulls Mr. Not Gay off Willie. Mr. Not Gay marches off into the night, and Willie catches his breath and turns to Fat Ass. Fat Ass turns to him. Sometime later, Willie gives Fat Ass a lift home in his knackered old car. Sitting in the passenger seat, the kid stares at Willie and smiles warmly, but Willie looks away. Apparently unmoved, the kid keeps staring at Willie. Willie turns off his engine and one working headlight, then gets out of the car with the kid. Willie admires the affluent suburban house they're in front of and frowns. As the kid unlocks the door, Willie pulls out a cotch and puts on a black balaclava. Inside, Grandma is watching a TV program featuring dancing fruit. Grandma walks past Willie, apparently unmoved by the fact that Santa is wearing a black balaclava. Willie turns to the kid, who nods. Willie pulls up his balaclava, opens a safe, and removes wads of cash and a passport, then shuts the safe and goes and sits down in an armchair. The credulous kid beams at him. Willie drives away in a very nice BMW. The next day at the mall, Bob, the manager, is doing his rounds and strolls through a woman's wear shop for larger ladies. Some noise emanating from the changing room catches his attention, and Bob decides to investigate. He looks under a cubicle door and sees a woman's feet and a man's feet behind them, with red Santa pants at his ankles. Marcus gives Bob a reproachful look and takes a candy from a jar on Bob's desk as he leaves. Later, Marcus wanders through a restaurant in the mall sipping a Coke and spots Willie putting the moves on a hot-bodied blonde at a pinball machine. Willie thrusts his crotch into the blonde. As he opens the car door, a pile of empties spills out, and he drives off, crashing them under his wheels. Bob is with Gin, the security chief, who eats an orange while Bob winces at the phrase.",
    "869": "Thenardier is down in the sewer and takes Marius' gold signet ring, putting it on. Valjean grabs Thenardier and shoves him down into the sludge, then gets up and hauls Marius onto his shoulder. With the unconscious Marius over his shoulder, Valjean wades up through the knee-deep sewerage as dim light filters through gratings above, washing over the curved brickwork. The sewerage gets deeper, and Valjean is up to his neck, holding Marius up next to him. He shoves a gate open and drags Marius through an outflow pipe into the dark night, where he looks up and sees Javert standing there waiting for him. Covered in sewerage, Valjean holds Marius onto his shoulder and climbs up steps out of the sewer while Javert aims a pistol at him. Valjean turns to Javert, who holds the pistol steady, considers, then turns and walks away. Wearing a troubled frown, Javert stares at the pistol for a moment, then drops it into the sewer and starts to walk away. Javert stands at the edge of a steep drop into a massive swirling sluice, paces at the edge, then leans forward and drops into the abyss, getting washed away into the swirling foam. Marius wakes in a clean bed beneath a ceiling painted with cherubs and angels, with a child's rocking horse nearby, and his grandfather sitting beside. Outside, women clean blood from the battle off the troubles. Marius sits alone in a room, scarred by battle, with his left arm in a sling, staring into space thoughtfully as tears fall from his eyes. He stands and looks around, his brow arched, and his face wracked with anguish. Cosette sits watching him, reaches out to him, and he limps over to her and takes her hand. Cosette walks with Valjean and the limping Marius into his grandfather's mansion as his grandfather watches. Cosette and Marius kiss, and Marius takes a seat in the spartan room with Valjean, who struggles for words, hangs his head, bows, and then Marius, his arm no longer in a sling but still walking with a limp, takes his leave. Valjean carries a large trunk out to a waiting carriage and grimaces in pain. Marius is with Cosette, and on the journey, he leans back in the carriage. On Cosette's wedding day, Thenardier and his wife hitch a ride on the back of a carriage arriving at the mansion, sneak around to the far side, climb inside, and exit through the opposite door as if they'd arrived in the carriage. Dressed finely, they mingle with the guests, stealing as they go.",
    "24": "Wide-eyed with apprehension, Carol looks at her mother, who nods permission for her to let it go, leading to a last defiant snort from Carol before she is overwhelmed. Carol breathes heavily, gaining control and stopping herself on the brink of crying. Slumped and fought out, Carol asks one last, naked husky voiced question, leading to a beat before he hands back the note deliberately. She takes it and walks back to the service area, embarrassed, confused, and messed with, and tosses the note. After Carol leaves, Melvin looks up, wary, as his brain sends a disturbing message. Carol enters the scene, then exits, as Frank prepares to depart and stumbles back, self-satisfied, relaxing. Frank adjusts and exits as she offers him the note, and Carol notes Melvin’s mood, pausing to look at him for a very strange, long beat before taking an old weekend case from the top shelf of the closet. She looks in another drawer, hesitating as if pondering one of the mysteries of the ages, talks to herself, and puts it back. Meanwhile, Melvin is in his bedroom with everything neatly stacked on the bed, waiting to be packed, including a camera. He checks each stack of underwear, socks, etc., four times and adds another check, as the phone rings. Melvin makes a little comment to himself as he moves, surprised by the call as he has almost no recent experience with receiving nighttime calls. As she picks up the phone, Melvin visibly relaxes. Frank starts to leave, but Simon stops him, and they embrace. As Frank moves off, Melvin sees Carol and his demeanor changes. Carol puts her bag in the car, and off they go, with Simon and Carol stunned by the manners as they turn onto Fifth. The camera follows Melvin going to a rack of carefully labeled CDs, while Carol chats away. Simon and Carol have thus declared their majority, and Carol, whose life has been rugged but basic, feels both strange and moved by Simon's complex trauma, which contrasts with her own meat and potatoes troubles. She looks out the window, kisses her fingers, and touches them to Simon’s cheek in a nice, understated gesture of friendship, visibly disturbing Melvin. Carol walks to Simon, puts an arm on him, gives him a kiss, and then turns to Melvin before exiting the room, leaving Melvin unnerved. Finally, Carol, dressed in a thrift shop find, enters the main room of the suite, hears the shower running, and sits down to wait.",
    "844": "She empties out a mini bottle and bites the top off another. Shaking his cup, she turns with a playful smile and sashays back and forth. Diana's smile quickly fades, and she sets down the drinks. Diana blinks her moist eyes. He points to her blue gingham blouse. Big Chuck tenses his face and nods. Diana glances off with a sweet smile as Chuck slowly removes his cowboy hat. He gazes into her eyes. She leaps on him. Sandy listens from the bathroom and rubs his face. Diana grips the bed as Chuck thrusts behind her. Sandy covers his ears. She falls onto her back. Sandy turns on the shower. Sandy ties a towel around his ears as Diana yanks on Chuck's neck with his belt. Now, she holds his legs from behind and bounces rapidly. Sandy buries his head in his hands. Lying on the floor, Sandy kicks the wall. Diana spots Big Chuck's wallet and car keys on a small table, and her smile fades. She finishes buttoning her shirt and glances back at the sleeping man. She notices Sandy's wallet and phone by the room key on the dresser. Stepping forward, she collects Sandy's things and grabs Big Chuck's belt off the floor. The plump criminal shifts in place. Sandy's eyes shoot open, and he pulls the towel off his head. Outside, she staggers away. Sandy yanks on the bathroom door handle. On the other side, Big Chuck's belt holds it closed. She crosses the quiet motel parking lot with a backpack in hand. Diana slings the bag over her shoulder, and it slides off as she arrives at Sandy's car. Sliding into the driver's seat, Diana tosses the bag into the next seat and places Sandy's phone in the center console. She leans forward and inserts the key into the ignition. Sitting back, Diana pulls a small amount of cash from Sandy's wallet and sifts through the bills. Grabbing Sandy's cell phone, she admires the photo of his smiling daughters. Diana holds the phone to her ear. Tensing her face, Diana fights back tears. The thief covers her eyes, then shifts her pained gaze around. Diana closes her eyes and places both hands on the wheel. Removing one, she rubs her forehead. Now, she enters the motel room and puts Sandy's belongings back on the dresser. Sandy crashes through the bathroom door. He quickly kneels. She moves across the room with the ice bucket and sets it on the bedside table. Taking off the backpack, Diana lies down next to Big Chuck. She takes all the blankets, revealing his naked rear end. Sandy stands up and eyes the room. The next morning, Sandy waits by the car as Diana approaches with sunglasses and disheveled hair.",
    "380": "Ahead lies a tiny one-street town, smaller even than Ashton, with powerlines emerging from the woods to feed it. Dangling from the line above are two dozen pairs of shoes, their laces tied together. The main street has stores on each side: Cole's Pharmacy, Talbot's Five and Dime, Al's Country Store. Everything is old, but this isn't a ghost town. A group of about 20 citizens spill out to see Edward approach; most are smiling, and all of these people are barefoot. A forty-year-old man named Beamen comes out of the seed store to greet Edward. Friendly but a little drunk, he's the closest thing the town has to a mayor, carrying a clipboard. Beamen checks the clipboard, still looking, still confused, until a helpful woman named Mildred chimes in. Beamen's daughter Jenny, eight years old, hides behind her father, peering around to look at the handsome stranger. He didn't mean it as a joke, but for some reason, everyone is laughing. Sitting at the kitchen table, Edward takes a second slice of apple pie. He and Beamen are joined by Norther Winslow, who fancies himself a cultured artist, though he's never left the state. Young Jenny is stealthily untying the laces on Edward's shoes. Suddenly, Jenny yanks off Edward's shoes and races for the door, with him chasing after her. As she runs, Jenny ties Edward's laces together. Reaching the edge of town, she tosses the shoes up and around the power line with a perfect throw. The gathered citizens of Spectre cheer for Edward, who is confused and overwhelmed. The women hug him, and the men shake his hand, all while he is still focused on his shoes. The townsfolk continue to congratulate Edward, and Norther grabs his notebook back. Edward looks to the bank, where young Jenny Hill is watching him, embarrassed to admit it. He starts to wade back to the bank and climbs onto the shore, completely drenched, pulling up his pant legs to reveal three shiny leeches clinging to his skin, eager to get off this subject. Lanterns and streamers hang on cables across the street, and a small stage has been built at one end to hold fiddlers. The whole town is there in celebration of its newest citizen, Edward Bloom. Before he can protest, two women grab him by the arms, pulling him in to dance with them. The resulting dance number seems both choreographed and complete chaos. From farmer to baker's wife, everyone wants to dance with Edward, who finds himself tossed around like a stick caught in a whirlpool, though he is having a blast. Jenny grabs both his hands, and they spin wildly until Beamen plucks his laughing daughter away to dance with her.",
    "274": "The Biker approaches, craning down as he draws near. As the crane descends, he momentarily disappears from view over the rise; then suddenly - ROAR - he tops the rise and, with wheels spinning, becomes airborne. He crashes back down to earth in the foreground and roars away. The scene shifts from the desert to a twilight street where the Arizona house is located. The roar of the Biker's engine and the clank of his chains recede as he gradually dissolves into thin air, leaving us looking at the empty street and the faraway Arizona house. Eerily beautiful singing, a woman singing a lullaby, emerges as the receding roar fades. Behind the singing, a droning high-pitched noise is faintly audible. The camera begins to float forward very close to the ground, slowly moving toward the Arizona house. The high-pitched drone becomes less faint under the singing, and the camera accelerates. The drone grows louder, revealing itself to be a human scream as the approach to the Arizona house shows a ladder propped up to a second-story window. As the speed of movement increases, the scream nearly buries the singing. The camera rushes to the house, toward the base of the ladder, drawn in by the sustained scream. Without slowing, it hurtles straight up the ladder, propelled forward by the deafening scream. Reaching the top, it crashes through the white curtains of the open second-story window into the nursery, revealing Florence Arizona with her back to us, screaming over the crib. The view rockets toward her as she turns, hands pressed to her ears, mouth stretched wide in an ear-splitting shriek, drawing in for an extreme close-up of her gaping mouth and wildly vibrating epiglottis. The scene suddenly changes as the scream is cut off. The singing previously covered by the scream becomes audible again. It is now morning, perspiration beads on Hi's forehead, as Ed walks back and forth, gently bouncing the baby and singing it a lullaby. Hi gets out of bed as the orange sun, rumbling, begins to rise perceptibly. The sun's rumble is abruptly snapped off by the high-pitched ba-WEEEEeeee of a strobe going off as a flash picture is taken. We see over Nathan Jr.'s shoulder as he stands at his open front door, facing a group of press people on the porch. An obie light over a local TV news camera glares in, and various flashbulbs pop.",
    "570": "Edgar drops the truck into gear and follows him, slowly, trolling along behind him. Zed's office is a circular, windowed room elevated above the main floor of MIB headquarters. Jay and Kay sit across the desk from Zed. There are five video monitors on a wall behind Zed's desk, and on each monitor is another Man in Black, in different parts of the world, the city name and a clock ticking in a corner of the image. While Zed talks, he goes through paperwork on his desk. Next to him, his computer screen beeps importantly. Zed looks over at it. Jay and Kay come out the front of MIB headquarters. Rosenberg, the jewelry store owner, steps out of a cab in the meat-packing district, still carrying the ornate box and his beloved cat. A moment later, the Orkin van pulls to a stop across the street. He heads into Leshko's, a Russian diner. Rosenberg comes into the tiny restaurant, squinting in the relative darkness. At a table in the middle, he sees a man eating alone—an enormous, dignified, yet profoundly strange-looking man in his mid-fifties. Rosenberg walks carefully over to the table, but does not sit down. He steps forward, to face Rosenberg, who sets the ornate box on the table. Rosenberg and the Arquillian stare at each other for a long moment—and then embrace each other. The embrace has an odd, formal quality to it, like mafiosi coming to a sitdown. They hold on, long and hard, and both seem choked with emotion. Finally, they break apart and take their seats. They speak in a bizarre alien tongue, which is subtitled. The driver hands over some documents. The guy digs out two other cards and hands those over. Mrs. Redgick is in front, moaning in pain, holding her swollen belly. Kay straightens up, fast. Mrs. Redgick screams again. Redgick gets out of the car, worried. Suddenly a tentacle whips out from between Mrs. Redgick's legs, cracks the whip once, and wraps around the door post, grabbing hold. Now a second tentacle whips out, but this one wraps around Jay's neck and pulls tight. Jay looks down at the creature cooing and nestling on his chest. It vomits on him. Back in the car, Jay wipes the last of the puke off his suit while Kay starts up the car. Close on various supermarket tabloids as a hand flips through them. Kay is furiously searching through the tabs; Jay is standing behind him, a little embarrassed. Kay pulls a copy of the Weekly World News from the stand and gives the guy a buck. He smacks the paper down on the hood in front of Jay, the pages turned open to a headline in typeface so large one would think it reserved for the Second Coming.",
    "668": "Down below, the hijacked car takes a right, gliding behind him and sending water into the air. Still, the police pursued the stolen car. Up above, Spider-Man is gaining on. He comes lower and lower until he can leap out of the roof of his uncle's car. He punches through it. Spider-Man grabs hold of the carjacker, who pulls a gun. As gunshots pepper the roof of the car, Spider-Man leaps up to the roof of a passing truck. Balancing on both feet, he keeps his eyes firmly on the stolen car, and a bridge moves ahead. Spider-Man vaults into the air, across the bridge, and lands back on the roof of the truck. Spider-Man throws himself onto the car's bonnet and punches through the windscreen. The car swerves, hits a bollard, then crashes into a set of iron gates. A posse of police cars builds up behind a smashed vehicle. The carjacker has made his escape from the vehicle and is creeping to a darkened warehouse, his gun held shakily in his left hand. As he reloads his piece, a shadow looms above his head. He's been surrounded. He shoots at the moving shadow. Trying to run from it, he fails to see Spider-Man lowering himself for a better look. At a locked door, Spider-Man catches up with him. He smashes the car thief's head into the glass panels on the door, then sends him flying across the room. The thief lunges with a knife, but Spider-Man kicks it from his grasp, knocking the balaclava off. Peter strides forward and grabs the man by the lapel. It's the thief from the arena. He remembers only too well letting the man pass and reflects on Uncle Ben lying on the ground, then backs away. The thief raises his gun and holds it to Peter's forehead. Peter knocks the hand away and twists the thief's arm, causing the gun to drop. The thief staggers back and trips. A police spotlight illuminates a second-floor window through which the thief has fallen. It moves down to pick out where he has landed face down. Peter gazes down from the darkness. The spotlight returns to the window, and his features lit up, Peter turns in horror. Police swarm all over the warehouse. They creep forward, guns held in one hand and torchlights in the other. They reach the window to find no one there. Peter is sitting with his elbows resting on his knees out in the open air, a light breeze ruffling his short dark hair, his face sad and his eyes moist. Around and beneath him, the lights of New York. He opens the front door of his home. Inside, sitting in the darkness is Aunt May, wrapped in her padded housecoat.",
    "698": "Peter looks up at the vertiginous tower as if he were at the bottom of a deep well, then tears the tattered, skin-tight black fabric across his chest. A slither of Symbiote falls onto Brock's shoulder, while above him, Peter continues tearing the unraveling Symbiote from his body. The slimy black Symbiote slithers off the ledge that Peter is on and snakes down the bell tower, where a globule lands in the palm of Brock's hand and spreads around him. As more lands on Brock's shoulder, it wraps itself around his body like ivy. Brock drops to his hands and knees, consumed by the black tendrils that push him to the floor as if he were stuck in a pool of tar. The Symbiote devours Brock’s face, and like a wild cat with jagged teeth, he lurches forward as Venom. Later in his room, Peter is in the shower with water streaming over his tightly closed eyes, and then they slowly open with a dead, vacant expression. A short time later, he’s sitting on his floor, lonely and leaning against the French windows. He trudges to the door and holds it, which comes off in his hand. He pries the door open with his fingertips as Aunt May looks around his shabby room. He puts the door knob down on a shelf and holds out the engagement ring, dropping it into her palm. He turns away from his aunt’s inquiring eyes and goes over to the French windows, his mournful face lit by a ghostly blue glow from the city outside. Aunt May puts the ring on the table, and Peter half-turns towards her. As she softly leaves the room, Peter turns his doleful gaze back to the window. In a skin-tight black Spider-Man-style suit, Venom swings through the city on web-like strands, only to be grabbed by Flint in an alleyway. Venom fights back and tosses Flint to one side. At night, Peter walks under the illuminated canopy of the theater across the street from Mary Jane’s apartment building, where he catches a glimpse of Mary Jane moving about her apartment in a lit top-floor window. His sorrowful blue eyes slowly fill with tears, and he bows his head and walks away. As Peter trudges off down the street, Mary Jane looks out of the window at the deserted corner where he was standing moments earlier. A short time later, she comes out of her apartment block in her waitress uniform and hails a cab. Meanwhile, armored vehicles are tossed aside like toys by bursts of sand, and Peter is in a crowd outside an electrical store, watching the TV coverage in wide-eyed shock.",
    "45": "Reggie sits on the floor of the booth, dialing, while an operator speaks into a headset. From the phone booth, Reggie peeks cautiously over the bottom of the window and sees, through the glass, Adam leaving the Sortie area. Carefully, Reggie opens the door and comes out, goes to the corner, and looks around it as Adam walks away from the camera down the platform. The camera pans to Reggie, peeking around the corner. She looks back once more at Adam, makes up her mind, and starts running towards the exit as the bell rings announcing the next train. Adam turns to look and sees Reggie, and this news hits her hard, causing her to stop in alarm. Reggie stands out in the open with the stamps in her hand, confused as to which man she should go to, looking at one, then the other, not knowing what to do, and stops in alarm. During the following, Adam looks around, seeking a way out, and moves out from behind the columns, creeping cautiously across the open space between the two colonnades and finally behind the second. As he aims carefully and fires, the bullet creases, and the deflected bullet rips the shoulder of his coat, leaving him unharmed. He wheels around with Carson in the background, who fires at him. Quickly, Adam peers back out and throws another shot. Seeing Carson otherwise occupied, Reggie turns and runs toward the open stage door of the Comédie Française behind her, including Carson, who, seeing Reggie running to the door, turns and fires at her, but he is too late as she is safely inside. Carson looks quickly back toward Adam, then takes off after Reggie. He runs to the door, tries it, and enters. As Carson enters the auditorium, he looks around while the camera sweeps the magnificent old theatre—boxes, seats, stage—but there is no sign of Reggie. Carson walks up the aisle checking between the rows of seats. Meanwhile, Adam appears in a large room lit by a single bare bulb under the stage, moving cautiously with his gun ready. He creeps along next to the wall, looking around at all the various scenic pieces filling the room. As Carson moves carefully across the darkened stage near the footlights, looking for Reggie, the camera pans down to his feet, only a few inches from the prompter's box. Inside, huddling down, is a terrified Reggie, holding her breath as she watches him. Carson moves into the opposite wings, sees the light board, and throws on all the switches, bathing the stage in light, then returns to the stage.",
    "1215": "The men in the boat wear burnt orange robes and have shaved heads. The boat's motor churns up plumes of white foam on the river as Rambo steers at the tiller. The boat enters more populated territories, where there are wooden homes on the riverside and harbors made of timber. A building on the riverside features a sign with a large painting of a cobra on the wall and a Red Cross sign. The boat pulls in at a harbor where two men stop what they're doing and turn their attention to the boat: one man wears a white t-shirt and a black hat, the other a blue shirt and a bandanna. The boat slows to a halt as Rambo and his men disembark, with Rambo bearing a doleful and weary expression. The sun casts an orange glow on the river water. Surrounded by onlookers, a young snake-charmer crouches alone in an open area facing two cobras, one of which rears and strikes at the dark-haired wrangler. A snake merchant approaches Rambo and gives him cash, while Rambo's men are nearby. Rambo walks away in disgust, heads for the perimeter of the arena, and empties a bag containing the cobra into a wooden crate. A group of Westerners arrive, led by Michael, who has thinning hair, and a blonde girl, Sarah. Michael greets and talks to the merchant, who points to Rambo, as Rambo maneuvers a cobra into the crate and slams down the lid. In the arena, the wrangler teases a cobra while Rambo stands near wire and wood snake cages as Michael and his party approach. Rambo throws a rat into one of the cages and scratches his face idly. Michael seems temporarily lost for words, and Rambo leaves. Michael turns to his party, and Sarah, who is in her mid-20s, pretty with blonde, scraggly hair and a high forehead, follows Rambo out. Rambo is washing his face and hair in a water barrel, then picks up a towel, wipes his face, and hangs the towel on a hook. He walks up to Sarah and fixes her with a firm stare before walking away. He toils alone in a darkened workshop where the only light comes from sunlight outside and the flames of the fire. Using a hammer, he forges a piece of broken steel on an anvil, its end orange and white with heat, then wipes an arm across his sweaty brow as his blows on the steel become more intense. In the darkness, save for the glow of headlights on jeeps and beams from hand torches, the army drags people from their homes and marches them away at gunpoint under the supervision of the cigarette-smoking commander.",
    "1335": "Bullets fly, and every few moments another cannon ball smashes into the piled debris. The big gun has been lined up with the gate and has burst right through in the first hit. Enjolras and the students throw themselves onto the barricades, firing at the attackers, handing their rifles down to others to be re-loaded, firing again. The hard core of student fighters retreat, firing as they go, into the Café Musain. Marius takes a bullet, and crumples and falls. Valjean runs towards him - CRASH! The latest cannonade bursts a hole in the barricade and now the soldiers are storming through. Students driving back the pursuing soldiers hack away at the staircase, smashing it to fragments - the soldiers below fire up at them - students fall, their bodies caught on the jagged remnants of the stairs. Students and soldiers fight in the café, on the stairs, up the stairs to the upper room. The students' ammunition has run out, they're hurling sticks and bottles - but the soldiers have found a way to clamber up, shooting as they come, and one by one the students are falling. Valjean has Marius in his arms and is hiding him from the onrush of the soldiers. Valjean carries Marius away from the carnage. The soldiers break through at last to the upper room, to find there's only Enjolras still alive. He stands by the window, knowing he will die now, proud and unafraid. Seeing him, the soldiers hesitate. Javert draws his pistol and holds it to Valjean's head. Valjean meets his eyes. He moves up from the embankment onto the bridge. He begins to move away along the embankment, up steps, towards a bridge. He's unaware of everything except the turmoil in his brain. He climbs up onto the parapet, reaching his arms up to the night sky. Here he stands, looking down at the dark water of the night river. The Seine forms a whirlpool here, where violent currents swirl around the piles of the bridge. He reaches higher, turning his body, twisting, as if he wants some angel from on high to save him - and so, turning, he falls into the river. The swirling eddies close over him. And he's lost. Women move about the street, seeking their dead loved ones among the bodies that still litter the barricade. These are both the middle-class mothers of the students - Enjolras's mother, Grantaire's sister - and the working women of the slums for whom they died, united now in their grief. Slowly he rises from the chair and turns to the doorway. There stands Cosette, waiting for him. Cosette holds Marius, supporting him, as he enters the house.",
    "1309": "He sits as thoughts crash at his head. He finally reaches for the keys and starts up the car. He looks into the rearview mirror and sees the man in the green army jacket pass behind his car. Elijah quickly turns and sees the man moving through the parked cars heading out of the parking lot. Elijah takes a deep breath and turns off the engine. The figure in the army jacket seems to move farther away with every step. Elijah starts breathing harder. He pushes himself to move faster. He avoids the hard chrome bumpers and tailpipes that jut out from the cars as he quickens his pace through the lot. He gains on the army jacket. The man in the army jacket turns as he reaches a subway entrance that marks the end of the parking lot. He disappears into the subway entrance. Elijah quickens into a jog now. He hasn't done this in a while and it's painful. He makes it with great strain to the subway. He looks into the entrance. A steep flight of stairs leads to the subway floor. The tail of the army jacket is glimpsed before it disappears. Elijah breathes hard as he takes hold of the railing. Elijah starts his descent. Elijah has to move fast. He takes the steps with less and less hesitation. He's moving with great agility. and then his foot catches on a step. His hand slips away from the railing. He falls down the remaining part of the stairs. He comes to a stop in a pile on the dirty gum-stained floor of the subway landing. His jaw is locked in a. His contorted anguished face sees the turnstiles of the subway upside down. The green army jacketed man looks back at Elijah with a blank expression pushing through the turnstile. The last thing Elijah sees before he blacks out is the tail of the man's coat riding up as he moves through the turnstile. The silver handle of a gun peeks out from the belt of his pants. David's neighborhood turns crimson as the day comes to an end. The Septa bus pulls to a stop in front of a public high school. David steps off, still in his security clothes. David turns to the high school football field behind him. A group of children are having a touch football game. Joseph runs out from the huddle across the field to David. Joseph nods. David looks to the fields to see a very muscular college-age man in sweats who stands with the other children. David stares at his son. David watches the cornerback being surrounded by kids. He's letting a couple of the kids feel his flexed bicep.",
    "288": "The brick is weather-worn and faded. Each apartment has three windows facing the back, one showing a hallway, one a living room, and the window on the right opening into a bedroom. He sets down the case heavily, removes his hat, and slowly wipes his brow with the back of his right hand. He takes off his coat and tie. With his eyes still focused on the distant apartments, Jeff continues talking with Gunnison. His shirt is stained with sweat underneath. He rolls up his sleeves, and his well-muscled arms heavy with hair confirm his dark, husky build. The man enters the bedroom. The woman sits up as the man enters. She takes a wet cloth off her forehead. Before the man even reaches her, she begins talking, somewhat vigorously. We can see a woman lying on the far bed. Near her, a small table is covered with medicine bottles, spoons, boxes of pills, a water pitcher, and the other impedimenta of the chronically ill. The man stops short of the bed, makes gestures of trying to placate her, but she goes on scolding. He hangs up and resumes his attention on the apartment of the salesman. The salesman looks toward the bedroom door, hesitates, then reluctantly walks toward it. He shouts back at her, turns and goes out of the room. His attitude changes to weary patience, then irritation, then anger. For a moment he is hidden by the wall. Jeff shifts his look more to the right. Jeff's attention is suddenly diverted to himself. His leg, under the cast, begins itching. He squirms, tries to move the leg a little. He scratches the outside of the cast, but the itch gets worse. It gives no relief. He reaches for a long, Chinese back scratcher lying on the windowsill. Carefully, and with considerable ingenuity, he works it under the cast. He scratches, and a look of sublime relief comes over his face. Satisfied, he takes the scratcher out. As he replaces it on the windowsill, his attention is drawn back to the scene outside the window. We see the man who left his apartment in anger come out of the doorway into the backyard. He is easy to identify through the color of his garish necktie. In one hand the man carries a small garden hoe and rake, and in the other a pair of trimming shears. He goes to a small patch of flowers, perhaps three feet square. They are beautiful, multi-colored three foot high zinnias. Jeff's attention is turned to something else of interest. Into the next door yard we see emerging from the apartment below the ballet dancer, the elderly lady. Her skin is dead white, and her body is thin to the point of emaciation.",
    "116": "Keyes puts the glass down noisily on Norton's desk, and with the doorknob in his hand, Keyes turns back to Norton with a glance down at his own shirt sleeves before they go out. The corridor door opens, letting light in as Neff enters with his hat on and his briefcase under his arm. He switches the lights on, closes the door, puts the lights on, closes the door, and puts the key in his pocket. He picks up the phone; Phyllis is on the phone and is not dressed as in Norton's office. He hangs up, takes off his hat, and drops the hat and briefcase on the davenport. Neff looks around the room and crosses to lower the venetian blinds and draw the curtains. He gathers up the morning paper lying untidily on the floor and puts it in the waste-paper basket. The doorbell rings, and Neff stops in sudden alarm. For a second, he stands motionless, then crosses to the door and opens it. In the open door stands Keyes, who walks past him into the room with his hands clasped behind his back and a strange, absent-minded look in his eyes. Neff closes the door without taking his eyes off Keyes. Keyes stops in the middle of the room and turns, prods his stomach with his thumb, and has stopped in front of Neff. They look at each other for a tense moment; Neff hardly breathes. Keyes shakes his head suddenly, prods his stomach again, and resumes his pacing. Finally, Keyes continues and goes on pacing up and down. Finally, Neff can't stand the silence any longer, crosses to the corridor door, and puts his hand on the knob to open the door. The hallway is empty except for Phyllis, who has been standing close to the door of Neff's apartment, listening. The door has just started to open when Phyllis moves away quickly and flattens herself against the wall behind the opening door. Keyes is coming out, and Neff, behind him, looks anxiously down the hallway for Phyllis. Suddenly his eye catches a glimpse of her through the crack of the partly opened door, and he pushes the door wide to hide her from Keyes. He pushes the call button and turns, then pulls back the elevator door and turns to Neff with one last glance of annoyance. She moves toward him, but he does not respond; instead, he pulls her close and kisses her. Meanwhile, two telephone operators and a receptionist are at work, several visitors are waiting in chairs, and among them is Lola Dietrichson, wearing a simple black suit and hat, indicating mourning. Her fingers nervously pick at a handkerchief, and her eyes are watching the elevator doors anxiously.",
    "1342": "Marius rushes down the street, with Eponine following, towards the walled garden behind which lies Valjean's house. Cosette sees Marius and comes up the garden path towards him, holding the wrought-ironwork of the gate with both hands while keeping her eyes on Marius. Marius wraps his hands around Cosette's as Eponine looks on and suffers. Valjean comes to the door, goes to the gate, and opens it. Eponine screams, and Valjean, now in his own bedroom, hears the scream and turns to the window. Thenardier and his gang shrink into the shadows as Eponine's scream finally ends. Valjean comes back to Cosette and then runs into her room, taking her in his arms before leaving to start packing. Feverishly, Cosette scribbles a letter, hurries down the garden to the gate, and places the folded letter in the grill where her and Marius' hands entwined. Eponine steps forward, opens the letter, reads it, and hides it in her pocket. She stands outside Marius' door as Marius looks up from inside. Marius is by the empty house, and we see an intercut between Eponine at the gate, Cosette and Valjean in the carriage, and Marius in the dark garden. Grantaire is downstairs flirting with a barmaid, while Madame Hucheloup, the proprietress of the Cafe Musain, sews a red revolutionary flag to help the students. Javert is briefing a hundred uniformed police about the coming day in a grand ornate old room at Police Headquarters. Monsieur and Madame Thenardier are in the ground-floor bar, slyly watching a student smuggle rifles upstairs disguised as a piece of cloth. Grantaire rather reluctantly goes upstairs, where Enjolras and the students have a production line underway for making bullets. Marius enters the ground floor, takes the red flag from Madame Hucheloup, who has just finished sewing it, as Joly collects empty tankards on a tray. As Joly ascends the stairs, Madame Hucheloup tries to get him to give the tankards back, but Joly starts to melt the tankards in a pot to make more bullets. Marius enters the first floor to join them at last. Valjean and Cosette arrive at their new hideout, while Marius ties the red flag onto a flagpole. Javert is seen in the police station addressing his men, as we pull back from Enjolras and Marius holding their flag at the first floor window with the students beyond them to see that citizens have spilled out of the Cafe Musain into the street and have all joined in the final chorus. Now into view come the leaders of a great funeral procession, followed by an entire battalion of infantry marching with weapons reversed, and a division of cavalry rides in front, behind a section of military drummers who drum a military tattoo.",
    "325": "In the late afternoon sun, a scene gleams green, gold, and silver. Beyond the river, the land appears flat and empty, formless and vague, until it rises far away like a dark and dreary wall. The sun on Lothlorien cannot enlighten the shadows beyond, where one steps onto a wide fleet filled with a soft light, where the walls are green and silver, the roof is gold, and in its midst is the trunk of the mighty Mallorn tree, tapering toward its crown. Celeborn steps forward to greet the guests. His hair is long and silver, his face grave and beautiful, with no sign of age. Next to him stands Galadriel, the Lady of the Elves, with hair of deep gold and timeless, unsurpassed beauty. Frodo looks at Galadriel standing silently beside Celeborn. Moonlight catches the trace of tears on Boromir's face as Galadriel's eyes settle on Sam. Gimli, Legolas, Merry, Pippin, Frodo, and Sam are in a pavilion set among the trees near the fountain. They lie on soft couches as Elves leave food and wine for them. Aragorn kneels beside Boromir, who looks at Aragorn in despair. Boromir feels Aragorn's love for Minas Tirith and takes heart. Aragorn returns Boromir's smile, betraying his disquiet sadness only when Boromir looks away. The Fellowship is asleep on their beds. Bare feet tread soundlessly across the lawn, and Frodo's eyes flicker open, as if by instinct. Galadriel, her white dress glowing in the moonlight, glances at him. Frodo follows her as if drawn by an invisible force. Upon a low stone pedestal carved like a branching tree sits a shallow silver basin. Galadriel pours water into the basin from a silver jug, and a glow rises from the water. Frodo slowly steps up to the pedestal and peers into the glossy surface, where the night sky is reflected. Frodo leans closer to the mirror's surface and gasps, his face lighting up with hope. Galadriel looks at Frodo intensely. Frodo looks down, clutching the ring in his hand, and then looks up at Galadriel, who suddenly seems to rise in stature before his eyes, making him afraid. Galadriel suddenly laughs, a slender Elf-woman once more, clad in simple white, her voice soft and sad. Frodo realizes what her message is. The Ring lies in the palm of Frodo's hand, and his fingers close over it. Meanwhile, naked, Lurtz's eyes follow Saruman, alight with a mean intelligence. The Uruk-Hai are smearing themselves in white paint in a creepy ritualistic ceremony, marking bodies, faces, and armor with the white hand of Isengard. Lurtz is quickly armored with a breastplate, leg guards, and helmet, and a sword is thrust into his hand. Saruman addresses a crowd of 200 fully armed Uruk-Hai.",

Camille shoots the general's guards and kicks one so hard he flies over a railing. The general gets off the hostess. Camille rips off her shirt and stands ready in a stroppy white top as Green bounds up the stairs. He places his German friend as armed guard, enters the general's room, and the hostess, hands bound, runs for the door, but is batted aside by Camille, who is then attacked by the general. He knocks the gun from her hand and slaps her. Bond runs upstairs and is aimed at by Green's man just as the compound's main fuel cells erupt, engulfing the meeting area in flames and flying glass. The German is consumed in the fire, but Green runs up the stairs, pursued by Bond. Bond is above Green on the flat glass roof and fires down, causing the glass to disintegrate. He drops back into the building, and Green attacks with a metal bar. Bond drops his gun, and Green grabs an ax from a fire point and flails wildly at Bond. The general has Camille by the throat, pulls off the edge of the floor they are on, and dangles in space, with Bond holding him by the hair. Camille struggles desperately under her attacker, grabs his groin, and kicks him in the face. She dives for the gun and breathes deeply, while Bond hauls Green back up by the hair and dumps him on the floor just as fire falls through the ceiling. Bond runs to her aid as Camille sits crouched in terror, with fire and masonry falling around her. The building is collapsing as Bond tries to reach her. He spots her through the flames, puts his arms around her as the ceiling continues to crack with fire and falling rubble. Bond holds her tightly, spots the gun and picks it up, while her eyes are wide with terror, and he is about to kill them. A burst exposes a fuel cell in the wall, and the blast takes out the whole side of the building. Green has got clear, and Bond watches him go as he and Camille clamber down the rubble, dragging his injured foot. A plume of dust appears in the barren, empty desert. Bond is behind the wheel of a car. He stops, gets out, flings Green to the ground, pulls a can of oil from the trunk, and Green stares down at the can and at the car as it drives away across the vast, empty expanse.",
    "497": "Cole just closes his eyes and holds his mom tight. We are in an antique store filled floor to ceiling with furniture and knickknacks. Anna stands with a young couple, and all three lean over and peer into a glass cabinet where an antique engagement ring sits on a velvet stand. The young woman looks at her beau, and she places it in their hands. The young woman looks at Anna with great intrigue, while the young man throws an odd glance at his fiancée. The young man and the young woman gaze at Anna silently before they look down at the ring. Anna moves to the back desk where Sean comes out carrying an antique bench in his arms, places it down, and takes a much-needed seat. Anna looks over to find Sean standing at his desk where a birthday present sits on his tabletop. Sean looks at her. Malcolm looks up sharply. Cole is crying now during a long pause as they both just stare. Cole searches for the answer in Malcolm's eyes, then pushes it across the table. Malcolm gazes at it, then looks up at Cole's pained eyes. Malcolm sits stoically at his desk in his basement, leans his head back against the chair, and stares into the shadows. Malcolm's eyes scan the room and come to a stop on a box marked with the label. A tape slides into the tape player seated on Malcolm's desk, and Malcolm's eyes are locked on the spool of audio tape as it spins in the player. Malcolm's fingers move to the volume dial, turns it way up, and the static noise from the tape fills the basement. Cole holds up his plastic rifleman, and Malcolm's eyes show he understands now. Malcolm glances around the empty church before looking back up at Cole, who looks nervous. Cole and Malcolm stand silently in the center aisle at the back of the church, and Malcolm moves around the corner on his street. His mind surges with thoughts, and then he glances up. His steps slow to a complete stop. Further down the sidewalk, coming out of the front door of his house is Sean. Malcolm's face turns to stone as he watches Sean come down the front stairs and start across the street. Malcolm moves towards Sean fast, but Sean reaches his car and enters it. Sean pulls away into traffic, almost hitting another car as he does, and Malcolm watches the car disappear down the next street. Malcolm turns and looks up at his home with unchecked anger and overwhelming pain erupting in his eyes. Cole quickly gets up and rushes out of the tent. He stumbles out. A table with a sewing machine fills the other side of the room.",
    "304": "The fellas crack up, and they all mutter equivalents as Joe stands up. Mr. Blonde shoots Mr. White with his finger, and everybody whips out a buck, throwing it on the table, except Mr. Pink. Everybody laughs, and they all laugh repeatedly while Mr. Pink rubs two of his fingers together. Joe comes back to the table as Mr. Orange screams, lying in the backseat, having been shot in the stomach with blood covering him and the backseat. Mr. White, behind the wheel of the getaway car, although driving for his life, keeps talking to his wounded passenger in the backseat, and they are the only two in the car. The door swings open, and Mr. White carries the bloody body of Mr. Orange inside, who is still moaning loudly from his bullet hit. Mr. White lays him down upon a mattress on the floor, and Mr. Orange looks up at his friend. Mr. White then gets Mr. Orange in a headlock as Mr. Blonde sits on a counter, drinking a fast food coke and eating a hot dog. Mr. Pink sees Mr. Orange on the floor, shot and bloody, and Mr. Orange lays his head back on the mattress. The two men end up on the floor kicking and scratching as the camera creeps along a wall to a corner where a bathroom lies at the end of the hall. Mr. Pink is obscured, but Mr. White is in view, and he turns to leave. Guns are firing, people shouting and screaming, sirens wailing as Mr. Pink tries to open the driver's side door, but it's locked. The shocked woman starts screaming, and Mr. Pink exits the frame, leaving Mr. White alone. The men share a laugh as we follow behind him up to Mr. White, standing over Mr. Orange, and as he gets closer, he sees Mr. Orange is out. Mr. White stands up, walks over to a table, and Mr. Pink reaches in his jacket for his gun, pulling it out. Mr. White sees this, immediately lets go of Mr. Pink, and goes for his weapon, resulting in the two men with their guns outstretched, aiming at one another. Mr. Blonde looks at his two partners in crime as Mr. White explodes, raising his gun and charging towards Mr. Blonde, but Mr. White calms down and puts his gun away. Mr. Blonde stops moving, heads for the door while the other two men just follow him with their eyes, and then walks out, heading towards the car he drove, with Mr. White and Mr. Pink walking behind. In the background, what looks like an office is set up.",
    "217": "Pappy is considering the crowd, and he drops one arm around Everett and the other around Delmar. Everett hesitates, uncertain of what is happening, while the band beams and Delmar leans into Everett with worry. Delmar gives Everett a meaningful look, which Everett considers for a moment. Pappy returns a considered appraisal. On the steps of the meeting hall, people stream out of the concert into the warm summer night. Everett, now relieved of his beard, is walking down the steps with Penny and raises her left hand with his own to display their wedding bands, but her finger is bare, and she walks off. His attention, along with everyone else's, is drawn to a street procession where a crowd carrying torches jogs behind a man in clanking leg irons and wrist manacles escorted by four policemen with nightsticks in riot-ready formation. Everett and the Soggy Bottom Boys descend the steps to meet the oncoming criminal, and Delmar cries out. It is George Nelson, grinning despite his heavy restraints, and as he passes, he turns to call back over his shoulder. Delmar, smiling, shakes his head as he watches him go. In the blackness, we hear snuffling getting louder and closer. Inside a cupboard, a snout noses the door open. As the door swings wide, light reveals several neatly stacked tins of Dapper Dan pomade next to a bunch of tangled hairnets. Everett, Pete, Delmar, and Tommy walk through the woods and emerge into a clearing where a cabin stands before them. Two shotgun-wielding goons fall in behind them and push them forward, revealing next to an oak tree three freshly dug graves with rough pine coffins at the far lip of each grave. The sheriff with mirrored sunglasses, Cooley, steps off the porch with a drooling hound at his heels. The goons shove them toward the tree, and three shirtless black gravediggers with bandannas round their necks emerge from the graves and look to Cooley for guidance, as does the drooling hound. The goons recover their leering grins and resume their task while the gravediggers stand next to the graves, leaning on their shovels, with sweat glistening on their faces like tears. Cooley gives a faint smile, and Delmar bows his head to silently pray, followed by Everett. The singing of the gravediggers begins a mournful swell, and the song, seemingly rising from the earth itself, is supported by a palpable bass.",
    "1002": "Gatsby surveys the scene and stands, resting on a cane, as he looks at the clock on the mantelpiece and then at his watch. The clock has a robust, angular dark wood surround. Gatsby paces, undoes a button on his white jacket, and sits, frowning. Nick sits, looking quite relaxed, while Gatsby freezes and breathes tensely. Nick goes to look out of the window as a car comes up the drive, prompting him to hurry outside, holding an umbrella. Grey-faced, Gatsby sits with a newspaper. The driver puts down a rug, and Daisy steps out of the car onto it, wearing blue and gold shoes, a flouncy purple and pale blue dress with frills, and a matching hat. Daisy walks in and checks her immaculately bobbed blonde hair in a mirror, looks into the room full of flowers, and walks into the room amazed while Nick waits in the hall, looking unsure. Nick walks into the room to find Daisy admiring the orchids and, confused, looks to the chair and the window, noticing that the French windows are ajar. Nick smiles at Daisy, who hands him her hat. He goes to the front door and finds Gatsby outside, soaked through. With a steely-eyed, determined look, Gatsby marches into the cottage, stops in the hall to smooth back his hair, and walks into the flower-filled room to stop for a moment and look at Daisy, who turns sharply and sees him. They gaze at each other across the room, with Daisy's chest heaving as she breathes deeply, her eyes appearing glazed, looking entranced. Gatsby steps forward and regards her with an earnest expression as Nick watches from the hall, wide-eyed. Daisy continues to gaze at Gatsby, dewy-eyed, and they both nod slightly. Later, the kettle boils, and Nick carries a tray with a shiny silver tea set into the room. As he pours tea, Daisy sits on a couch while Gatsby stands leaning against the mantelpiece where the wooden clock sits. Nick finishes pouring tea through a strainer, and he and Daisy exchange furtive and nervous looks. Gatsby steels himself, turns to Daisy smiling, but accidentally knocks the clock off the mantelpiece, breaking it. He tries to push the bit that broke off back in place but finally gives up and sits across the coffee table from Daisy, resting his chin on his hand. Nick stands between Gatsby and Daisy, handing them cups of tea, then sits on the couch next to Daisy as they all look rather uncomfortable. Nick stares into space, while Daisy and Gatsby steal the occasional glance at each other. Suddenly, Nick springs to his feet, and on the porch, Gatsby holds up a hand.",
    "3": "The Colonel grabs him by the collar and glances toward the window, where Jane peeks out from behind the drape and quickly pulls it shut. Suddenly, deeply shamed, the Colonel stands, still breathing heavily, and leaves. Ricky gets up, goes to his bureau, and looks at his reflection in the mirror. He calmly takes a cloth and starts to wipe the blood from his face. Meanwhile, Carolyn, wearing protective headgear, is holding a Glock 19 automatic revolver with both hands and firing it directly at us. She empties a round and stands there, exhilarated, as an attendant approaches with a new round of ammunition, and she starts firing again. Her face loses its usual resolute determination; she is actually enjoying herself spontaneously, and the lack of her usual self-consciousness allows us to see just how beautiful she is. The Glock 19 sits on the passenger seat amid some CDs as the Mercedes turns onto Robin Hood Trail and we turn into the Burnham driveway, where a 1970 Pontiac Firebird with racing stripes blocks our access to the garage. The room seems changed: sloppier, more lived in. Lester is sprawled on the couch in his underwear, drinking a beer and controlling the car, as his remote-controlled model jeep zooms across the floor of the family room, expertly maneuvering corners and narrowly avoiding crashing. She just stands there, staring at Lester, whose working out is beginning to produce results. He smiles at her playfully with the same look she had at the beginning, when he dropped his briefcase, but whatever power that look had is gone. Lester just laughs, and his face is close to hers, suddenly charging the atmosphere. She pulls back automatically, but it's clear she's drawn to him as he smiles and moves even closer, holding his beer loosely balanced. Then, just before their lips meet, she's immediately sorry she said it, but it's too late; his smile fades, and the moment is gone. He stands and gestures toward all the things in the room. Carolyn stares at him, on the verge of tears, then turns and walks out of the room before he can see her cry. Jane lays in Ricky's bed, wearing a tank top, and glances at us. We're watching the wide-screen TV in Ricky's room, where a cord leads from the TV to Ricky's digicam. Ricky holds the camera, standing naked, and aims his camera at Jane as she gets out of bed, takes his digicam, and focuses it on him. We see his image on the TV as she videotapes, and Jane zooms in on his face, which remains placid. Ricky smiles and grabs a half-smoked joint from an ashtray and lights it.",
    "884": "Lizzie makes her way over to Charlotte, and he shows her into a room where Charlotte and Lizzie are left alone again. Charlotte takes Lizzie into the drawing room and walks over to the window. Later, Lizzie is sitting reading in her room when Maria rushes to look out the window at a carriage that's arrived. The party is later making its way up a wide path leading to a majestic mansion with elegantly manicured gardens. Lady Catherine is holding court in her drawing room, sitting on an ornate, throne-like chair, and looks at Lizzie, who is squashed between Maria and Sir William on a sofa. Lady Catherine raises one eyebrow and turns her attention to Charlotte, and as she turns to Lizzie, her smile fades and she glares fiercely. Maria, Charlotte, and Lizzie are shown walking outside in the gardens, in the house, Darcy rises from his seat, comes to stand over Lizzie, makes no effort to make any further inquiries, and strides slowly and pointedly over to the window, where he stands with his back to the room. Lizzie looks at Fitzwilliam as Darcy turns to look at her and smiles, but then Darcy turns back to the window, poker-faced. It's a bright, sunny day with the wooded green fields of the English countryside stretching out to the horizon, as Lizzie wanders alone taking in the sumptuous view. She idly pats the trunk of a large tree as she passes by, continues on under the shady canopy of leaves, and stares up into the branches that shield her from the sun's glare. Darcy, riding his horse through the woods, is a picture of elegance in his top hat and frock coat, and upon spying Lizzie, brings his horse to a halt, never taking his eyes off her. Lizzie stops, nonchalantly crossing her arms in front of her, staring up defiantly at Darcy, who looks awkward and kicks his horse on. They set off down the avenue of trees at a trot, as Lizzie watches them, not quite knowing what to make of the encounter. Later, Fitzwilliam sits with Lizzie as she plays the piano, while in an adjoining room, Lady Catherine is listening, with Darcy, Charlotte, and Maria sitting on a sofa near her. Darcy goes in to join Lizzie and Fitzwilliam, and they share an intense gaze. At the sound of the front doorbell, Lizzie sets down her pen, gets up from the writing table, and checks that her hair is straight as the maid shows Darcy in. He bows stiffly, the maid curtsies and leaves the room, and Lizzie takes a seat. A rather awkward silence ensues between them, with neither quite able to look the other in the eye, until eventually, Darcy pulls out a chair and sits down.",
    "101": "She looks up at the sky, where the moon shines above. Forrest lies in a hammock on his boat, then stands at the helm and slowly glides by the docks. Noticing something, he bends down for a clearer view as Lt. Dan sits in his wheelchair on the deck. Forrest looks at Lt. Dan and smiles, surprised, while the boat glides and crushes a dock, which they both look at. Forrest's shrimping boat is alone on the gulf waters, and Forrest looks up to see Lt. Dan sitting in the rigging. Later, Forrest empties the net, while an all-black gospel choir sings and claps their hands. Lt. Dan sits at the back of the church, taking swigs from a liquor bottle. A catch of junk is dumped onto the deck as Lt. Dan lowers himself from the rigging. The wind starts to blow strong, water sprays on deck during a hurricane, and Lt. Dan shouts and shakes his fist from the rigging as wind and rain pelt him. Forrest slides back and forth as he tries to steer the boat. An anchorman on TV stands in front of a ruined pier and boats, while Forrest's boat comes down the river. Lt. Dan and Forrest empty their net, and a huge catch of shrimp falls onto the deck. They continue to open catch after catch, culminating in a huge haul, making both Forrest and Lt. Dan smile. A man sitting on a bench listens to Forrest recount this story as an elderly woman sits beside him. The man laughs and walks away, and the woman looks at both the magazine and Forrest with surprise. Forrest and Lt. Dan are seen working on the boat, and despite Forrest's mild surprise, Lt. Dan smiles and looks away before pulling himself out of his chair, jumping into the water. The television shows an assassination attempt on President Gerald Ford as Forrest and Lt. Dan have dinner on the deck. Forrest opens the door to find a doctor standing next to Mrs. Gump in bed, and the doctor looks down at Forrest's legs before leaving and closing the door. Forrest takes off his hat and steps over to her. Back with the elderly woman, she and Forrest sit as she cries, wiping her eyes with a hankie. A bus stops, and Forrest looks at her. Forrest rides a lawn tractor over the football field lawn, takes out a letter, and opens it while the choir and members sing. New furniture is taken inside, and a new cross is placed on the steeple.",
    "79": "A barn is in the background as the sun rises. In the same position, John awakes. He and Rachel, who lie huddled in calm sleep, get up and start into the kitchen, watching a moment. They head for the stove where Rachel places her gun beside it, ready to hand, and picks up a coffee pot while John puts kindling in the stove. John looks at her for a moment. They look towards a sound as two troopers are shown, with sirens loud as they rapidly approach Rachel's house. Without her gun and holding John's hand, Rachel comes down to the fence. Meanwhile, the other children hurry out of the house behind them. The car brakes as the troopers, fanning wide, advance towards the barn. Rachel and the children are grouped a short distance behind as the barn door appears black. After a short pause, a preacher appears. The troopers close in on the preacher from before and behind, just as they did for Ben's arrest, with the same sickly look as at Ben's arrest. One trooper smacks the back of the preacher’s head with a pistol barrel, and the doll he is holding bursts open, spilling money over him. Two troopers gently lift John away, and Rachel lifts him in her arms and turns towards the house, carrying him as his head hangs back over her arm. Perhaps ten faces, most of them frenetic, watch. Our two loafers are having fun amid the general hubbub, which includes a gavel that stops the noise. John looks over his shoulder in the direction of the gavel, then at a finger. After a short pause, a lawyer’s hands gently help him from the chair and consigh him to Rachel. Above John’s head, Rachel mimics pantomime with a watch while everyone in a cafe stands. Rachel gathers her parcels as Icey rushes to the door, opens it, turns to the crowd, and shouts into the cafe, before turning to the street mob. Rachel hurries her children to the door, and Icey leaves the door to yell at the mob. As Rachel leaves the shot, the cashier shuts and locks the door. Mary and Clary come out first and start walking to the left while Rachel comes out and hurries off to the right, followed by John holding Pearl’s hand. The camera pans to Mary and Clary as they turn, and we pan with them as they hurry after Rachel, bringing Rachel into view as she charges away with her brood hustling to keep up. Icey carries a torch, flanked by rabid faces and smiling loafers, one with an axe. As she speaks, a man rushes to Walt with a rope. The camera pans to Rachel and the children past this street as they hurry towards Ruby, who stands alone in the background facing the jail, with Rachel and the children hurrying towards her in the background.",
    "1285": "The heavy-set man notices and follows him as Klaatu walks up to a snack machine. Watched by a child, he studies the mechanism, then places his hand on the selection panel, resulting in a tuna salad sandwich dropping into the collection tray. The little curly-haired lad walks up and stares at Klaatu, who senses the presence, turns, and stares back. Klaatu stands as the boy continues to stare before being ushered away by his mother. Klaatu watches the ticket fight and takes a bite of the sandwich, while the big man collapses. The thief sees his chance and snatches the ticket back off the prone man, prompting a security guard to chase the thief as his colleague attends to the fallen man. Klaatu observes the scene, then walks into the grubby men's room. Standing in front of the mirror, he pulls back his jacket to reveal a patch of blood on his chest seeping through his shirt. He touches the blood, studies his reflection, and touches a finger to the sweat on his brow before he collapses. A reprimanding look is given as a woman takes the phone. The family next door is unloading their car while crowds mob the offices of the New Jersey Transport Police. Helen pushes her way through the throng and is concerned to see Klaatu sitting on a bench, his head slumped forward. As she approaches, he looks up into her eyes. Evacuees file through the city past fences topped with barbed wire. In the pouring rain, she opens the passenger door of her car and Klaatu gets in, with Jacob sitting in the back. Klaatu turns and looks at the boy, while Helen shoots him a mistrustful look and maneuvers her silver car out into the busy street. She pulls out the sample of his fatty birth skin and dips his finger in, rubbing some of the substance on the stitched bullet wound on his chest, which heals immediately. Helen stares in disbelief and gapes at him, open-mouthed, while Jacob looks puzzled and Klaatu calmly adjusts his tie. Lost for words, she obeys. Meanwhile, two heavily-armed fighter drones hurtle through the clouds toward Manhattan, remote-piloted from the base, skimming between the high-rise city blocks. A pilot's eye view is displayed on a bank of monitors. An orange light glows in the huge robot's head as the Reapers approach, and beams of energy shoot out from the robot's eye slit, detonating the missiles. Beams from the robot are locked on the Reapers, which are sent plunging into two tanks, and the robot's light goes out. The Colonel rips off his headset in frustration. Traffic clogs the nighttime highway, and as Helen pulls into a rain-drenched parking lot, an illuminated golden arches sign is reflected in the car's windscreen.",
    "337": "Denethor continues with his meal as Faramir exits. High above Minas Morgul, on a small ledge next to the stairs, lie Frodo, Sam, and Gollum. Sam watches a sleeping Gollum suspiciously as he desperately tries to stay awake, but slowly, inevitably, Sam falls asleep. Gollum's eyes snap open, he sits up, and quietly crawls towards Sam's knapsack. Sam breathes deeply now, heavily asleep. Gollum grimaces in distaste as he pulls out the lembas bread and quietly sprinkles crumbs over the sleeping Sam before throwing the remaining lembas bread over the cliff. Sam's eyes flick open and Gollum spins around, caught off guard. Too exhausted to argue, Sam turns away and gently shakes Frodo's shoulder. Sam rummages through his knapsack, looking for a bite to eat, but stops rummaging, shock on his face, and slowly turns to Gollum. Gollum slaps his hand against Sam's jacket, sending lembas crumbs raining down. Sam is enraged, throws himself at Gollum, and punches him. Frodo pulls Sam off Gollum and collapses on the ground, with Sam's horrified face showing. Sam attempts to fuss around Frodo, but a terrible light comes into Frodo's eyes as he stares into Sam's earnest eyes. Frodo pushes Sam away, clutching the ring beneath his shirt, and rises to his feet as if empowered with a frightening intense energy. Sam stares at Frodo with disbelief, tears well in his eyes, and spill down his cheeks as Frodo turns and leaves with Gollum. Sam is in complete misery. Meanwhile, Faramir leads a column of 200 knights through the streets towards the city gate, with people rushing forward, throwing flowers over the knights. Gandalf hurries alongside Faramir's horse, reading the pain in Faramir's eyes, and calls after him, trying one more time to stop the young man. From a high angle, Faramir leads the 200 mounted knights through the gates of Minas Tirith and across the Pelennor Fields towards the ruins of Osgiliath as the people of Minas Tirith watch. Faramir's knights fan out to form one straight line of 200 horsemen as Gothmog and his men watch them approach. Suddenly, fast pushing into Pippin, who looks on as Denethor eats, Gothmog rises amidst the ruins. Faramir's knights thunder towards the camera, 75 yards away, and Gothmog turns to camera and raises his hand. Behind Gothmog, 5,000 Orc archers rise to their feet, black arrows already strung on their bows. Faramir yells defiantly, but in wide profile and slow motion, his 200 knights ride straight into a black wall of flying arrows. At normal speed, fast cuts of screaming orcs are shown, and throughout the above sequence, Denethor continues to eat.",
    "1348": "The boys are scared as they watch the creature hold Woodward tight, lift him, and its tentacles suddenly thrust into his nose, ears, and mouth. Joe stands and looks intently at the screen. Just then, a muffled shatter-crash occurs, and suddenly, boom, the doors burst open with armed commandos. Donny gets stoned in his car and doesn't notice the movement in the distance behind him, which is the military coming in. In the locker hallway, the boys are handcuffed and scared as they are led out by armed soldiers. Nelec moves to them while Overmyer checks their pockets, and Nelec takes Cary's backpack, opens it, and pulls out some fireworks. Joe is terrified as Overmyer pulls from Joe's pocket a couple of coins, half a pack of Bubble Yum, and his mother's necklace, dropping everything but the necklace. Joe reacts panicked and is on the verge of tears as Overmyer pockets the necklace. The terrified boys are ushered away and put onto the bus. Boom down to Donny's car in the foreground, where we realize that we haven't been the only audience to this; Donny, sunk deep in his seat, hiding, watches wide-eyed as the bus drives away, his stoned mind races. Staying hidden from the remaining military, Donny scrambles for his CB, turns to channel 9, grabs the mike, and speaks quietly, frantic. Jack moves fast through the crowded evac area. Preston reads Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine when suddenly Jack is there, grabs him, and pulls him up. The scene pans as Nelec moves back; we push in on Overmyer, who sits near the front, putting on his dark gloves. Nelec sits, which takes us to a shot towards the back of the bus where another airman, Hernandez, 40, sits too. We push past them toward the four boys, sitting cuffed and seat-belted behind the dirty, wired safety glass, all looking toward us, terrified. Glass shatters as the entire bus is rocked, Charles screams, hurt, and at the front of the bus, Nelec falls and hits a bench. The bus was hit so hard it rides for a moment only on its wheels. The military driver struggles with the wheel as the bus slams back onto the road loudly and a tire blows. The kids panic as the hobbled bus still drives. We push in on Cary, to close-up, looking past the camera, terrified. Charles scrambles to unlatch his seatbelt. Baaam! The bus is slammed so hard that windows shatter, and Charles and Cary, seatbelts removed, land on Joe and Martin. The three soldiers hit the window-floor painfully, Hernandez so hard he's instantly hurt. Nelec rises, scared but pissed. The rear wheels of the bus scream in rotation as we countermove with the creature as it comes around the other side, climbs onto the exposed side, made of metal and window.",
    "331": "All is quiet as Frodo peers uneasily into the darkened living room when suddenly a large figure looms out of the shadows, reaching for him. Frodo lets out a startled cry, pulls himself free, and spins around to face his assailant as Gandalf steps into a shaft of moonlight with paranoia blazing in his eyes. Gandalf's clothes are dirty and ragged from much traveling, and his hair and beard are much longer and unkempt; he is suspicious and alert. Frodo pulls the envelope out of an old chest, and without a word, Gandalf takes the envelope and tosses it into the fireplace. Flames instantly consume the envelope, revealing the ring as it sinks into the red hot embers. Gandalf reaches into the fire with a pair of tongs, lifts the ring out, and drops it into Frodo's hand, who reacts to its weight. The gold band of the ring has fiery letters that begin to appear, and a tiny inscription glows red as if burning from within, emanating from the ring. Frodo looks at Gandalf, each knowing the other has heard it: Mordor. The ring lies between them on the table as Gandalf looks at Frodo, sadly. A teasing glimpse shows Gollum being tortured by the Orcs. On a dark country lane, a Hobbit bounder lifts his watch lantern in alarm as two Black Riders thunder out of the darkness, and a lethal sword swings down at the small Hobbit bounder. Frodo thrusts the ring at Gandalf as he throws clothes into a knapsack, and Gandalf watches him, making plans. Frodo is preparing to leave, and Gandalf looks at the young hobbit, moved by his courage. Gandalf freezes and moves quietly towards the window, eyes wide with tension, as he raises his staff above the window and slams it down on the intruder, resulting in a yelp of pain. Gandalf hauls a small figure into the room, revealing Sam Gamgee sprawled across the floor, looking up in terror as Gandalf looms over him. Hobbiton is shrouded in a white veil of mist, revealing Gandalf, Frodo, and Sam hurrying across a ploughed field, away from Hobbiton. Gandalf leads his horse as Frodo and Sam are carrying knapsacks, guiding them under the cover of woods. Gandalf takes Frodo to one side, and Frodo nods, patting his pocket. Frodo and Sam hike over the gentle Shire countryside, wading through a shallow stream. Sam stops short, taking stock of his surroundings, then takes a deep breath and steps forward, his brown, furry foot hitting the ground as Frodo and Sam continue their journey. Meanwhile, Gandalf is galloping along the outskirts of the ancient forest of Fangorn. Nestled in a basin at the foot of the distant Misty Mountains, the tall black tower of Orthanc is clearly visible as Gandalf gallops through the gate into the fortress of Isengard, a great ring-wall of stone, a mile from rim to rim, enclosing beautiful trees and gardens, watered by streams that flow down from the mountains.",
    "651": "The boys burst into the room. Jamal stares dumbfounded at Latika. She smiles in recognition. Maman and his henchmen stand at the door. Punnoose's face is now badly scarred. She avoids Maman's eyes but doesn't move. He reaches over and grabs her roughly. Salim draws a revolver from behind his back and points it at the men. Jamal looks astonished at his brother. Maman draws closer. Maman leers at Salim. Salim places a cushion over the gun. Jamal recoils in horror. And the men tremble. Latika rushes to take Maman's money from the floor. Jamal is rooted to the spot. The three children flee the scene. On the game show, Jamal looks deep in thought. The host points his hand at Jamal mimicking holding a gun. The scene of Maman's death replays. The host looks down at his computer screen. Young Salim, Jamal, and Latika sneak past the sleeping guard and break into a brand-new but unoccupied hotel. They run up a deceased elevator into an atrium door with an enormous gold chandelier. Inside the hotel room, Salim gleefully pours two bottles of spirit into a pot while Jamal picks a towel out of a cupboard. Jamal shakes the dusty towel and takes it to the bathroom door. Salim gulps down some beer. Salim suddenly looks solemn and leaves the room. Salim steps out onto the street. Jamal has his eyes closed and head turned away from a semi-naked Latika. She smiles as he squeezes his eyes tightly shut. She goes back into the bathroom. He keeps his eyes closed for a moment more then slowly opens them. Salim crosses a road busy with tuk-tuks, cars, bicycles, and carts. He approaches a cinema kiosk, hands over a coin, and receives the ticket. On a large balcony above the cinema, six men are drinking and playing a gambling game. None of the men notices Salim as he steps onto the balcony and swaggers over. They ignore Salim as he takes out his gun from behind his back. He points it at one of the men's heads. Salim slowly turns to face Javed, he nods. Javed beckons to Salim. In the hotel room, Jamal and Latika lie on a mattress on the floor. Latika makes graceful hand shadows on the wall. Her arms are painted in intricate gold and henna designs. They stare at each other for a long time. Salim returns to the room. Jamal and Latika snoozing on the mattress. Salim stands over Latika. Both Latika and Jamal wake up. He holds out his hand for Latika. He leans towards Latika. Jamal rushes Salim. Salim eventually overpowers the smaller Jamal and ejects him from the room. Salim emerges, pointing a gun.",
    "1096": "Zus holds a protective hand in front of his face while people watch in mute shock; Tuvia, with a livid scowl, drops the stone on the ground and gets to his feet, as Zus sits up and wipes his mouth. Straightening his jacket, Zus looks around at the assembled people staring at him, and Benzion picks up his gun. Zus addresses Asael, who's standing with Chaya; the two young people look at each other, and Zus affectionately pats Asael on the cheek. Zus then turns to find Bella standing behind him; without a word, he grabs his machine gun, and with a line of volunteers behind him, strides off past Tuvia. At Nowogrodek, Nazi soldiers stand guard as Jewish men and women wearing yellow stars file into the ghetto, while Tuvia and Asael stride purposefully past the ghetto entrance. They carefully tread along a low-tiled roof, climb down at the far end, and hurry towards the interior of the ghetto. On an unpaved woodland track, the army general Panchenko, astride a tall black horse with Gramov at his side, rides at the head of an infantry column toward Zus and his men standing by the side of the track. Panchenko nods at Zus, who nods back. As the Russian commander moves on, Zus and his men fall in with the Russian foot soldiers. Inside the ghetto, a Jewish elder addresses a room packed with smartly dressed, solemn-looking people. Tuvia addresses two women in the room, then looks despairingly at Asael. A beautiful young woman steps forward. Under a cover of darkness, as people stream out of a house tearing off their yellow stars, one Jewish man hiding in a doorway peers toward the floodlit square where German guards are on duty in front of the barbed wire entrance to the ghetto; he beckons to Asael across the dark narrow street where the people have gathered. Asael ushers them out through a hole in the wall and into the street, leaving behind a pile of yellow fabric stars. At daybreak, carrying bags and cases, they walk in single file across the wintry landscape towards a windmill and on into the Birchwood forest. At the camp, Shimon and Malbin sit behind a makeshift desk on which people are putting their valuables, and she and her parents hug each other. Shimon addresses an elderly man, while Tuvia shows the man a loose trigger on a rifle; the watchmaker hands back the rifle and the trigger works. Tuvia sits on his horse, and young and old listen with rapt attention as Malbin nods approvingly. A curly-haired boy turns to Lilka, the beautiful newcomer, while Asael supervises shooting practice. Elsewhere, women are sitting at sewing machines.",
    "35": "Sam begins to play it very softly and then prepares to move the piano away. For a long moment, he just looks at her. Meanwhile, Renault and Laszlo approach the table from the bar, and as Rick sees Ilsa, he stops short, appearing shocked. Sam stops playing. Two close-ups reveal Ilsa and Rick seeing each other, and Rick sits down as he and Ilsa look at each other. Laszlo signals the waiter, and Rick takes the check. Renault leaves, and Ilsa smiles as they join Renault at the curb. Sam now realizes Rick is in a very grim mood, and Sam sits down at the piano, starting to play softly, improvising. Suddenly, Rick pounds the table and buries his head in his arms before raising his head, trying to regain control, holding his head in his hands. Rick just stares ahead as orchestra music slowly joins Sam's playing. Later, Ilsa fixes flowers at the window while Rick opens champagne. Rick drives a small, open car slowly along the boulevard with the background scenery changing to a country road as she snuggles close to him and puts her head on his shoulder; he puts his arm around Ilsa. On an excursion boat on the Seine, Rick and Ilsa stand at the rail, seemingly transported by each other as Ilsa laughs. They see the Arc de Triomphe from a distance, and she walks over and joins him. They drink inside a swank Paris cafe, and Rick and Ilsa dance, appearing to be very much in love as the music plays. Ilsa flips a coin, then tosses it over to Rick, and they kiss passionately. During the backdrop of the rubble of a burned-out, demolished building, German troops cross a river as tanks roll down the road toward Paris and German war planes fly overhead. A man sells newspapers to people crowded around him, and there is much excitement. Rick and Ilsa sit at a table, buy a newspaper, and begin to read it while nearby, a group of frightened French people cluster around a loudspeaker on a wagon. At the bar, Rick gets glasses and a bottle of champagne, walks over to Ilsa and Sam at the piano, and pours the champagne. Ilsa seems unnerved, evidently having something on her mind, while Rick's manner is wry, but not the bitter wryness seen in Casablanca. Sam looks at his glass, and Rick and Ilsa look at each other, then hurry to the window. She smiles faintly and looks at him tenderly. Rick takes her in his arms and kisses her hungrily, and while locked in an embrace, they hear the dull boom of cannons, to which Ilsa reacts worriedly. Ilsa looks at Rick, and he chuckles, then chuckles again.",
    "85": "John turns his back and looks out the window beside the bureau and then throws the hairbrush, striking Preacher's head, and he is sure now Pearl knows. Preacher's hand locks the door as Willa, in outdoor clothes and not dressed for work in the parlor, enters with her back to us and stops, smiling benignly. Willa keeps smiling and, still smiling, shakes her head in disbelief as she makes for the house while Pearl screams. In a narrow screen setup similar to an earlier corridor scene, Preacher and Willa's eyes meet, and he turns. Willa is calm and immobile with the ecstasy of a martyr as Preacher hits her across the mouth. Preacher then hears the voice and starts to move out of the close shot, moving over to the coat on the back of the chair. His hand goes into the pocket and brings the knife out, the same coat and pocket as in the wedding-night scene. He pulls down the blind and moves toward the bed as the knife clicks open in his hand, and he raises his arm to strike. Later, he is scrubbing out an ice cream container on the back porch, looks up, and moves towards her as Walt enters the shot with a pipe. They enter the kitchen, where Walt clucks his tongue and moves towards the kitchen cabinet, pours, and snaps it down in weak defiance, then looks towards off-screen. He sits at a table with his back towards us, mumbling over his Bible, closes it, and turns to them with weepy eyes and a brave little smile as Icey smiles sideways, happy to let her mouth fall open and let out a gasp. We pan with slowly streaming weeds and bring in Willa in close profile; the current coming from behind her drifts her long hair across her throat, and she is in profile as before. It descends, catches on the windshield, and the line tautens and tugs. We start to follow the line up, continue to follow the line, and bring in close the stern of Ben Harper's skiff as he sits back, tugging unconcernedly at the line. Then he leans over to see what's wrong, peers over the side, and we start moving before he does. With a low camera angle capturing his full figure, we tilt to frame him from the waist downward and follow close behind him as he leaves the tree and walks along the side of the house. We tilt downward and close in, following only his feet as he steps past a tiny cellar window and we pan and tighten in close on it, where their noses are flat against the glass, their cheeks touch, and their window isn't quite big enough to hold both their heads; it is on the ground, and we don't see their chins.",
    "1010": "The Queen gives the corgis food, and the corgis look up at her before running through the clearing. Video footage shows crowds of people lining up in a queue, and a sign is seen. All around, the ground is covered in floral tributes. Later, Charles talks with Steven, and Tony looks at Cherie before leaving her with her paperwork. Elsewhere, the Queen sits at a desk writing in a book, but she suddenly stops writing. The next day, three Land Rovers drive away from Balmoral. On Wednesday, Robin stares out of a window, with a blond woman sitting behind him, and a man sticks his hand up as Tony stares back at them. The Queen signs the letter, and Robin looks from Prince Philip to the Queen. The Queen walks over to a desk, sits down, picks up a phone, and glances at the sun. The Queen puts Tony on the speaker and glances at Prince Philip, then arranges pens and a magnifying glass on the desk. Tony casts his eyes skyward, stands up, and looks out of the window, still gazing out before picking up the phone on his desk. Tony puts down the phone, pauses, then leaves his office, stroking his chin thoughtfully and stops beside a female secretary who sits behind a desk. At Balmoral, the Queen exits a Land Rover and enters a building. The Land Rover drives through the hilly and woody countryside with the Queen in the driving seat, continuing along a long, bumpy, and barren road parallel to a river. The road runs down to the river's edge, and the Queen plows into the waters. As she heads across the ford, rocks and potholes on the riverbed jolt the car, and the Land Rover comes to a sudden, violent halt in the middle of the river. The Queen steps out of the car, into the mountain waters, and inspects the underneath of the vehicle, continuing to examine other parts of the Land Rover. The Queen holds a mobile phone and dials a number. Back at Balmoral, Thomas sits at a desk, and the Queen hangs up the phone, then removes the headscarf she is wearing. She gazes at the serene countryside surroundings, shuts her eyes for a moment, looks down, frowns, then looks up. The vast landscape dwarfs the figure of the Queen, who sits on the riverbank by the vehicle. The Queen remains seated, her back turned away, and her body gently rocks as she starts to sob. After a few moments, she turns to her left and sees a stag on the opposite side of the river, which stands still.",
    "212": "The whistle of an approaching train is heard as the train comes to a stop, and Harry is among the first to get off, followed by an attractive girl about the same age as he is, named Ruth Dakin. In the excitement of greetings, Ruth is momentarily forgotten, standing and smiling, waiting, as George and Uncle Billy stare, astounded, with George thunderstruck. He takes Ruth's hand and kisses her. The camera moves with them down the platform, but George stops with a sinking feeling while Uncle Billy and Ruth continue out of shot, and Harry stops with George before running out of the shot as George watches him. George slowly moves after Uncle Billy and Ruth, thinking deeply, as the camera moves with him when he comes into the scene. Ruth detaches herself from the group and offers George some popcorn, nodding and smiling. Cousin Eustace takes a photograph of the family group assembled on the porch, and flash bulbs go off as the group breaks up, with the crowd entering the front door of the house, leaving George and Uncle Billy on the porch, the latter tipsy and feeling very high. Uncle Billy looks around for his hat, which is on his head, and George takes the hat from Uncle Billy's head and hands it to him as they descend the porch steps and George turns his uncle around, heading him down the street. George stands at the garden gate, obviously disturbed about the latest turn of events, as he takes some travel folders from his pocket, looks at them, and throws them away. His mother comes out of the house and kisses him, nodding toward the house, where Harry and Ruth, among a crowd of other couples, are dancing to the music of a phonograph, and are seen through the front door as they kiss. Mrs. Bailey puts George's hat on his head, and George stands in the middle of the street, hands in pockets, obviously undecided about what he wants to do. As a girl passes, he turns to watch her for a moment, while Violet is locking up for the night, with a couple of men crowding around her, each intent on taking her out. She looks up and sees George standing there, and the camera pans with Violet as she crosses the street to George. Violet, who takes her beauty shop seriously and is an eyeful, is sensed by George to be far from immune to her attractions, as she links her arm in his and continues down the street with him until they stop walking and face one another, with her eyes seductive and guileful as she looks up at him.",
    "1148": "Harry smiles. As evening falls, they join the excited crowds in the magnificent Quidditch stadium. The spectators take their seats in the stands, many of them wearing colorful national costumes. He stops Harry with his walking stick and then smacks at him. Spotlight beams illuminate the packed stands. Hermione and the twins wear green and white scarves. Mr. Diggory takes them to the highest level of the stadium. The seven Irish players zoom out in formation with green and white smoke streaming from their broomsticks. Fireworks explode in the shape of a spirited leprechaun dancing a jig. The opposing team in black and red fly high above the pitch, and one turns a somersault. A gigantic image of the handsome Bulgarian player is projected onto the towering stands. He hovers in front of a waving flag proclaiming the name Krum. Krum raises his fist confidently. Cornelius Fudge uses his wand to amplify his voice, and a bright ball of light springs from his wand and plunges down towards the arena. Back in the tent, George and friends celebrate the Irish victory. Mr. Weasley lights a lamp and hurries them out of the tent. The camp is in chaos, many of the tents are on fire, with flames leaping high into the darkness. Harry sees ominous cloaked figures with skeleton masks and tall pointed hats, carrying flaming torches. He starts to run, and wrestled away from Hermione and the others, Harry dodges through the panicking crowd. In the confusion, Harry trips and falls. As he struggles to get up, flying feet knock him aside. Light from the burning tents flickers across his face as he lies unconscious on the muddy ground. Everything goes black. A full moon shines down on the devastated camp. A lone figure strides between the smoking tents, kicking the smoldering remains. The figure points a wand into the dark sky and casts a spell. A huge, ghostly, green skull appears with a snake emerging from its mouth. It floats above his head. The young man bears his teeth with an evil smile of satisfaction. Harry slowly regains consciousness and sits up. He sees the shadowy figure approaching through the smoke. Harry gets to his feet and runs away from the dark figure, and the figure runs off. Seeing the skull, Harry clutches his scar. A group of Ministry wizards gaze up nervously at the ghostly skull, a dark mark still hovering above their heads. Ron counts his money. Harry nods to a young Chinese girl, and she gives him a shy smile. Harry scratches his eyebrow. Hermione leans forward. Harry addresses an envelope to his godfather, Sirius Black, and puts the letter into Hedwig's beak. The snowy owl flies out of the train window and sows away over a lake as the Express steams on towards Hogwarts.",
    "845": "At the front desk, the attendant hands him a clipboard. Outside, Diana opens the car door as Sandy pours himself a cup of coffee and a brown utility van pulls into the motel parking lot. The skiptracer walks around and sees Diana sitting in the open passenger side. Inside, Sandy stirs his coffee while the skiptracer pulls Diana from the car, and he notices the abduction through the window. Sandy runs outside as the skiptracer pushes Diana into the van, locks the door, and hurries to the wheel. Sandy runs over and watches the van speed off, then he quickly shuts the passenger-side door and gets behind the wheel of his rental. Sandy backs out of his parking spot and speeds away from the motel. On a narrow country road, the skiptracer talks on his cell phone as Sandy comes up on the van. He moves into the oncoming lane and pulls up beside the van. Diana opens a window, and spotting an oncoming car, Sandy hits the brakes and swerves behind the van. Diana pushes against the gated partition while Sandy pulls up beside the van again. The van speeds toward an intersection's red light, cars whiz by as the van turns sharply, and Sandy follows, barely dodging the oncoming vehicles. His sedan skids up alongside another car and he peels away onto a two-lane highway. Sandy speeds up beside the skiptracer's van, but the skiptracer swerves at Sandy, sending him into a grassy median. Sandy recovers on the other side, facing oncoming traffic as speeding cars swerve out of his way. Guardrails lie on both sides of the road, trapping Sandy with the oncoming traffic. The skiptracer peers out of his window, watching the businessmen at their numerous vehicles. An 18-wheeler speeds towards Sandy and he swerves toward the median, launching the sedan off a mound of dirt so it soars through the air and lands on its tires in the grass as Sandy rejoins the van on the right side of the road. In the van, Diana pounds a cylinder against the partition lock and breaks through. The skiptracer elbows her stomach and holds her back, but Diana punches him in the throat and he falls limply against the steering wheel. Sandy slows down and lightly hits the back panel of the van, barely nudging it. Diana notices a merge up ahead, and Sandy eyes the runaway van, gripping the steering wheel as he takes a breath. He speeds into the side of the van, causing it to flip over. Sandy stares wide-eyed as the van continues to flip into the median, then stops the car and watches the van land right side up. Sandy unbuckles his seatbelt and slowly emerges from the car. In slow motion, he hurries toward the van with his mouth dropped open.",
    "707": "Peter smiles and looks at the ring, then slips it into the pocket of his jeans before opening the door to Mary Jane, who holds up a newspaper. He gives her a warm, guarded smile as she sits down. Peter smiles feebly, and Mary Jane nods sadly, then looks down dejectedly. Peter, in his Spider-Man suit, gives her a little smile before putting on his head mask and leaping out of the window. Mary Jane stands up, gathers her bag, scarf, and newspaper, and goes for the door. Across the room, the black spider-like tendril crawls across a cabinet behind her but freezes when she looks around. She leaves the apartment, and the slimy, black mass drops to the floor. On a city street, two cops look up to the sky as a huge, towering jib crane swings around, its driver struggling with the controls. Meanwhile, Gwen is part of a photo shoot in an office, and the photographer checks his shot. Gwen and the other two models turn to the window as an enormous steel girder hanging from a chain swings towards them; they throw themselves to the floor as the girder smashes through the window, ripping out the supports along one corner of the building. A desk and other debris plummet to the ground. Captain Stacy arrives on the scene as, in the devastated office, Gwen helps another model up. The huge yellow jeep of the crane swings back towards the office, smashing out the supports beneath it. The office floor gives way, and desks and furniture tip out through the smashed windows. Gwen slides down the tilting floor and just manages to hang onto a telephone cable, but the cable snaps, and she clings onto the very edge of the floor. A blonde-haired young guy runs up behind Captain Stacy and starts taking photos, but Stacy grabs the guy's camera and looks up at his daughter through the telephoto lens. Gwen's eyes widen in horror as a desk slides towards her; she releases her grip on the floor but manages to grab onto a long metal rail just below. As Spider-Man approaches, swinging from building to building, the metal rail falls loose from the wall and buckles, swinging Gwen out above the streets hundreds of feet below. As Spider-Man swings and leaps towards the skyscraper, the crane's jib rips out through the building, sending huge chunks of metal toward him. Dodging the debris, Spider-Man just manages to catch Gwen, saving her from being crushed by two clashing slabs of concrete. Spider-Man swings down to the pavement with Gwen in his arms, and Gwen hugs her dad. As Spider-Man swings away, Gwen gazes after him. In his office at the Daily Bugle, J. Jonah Jameson is in a meeting with a marketing guy.",
    "1086": "Tuvia, weaving his way between the trees, is knocked off his feet by an exploding shell. As he groggily struggles to raise his head, his blue eyes seem dazed. Behind him, a bunker explodes, throwing bodies in all directions in a cascade of debris. In slow motion, a man runs through the trees amid the dust and flames. Tuvia, clutching a slender tree branch with his body position dazed, watches a bomber fly across the sky about to drop another bomb. Malbin appears out of the haze and pulls him towards a shelter just as Asael arrives. Tuvia slaps down against the wall of the bunker as the planes fly away. Asael breaks from Tuvia while Malbin herds people out of the bunker. The survivors run through the trees, some carrying bundles and others armed with rifles. Chaya clings desperately to Asael, and he and Tuvia take up gun positions behind a bunker. Asael glances sideways and sees Chaya positioning her rifle. He watches his young wife being urged away. His nose bleeding, Tuvia walks away from the burning remains of the camp, leaving a few men and women, including Lazar, Lilka, and Asael, standing behind the mossy roots of their bunkers with weapons poised, keeping their sights fixed on the woodland ahead of them. Deeper in the forest, the rest of the community hurry through the bare trees. The shooters leaning on the roofs of the shelters scan the horizon, and one woman is hit. Asael fires at the unseen enemy. Tuvia stops to listen to the sound of gunfire as another man goes down. Asael, keeping his head low, scurries to a new position, and a machine gunner falls to the ground while Lazar runs on. The others give Lazar cover as Asael scrambles sideways, firing as he runs, and the bunker behind him is blown to smithereens. Asael pulls an injured woman, Layla, to safety. Lazar, with rifle in hand, ducks behind a tree and reloads. Seeing Asael crawling towards him with Layla hurt, he propels himself out from behind the tree and runs towards the enemy, but his body is tossed into the air like a rag doll. Asael looks behind him and sees a female shoot a hit, her arm still clinging to her machine gun; her head goes limp, but the gun goes on firing. Deeper in the misty forest, Tuvia, at the head of his flock, strides on with a machine gun held across his body. Further on, with Malbin, Bella, and Shulman behind him, he comes into a clearing, but his pale blue eyes scan the horizon. Stretching ahead of them with no end in sight is marshland. Aron and Rachel, along with Tamara cuddling her baby, look up at the sky.",
    "1244": "Don sits in the chair to Brian's left, the presenter to Brian's right. Brian shoots a scathing look at the presenter. Don smooths out his tie. The floor manager points at the presenter. Brian's grin sticks. Brian fades to silhouette as the lights dim. Brian nods bitterly as Don and the presenter rise from their seats and stroll away across the studio floor. Still sat in his chair, brooding introspectively, Brian glances over at the TV crew who wander out of the cavernous studio as the lights go out. Brian sits in the darkness on set, the switched off cameras pointing away from him. Brian drives past Elland Road in his Blue Merc with Nigel and Simon in the back. The lads read comics and annuals as Brian broods at the wheel. He looks in the mirror at them. The boys swap wide-eyed looks on the back seat. Brian smiles as the boys stifle giggles. The boys huddle close behind Brian, excitedly. The chalk cliffs of the south coast. Girls wheel over the Brighton Promenade in the sunshine. Brian stops the car outside a large red brick house. Peter's wandering among the shrubs and plants in his front garden. He looks over at Brian in his car. He stoops over a flowerbed. His eyes fixed on Peter, Brian gets out wearing a heavy frown. Still bent over the flowerbed, Peter glances over at Brian then carries on weeding. Brian puts his hands in his pockets as he strolls up the drive. Peter shoots Brian a withering look. Peter looks down at his plants. Then, he steps back with his hands on his hips, admiring them. Eventually, he turns to Brian with disdain. Peter turns back around. Peter takes a step closer to kneeling Brian, scrutinizing him. Peter points at Brian. The boys exchange puzzled looks in the car. Peter walks closer and stops. Peter strolls towards his house, then turns back. Brian fixes Peter with a sincere, imploring look. Peter looks at Brian, then hangs his head and shakes it. He rubs the finger of his clenched fists together. Then, he raises his open hands out towards Brian. Brian stands and walks towards his old friend. Brian throws his arms around Peter and hugs him close. Peter screws his eyes up and returns the embrace. Then, he scowls. Brian is wide eyed as he speaks into Peter's ear. Peter blinks slowly and shakes his head. A tender smile spreads across Brian's face. He tightens his embrace and closes his eyes. They step back and look at each other. Peter thumps Brian's shoulder playfully. Peter nods over Brian's shoulder towards the boys in the car. Brian beckons to them. The boys scamper to Peter.",
    "646": "Jamal's mother screams at the boys as the attackers bludgeon defenseless men and women, and Jamal watches as his mother is clubbed in the face. She falls back into the water, and the boys help each other out of the pool and run. Jamal looks back for his mother, but Salim urges him onward while a man falls and is stamped on by a mob. Salim and Jamal run past another man throwing a Molotov cocktail at a door, fleeing down an alley where they come face to face with a young boy dressed as the Hindu god Rama, covered in blue paint with his hair bound up on his head. Both of them run, passing the girl, Latika, hiding in an alley as a man sets another man on fire. The boys run towards a police station, with Latika falling behind. Inside, the policemen are playing cards while a man runs into the street with his clothes in flames, and the policemen do nothing. The boys run again, beckoning Latika to follow, and Jamal's mother lies face down in the pool. In the present day, back in the police station, Jamal remembers seeing the young boy dressed as the god Rama. The boys had been frozen to the spot momentarily, staring at the bow and arrow in the boy's hand. Back on the show, Jamal is lost in thought. Five-year-old Jamal and Salim stand on high ground looking down on their slum burning amidst the riots, while Latika stands some distance away. In the street, Latika stands drenched in the torrential rain as Jamal and Salim sit in a shelter; Salim rolls onto his side, and Jamal looks at Latika in the rain for a moment before lying down. Jamal and Salim's mother screams as flames explode, and Jamal wakes up as Salim lies with his back to him, wide awake. Jamal looks at Latika still out in the rainy street, seeing her squat down tracing letters in the puddles; he calls out to her, and she stands up, runs over to the shelter, and squats next to Jamal. Latika shakes her head while Salim's eyes remain wide open, and she lies down next to Jamal. The three children lie on the floor out of the rain, shivering in the cold. In the present, Jamal sits on the studio stage opposite the host as people scavenge on mountains of rotting rubbish while lorries offload more refuse sacks. Jamal appears pensive in the studio, while on the rubbish tip, Latika picks through scraps with a stick. She looks up when a minibus arrives, turns, and shouts as two men emerge from the minibus and approach a makeshift tent, counting two pairs of feet. Inside, Jamal and Salim lie dosed in the tent amidst the rubbish.",
    "604": "Hermione puts one arm over Harry's shoulder, the other over Ron's. Ahead of them, Katie Bell lies on her back in the snow, her body wrenched from side to side. She shoots up into the air and hovers with arms outstretched, her mouth open in a muted scream, then crashes down onto the snow and lies on her back, her head shaking. Hagrid arrives on the scene, and they step aside as the giant Hagrid picks Katie up. Harry walks towards something on the ground, a necklace of blue stones lying on the snow, tipped out of its box. Harry folds back the wrapping paper, and, back inside its box, the necklace lies on a desk. Professor McGonagall studies it and then turns to Leanne. Hermione, Ron, and Harry face McGonagall as Snape arrives. Snape waves his wand, and the necklace rises into the air. McGonagall looks at Snape, the others stare at him, and Harry is the last to lower his gaze. Harry lies on his bed with the Marauder's Map and sees Malfoy moving on it. Ron lies in bed with his hands behind his head; both boys look uneasy. Harry takes off his glasses and puts them on the map on his bedside table, and Malfoy disappears from the map. At Professor Slughorn's supper party, twin girls look around at Hermione, and everyone's enjoying dessert. The door opens, and Ginny comes in, having been crying. Harry is the only one to stand as Ginny approaches the table, grinning politely as he bends down to retrieve his napkin, with Hermione watching him. Cormac, eyes fixed on Hermione, sucks his little finger suggestively, causing her to turn away in embarrassment. Slughorn turns, eyes wide, as Harry stares at the photographs. Taken aback, Slughorn stands rooted to the spot while Harry gives a faint smile. The sand in the hourglass drifts slowly from top to bottom, held upright by snakes with green glass bodies and golden heads. Ron, in his Quidditch gear, including his leather helmet, enters the Great Hall looking totally miserable. He sits down in front of his breakfast, a fried egg on a square of dry toast surrounded by four toast triangles, as Hermione smiles knowingly and Harry turns away. Lavender bounces up and goes, leaving Ron looking even more miserable. Harry passes Ron a goblet; Ron looks at Hermione and Harry, then lifts the goblet to his lips and drinks. Hermione glares as Harry smiles, and Ron smiles broadly. The two friends clasp hands over the table. The game is played in a snowstorm, as a bound leather Quaffle zooms through the air, caught by a Slytherin Chaser, whose green cape flaps behind him as he joins his teammates, flanking him as they charge for goal.",
    "433": "He turns on his stool to watch the game. Eddie goes back to his bottle of beer. Some bills drop on a ragged, beat-up pool table. Two men, dressed in work clothes, stand around looking disgruntled. They go to the bar. Eddie sits at a table, smoking, waiting. The paper bag with the whisky is on the table. He mashes out his cigarette in the ashtray. Sarah, dressed in a dark suit, limps toward him. When he looks up, he sees Sarah standing nearby. She seems cold and suspicious as she limps toward the table. She pauses and looks at him. They stare at one another for a long moment. He gets up, puts his arm around her shoulder, and walks away with her. As they walk, she hesitantly puts an arm around his waist. A hand reaches up to open the wooden shutters. As they open, we see Eddie, in his underclothes, on the bed. Sarah, in a robe, walks up and joins him in bed as they both peer out the window. She hands him her cigarette. He starts to put on his wristwatch. He kisses her on the cheek. He kisses her again, this time on the lips. He reaches out and closes the shutters. Sarah emerges from a neighborhood grocery store loaded down with a Cheese Doodles carton full of food. A woman runs out of the store to give her a parcel she left behind. He pulls her schoolbooks out of the carton and takes her purse. She unloads liquor and canned goods from the carton, then goes to join Eddie by the window. Sarah takes a cigarette lighter out of her purse and hands it to Eddie. He takes it. She smiles, then she gets up and returns to the kitchenette. He comes up behind her and puts his arms around her. She cuts her hand opening a can. As he rummages through the closet for his bag he pulls out his leather cue case. They kiss. Someone knocks on the door. Sarah goes to open it. We stay on Eddie, who examines the lighter in his hand. He enters the room, awkwardly, toying with the rim of his hat. There is a long silence. Charlie sits. She starts to make the drinks. Eddie leans up against the wall, listening. Sarah watches them both, curious, confused. Suddenly Eddie becomes tense. Sarah turns to fix the drink. Eddie signals her to stay where she is. He moves forward, confronting Charlie. Eddie walks off. A tear rolls down Sarah's cheek as she hears this. She stands near the door, with her back to both of them. Charlie gets up and moves toward the door. Sarah, her cheek wet, says nothing.",
    "967": "She grips two high heels, a coat, and an open champagne bottle which she sets on the counter. Her unblinking eyes stay on him. The woman sits on the counter. David straightens, his gaze fascinated. As David faintly nods, the smiling woman shakes her head. Their amused smiles relax as their stare lingers. David breaks the gaze. The two strangers gaze at each other, and then converge abruptly in a deep kiss, caressing each other passionately. As their kiss ends, their faces still hover close. A second onrush of kissing overtakes them. The woman jogs out barefoot. Charlie smiles. David follows her. She peers back. Two men approach. She loosens his tie. She hurries off. Now in the ballroom. Backstage Charlie and other aides applaud. David peers at his supporters, then briefly bows his head. He glances back stage. He holds up a shoe. Numerous flashbulbs pop. Now dark clouds drift over Manhattan. On a pleasant city street, largely devoid of activity. A shiny black town car stops by Madison Square Park. A rear passenger door opens. The oldest member of the mysterious four-man team from the rooftop gets out of the car in his fedora and overcoat. He confidently enters the park. Farther along, the mustached stranger sits on a bench. The older superior sits beside him. His superior walks away. The mustached subordinate peers after his boss with a faint smile. Across from the park, a well-kept residential building shows beyond a few trees. Inside David sleeps. He wakes and turns off his alarm clock, which reads six o'clock. Later, David sips coffee. Later, David carries a to-go cup of coffee as he crosses a park. As David and his fan go their separate ways, the mustached stranger remains on his park bench, his head bowed and his fedora brim tilted to shade his face. David hurries across a street. A clock on the side of a building reads 7:05. Sunlight glows through a tree's branches, bathing the stranger's face. He awakes. Blinking, he glances around, then pulls out his hardcover book and checks a bookmarked page. He jumps to his feet, spotting David, who boards a bus. The stranger races after it. David notices him through a bus window. The stranger keeps sprinting, as David looks for a place to sit. He smiles. The lovely woman from the election night sleeps with her head leaned against a window. As David takes the seat beside her, she stirs. David checks out her thighs and miniskirt. She notices him and beams. Outside, the mustached stranger still sprints after the bus. She stares at him. David grabs his phone. A car speeds past the running stranger. The bus pulls up to a stop.",
    "210": "Mickey, a young punk who has had one too many, is beside him. He takes the key from Mickey and turns the switch. The floor begins to part in the middle, each half sliding under the bleacher seats. Pandemonium starts. Dancers begin to scream as they try to get off. Some are so engrossed in dancing they continue at top speed. Teachers and elders start to scurry off. George and Mary are dancing. They mistake the screams for cheers. George and Mary are so busy dancing they don't notice the floor opening. As the floor opens, it reveals an attractive, lighted swimming pool. Spotlights concentrate on them. The crowd is watching George and Mary dancing. They move backwards until finally they reach the edge of the floor and fall into the pool below. George and Mary are still trying to dance in the water with the crowd on the edge cheering them; some of the crowd leap into the pool; the principal tries to restore order, finally clasps his hands like a diver, and leaps in himself. The night is warm with a bright moon. George is dressed in a jersey sweater and oversized football pants that keep wanting to come down. Mary is in an old white bathrobe. Each is carrying their wet clothes tied into a bundle that leaves a trail of dripping water. As they near the camera, we hear them singing. The camera moves with them as they proceed down the street. He takes the bundle of clothes from Mary. They stop and look at each other. Mary stops. George, to cover his embarrassment, talks quickly on. In his confusion, George steps on the end of the belt of Mary's bathrobe, which is trailing along behind her. She gathers the robe around her. He picks up the belt and throws it over her arm. George looks after her, then picks up a rock from the street. It is a weather-beaten, old-fashioned two-storied house that once was no doubt resplendent. George hurls the rock at the house. We see a grumpy old man in shirt sleeves in a rocking chair on the porch. He looks up as he hears the breaking glass. As he talks, Mary has been listening intently. She finally stoops down and picks up a rock, weighting it in her hand. The old deserted house. Mary throws her rock, and once more we hear the sound of breaking glass. Mary looks at him provocatively, then turns and shuffles off down the street, singing as she goes. George hurries after her. George joins her in the singing as they proceed down the street. Man on the porch of the house is listening to George and Mary. They have stopped walking and now face one another.",
    "1323": "Bob pulls his son close and hugs him with all his might, tears filling his eyes. Charlie tried hard to push, and there it is a baby's cries. Audrey stood stunned, standing wide-eyed and holding up the child. Audrey reacts, crosses to the counter, turns on the radio, trying to drown out the sound of the approaching menace. Out of the static, the haunting sounds of Bing Crosby singing \"Silent Night\" fill the room. The quiet before the storm. Michael helps Charlie quickly clean herself up. She stares at him, a burning spite in her eyes. Those words provide her little comfort. Charlie shakes her head, this is all too much. Michael nods grimly. Charlie looks urgently at Michael. The baby cries louder. Charlie, shaken by this revelation, reaches out to Audrey. Audrey moves to hand over the baby to Charlie. Sandra backs away from them, moving toward the front door. Michael cocks his gun, points it at Sandra. Charlie squares off with Sandra, panic in her eyes. Charlie stares at her in horror, the truth of those words rattling her to the very core. A brilliant spectral light pours into the diner. She raises a hand to block the light. And that's when Michael fires. BLAM! Sandra staggers back, blood dripping from the hole in her forehead. Michael fires again, blowing Sandra's body back through the doorway. Jeep watches the baby sail slowly through the air. Jeep dives for the baby, catching the bundle of rags mere inches from the ground, and then he looks up to see the dark silhouette of a man approaching from out of the spectral light, a man with wings. Jeep's eyes grow wide as the fierce angel steps into the diner. The angel's wings retract with clockwork-like precision, and now that we see his face clearly, we notice his striking resemblance to Michael. Gabriel raises a massive, ferocious, strangely mechanical-looking mace in his powerful hands. The world returns to normal speed as Gabriel brings the mace arcing down at Jeep. Jeep rolls, clang! The weapon just misses him, hitting the floor in a spray of sparks, literally cracking the ground. Gabriel brings the mace up again. With a sweep of his hand, Gabriel sends Bob flying across the diner where he crashes down behind the counter near the stove. Michael grabs Jeep's hand before the boy can rush back into the fray. Michael lets go of Jeep's hand and turns away to face Gabriel, leaving Jeep to contemplate those final words. And that's when Jeep opens his hand to find the keys to Michael's police cruiser. Jeep looks up from the keys to see Charlie, Audrey, and the baby.",
    "1265": "Snape bends down and picks a plant with two leaves, which flutter like wings, and he guides it to Lily. The red-haired Lily smiles at the boy Severus, and he glances at her. Then, they both look up at the Willow tree above them as the wind rustles the branches and the leaves fall flying like tiny birds. The fluttering leaves skim over the water. The image changes to Lily wearing the Sorting Hat, and she glances at Severus as she walks down the hall. At the dining table, another boy sits beside her, while the pale-faced Severus looks at her, doe-eyed. James smiles at Lily, who gazes back at him. Lily and James kiss and dance. Voldemort kills Lily, followed by an image of Wormtail, and Snape's face softens. Dumbledore's blackened hand, Draco and the vanishing cabinet, and the night of Dumbledore's death, which Harry witnessed on the Astronomy tower, appear. There are images of Voldemort, and Harry, restless in his sleep, and the night of Lily's death. Snape enters the bedroom in the house in Godric's Hollow and finds her dead beside Harry's cot. Snape is overcome with grief, and he gazes at her lying lifeless on the floor. There are tears in baby Harry's eyes and a raw, jagged scar on his forehead. Teenage Harry peers through a doorway as Snape raises his wand and completes two circles in the air, creating white wisps of cloud that gather to form a Patronus in the shape of a beautiful silver doe. It leaps out through a window, and longingly, Snape watches it leave as Dumbledore spins around, mouth agape. Snape rocks Lily's lifeless body in his arms, his face somber. In the forest, Harry sees the doe approach, and the black swirls and the Pensieve return. Harry lifts his head out of the bowl, his eyes wide and anxious. Dazed, he slowly backs away, holding his hand to his heart, then sits down on a step, his face unshaven and dirty, staring ahead blankly. He sits motionless, then walks downstairs along pathways cleared amongst the rubble. He turns on a landing and sees Hermione and Ron sitting together on a step further down. He pauses, stares at them, and descends. They start to follow him, and Hermione holds Ron's arm, fighting back tears. She rushes forward and flings her arms around Harry's neck. Over her shoulders, Harry glances at Ron, who lowers his gaze for a moment. Hermione unwraps her arms from around Harry, and they separate. Harry takes his leave, and Ron moves over to Hermione. Side by side, they watch as Harry slowly makes his way down the stone staircase. Outside, Harry walks slowly across the deserted courtyard, where the remnants of flickering fires cast his shadow before him. He enters The Forbidden Forest, treading carefully, and stops by a tree.",
    "1365": "Debbie gets out of the shower, followed by Pete, who sneaks down the hallway and kisses Sadie (13) to wake her, but she wants to be left alone as Pete breathes all over her while talking. Pete lifts a sleeping Charlotte (8) out of bed, walks her downstairs in a ridiculous manner due to her being too tall to be held like a baby, and they set up a tray of muffins and donuts on the table, decorating the room with birthday balloons and streamers, with Pete occasionally sneaking bacon, cupcakes, and mini donuts into his mouth. The house appears more cluttered and messier than previously depicted in Knocked Up. Debbie opens a window and sneaks a cigarette while Sadie watches Lost on her iPad and Pete and Debbie talk in the kitchen; Pete clears the breakfast dishes, turns on the faucet, and pours water on a cupcake. Meanwhile, Charlotte plays the theme from The Office on her keyboard, and Sadie tears apart her closet looking for clothes. Debbie is in workout gear when Pete enters wearing a lycra outfit with multiple logos. As Debbie leaves, Pete picks the soaking wet cupcake out of the sink and takes a bite. Debbie then runs up a long flight of stairs with her trainer Jason while her friend Barb trails behind. We then see Pete in a large group of bikers riding down San Vicente with his friend Barry, narrowly avoiding a collision when a car makes a right turn in front of him, prompting him to bang on the back of the car. Meanwhile, Debbie is doing sit-ups while talking to Jason, who holds her feet down, with Barb stretching on a yoga ball in the background and Jason demonstrating exercises. Pete and Barry eat frosted scones, enjoying some alone time to delay returning home. The family is driving with Sadie watching an episode of Lost on an iPad, and, during a violent scene, Charlotte grabs for Sadie’s iPad and starts trying to lick her. Pete and Debbie get out of the car and walk down the street into a store where they see their two employees, Jodi and a new, gorgeous employee named Desi, who is up on a ladder. Debbie goes behind the register, looks at Jodi, while Pete is still staring at Desi before he walks over to Debbie. Desi then comes down to help a customer at the front of the store. We see quick cuts of Debbie playing with the kids on the trampoline outside, doing a full flip and landing on her feet, with Pete nowhere to be found. Finally, Debbie walks down the hall and into the bathroom without knocking.",
    "422": "The Kentucky-bound train rolls down the track while Bert and Eddie finish their breakfast coffee in the dining room. Sarah is in the washroom and then makes her way down the aisle to join them at the table, where she stands silently, absorbing an insult. Bert gets up and reaches into his pocket for his billfold as Eddie and Sarah just stare at him. Later, they are at a table sipping drinks, with Bert shuffling a deck of cards as he talks and Eddie, like a schoolboy, listening intently, while Sarah sits apart, watching them both. Eddie glances at Sarah, who stares mutely at Bert, and then he reaches across to light Bert's cigarette with the lighter Sarah gave him while Bert's own lighter is on the table before him. Sarah sees it, picks it up, and sparks it into flame as Bert goes back to shuffling his deck of cards. The lobby is thronged with gamblers, their women, sportsmen, and tourists, all there for the Derby, with a jazz combo audible over the din of their voices. Eddie, looking excited, leads Sarah through the crowd with Bert behind them, his face now shaded by dark glasses, as he follows a bellhop to the main desk, forcing his way through people to get there and displaying a neatly folded wad of money in his hand. Eddie laughs and moves toward the open door leading to the billiard rooms, his face glowing as he watches the flow of men moving in and out of the crowded room, and hears the sound of clicking pool balls while tucking his cue case under his arm. He then turns to Bert and Sarah, who join him, before Sarah turns toward the elevators with Bert behind her, jiggling his keys. The bellboy unlocks the door, allowing Sarah to enter as the doors to the other suite are open. As she catches sight of Bert arranging things with the bellboy, she closes one door, and the bellboy leaves as she moves to close the other. Bert comes to the door, holding it open, and then turns away, leading to a long pause as he glares at her before going back into his room. Sarah closes the door and leans against it as screams are heard while the horses jerk out of the starting gate to begin their runs. Eddie cashes in a winning ticket and moves through the ornate racetrack bar to join Sarah at a table, where she has been drinking. As she puts the money in her purse, Bert sits down, and we see Findley studying his program and holding a drink, appearing tall and refined, with a pale, debauched, yet oddly youthful face that some men over forty sometimes have, while a cork-tipped cigarette dangles from his fingers.",
    "1270": "Harry and Ron are standing by Dobby's grave when Bellatrix approaches them, and we find that Hermione has transformed to look exactly like Bellatrix. Reluctantly, Griphook slides the sword into her bottomless bag as she joins Harry and Ron, who is disguised as a long-haired, bearded Death Eater. Ron holds out his hand, palm upwards, and Hermione and Harry grasp his outstretched hand; Harry then turns to Griphook, who places his hand on the others. They apparate in a dark and gloomy street by Gringott's Bank, where a cloaked man spots Hermione, who walks ahead of the others, but the cloaked man moves away. Harry bends down, and Griphook climbs on his back as Ron flings the invisibility cloak over them. Standing in the imposing banking hall, Hermione glances anxiously back at Ron, then stares wide-eyed at the rows of goblin tellers ahead of them, teetering in her unaccustomed heeled shoes. As a goblin teller looks up, she tries to look austere as she swaggers along, with Ron, wearing a long, black coat, walking behind her with his head bowed, and hidden under the invisibility cloak, Harry and Griphook follow. Harry spots an armed guard, and we note that Hermione, like Bellatrix, has a strand of long black hair over her right eye as she stops in front of a wizened old goblin behind a high desk. The goblin continues to write in his ledger as she regards him haughtily with arms folded. He looks down at her, then turns and leaves his desk while a teller looks up, and Griphook whispers to Ron, who sees an armed guard slowly pacing toward them. The old teller returns to his desk with Bogrod, a bespectacled goblin, and under the cloak, Harry and Griphook have moved nearer the desk and stand beside Bogrod. Harry casts a spell, and Bogrod's demeanor changes as he smiles benignly. Griphook is driving a cart along a twisting rail track, hurtling through dark, underground tunnels, with Harry and Ron sitting on his right and Hermione on his left, and Bogrod, in his happy, mesmerized state, sitting behind his fellow goblin facing back of the track. Traveling at incredible speed, the cart's single headlight illuminates a waterfall gushing beneath the track. Griphook brakes desperately as the track twists down towards the waterfall; they pass through the cascade, and the rail-cart comes to a halt, activating an alarm. They're tipped out of the cart and plummet, but they stop falling, then land safely, and all five get to their feet and look up at the cart as it trundles away. Harry turns to Ron and Hermione, and Ron recast the spell on Bogrod, who smiles benignly again, as Ron leads them in semi-darkness towards a cavern where a huge, gray, spiky dragon lies chained on the ground, and Griphook takes something from an opened wooden crate and hands it to Ron.",
    "1260": "Two safety guys stand by as Carl dives off and free-falls hundreds of feet towards a river, then gets whipped back up by the heavy-duty elastic. Waving his arms, Carl swings back and forth beneath the giant, curved bridge supports and takes out his phone. Meanwhile, Wes is on a golf course and hands his phone to a caddy. At Norm's, there's a Sparta-themed party where Norm wears a red cape, holds a shield and spear, and later sits weeping with Carl beside him, looking anxious with his hand on Norm's shoulder. Norm wears a false beard and mustache, which starts slipping, and Carl sticks it back in place before looking down humbly. At home, Carl checks his answer phone. At the Bigfoot Lodge, the sign shows an ominous figure in a forest, and Carl stands outside the entrance looking pensive. Peter and Lucy walk up, and Carl leads them inside where he and Peter dance. Janet offers a piece of cake to Lee, and Faranoush looks again. Norm leans against the bar, looking morose, and Carl taps him on his left shoulder and leans round to his right, at which Norm bows. Norm dances around with his hand on Soo-Mi's shoulder as they walk off, and Lucy is with a group of friends. Carl catches her eye, smiles, and waves. Lucy points around the room and gives Carl a big thumbs-up, and they share a fond smile. Sitting alone at a table, Carl makes a phone call while Allison is at an exhibition of her photos, opens and then closes her phone as a woman looks at a photo of Carl sprawled on the ground. Allison smiles tightly, and the woman raises her eyebrows. Peter sits next to Carl and smiles. Meanwhile, Rooney stands at the bar alone, and Tillie walks up and smiles at him broadly, while he looks at her warily and then has a drink, knocks back a shot, and ushers her out of the bar, looking back cautiously as he goes. Carl arrives home, she kisses him, and he responds, kisses her for a moment, then pulls away sharply, looking pained. Carl gets into an elevator, presses a button, the doors close, and as the elevator descends, the light flickers. Carl looks up, the elevator stalls, and the doors open to reveal it's stuck below the level of the floor. Carl clambers out, walks off along the hall looking around cautiously, and as he walks across the forecourt, a black cat runs past behind him. Carl stumbles onto a car bonnet and sees a guy hooking his car up to a tow truck, realizing the guy is himself. Carl runs from his hallucination as Terrence drives away from a hotel with Carl popping up in the back of the car, and Terrence hits the gas.",
    "1340": "Valjean and Cosette turn into a street that is walled in by high windowless houses, and then Valjean sees a nearby lamp bracket. The narrow street turns and opens out onto the river, but they follow it around a corner to find a dead end, so Valjean stops. A high wall is before them and they are trapped. Valjean looks around, and once on the top, he hauls Cosette up by the rope. A cloister appears as he sings, he walks out onto the roof and stands by the symbol of the HQ, a monumental stone eagle. He looks down at the lights reflected in the river below and then up at the great city. The fine ladies and grand gentlemen in the carriages avert their eyes or raise the blinds of their carriage windows to shut out the sight of the losers of their world. Gavroche, bounding over their heads and evading the swipes of liveried footmen, lands on the running board of one particularly grand carriage and begs or taunts the rich. Still running with Gavroche as he hops onto the back of another very grand carriage, the traffic now moving at last, he hitches a ride on the back—one or two of his gang hop on back of the carriage with him, while others run panting after to hear his political lecture. The carriage reaches an arch into a courtyard where a crowd of a couple of hundred is gathered outside a house of sickness. The carriage stops as its occupant wants to watch what is going on. Gavroche jumps off as the carriage stops and joins the crowd made up of citizens of Paris, student revolutionaries, the poor, and beggars. The students hand out printed leaflets and try to excite the crowd, and a student, Enjolras, stands on a raised step making an impassioned speech with fellow student Marius. A priest is seen hurrying into the house accompanied by two altar boys. In the crowd, a young street girl, Eponine, has her eyes fixed longingly on the handsome Marius. The occupant of the stopped carriage is Monsieur Gillenormand, Marius' grandfather, who is clearly deeply unhappy to see his grandson engaged in such an activity. Mounted police ride in to break up the crowd, and Marius turns to see his grandfather staring him down, furious. Gillenormand turns to get back in his carriage. Through a crack in a door, we see Marius sitting on a tatty mattress in a tiny hovel of a room, taking out a hunting rifle from under the mattress, wrapped in a rag. His eye is caught by the family crest ring on his finger, and close on a signet ring, Marius stares at it then takes it off his finger.",
    "1253": "Rows of film studio buildings are reflected in the shiny gold surface of a shield with the letters WB at its center, followed by a series of 3D metallic Vs, one inside the other. A brown-haired guy in his 40s, Carl, rejects a call from an unknown caller, stares down blankly, tenses, takes the phone out again, hangs up again, then takes his phone out and fumbles, accidentally answering it and sighing. He holds it to his ear, turns to the window, and sees Peter wave. Carl moves his mouth, grumpily hangs up, and is then at the Bigfoot Lodge where a ring causes everyone to turn and gawk. The guy nuzzles her as Carl eyes Rooney, with Ted and Stephanie frowning at him. He bashes into a waitress and slips, ending up on the floor with a tray of drinks. He stands up, stiff as a board, and trudges off past a crowd of staring people. At home, Carl dons a suit jacket and studies his reflection in the mirror, pops a name badge into his pocket, then smiles at himself. As he leaves his apartment, a small white-haired woman creeps up behind him and smiles. Outside a cafe, a guy bins a flyer as Carl sits at his computer and spots a colleague springing out of his chair, with Norman hanging up. Carl swallows and, outside the bank, he rejects another call from an unknown caller, sits down on a wall, and takes out a leaflet. Carl frowns as Nick leans over him, lobs the rock, and is open-mouthed as two security guards run out of the building, one taking him down and the other leaping on top. Nick leaps over a wall as Carl is in his car rejecting an unknown caller and winds up his window as a guy selling oranges approaches and then passes the man outside the cafe. At his desk, Carl browses DVDs in the video store, sits alone on the sofa in his smart apartment, and watches a film. He frowns, pauses the film, goes to the door, and peeps through the spyhole as Peter hurries off, shutting his door with a worried expression. Peter and Rooney enter Carl’s flat, Rooney goes to the fridge, and Peter heads over towards the sofa, furrows his brow, and studies something. Carl is contorted but stiff, a fly lands on his eye, and he wakes from his nightmare and sits up with a start on the couch, wide-eyed and disheveled. He stares into space miserably, swallows, frowns, and thoughtfully gazes down at something on the table, examining it as he makes his way towards the rows of seats and sits down. On two screens, Carl jumps out of his skin.",
    "974": "She glances around and frowns to herself, her lips parted. She answers her cell as the front door opens and David enters. She waves at David and nods at the phone; David hands her a cup of coffee and then fixes his own coffee in the kitchen of the one-room flat. She hangs up, noticing her phone shows four missed calls from Adrian. David looks up knowingly, his thoughtful gaze drifting as she glances aside and her lips spread into a sad smile. David blinks and moves to a chair at her bedside, as she meets his gaze. Swallowing hard, Elise averts her eyes. As she looks at him again, she smiles wistfully while David gives her a contented look. Her eyes glimmer with tears as she meets his gaze and David crooks a smile. Elise's smile fades as she stares into David's earnest eyes, and they gaze tenderly at each other before blinking and David looks away. He juts out his jaw, then locks eyes with her. Now Elise sits in a green room as, in the studio, David shakes Jon Stewart's hand and waves to the audience. Meanwhile, a guy in a ball cap enters the green room, Elise's shoulders sag as the man leaves, and she collects her belongings. Now as David leaves the studio, the man in the ball cap opens the door for him. David texts as he walks through the doorway, and lifting his gaze from his phone, he finds himself in the Adjustment Bureau warehouse. He whips around to the closed door but finds it locked, tries another one, then attempts to lift a loading bay door. Now David sits with his back against a support beam, and as he stares off, a figure appears—the steely-eyed adjustment officer approaches. Rising, David stares at him and looks Thompson in the eyes as Thompson paces away from him. David follows, observing Thompson standing still, his thoughtful eyes blinking, shifting his gaze to a bay door which begins to rise. With a determined look, David hurries past Thompson to the exit as the adjustment officer blinks his disapproving eyes. Meanwhile, at Cedar Lake, dancers perform on one section of a low, L-shaped stage, twirling gracefully while male dancers leap across the other section, drop to their knees, and spin. David rides in the back of a cab, his eyes shifting to his window as the city's glimmering lights glide past. The taxi slows in front of Cedar Lake, and now David enters the dance studio, joining a group of patrons standing near a tiered section of stage. Elise sits on the top platform, her feet resting on a bench below it; as she hunches forward, a group of dancers gathered behind her lifts her into the air.",
    "710": "Spider-Man hits wreckage and glides off it as if it were a ramp, landing on top of the van and hitting Flint with a volley of wet balls. Flint punches Spider-Man off the roof, and although Spider-Man clings on, Flint punches him into the truck. As the van heads for a collision, Spider-Man pulls the guards out, firing a thread out of the back of the van, which flints and crashes into a parked truck. Flint watches from the edge of a building above as Spider-Man staggers out of the red van, looking around frantically. As Flint moves off, the rescued guards drop from a web spun across the street. Spider-Man wheezes up to the ledge of a building, pulls off his mask, and shakes sand from his hair, then pulls off his left boot and shakes out some more sand. Later in the evening, Peter, dressed smartly in a sober suit with his dark hair swept across in a neat side parting, stops a few feet away from the entrance of the restaurant constellation and pulls Aunt May's ring out of his breast pocket. Looking agitated, Mary Jane strides up alongside a newsstand and storms off with a face like thunder. Inside the restaurant, Peter takes in the opulent splendor as diners and waiters flip past him, walking across the reception area where he's summoned by a maitre d' behind a small counter. The maitre d' has brought a pen on a silver platter, examining it with dark, beady eyes as Peter hands him a note. Clenching his fist, the maitre d' then leads Peter to a table before scurrying away. Peter snaps out of his role play as he sees Mary Jane coming towards him in a little black dress. He shows her to her seat and chivalrously pulls out her chair for her, then spots simpering blonde Gwen waving at him and waves back. The maitre d' summons the champagne, but Peter hurriedly shakes his head, leading the maitre d' to wave the waiters away. Gwen waves at Peter as she walks away, and he waves back again. The maitre d' takes this as the signal, and helpless waiters are called off again as Peter shakes his head. The maitre d' bringing the champagne glasses passes Mary Jane as she storms out. Peter stares after Mary Jane in shock as the maitre d' sets the glasses down on the table and the waiter brings a champagne bucket. As a violinist serenades him, Peter picks up Mary Jane's glass and fishes the ring out of it with a fork, then dries the ring with a napkin.",
    "240": "He starts to scale a wall, looking as though he's getting away, but there's a floodlight on the SS vehicle that flares into light, swivels, and finds the man. A volley of shots follows, and the man drops from the wall, dead. The SS men get into the vehicle and speed off, driving over the dead bodies. Szpilman and Henryk stare at the scene, silent and shocked, with the only sounds being the weeping of the people opposite and, nearer, Mother crying softly. Szpilman, as if in another world, plays the piano in a cafe full of customers, although the atmosphere is much more subdued than previously, and the mood is sombre. A doorman with a cudgel beats away the beggars from the door as Halina, distraught and out of breath, runs to the cafe entrance, and the doorman lets her in. Szpilman snaps out of his reverie, seeing Halina, in a state of great anxiety, beckoning urgently across the heads of the customers. Szpilman quickly brings the piece to a close, stands, steps off the platform, and threads his way through to Halina, who is shivering and almost unable to speak. Szpilman starts running through crowded streets filled with corpses, sweating and dodging, sidestepping people until a woman, the Feather Woman, bars his way, her brightly rouged cheeks and thickly painted eyebrows beneath an unsteady mauve ostrich feather rising from her straw hat. He tries to dodge past, but she grabs his arm. Szpilman manages to free himself and runs on to a mob of men in front of a building, being herded by Jewish policemen. More and more captive men are brought in by the German Schutzpolizei (Shupos), and the mob constantly swells. Szpilman reaches the back of the crowd and scans the mob, seeing the Jewish policemen using batons and whips to herd the men. Szpilman becomes alert, as he's seen someone he recognises—Heller, with his red hair and Hitler moustache, wielding a baton and driving men into the building. With difficulty, Szpilman pushes his way through the mob and gets nearer to Heller, who glances around and shoves someone aside so Szpilman can approach while he continues to beat and manhandle people. Heller just glares at Szpilman and then moves away, leaving Szpilman standing, jostled by the crowd, uncertain and forlorn. Szpilman, keeping to the shadows of the alleyway, watches the front of the building where there are comings and goings, with German soldiers in evidence, and the mob is smaller now. Szpilman waits and watches as a poor woman passes, carrying a can wrapped in newspaper, followed by a ragged old man dragging himself along. The ragged old man, shivering with cold and showing his purple feet through the holes in his shoes, suddenly lunges forward and tries to grab the can from the poor woman.",
    "268": "A hand grenade pin hangs, glinting, from one of his fingers, as pawing at Lenny's chest he must have hooked his finger through its ring. Reacting and reacting to Hi reacting, he looks down to see the bandoliers across his chest with silver pins glinting in all the grenades except one, where its squeeze-lever juts at a right angle. Hi's jaw drops and the lit cheroot hits the ground between his boots. Scrambling to his feet and trying to drop the shotguns to free his hands, in his panic his fingers tangle in the trigger guards. Starting to run, he finally frees his hands and dives behind the parked car. His hands fly in to wrap around the grenade, but too late, bright light blows sky-high. There is a roar, as if the earth were cracking open, and flame, as if hell were slipping out. We pan the fire to the sky where a white aluminum ladder rises up into the blackness, clanking softly. The top of the ladder arcs toward the camera. Late at night, the nursery is dark and empty, of the unpainted crib with the burned-in names: Harry, Barry, Larry, Garry, and Nathan Jr. As we pull back from the headboard, Ed's arms gently deposit the sleeping Nathan Jr. into the crib. Hi puts the singed copy of Dr. Spock's Baby and Child Care next to the baby as he and Ed look sadly down at the baby. The silence is broken by the bleat of a squeeze-me toy as the lights are snapped on, startling Hi and Ed. Nathan stands in his jammies, hair disheveled, holding a gun and squinting against the light, keeping the gun trained on Hi and Ed as he slowly raises a pair of eyeglasses to his nose and advances cautiously into the nursery, gesturing with his gun. Hi and Ed back away from the crib as Nathan peers in, studies the baby for a moment, lays the gun down, tenderly picks up the baby, and holds him to his chest with a tear forming at the corner of his eye. Hi and Ed quietly move back towards the ladder as he bounces the baby, studying Hi and Ed, and Hi shrugs. Nathan turns to put the baby back in the crib, turns around with a thought, and Hi does a small take, surprised at this much integrity. She stands looking into the crib, and Hi steps up next to her and puts an arm around her shoulder. Ed starts crying softly as she gazes into the crib, and Hi murmurs something to comfort her. Nathan is studying the two of them as Hi turns to face him and speaks in a rush. Nathan looks at her, finally nods, and sighs.",
    "255": "A disheveled young man in a gaily colored Hawaiian shirt is launched into frame by someone offscreen, as the hatch marks on the wall behind him are apparently height markers. His picture is taken, and it is mounted on a tripod. A pretty young woman in a severe police uniform peers out from behind it. HI obliges but still looks at Ed out of the corner of his eye, on his eye-skewed profile, as Hi is escorted away from the camera toward his cell. At the far end of the corridor, a huge con is sluggishly mopping the floor, and the Mopping Con snarls as Hi passes. Panning a circle of men who sit facing each other in folding chairs, the pan starts on Hi. At this point, the pan has reached the COUNSELOR, an earnest, bearded young man who straddles a folding chair with his arms folded over its back; he is addressing one of the Cons. The huge muscle-bound black man with a shaved head is knitting his brow in consternation. Three PAROLE OFFICERS - two men and a woman - face Hi across a table. A beat-up Chevy pulls into the all-night store's empty parking lot, and Hi is getting out of the Chevy in a Hawaiian shirt, holding a pump-action shotgun. He primes the shotgun - WHOOSH - CLACK - and heads for the store. Full-face exposure of Hi once again in front of the mug-shot wall. Hi obliges but shoots sympathetic glances at Ed who is obviously upset, wiping away tears and snuffling behind the camera, on Hi's profile. He turns back to Ed, looking up through her tears as Hi is led away, as another police officer starts to lead him away, struggling to call back over his shoulder as he is firmly led out the door. The door slams, as Hi is once again escorted toward his cell. The Mopping Con is now in the middle-background, having worked his way about halfway up the corridor since last time we saw him as Hi passes, and Hi looks sheepish. Two convicts sitting next to each other, GALE and EVELLE, appear to be friends. Hi faces the same three PAROLE OFFICERS across the same table. Of a 7-Eleven parking lot, at night, deserted except for Hi's car which sits untended, its engine rumbling, Hi backpedals into frame with a shotgun and a bag of cash. He spins and grabs his car-door handle, locked. He tries the back door, locked. As we hear the wail of an approaching siren, Hi takes it on the heel and toe. On Hi against the mug-shot wall, we see his right hand being efficiently manipulated by Ed's two hands: She is rolling each of his inked fingers into the appropriate space on an exemplar sheet.",
    "1118": "The car heads straight towards the ground as they both wrestle with the gear stick and Ron waves his wand desperately, but it snaps. The car heads towards an ancient willow tree standing in the school grounds and plunges onto the top branches. High in the tree, the car rocks precariously and falls backwards, getting stuck halfway down. Ron holds up his broken wand as hefty willow branches attack the car, causing the vehicle to rock and the windscreen to shatter. A branch smashes through the back window, and branches attack from all angles, showering them with broken glass. The car suddenly tips forward, bounces from branch to branch, and falls towards the ground, landing on the grass. Ron presses the accelerator and the car zooms away. The tree lunges after them, but they escape its clutching branches. Clear of the angry willow, the boys breathe a sigh of relief. Suddenly, the car doors fly open and they are hurled out onto the grass. The boot opens, throwing out their trunks and luggage. Harry catches Hedwig's cage, and Ron peers anxiously at his pet rat. The car starts, the doors shut, and the battered car drives itself across the grass towards a stone archway. Harry and Ron race after it as it rolls down a cobbled passageway and zooms away towards the forest, leaving Ron and Harry far behind. Later, they haul their luggage into school and leave it on the landing before running upstairs. Filch, the caretaker, with his cat Mrs. Norris, is standing at the top of the stairs. Hogwarts School is housed in a handsome castle surrounded by stone outbuildings and long Victorian greenhouses. In one of these, a class of students stands waiting around a long bench filled with rows of potted plants as a short, plump woman with curly, gray hair in a brown smock and a matching tall, pointed hat enters wearing a pair of earmuffs. The root looks like an ugly baby as they cover their ears. A boy collapses as they pull out the screaming roots. Showing off, Draco Malfoy pokes his finger into his Mandrake's mouth and it bites him; furious, he throws it into a pot. Later, in the corridor, the ghost of Sir Nicolas floats into the Great Hall where the students are sitting at long tables while Ron is trying unsuccessfully to mend his broken wand with sticky tape. A boy takes a photograph as a tatty gray owl flies down into the room, swooping low over the table towards Ron but colliding with a bowl and scattering crisps everywhere. Draco and his cronies snigger as Ron takes a red envelope from Errol's beak. Ron nervously breaks the seal on the red envelope, and to his embarrassment, it starts to scream at him.",
    "1059": "At school, young women walk with books balanced on their heads, lead to dance, and circle the hall in pairs. Later, they use whisks in the cookery class. Heavy snow is falling as a teenage girl with long dark hair walks down a suburban street in school uniform. Girls play hula hoop in the playground, breathe on a cold window, make foot shapes in condensation, and play lacrosse. Inside, the girls daydream and doze in class, while one girl scratches the back of her ankle with her other foot, and a graphic paper plane flies into a bin. The girls continue to daydream and look bored. At home, her father sips his juice. Jenny attends orchestra practice, where a young boy next to her on violin stares at her, and she waves to an older fresh-faced lad in the violin section. The youngsters tease, and Jenny sighs in frustration. Jenny and the violinist exchange glances as they play. Later, Jenny frowns at the sky as she leaves orchestra practice, stands getting soaked at the bus stop, and a car speeds past, nearly hitting a woman with a pram and a young boy. The car pulls over beside Jenny, and she avoids eye-contact with the handsome driver who gets out, runs around to put the cello in the back seat, and gets back behind the wheel. He drives beside her at walking pace, and she hops into the passenger seat. David changes gear, and they arrive on Jenny's tree-lined street. A large black car overtakes them, and David nods, giving a tight smile. Jenny smiles and gets out of the car. Lying on the floor of her room, Jenny sings along with the record which spins on a small player on the floor. She winces as Graham flounders, resorting to his tea. On another day, Jenny finds a card in a large bouquet of flowers; her father frowns, while her mother smirks as Jenny strides off on the garden path. David crosses the road in front of them. Jenny agonizes, but they shake hands, and she heads back to her friends. They sit awkwardly in the living room, where Jack studies David, who gallantly kisses Marjorie's hand. David and Jenny run through the London rain, up stone steps to the concert venue where men and women pair up and go in. Jenny admires glamorous blonde Helen and touches her fur stole as the pair walk off together, with Helen tapping Jenny playfully on the shoulder. Jenny and David listen with rapt attention to the concert, while Helen looks unimpressed and sleepy, and Danny concentrates serenely. Jenny smiles to herself as she listens. Later, everyone files out of the concert hall, and they walk to the nightclub, where a platinum blonde singer fronts the band.",
    "613": "A flustered man looks down at Elizabeth, then lifts his chin, flutters his eyelids, and steps over her. Alison gives him the A-OK and he walks on. In a staff meeting, his coworkers look on stony-faced. He prods Alison's arm. Clayton rises from his seat at the head of the table and walks out. Alison raises a palm to Sidney. Clayton eats edamame beans and sushi at the desk in his office. He tries to ignore Sidney, who's tapping a notebook with a pen. He nods. Bill's eyes narrow and his expression hardens as a sheepish-looking Sidney sits opposite an indignant Clayton. Sidney's hopeful smile wanes. Clayton stares at Sidney, who furrows his brow and points at the door. Clayton nods and Sidney leaves. Alison reads as models pick outfits from a rack. Sidney plunks himself down beside her and sighs. Alison stares at him, scoffs, stands up, and flounces off with her nose in the air. Sidney makes eye contact with Lawrence and waves. Sidney's nose is taped up like a pig's snout. As Eleanor and Sophie approach, he tears the tape from his face and hides under his desk, then emerges from beneath the table with Sellotape stuck to his left ear. Sidney frowns and obediently toddles off. He fills a plastic container from a water cooler and stares at Sophie, who's cradling Cuba, screwing up his face slightly. Slighted, Eleanor gives him a piercing look and stomps off. His eyebrows twitch as he looks around, and Lawrence and Sophie follow Eleanor from the office. Sidney cautiously opens the door of an office and peers in to see Cuba staring back at him. He tosses the little red ball, which bounces out through an open window, and Cuba scampers after it. Sidney dives for the window and closes it, then smiles and looks up to see a large stone ornament. Sidney's eyes widen at the weighted, polished stone and, horrified, he bites his fist. He calls an elevator, and as she points, they grapple for it. A white paw sticks out as Sophie, Eleanor, and Lawrence are in reception. Sidney runs off and Alison follows to find Sidney leaning out of a window. He turns minus the bag. She turns to look at Sidney, who shrugs with arms folded. The search party heads off, leaving a relieved Sidney slumped against a wall by the window, as Cuba's nose sticks out of the leather handbag drifting up behind him on the window cleaner's rising platform. Sidney stands in the doorway of Clayton's office, sips whiskey, flings the blue shirts onto a desk, and peers down his nose at them, gesturing with a raised hand. Smiling, Clayton strolls up to him. Sidney leaves, then steps back in.",
    "908": "Purvis sits at the wheel while Anna averts her gaze, and Purvis stares at the helpless informant. She gets out of the car, and Purvis' gaze follows her as she walks around his vehicle. Holding a gun in his pocket, Dillinger peeks around a tree, wearing a straw boater hat and sporting a trimmed mustache. He steps out to meet Piquett, and they sit on a roadside park bench. Piquett reaches into his coat, and Dillinger unfolds the page to reveal a handwritten message that reads, \"I am too well guarded. Two years is not a long time anyway.\" Dillinger folds up the note, stands, and walks away while Piquett puts on his hat and heads off in the opposite direction. Now at a stone wall, Dillinger, Alvin Karpis, and other men look down at an idling steam locomotive as Alvin turns away from Dillinger, who stares ahead. Anna sits at the kitchen table fanning herself with a magazine, and Dillinger enters, crossing the room. Anna's fanning motion slows as her knowing gaze follows him. Dillinger glances around the living room, then returns to the kitchen, goes to the sink, and washes his hands. Anna glances at the door as Polly emerges, and Dillinger dries his hands with the towel and leads the way through the house to the front door. They leave, and our view returns to Anna, who remains at the table, covering her mouth with her hand. Madala crosses the field office to Purvis, who sits on a desk, and Purvis eagerly talks the call. As he listens, Winstead looks up from a newspaper, and Purvis lowers the phone, turning to his peers as the agents gather, with all eyes turning to Winstead. Madala checks a newspaper. Dillinger pulls up to a building with Polly, and they enter the building through a set of double doors, where she goes off, and Dillinger steps forward, casually chewing gum as he glances around. An elevator door opens, and Dillinger steps aboard among a few other men, including a uniformed officer, and he glances at the elevator operator as the door glides shut. He enters the quiet office, passing a row of empty chairs against the wall of a waiting area, with daylight shining in through a window. Dillinger hikes up his pants as he enters the main office, turning to a bulletin board where multiple mug shots of familiar criminals hang posted. He crosses to a desk and holds briefly by a secretary busy typing, and a couple of yards ahead, an agent on the phone sits at his desk, unaware of Dillinger's presence. The gangster finds another bulletin board and scans its postings, seeing a mug shot of Homer, photos of a robbed bank and a sprawled body, and a street map. A smile crosses Dillinger's lips as he passes through a brilliant shaft of sunlight.",
    "432": "She looks at Eddie anxiously as she digs in her purse for the coins. She pays, collects her purse and book, and rises to leave. The public address system bleats over the noise of the crowded luncheonette. The waitress leans over and slaps Eddie on the shoulder. He wakes up with a cramped neck. The bar is nearly empty when Eddie comes in. As he looks around the bar, he sees Sarah, alone at a back booth, sipping a highball. She seems amused by their encounter. He takes his drink and joins her at the booth. Sarah nods. There is a long pause as she tries to read his face. Eddie finishes his drink, rises, crosses to the bar, pays the bill, and returns to the booth. As they go out, Sarah stumbles, and he catches her by the arm. Eddie pauses a moment to register this as she limps off, then follows. Eddie goes into the liquor store. Sarah waits outside, stiff and uneasy. Then he comes out with the scotch and they walk off down the street together. They walk slowly, with their eyes pointed straight ahead. He tries to ignore her halting gait. They pass under the awning of the neighborhood's elegant Parisien restaurant. As she searches through her purse for her keys, he reaches out and puts his hand on her shoulder. She closes her eyes, then draws back against the door, fearful, like a threatened animal. He takes her head in his hands and kisses her. She responds but, as he holds her tighter, she starts to struggle. She pushes him away and shakes her head. They stand there for a long moment: she looks away; he looks down at the floor. Then Eddie takes the bag of scotch and places it underneath her arm. He leaves her there in the hall and walks off. A door opens. A hotel manager shows Eddie into a dingy, barely furnished room. He reaches in his pocket and pulls out some bills. Eddie removes his bags from the locker. The sight of the lunch counter reminds him of Sarah. But the lunchroom is empty; only the janitor is there, mopping up. Eddie picks up his bags and goes out. Eddie, on his way back to the hotel, stops at the same liquor store for a bottle. He enters his room, puts down his bags and the liquor, and sits on his rusted brass bed. From his pocket he pulls out the few crumpled bills he has left. He looks at the money, shakes his head disgustedly, and closes his eyes. It is a friendly, neighborhood bar for business people and cocktail drinkers. Eddie walks casually by the pool table and over to the bar.",
    "359": "The boy continues running as one by one the trees transform into tall white pillars. The boy now stands within a vision of the majestic architecture of the great Gondorian city of Minas. A silhouetted figure appears in the distance and moves towards the child. The boy runs to the figure. Arwen watches as the figure holds out its arms, swinging the laughing child into the air. The figure turns to reveal Aragorn, a little older, dressed in the casual finery of a Gondorian noble. The child, now in Aragorn's arms, looks directly at Arwen. It is a quiet look filled with infinite sadness. Arwen's eyes drop to the child's chest, where the Evenstar hangs around the child's neck. Arwen realizes she is staring at a future that can never be, the child she and Aragorn will never have. Elrond is speaking to his daughter. Arwen shuts her eyes, and when she opens them again, the vision is gone, and she is staring at dark trees once more. Arwen turns towards her companion, who stares at her, concerned. Arwen wheels Asfaloth around, riding away. Arwen's horse gallops over the bridge and through the gates into Rivendell. Elrond is seated alone as Arwen runs up the steps towards him. Elrond stands, stunned, as Arwen, breathing hard, walks towards him with a fierce light in her eyes. Elrond's face is grim. Her father turns away, staring into space as the fight seems to go out of him. He won't look at her, so Arwen gently takes her father's face in her hands and turns him toward her. A hooded figure ascends a curved staircase towards a gallery, stopping before a statue that holds the broken shards of an ancient sword in its arms. The blade, shattering in several fragments as Isildur brandishes Narsil at Sauron. The hooded figure looks up into the sorrowful face of the statue and the figure is revealed to be Arwen. Elrond stares at his daughter, unwavering. A broken sword glows with red heat, its blade in several fragments as a heavy hammer pounds the red-hot blade on an anvil while Elven-smiths temper the steel. Elrond's face is lit by flickering fire as sparks fly in the Rivendell forge. The sword is withdrawn from a pool of steaming water, light shimmering as the water drops slide down the blade of Narsil, the sword that was broken has been remade. Pippin is asleep with Gandalf's protective arm around him as Shadowfax thunders through the night. Shadowfax powers along the countryside, with Pippin huddled in front of Gandalf, the wind sailing through his hair. Shadowfax gallops up onto a low ridge, where before them is the dark mass of Mount Mindolluin, its tall white face whitening in the rising sun. Upon its outthrust knee is the Guarded City: Minas Tirith.",
    "1271": "The dragon rises and breathes fire, then cowers as Griphook shakes a bell. Ron shakes the bell given to him by the goblin, allowing them to ease past the dragon. They continue along a narrow passageway and reach a door, where Griphook presses Bogrod's hand into the locking mechanism, causing Bogrod to grin inanely as the door opens. The dragon belches flame as they enter the vault and close the door. Light appears at the tip of their three wands, revealing a vault filled with treasure, including gold and silver goblets, candlesticks, jewels, and stacks of coins. Harry walks further into the vault, moving ahead of the others, until he stops, turns his head, blinks, and stares up at a gold cup with two handles. Hermione dislodges a ring, which replicates, causing other objects to start replicating. Hermione throws the ring to Harry, who, catching it, wades through the growing mass of treasure. Up to his knees, Harry scrambles over the treasure towards the cup, which has now risen to waist height. Harry stretches the sword high above his head, reaching for the cup, but he disappears from sight, lost in a mountain of gold and silver treasure. The others remain stock-still as he stumbles and drops the cup. Griphook grabs it as Harry tosses him the sword and flings the cup to Hermione. Griphook presses Bogrod's hand against the door, and replicating treasure tumbles out through the open doorway, burying the three inside the vault. Griphook rings the bells to keep the dragon at bay. Harry struggles out of the vault and runs to a balustrade, while Griphook runs off, leaving the grinning Bogrod alone with the dragon, which raises its head and breathes fire, incinerating Bogrod. Armed guards rush in, throwing explosive bursts from their wands, as Hermione destroys the balustrade and, taking a run-up, leaps through the opening onto the dragon's back. Clinging to its spikes, she hauls herself up as the beast belches flame and goblins take cover. Ron and Harry are still by the vault and leap onto the dragon's back. Hermione's spell releases the dragon's chains, and it breathes fire, looking up towards a pinprick of light high above. The three friends cling on desperately as the dragon climbs towards the light, while a guard shoots from an approaching rail cart, which the dragon knocks off the track with its head, causing the cart and its passengers to plummet. All is quiet in the banking hall as rows of tellers pore over ledgers, and above their heads, a chandelier starts to sway. A teller looks up as the dragon bursts through a grating in the floor, causing guards and goblins to flee the flames. The dragon's head hits the chandelier as the three cling on while it bursts its way through a glass dome onto the roof.",
    "784": "Kevin arrives and stares at Jane before starting to sneak off, but George spots him, prompting Kevin to turn and feign surprise as Jane's smile fades. Meanwhile, an aging Volvo speeds through the rainy night with its headlights blazing, swerves alarmingly, and slides backward down a grassy slope, narrowly missing a tree. It comes to a halt, leaving the occupants frozen in shock, and as the tires spin in the wet ground, they stick their cell phones out the windows, trying to get a signal while not looking at each other. Kevin and Jane arrive soaking wet at a bar, where Jane checks the public telephone but indicates with a roll of her eyes that it's not working, so they head to the bar. Kevin flops onto a barstool, and two empty glasses hit the bar as Jane grins at him and gawks, causing Kevin to be taken aback. They grin tipsily as the locals enjoy their goofy performance, urging them on as they dance on the bar with Jane barefoot and Kevin coming up with wacky dance moves. Kevin jumps down, leaving Jane dancing wildly to the crowd's delight, then helps her down as she lurches drunkenly, and he stops her from falling. They stare into each other's eyes, and Jane kisses him hard and passionately. They continue kissing in the Volvo, tearing off each other's soaking wet clothes. The next day, Kevin strolls down the grassy slope with two coffees, while the early sun reflects off the car windows, and Jane is still asleep in the mud-spattered vehicle. He looks around nonchalantly before they go to a diner. Kevin's expression freezes as Jane crumples up a paper, throws it at him, and leaves, staring at him with bitter disappointment before turning on her heel and leaving. Kevin walks back to the diner with his face in his hands and later strides into the newspaper offices to approach Maureen, leaving angry and frustrated. Jane arrives at her apartment, overturns a chair, throws the phone, screws up the paper, stomps on it, and sits staring miserably into space. At the office, she picks up her messages, runs her hands through her shoulder-length hair, and throws her arms defensively. Casey comes in, and they exchange a worried look before Jane walks slowly toward George's office, where he places a caring hand on her shoulder to escort her out. Tess is at the bridal shop, and Jane is puzzled as she walks over to Tess looking horrified, while Tess looks puzzled as Jane walks out. Tess pouts and flounces back to her fitting room, tripping over her hem as lights begin to decorate the evening cityscape and a taxi drops Jane off at the restaurant where guests are gathering for the engagement party.",
    "1378": "Harry sees something shining in the distance and moves towards it as Viktor tries to zap him but misses, and then Harry ducks and Viktor gets zapped by Cedric. Cedric runs up and kicks the wand out of Viktor's hand and points his wand at Viktor's body as if to finish him off. Harry runs up and intervenes, and they struggle before the two of them begin running towards the cup. The undergrowth grabs Cedric and he falls to the ground, causing Harry to look back and see Cedric is pinned down with no means of escape. Harry zaps the plant life, helping Cedric wriggle free, and then assists him up. The wind starts blowing again, and Harry and Cedric have ported to a graveyard. Harry lets out a shout and holds his head in pain, as Wormtail and Voldemort appear nearby. Wormtail casts a spell and kills Cedric, leaving Cedric dead on the ground. Wormtail pulls Harry closer and a statue grabs hold of Harry, trapping him. Wormtail drops something into a cauldron as Harry watches, and a bone hovers in the air under Wormtail's control, dropping into the cauldron. Wormtail slashes his arm over the cauldron, and then takes the knife to Harry, cutting at his arm, prompting Harry to shout. Wormtail lets the drops fall into the cauldron, which bursts into flame, and a reformed Voldemort emerges. Wormtail hands him the wand and bows deeply, looking concerned but doing it anyway, before Voldemort sticks the wand into Wormtail's arm. The sky changes as others are summoned, and Voldemort begins slashing angrily at the hooded figures before granting Wormtail a new hand. As Harry struggles to get free, Voldemort puts his hand on Harry's head, making him scream, and then forces Harry to bow with magic, casting at him so he wriggles in pain. Voldemort pulls Harry to his feet, and as Harry begins to move away, he takes steps toward Voldemort. They both cast and their streams of magic meet, and they struggle as shapes form in the surrounding magical energy. The connection breaks and Harry runs over to Cedric's body, summoning the cup over to them, and in an instant they port out. Voldemort looks angry as Harry appears with Cedric's body back at the arena, where Harry weeps on Cedric's body as Amos breaks down wailing and the crowd looks on distraught. Mad-Eye Moody enters, closing the door behind him while Harry is still sobbing in the room. They sit, and Harry nods as we see his arm marked with a skull and snake. Mad-Eye starts shaking and struggling for air, reaching for his empty bottle before rushing to a chest with other bottles, struggling to find one. A flash of magic occurs and Mad-Eye is knocked into the wall.",
    "715": "He snaps his fingers and points to the car, then yanks open the car door, revealing empty seats. Smiling, Rose and Jack run onto the forward well deck. Rose places her hand on Jack's lips and gazes at him. They kiss. Standing at the bridge rail, Murdoch glances down at them, smiles, and walks off. Watching from the crow's nest, another man, Fleet, looks down and taps his comrade, Lee, on the arm. They stare down at Jack and Rose. The men turn and gaze past the ship. Their eyes widen as a large iceberg looms, straight ahead. Fleet rings the lookout bell three times and grabs a telephone, which rings on the bridge. The quartermaster at the wheel glances back at the phone. Officer Moody steps onto the bridge and answers the phone. Moody hangs up and turns to Murdoch as he runs to the bridge door. Quartermaster Hichens turns the wheel to the left. Murdoch rushes over to the engine room telegraph and shifts the handle to full speed astern. Hichens turns the wheel quickly. In the engine room, the chief engineer spots the telegraph shift and drops a pot of steaming soup. He turns the wheel until it stops. Murdoch hurries to the bridge rail and peers at the iceberg. In the engine room, an engineer yells. Other engineers scurry around. A red warning light flashes. Engineers slam the furnace dampers shut. Underwater, the ship's main propeller slows. An engineer pulls down a thick lever. All the propellers stop. An officer pushes an engineer out of the way and turns a wheel quickly to the right. The propellers spin in the opposite direction. In the crow's nest, the men stare at the iceberg as the ship heads straight toward it. Murdoch stares at the iceberg. Nearing the iceberg, the ship veers slowly to the left. The ship's propellers turn and reverse. Sweat trickles down Murdoch's temples. The ship's bow shifts to the left of the iceberg. At the bow railing, a man runs toward it. The ship scrapes along the side of the ice. Jack and Rose stop kissing as the ship trembles. On the bridge deck, Murdoch glances down at his hands, resting on the shaking rail. Above, Fleet holds onto the rim of the crow's nest, while Lee sits on the floor. In the bridge, Hichens keeps the wheel turned hard left. Below deck, Fabrizio sits up in his bunk. In the cargo hold, water shoots through a long tear in the hull. In the cabin, Andrews sits at his desk. He glances up at the trembling crystal chandelier above.

    "172": "He reaches for the script. Harry backs away, holds the script to his chest. Bo Catlett notices this. Bo Catlett eyes him a beat, then pushes out of his chair. Bo Catlett nods, gets up. Ronnie sits up straight. Ronnie opens his coat so that Harry can see a gun tucked in his belt. Bo Catlett gives Ronnie a look. Bo Catlett glances once more at Chili then follows Ronnie out the door. Harry stares at the door a moment, senses Chili staring at him. Chili looks at Harry. Chili shakes his head as Harry sits down in one of the chairs, fumbles for his cigarettes. Chili's minivan is parked out front. Obviously losing it now, rubs his eyes and quickly walks off to a row of payphones. Chili sits at the desk on the phone. They consider each other a moment until Chili finally checks his watch. Karen looks caught, doesn't answer right away. Chili lets that sink in a minute.

Chili reaches for the door, opens it and looks back at Leo. As Chili starts for the elevator. Chili drives a dark road up into the park. Chili pulls in behind a row of trailers. He gets out of the car and heads for the set where Harry is now looking up at the sky and yelling at someone. He rounds a corner, and we see an explosion of light up ahead as we come upon. As he starts back, he sees Leo's scared look just before he slams the door shut. Leo steps into his doorway. Chili shakes his head, starts back for the elevator. Chili stops, turns around. Chili says nothing, sits down in one of the red leather chairs. Bo Catlett smiles at him, doesn't give up the script. Bo watches as Chili picks up a copy of the script, begins flipping through it. Chili flips through the script, sees a name. Karen smiles, decides to wait a moment. Chili, lost in the movie, keeps mouthing the dialogue. As Tanya/Marlene Dietrich resumes her slow walk away, Karen sits down at the end of the row. People start getting up to leave. Chili turns to a guy a few seats away from him. The guy gives Chili a look, puts his arm around his date, and quickly starts up the aisle so that Chili can now see Karen sitting there at the end of the row. She gets up, they start up the aisle together. As Karen and Chili exit the theater, stand there a moment.",
    "831": "He goes inside, where Nick and Kurt are playing video games. The next night, a laid-back Nick strolls along a walkway at a Travel Inn. Clean-shaven with short dark brown hair, he wears jeans and a shirt with the sleeves rolled up. He comes to a room and knocks gently on the door, which Dale answers, leaving the security chain fastened. Nick grabbed him. Dale and Kurt run to the window and see a man dressed in black get out of a black muscle car, and Kurt and Dale share an excited look and clench their fists. Kurt pauses to compose himself, then opens the door and speaks as a sharp-suited man wearing dark glasses enters the room, takes off his shades, and throws a plastic sheet down. The guys are in Kurt's car as they drive into a rough neighborhood and near a bar. They enter the bustling bar filled with a shady clientele. Kurt nods to a musclebound guy as they head to the bar, to a Latino, and finally to the heavyset black barman, who bridles. A guy eyes them as they leave—the same guy from inside. They follow the black guy, who has a shaven head and several tattoos. Jones glares at them as Harken smashes his office wall down with a sledgehammer. With his extended office now complete, Harken removes a strip of clear plastic from a plaque on the door and buffs it with his sleeve. Nick glowers and then withdraws money from his bank account.

He's in his office while Kurt's in the main office and frowns as Bobby's bare torso presses up against the window. At home, Kurt raids a private stash of money. In the main office, Bobby looks over at Kurt, gives him the finger, and smooches with one of the women as Kurt frowns. Bobby's shirt is open, exposing his bloated stomach, and he holds up Hank's handicapped parking pass. At the dentist, Julia licks the back of Dale's neck, then sucks his left earlobe and jams her tongue in his ear. Dale furrows his brow as she tweaks his nipples, then grins and slaps his ass. Wearing a black hoodie and dark glasses, Dale withdraws money from a cash point in a gas station mini-mart. Later, the guys sit opposite Jones at a table in a dingy bar, pushing a large briefcase towards him. Jones opens it to find it empty apart from a small bundle of bank notes, snaps it shut, sips his drink, and beckons them closer. They lean forward as he reaches inside his jacket.",
    "322": "Aragorn warily approaches Boromir, who is motionless and stares at the ring as if transfixed, seemingly growing in stature as if absorbing its power. Boromir smiles at Frodo, ruffling his hair, and Aragorn unhands his sword. Following the crows as they race deeper and deeper, there is a vista of industry with hundreds of Orcs and writhing birthsacks flying past Saruman, who stands upon a wooden gantry. The Fellowship is struggling through a blinding blizzard, up towards the Pass of Caradhras, while Legolas the Elf moves lightly across the top of the snow, suddenly pausing. Merry and Pippin shiver in Boromir's arms, and Frodo meets Gandalf's eye, the weight of the decision weighing heavily upon him. The Fellowship is walking along the far shore of a dark lake directly below great looming cliffs, where the footing is treacherous on the narrow strip of green and greasy stones. Gandalf touches the smooth rock wall between the trees, and slowly, faint lines appear like slender veins of luminous silver running through the stone. A large moon rises over the mountains as the lines grow broader and clearer, forming a glowing arch of interlacing ancient letters and symbols. Gandalf raises his arms and eyebrows, and with that, the rock face silently divides in the middle, and two great doors swing outwards revealing a blackness deeper than the night. As the Fellowship enters the blackness, something in the water stirs. They step warily into the darkness of Moria, a dank cavern with winding steps leading deeper into the mountain. A glow from Gandalf's staff suddenly lights the chamber, and the Fellowship recoils in horror as many dwarf skeletons are strewn about, clearly the dead of some old battle, with rusting armor and shields peppered with arrows and axes. The Fellowship draws swords and backs away towards the entrance, but Frodo is suddenly pulled to the ground by a long sinuous tentacle wrapped around his ankle, dragging him towards the lake. Frodo cries out, and Aragorn and Boromir rush forward. Aragorn severs the tentacle holding Frodo and pulls him to safety, while Boromir hacks at the other writhing limbs. Twenty more tentacles ripple out of the lake as the dark water boils and the hideous beast lashes out at the Fellowship. Again the creature grabs Frodo and pulls him to the lake, flinging Frodo in the air as the Fellowship battles the creature. Aragorn hacks at a tentacle, releasing Frodo, who falls into Boromir's arms. Legolas shoots an arrow into the creature's head, gaining a few vital seconds for Aragorn and Boromir as they race out of the water with Frodo. The Fellowship hurriedly backs away from the creature, retreating into the Moria chamber as many coiling arms seize the large doors. With a shattering echo, the creature rips the doors away, creating a rock slide that crashes down the cliff face.",
    "834": "Nick watches from his car as Bobby jumps around by the window in silk pajamas, flailing a pair of nunchucks, and after considering for a moment, Dale sneaks through Harken's house carrying a jar of peanuts. He puts a light on in the bedroom, goes to the door of the on-suite bathroom, opens it, and a cat leaps out at him. He falls against the shower, picks up a bottle of shampoo, and his eyes move between the shampoo and the peanuts. Nick sees Bobby's bedroom lights go out, heaves a sigh, looks at his box of Rat Attack, and answers his phone. Bobby answers the door to Harken, who hands him his phone and shoots him in the chest. Nick ducks down in his car as Harken flees the scene in his 4x4, yanks his seatbelt but it won't budge, and panicking, Dale tidies Harken's shower soaps and legs it with the peanuts. A speed camera snaps a picture of Nick as he hurtles through a red light, and the guys meet in a bar before getting in Nick's car, only to have a squad car block them in. A black officer strolls over, taps on Nick's window, and peers in, leading to them being in the back of the cop car at the precinct where Dale, Kurt, and the two detectives stare at Nick, who frowns while Kurt's face drops as he recalls scrubbing his backside with Bobby's toothbrush. The guys find Jones drinking in the bar, and after Jones cocks an eyebrow and shoots them a look, they huddle closer as Jones smirks and sips his drink. They then ride in Kurt's car to Harken's house, sneak in, and Kurt squats by Rhonda, who smiles at him before Harken enters and stomps out of the room. Kurt heads for Rhonda, and as Kurt emerges from the bathroom with Rhonda close behind, Nick and Dale are in the car with cops nearby. Kurt drives off, and Harken rams them in his SUV twice, causing them to weave around a car. Julia is naked in a bath and masturbates, while Kurt accelerates, swerves wildly through traffic, and hangs a sharp left into an empty street. Harken smashes into them in his 4x4, setting off the airbags, and taps on the window with his revolver, which Kurt lowers. They get out, Harken holds them at gunpoint and then shoots himself, sinking to the floor and clutching his leg, as Dale tosses the gun down. The guys high-five, and as Harken goes for Kurt, Nick smacks him hard in the face, knocking him to the ground. Luke smirks, pats her, and she pulls the patient's trousers down.",
    "258": "At the same time, the little Cashier emerges from the 7-Eleven with his gun, and the two begin to shoot at Hi's retreating figure, with the Policeman's revolver popping and the Cashier's Magnum booming. Hi is huffing and puffing down the road with his Huggies as the cop car careens onto the street in the background, its siren wailing. The PASSENGER COP leans far out his window, one hand gripping the light-and-siren rack, the other pointing a gun at Hi, shooting away, as bullets whizz past. Suddenly, the Huggies box pops forward out from under Hi's arm, hit by a bullet with a soft pthunk! Still running, Hi reaches forward, tries to catch it on the fly, bobbles it, tips it, and loses it. He overruns it a couple of steps before bringing himself up short, turns to pick up the box, but PING-PING, bullets chew up the road near his hand. Leaving the Huggies, Hi takes off through a well-manicured yard as the police car proceeds down the street to catch him around the corner, with the driver still drawling over his loudspeaker. Tracking behind Hi, he runs up to the house and crashes through the screen door, runs through the living room where a middle-aged couple sits on the couch watching TV and looks up as Hi rushes by, then plunges down a staircase, and as he does so, we hear: ka-chick ka-chock ka-chick ka-chock. He emerges into a rec room where he and we rush past two kids playing ping-pong and runs out the back door, followed by OFFICER STEENSMA, who plunges down the stairs. Outdoors now, Hi runs, crosses the street behind the house, and enters the parking lot of a supermarket on the other side, as a pack of dogs thunders in with the lead Doberman and about a dozen neighborhood dogs. The dogs thunder through the living room and down the stairs as Hi bursts in. Tracking on him as he runs down the broad front aisle, head whipping as he runs, looking up each perpendicular lane, searching for something, he turns up one of the last lanes, races along it, and grabs a carton of Huggies, still on the flat run. He emerges into the broad back aisle and runs along it, but at the first perpendicular lane he hits, we see Officer Steensma, gun leveled, at the other end, and he fires. Hi keeps running as the Policeman runs along the front aisle, keeping pace with Hi running along the back aisle, squeezing off shots at Hi as each lane gives him the opportunity. Hi abruptly stops between lanes and doubles back, losing the Policeman.",
    "252": "Butch pulls on his tee-shirt, and Esmarelda bounces in her seat with excitement as he looks at her license. We DOLLY around a phone booth as Butch talks inside, then hangs up the phone. Butch holds up a hundred dollar bill, causing Esmarelda's eyes to light up. She goes to take it, but Butch holds it for some time before giving her the bill. Butch flicks the switch back, making the room dark again, and climbs into bed, spooning Fabienne from behind. When Butch and Fabienne speak to each other, they speak in babytalk. Fabienne rolls over, and Butch gets on top of her. They kiss, and Butch's hand goes out of frame and starts massaging her crotch. Fabienne reacts, lies her head back, and Butch continues to massage her crotch. Butch kisses her on the mouth and then his head goes down out of frame to carry out the oral pleasure. Fabienne's face is alone in the frame; she finishes drying her hair and wraps the towel like a turban on her head, handing him a towel as Butch exits the bathroom. We stay on Fabienne as she brushes her teeth while Butch keeps on talking from the other room. Fabienne brushes her teeth, and as we watch her for a moment or two, she remembers something. She walks out of the bathroom to ask Butch a question, only to find him sound asleep in bed. She looks at him for a moment as Butch squints down the front of the bed at her, trying to focus. Fabienne enters the room, laughs, and gives Butch a sweet long kiss. Butch climbs out of bed and starts pulling clothes out of the suitcase that Fabienne brought. Butch is finished dressing as he goes through the suitcase. By now, Butch is frantically rummaging through the suitcase, throwing clothes. Fabienne can hardly speak, as she’s never seen Butch this way. Fabienne is crying and scared. Butch lowers his voice, which only serves to make him more menacing, and he bends down in front of the woman who has sunk to the floor, then rises as Fabienne is still sniffling. Butch goes to the closet, puts on his high school jacket, and rises from the floor. The little Honda races toward its destination as fast as its little engine will take it. He has parked his car a couple of blocks from his apartment to check things out before he goes boppin' through the front door. Butch walks down the alley until he gets to another street, then he discreetly glances out. Everything seems normal, more or less the right number of cars in the street. None of the parked cars appear out of place, basically looking like normal morning activity in front of Butch's home.",
    "1298": "Bo runs to the front bumper and climbs onto the hood, while Merrill climbs up over the side and joins Morgan on the roof, keeping a hand on his nephew as Morgan raises the monitor above his head. There's movement right next to him, causing Graham to spin and aim the flashlight at the crops to his right, but the light only penetrates a few feet into the crops. Graham holds his breath, turns, and drops the flashlight at the same time, causing the beam of light to turn off when the flashlight hits the ground. Graham kneels down and gropes in the darkness, searching with his hands over the ground in all directions until they finally touch the flashlight. He tries to get up but stumbles backward into the crops, tangled as he struggles to rise. He gets up and starts running, with leaves and stalks slapping him from all directions and something coming behind. Graham makes a sudden right turn, putting his hands in front of him to protect his face and eyes, then makes another sudden turn left, and keeps running across the yard until he steps into the kitchen. His hair is messed and his shirt has a few leaves from corn stalks stuck to it, but the children don't notice his presence. Graham takes two steps to the kitchen table and slowly takes a seat as the children splash each other at the sink while cleaning the dinner dishes. His kind eyes stare down at the ground as he slows his mind, his breathing a slow controlled pant. The children stop playing and look up to Graham, following his stare to the kitchen table until Graham looks up at them. Morgan reaches into the pile of video tapes under the television stand, grabs one, and Bo snatches it as Morgan tries to put it into the VCR. Morgan stares at his sister, while Graham and Merrill sit down at the same time on the sofa with the same dazed, slow movements. Morgan rummages through the pile of videos frantically, finds one, and reaches for the VCR, breathing heavily and wheezing. He moves to the sofa and takes a seat between his father and his uncle, as Bo walks over and squeezes in also. The four of them stare at the television as Morgan brings his asthma spray to his mouth and inhales. The family room lights are off now, with a couple of glasses of Bo's water on the television. Bo is asleep on Graham's shoulder, and Morgan is asleep on Merrill's lap, while Graham turns his sleepy eyes away from the screen to Merrill, who looks his brother in the eyes and then at the TV screen.",
    "744": "A petite black woman with long plaits comes towards Skeeter, passing beneath the long, wispy branches of the willow. The black woman, Constantine, smiles at her warmly as she sits down next to her. Constantine grips Skeeter by the hand, bringing a grateful smile to her face, and Skeeter nods with tears in her eyes. They walk out of the willow glade, and Constantine slaps an arm around Skeeter's shoulders. Skeeter walks back the same way she came, with a more relaxed pace and a thoughtful look on her face. Later, she is on the phone, and Charlotte has traced the phone flex to the kitchen. Elegant, slim Ms. Elaine Stein is still on the phone, and Skeeter replaces the receiver, grinning as if she'd just won the jackpot. Meanwhile, Hilly is on Elizabeth's back porch with a contractor. Aibileen glances up at a windy sky. Skeeter waits for Hilly to drive away and then looks pointedly at Aibileen, who hurries in with the laundry basket. They come into Elizabeth's kitchen, and Elizabeth's husband, Raleigh, sees Skeeter sitting with Aibileen. Aibileen gets up from sorting the washing, and black storm clouds release heavy rain on Jackson. At Hilly's house, Minnie is fanning Mrs. Walters with a newspaper. She and Minnie glance towards the window and the storm raging outside. Mrs. Walters sits up in her chair, in awe, and fixes Minnie with a look of confused comprehension. Hilly, who has been lighting candles on the dining table, sits fanning herself. Minnie puts down the paper and sidles to the window, looking out over the terrace and the outdoor toilet beyond it. She sees a sun chair being buffeted in the wind, shifts awkwardly from foot to foot, and the pool umbrella has gone the way of the chair. Minnie beats a hasty retreat, and Mrs. Walters lays out some cards. Her daughter's eyes narrow as she watches Minnie disappear down the hall. In the bathroom, as Minnie softly raises the toilet lid, Hilly puts her ear to the bathroom door. Minnie, caught with her knickers down, freezes, but then defiantly flushes the toilet. Minnie stands with her arms folded, then slams down the lid. Mrs. Walters looks up from her cards without expression. Minnie, carrying her handbag, strides out of the front door into the pouring rain. A child's bedroom is turned upside down, and Aibileen sits with Mae Mobley on her lap, sheltering under an upturned mattress. In Elizabeth's sprawling bungalow the next day, Aibileen, in her maid's uniform, is sitting on the toilet. Flies buzz around her; she brings a hand to her mouth, her face perspiring, her expression world-weary. Elizabeth, holding Mae Mobley's hand, stands outside the wooden toilet on the back porch, and Aibileen picks the child up. Aibileen shuts the toilet door with her free hand.",
    "454": "As the scene freezes with Humperdinck caught in mid-sentence, the Kid is half sitting now, not strong yet, but clearly stronger than when we first saw him, and on these words, as we saw before, Buttercup emerges. The crowd suddenly goes to its knees, wave after wave of silent kneeling people, all of them down. Buttercup is touched as before but then seems stunned as she advances on Buttercup now, who is more and more panicked. Buttercup comes out of her nightmare, alone in her castle bedroom, and as she frantically grabs a robe, she starts to run. She bursts into the Prince's chambers where Count Rugen stands nearby, just stunned. Finally, softly, he begins to talk, and she nods. The trees are unusual in one respect: all of them are extraordinarily heavily knotted. Humperdinck and Rugen walk into the grove of trees, deeper into the grove now as Rugen searches around. Rugen smiles and hurries down the stairs as the tree slides back perfectly into place. Count Rugen drags Westley up alongside the thing—levers and wheels and wires, you name it, it's there. Westley has suction cups on his head now, on his temple, on his heart, his hands and feet. He says nothing, keeps control of himself, and then opens the flood gate, water pours down the chute, turning the wheel, which in turn really gets The Machine going. Westley is lying on the table, and he's only flesh and the chains are metal and thick, but such is his desperation it almost seems he might break them. It keeps on coming as we finally see he switches off The Machine, picks up a large notebook and pen, and sits in a chair. Westley is in anguish so deep it is dizzying, and helpless, he cries. Count Rugen watches the tears, then starts to write in his quarters, swamped, with piles of papers strewn all over. Now Yellin, a pale, shifty, quick-eyed man, appears in the doorway, entering. The Prince and Yellin turn to her in the doorway as she glides out. A lot of hollering is going on as the thieves are being rounded up by the Brute Squad, a large group of large men, with Yellin standing on a wagon in the midst of all the scuffling, and his wagon starts, and as it does, Inigo, drunk as a skunk, sprawls in front of a hovel, a bottle of brandy in one hand, the six-fingered sword in the other. He looks dreadful, unshaven, puffy-eyed, gaunt. Inigo feels a hand on his back and compares it to his own smaller hand, and as the Assistant Brute is just about to club Inigo's brains out, Fezzik lets fly with a stupendous punch.",
    "491": "After a second, he enters. Mr. Cunningham finds Cole sitting in a poor villager costume as a female teacher kneels next to him and makes final adjustments. Cole and the woman glance at Mr. Cunningham, who looks around the room and then directly at Cole. The female teacher looks to Cole and nods. The group of villagers on the stage laugh and mock. Tommy Tammisimo is dressed in a mismatched costume and hops around, clearly embarrassed. He smiles a true friend's smile. Cole hesitates, and it takes him a moment before he steps forward. Cole steps up to the stone, places his hand around the handle, and begins to pull. The sword starts to come out, and Cole raises the shiny sword out of the stone and high above his head. Merlin and everyone on stage bow. Malcolm watches his client standing unafraid in the spotlight for the first time. The villagers rise and rush to Cole, scooping him up and carrying him around the stage in celebration. Cole chuckles and then starts laughing as the group of eight-year-olds try unsuccessfully to keep him up. They slowly sag and collapse, with all the students laughing as they try to untangle themselves. Malcolm watches with utter joy as Cole becomes indistinguishable among a group of twenty children giggling and enjoying themselves on stage. The rain comes down a little stronger now on the stained glass window. Malcolm sits on the stairs in the lobby, and Cole walks back and forth in front of him, still holding the sword from the play. Cole glances at Malcolm, who exhales very slowly as he gets up. Cole watches as Malcolm walks down the stairs to the entrance. Lynn glances over to Cole, who sits in his seat silently. The way he says the words gives Lynn a chill. Cole takes a long time. Lynn gazes out the windshield at the line of red tail lights, looks over slowly, and eyes Cole. Lynn becomes upset and nods with grave understanding. Cole watches her, and Lynn's eyes move to Cole. Cole gazes at her intense expression and smiles a tiny smile. Lynn glances down and drowns in her thoughts. Lynn looks up sharply and becomes still, her face unreadable. Lynn's eyes lock on Cole's, and she brings her hands to her mouth, beginning to cry. Lynn covers her face with her hands, and the tears roll out through her fingers. Lynn looks at her son, barely getting the words out, and Cole moves closer to Lynn. She cradles him in her arms, and mother and son hold each other tight. Malcolm walks quietly down the sidewalk towards his home, enters the living room, and smiles at what he sees.",
    "1075": "Nullah notices and drops in after her, and she eyes him coldly. He studies her and smiles as the Drover rides up while they pull away, in the tank. Nullah brings Daisy to the surface, and as the truck drives away down the dusty road, Drover hauls Daisy's body from the tank. Sarah sprints over, and Nullah desperately hugs his mother while Drover hangs his head as Nullah clings to the body. Bandy runs out of the house, and the cop's truck continues down the long, straight, dusty road into the vast scrub lands of Faraway Downs. The windmill turns slowly at sunset as Sarah looks tearfully out towards Daisy's blazing funeral pyre. Smoke drifts from the top of a rocky summit nearby, and Magarri signals to the hilltop, waving to King George who starts to chant. The body is carried towards the fire, with the old man looking down on the homestead from his hilltop in the soft glow of dawn. Sarah steps out of the house as Drover sits down on the fence and lights a cigarette. She looks distraught, and he frowns as she avoids his gaze. She walks to where Nullah is grieving, lying curled up on the ground on a mattress, while she's completely at a loss. She crouches down next to him, laying newspapers from a pile on the ground to kneel on, as she kneels and thinks, with the nearest front page having an advert for a film. He looks up and sees the smoke on the hilltop while she looks perplexed, and he holds up his hand with a cloth tied around it as she's not sure how to proceed. He watches her expectantly as she finishes with a self-deprecating flourish, and her eyes fill with tears in the blazing sun. Sarah faces Drover in the saddle, and Nullah looks up as a twister starts to form in the dust in front of the house. He looks unconvinced while Flynn salutes and eyeballs Sarah, and Bandy and Flynn nod as Sing Song winks and Nullah grins. Sing Song's chop wagon moves on as Drover opens the gate to the cattle pen, and Drover marshals his motley gang of riders as the huge herd moves out of the pen, raising a massive cloud of dust. The army of cattle moves off, while King George follows their progress from his rocky mountain top. The herd approaches a wide river as Drover and Sarah ride ahead of the cattle, and the others ride behind and alongside, keeping them together. Sing Song drives his wagon into the water, and the crossing is successful. Crowds fill an open-air cinema in nighttime Darwin as Carney stares grimly and drops a curtain down between himself and Fletcher, who turns angrily away. The drive moves on through the soft light of sunset, approaching a range of jagged vertical cliffs.",
    "921": "He flips a dangling leg back into the lift as the doors close and intercepts M, then vaults a balustrade into the balcony above the lobby, avoiding the squads of agents looking for him. He is back past M, and she gives a half smile as Bond leaves the building. In a dingy building, two men are carrying a heavy box downstairs. In an office, Felix swigs from a bottle and puffs on his cigar as Bond hangs up. In a rundown part of town, men are drinking, smoking, and playing games in a bar. Felix walks in to join Bond who is at the bar, while a guy in a leather jacket walks to the bar and a soldier in armor is present. He sprints upstairs and takes out a waiting soldier with an elbow to the face. Another opens up, sprints off, and jumps from one building to another as Felix observes the chaos dispassionately and sips his beer. Beam looks concerned as Felix gets in the car, and Bond emerges from the shadows of a balcony onto the rundown street. The sun blazes down on a rocky desert, and the general, police chief, and guard sit on a cool balcony surveying the arid scene. The general leers after the slim hostess, and the police chief wags a knowing finger at him. Behind a rock overlooking the geometrically laid out compound, Camille expertly assembles and loads an automatic as two cars approach. She stares at him, then looks coldly at him to an underground entrance. Parties converge along metal walkways and staircases and arrive at a meeting area surrounded by clear glass panels where there is a display of shiny metallic balls nearby. Greene's party arrives, his grim-faced driver carrying two metal attache cases, and Greene grins at the general. The hostess brings the general's beer, removes the beer, a document is placed on the table, and Greene slides it over to the general with a pen. Camille vaults over the edge of the compound's main building and drops onto the balcony. The general eyes Greene grimly and grabs the paper as the second case is placed in front of him. He opens it and examines the wads of banknotes inside, then leaves the table as Greene and his men grin smugly. Inside the building, Camille is heading in their direction and hides in a doorway as the general and his bodyguard approach. She composes herself as the police chief heads downstairs to his four by four and dumps the money on the backseat. The general's men stand guard at his suite as Greene's party heads for the car park. Camille rips her clothes, breathes deeply, and drops onto the police chief's car, where he shoots the chief in the head and clings to the bumper as the driver reverses.",
    "139": "Gandhi has remained seated, pensive, while Charlie studies him for a moment. A little grin appears on Gandhi's face, but his mood stays pensive and remote. Gandhi looks up with anger and determination, which is then broken by a hopeless sigh, leaving Charlie stunned and obviously hurt. Gandhi proceeds more gently, and now Charlie understands. Gandhi smiles, showing warmth and sadness, then speaks with determined purposefulness and a friend's trust. He has taken some scratched notes from under the bedding and handed them to Charlie. He nods, meeting Charlie's eyes with a smile that shelters his vulnerability and returns his love. The very English, very steadfast Charlie fights to contain his emotions. The courtroom is packed to overflowing and restless as Gandhi sits in the dock. The English magistrate surveys the courtroom and signals his English clerk to him. The magistrate frowns, seeing the front row from his point of view with two or three Indian journalists and one European, which he receives with some alarm, and he indicates that the clerk take his place. Gandhi stands, and the courtroom is silent, but the sound of chanting outside is still audible. The magistrate stares as the journalists write and the clerk swallows. The magistrate is only too aware of the mob outside as he looks around the courtroom. The clerk lowers his eyes to his pad. The magistrate searches the distant wall, the top of his desk, and his twitching hands for an answer, then stares again, along with the journalists. The magistrate wets his lips, and the court explodes into chaos with cheering and delight. The magistrate rises, looks around the room, and heads for his chambers as the journalists scribble furiously. Gandhi turns and starts out of the courtroom, steps down from the courtroom to the balcony, and a huge cheer comes up from the massed peasants below. As he smiles down at them, he is turned by surprise and caution, followed by even more caution on hearing something that sounds casually ironic but is determined, even angry. Inside, the Governor, Sir Edward Gait, with a portrait of the King prominent behind him, feels cornered for different reasons while the desk is arrayed with several tall stacks of identically covered folders and some folded newspapers on one corner. He taps one of the folders irritably with his hand as Sir George looks at him, half defensive and half defiant. They are old friends from the same school and social class who have been together a long time in India, arguing as friends who accept the same premises, although the Governor feels the game has not been played quite fairly.",
    "97": "A group of wounded soldiers hang out in the hospital, recuperating. Forrest turns the TV off and is hit on the back of the head by a ping-pong ball, so he shakes his head. The wounded ping-pong player hands Forrest a paddle, and they step toward the ping-pong table. The player holds the ball up and moves it back and forth as Forrest keeps his eyes on the ball. The player tosses the ball down onto the table, and Forrest begins to hit the ball back to the other player. Forrest hits ping-pong balls that land in a bedpan positioned on a chair as a group of wounded soldiers sit and watch him play by himself. Forrest hits two balls at a time against the opposite side of the table while Lt. Dan stares out the window. Forrest lies in his bed asleep, then a hand reaches and grabs him. Lt. Dan pulls Forrest to the floor, holds him down, looks at him, lets go, and rolls away. Lt. Dan sits up as Forrest looks at him, and later Forrest plays ping-pong by himself when an officer walks up to him, holding up an envelope. Forrest steps up to Lt. Dan's bed and stops in mid-sentence as he looks down to see a heavily bandaged soldier with bloodstains lying there. Forrest turns and looks at the nurse. The television reveals Forrest being awarded the Medal of Honor by President Johnson, with color footage showing President Johnson placing the award around Forrest's neck, shaking his hand, leaning, and whispering into Forrest's ear. The television then shows Forrest dropping his pants, bending over, and showing the bullet wound on his bare buttocks as President Johnson looks down and smiles. Three men in a barber shop look up in disbelief, and Mrs. Gump looks up in shock. Hilary leads a line of vets toward a large anti-Vietnam War rally and pulls Forrest up onto the stage; the other vets follow and push Forrest toward the microphones. Abbie raises his fist as the crowd cheers wildly, and Forrest looks at the crowd as he speaks. A policeman sneaks over to the audio circuit board and pulls the patch cords out, so Forrest continues to speak into the microphone even though no one can hear him. Hilary notices the policeman, rushes over to the audio board, pushes the policeman away, and grabs his nightstick. Another protester grabs the policeman and pulls him away as Isabel, Hilary, and another protester try to plug the tangled mess of wires back into the audio board.",
    "1008": "The others stare ahead, dazed and incapable of movement, as one man wipes tears from his eyes. Another man approaches the front of Buckingham Palace and places a bouquet of flowers at the gate, and more people arrive with bouquets of flowers to place at the railings. Tony and Alistair watch Earl Spencer read a statement on TV when a woman enters. A smiling Alistair puts down the phone, and the woman hands Tony another phone. Tony's hand covers the receiver as he waits a moment, then raises the phone to speak. As a servant arranges cutlery on a table, Robin enters the dining room. The Queen strides down a corridor with stags' heads mounted on the walls, and two maids stand aside to let her pass. In the study, the Queen picks up a phone from a desk and sits behind the desk. Cherie enters the room behind Tony, and Prince Phillip enters the study wearing a kilt. Tony sits on a sofa while Cherie stands close by; he puts the phone down, and Cherie moves around and catches his attention. The Queen and the Queen Mother, dressed in black, walk to a nearby car while the Royal Family staff watch the broadcast, and Robin stares impassively at Tony's image on the TV. Charles, accompanied by Stephen and various men, walks through a vast lobby with high ceilings and huge windows, then strides down a corridor and suddenly stops outside a room, pausing for a moment before entering. Charles slowly enters the room, and a glass door shuts behind him. He stands before a casket, waits a moment, then walks around to the head of the casket. Seen from outside the room, Charles's view is obscured by the frame of the glass door, and a priest can be glimpsed speaking while Charles has his hand over his mouth, looking in grief at the casket. Later, Tony sits in the backseat of a car driving down a motorway at daytime, hands the phone to his female assistant, then glances out the window. Charles descends from a plane down some stairs, shakes hands with Lord Airlie on the runway, and walks over to meet various uniformed men standing nearby. A line of soldiers carries a casket above their heads, and Charles approaches Tony; they both look at the soldiers with the casket. Nelson Mandela appears on TV while the Queen fiddles with her pearl necklace, and Phillip picks his fingernails while the Queen scratches her wrist. At nighttime, two Range Rovers pull into the courtyard at Balmoral, and the Queen looks at the vehicles from an upstairs window. She watches as two men exit from the lead vehicle, then turns away from the window.",

As Jack heads back to his car, three residents walk with him, ad lib, but he stops when he notices four military trucks driving past slowly, with antennas atop the trucks, and the men inside seemingly scanning the area, which disturbs him. Meanwhile, Joe rides along a hillside, parks his bike, and walks toward the edge, moving into the doorway where his dad and others convene. Joe hears something, drops his flashlight, and the men all turn silent, putting Joe on the spot. Later, Joe paints his model on the floor of his living room while watching \"In Search Of\" and talking to Charles on his walkie talkie. In the middle of nowhere, a wooded area sees an Ohio Power cherry picker truck drive up and park beside a utility pole. Rooney, 49, with a cigarette in his mouth, makes notes on a weathered clipboard, glances at the power line, and doesn't understand what he sees as we push in on him. He radios in. At a loud town meeting, two hundred frustrated citizens crowd the auditorium. Jack is at the podium with town officials, including the local mayor, sitting on stage as Mrs. Babbit, 52, speaks into the microphone on the floor. The town roars its approval, and Jack tries as the town erupts in agreement. A short, bald man of 65, Mr. McCandless, speaks, and the mayor takes over as Jack has a sidebar meeting with someone and continues into the office. We dolly fast with an exasperated Jack as he writes, tailed by someone, heading for his office, where he sees Louis being escorted out by an officer across the room. Louis heads out, and Jack holds on as he turns and enters his office. As that door opens, we cut to the door of Joe's messy, motherless room opening as Joe and Alice enter. Joe could not be more self-conscious as he moves stacks of comics, tosses some dirty clothes behind the bed, and hangs a bath towel on his desk chair. Alice looks around as she enters and sits on the bed. Joe takes the five-car train model, and Alice moves close, holding it as Joe watches her. She really looks at it, but their tension is interrupted by an out-of-breath Charles. Jack is with Officer Tally, 24, who puts a map on his desk showing 28 dots in a circle, anywhere from a 20 to 150-mile radius, with Lillian at the center, stunning Jack. Officer Rosko is at his desk with a young woman and a ham radio beside a reel-to-reel tape deck, taking notes. Cary is behind the camera, with Charles beside him, as we see Alice behind the camera, watching Joe and smiling.",
    "980": "He stares at her for a moment then lets go of the screen door and purposefully walks across the porch to embrace her. She flings her arms around him with a big smile. They sit indoors. She leaves. Daisy leans across the dining table. Benjamin carries two of Daisy's suitcases as they walk side by side through the silent shadowy corridors of the home. They enter a bedroom decorated with framed landscape paintings. Daisy puts her coat and hand back down on the double bed which has tall elaborately-carved bedposts. She closes the door and turns around. Their eyes meet across the dimly-lit room. Stepped closer and Benjamin firmly clasps her torso. Daisy arches her back slightly as their lips meet in a slow kiss. Benjamin unfastens her belt then unzips the back of her dress. She carefully rolls down her stocking, revealing a scar beneath her right knee. He slides off her dress and kisses the back of her neck. Her hand meets his as he grasps her right thigh. She turns to kiss him. Her long sleek red hair draped over one shoulder. Benjamin pulls his sweater off and climbs onto the bed as Daisy reclines, wearing a sultry black slip. A clock ticked from Queenie's old dresser. Benjamin and Daisy are silhouetted against the lilac sunset on the slowly drifting boat, the Bottomup. Benjamin looks up to see a space rocket rise over billowing mountainous clouds on the horizon. Daisy wrings out her wet hair. Benjamin playfully engulfs her in a stripy towel. They lounged together beneath palm trees on golden sands. Standing beside her on the ocean, Benjamin watches Daisy as she raises her head from the still waters. Night, they make love on the deck. They dive off the prowl of the boat as moonlight plays on the glittering surface of the sea. They swim gracefully beneath a brilliant full moon. They remained seated at the picnic branch as people flee from an advancing storm. They lie on the floor close to bed. He lies face down with his eyes closed. Daisy rests her chin against his shoulder. Lightning flashes. The wind rattles the windows. The doors rattle in the gale. Pale diaphanous drapes and close them in their bed. Daisy rolls onto her side and smiles as she gazes at him. He props himself up and looks at her. She strokes his cheek. He smiles. He inches closer. They kiss. A ceiling fan turns beneath the slipping raft over their bed. In the hospital, Caroline stares down at the diary. Looking tanned and healthy, Benjamin and Daisy carry luggage up the front steps of the retirement home. Benjamin enters ahead of Daisy to find it deserted.",
    "355": "Frodo materializes as he drops to his knees, clutching his bleeding hand, and screams. The fires below roar in anger, red light blazes, and the cavern is filled with a great glare and heat. Legolas sees Aragorn fall to the ground as Gollum triumphantly holds the ring aloft, dancing gleefully, perilously close to the edge of the chasm. Aragorn turns to see huge troll feet moving closer, and Legolas races toward him. Gollum remains triumphant on the edge of the precipice, with the fiery lava casting an evil light. Frodo rises slowly, his eyes lock on Gollum, and time seems to stand still as they regard each other, with the ring glinting in Gollum's hand. Suddenly, Frodo lunges at Gollum, thudding into him and lifting him off his feet. Frodo and Gollum, locked in struggle, plummet over the edge of the chasm. The huge foot of the cave troll lands on Aragorn's chest, and he stabs at it ineffectually. Gandalf is in despair as Sam watches in horror while Frodo and Gollum disappear into the chasm. Gollum falls into the Crack of Doom and is instantly engulfed in the churning lava. Sam leans into the Crack of Doom, seeing Frodo clinging onto the rock face with his one good hand. The caverns shake violently as Sam desperately reaches for Frodo, who is too far down. Frodo looks at Sam, his face impassive, and struggles to reach him but can't with his bleeding hand, falling back and clinging to the rock with his good hand. Frodo looks at Sam imploringly, reaches up once more, and this time Sam grasps his hand tightly. The ring sits on the river of lava for a brief moment, then sinks away. The Eye of Sauron and Mount Doom are clearly seen from the great plains, and on the battlefield, all eyes turn to Mount Doom. The cave troll, with Aragorn at his mercy, is distracted by the sounds emanating from Mordor, turns in terror, and runs off. The Fellowship turns to watch as the massive dark tower of Sauron shakes itself to pieces. Towers fall, walls crumble, and vast spires of smoke and spouting steam billow up as the foundations explode apart. The black gates collapse in a huge cloud of ash, and the Orcs flee in all directions. The company watches as Mount Doom explodes, realizing the reason for their misery is clear: Frodo and Sam can never survive the cataclysm. The volcano erupts, fire belches from its riven summit, sending lava streaming down its sides. Frodo and Sam stagger out of the Sammath Naur as ash and molten rocks fall all around, and the skies burst into thunder, seared with lightning.",
    "392": "He is gone. She strides toward us, naked under a robe which she is just cinching shut. The Dude stops between two albums and pulls out an album with a worn sleeve. On it is the group's name, Autobahn, the album name, Nagelbett, and a picture of three young Germans, their foreheads looming below slicked-back hair, gazing upward in thin-lipped epiphany. They are wearing severe but modishly retro suits. A bed of nails is the only set dressing on the cover. The Dude and Walter are pulling up in front of a dilapidated house sitting on a scrubby lot. Parked incongruously in front of the house is a brand new red Corvette. It is opened by a matronly Spanish woman. Larry, a fifteen-year-old, looks at the two men. Walter pops the latches on his attache case and takes out the homework, which is now in a ziploc bag. He holds it out at arm's length, displaying it to Larry. Walter is still holding out the homework. Throughout Walter has been staring at Larry with the homework extended towards him. As he shoves the homework back in the attache case, he is heading for the door. Walter is striding down the lawn with his attache case like an enraged encyclopedia salesman, without looking back at the Dude, who follows. He pops the Dude's trunk, flings in the briefcase, and takes out a tire iron. CRASH! He swings the crowbar into the windshield, which shatters. CRASH! He takes out the driver's window. Lights are going on in houses down the street. A man in a sleeveless T-shirt and boxer shorts has run over behind Walter and grabbed him from behind on a backswing of the crowbar. He wrestles the crowbar away from the startled Walter. He finishes hammering, rises, and grabs a straight-backed chair that stands nearby. When the door is opened—outwards, the chair clatters to the floor. Out of the blackness something is falling toward us. It is a woman, falling in slow motion, her limbs flailing, her mouth contorted by either fear or ecstasy. She is topless. She falls past the camera, leaving blackness, then after a beat reappears, rising into the night sky. A crowd of mostly tanned middle-aged men with blow-dried hair, wearing jogging outfits and other expensively casual attire, are blanket-tossing the squealing young woman in nightmarish slow motion. It is a party, lit by festive beach lights and standing kerosene heaters. A man walks towards the camera through the pools of beach light. He is handsome, fiftyish, wearing cotton twill pants and a Turnbull & Asher shirt with a foulard knotted at the neck. Behind him, the woman rises and falls, appears and disappears.",
    "920": "She looks out of a side window as rocks and crags skim past. Daylight falls through holes punched in the fuselage by another burst from the fighter. Bond nurses the stricken aircraft as the hunter swoops in for the kill and eases the floor throttle forward. The dying engines belch smoke, enveloping the fighter's cockpit. The transport moves to avoid the smoke, trapping the fighter between the larger plane and forcing it to slow. The fighter turns to avoid a collision and hurtles straight towards the rocks. He throws her a parachute. A red warning light shows generator failure. She opens the outside door for Bond, who gropes for his chute, then hauls on the stick to get out of the plane over the hill. As the two aircraft nearly collide, Bond raises the nose, gaining as much height as possible. Cargo strains in its straps, which snap back towards Camille. Both propellers give out under the strain. Bond drops down the vertical fuselage to Camille, grabs her, and they tumble out into space. He lets go of her parachute and dives for her as they and the plane continue to fall. M sits stony-faced. They are in the sunless steps of the sinkhole. He puts his jacket around her shoulders, stands, thinks for a moment, and then turns to her. They stare at one another until Bond breaks eye contact. She gives a small nod. He holds out his hand, she takes it and pulls herself up. They trudge through the chilly, rocky shadows and come to a rockfall. Bond kicks at some of the stones and picks one up, starting to climb up the rockfall. He comes to the top and pauses, seeing a huge underground lake. They walk down a tunnel with the roof held up by wooden supports. People cluster around, queuing for water, and argue amongst themselves. A man climbs up to peer into the well, but it is dry. A standpipe stops dribbling. The bus arrives at the dying town. A small group of people, joined by Bond and Camille, get on board. The bus's red tail lights shine through the dusty environment. Covered in dust, they arrive at the Grand Hotel. He heads unhurriedly upstairs, makes his way across the landing, and approaches the door of his room, pushing it open. He bursts into the bedroom, finding Fields' body on the bed covered in black oil. He is frisked and escorted out but then breaks another's knee and lays out a third. He grabs the keys, unlocks his handcuffs, and frisks his would-be captors. As the lift doors open, he cocks the automatic and calmly slips it into the waistband of his trousers at the small of his back.",
    "1256": "Peter and Rooney go to Carl's aid and prop up the smiling Carl, who then punches a random guy in the face. A burly guy knees him in the gut before the burly guy is restrained. Carl's face falls, and he looks as if he's on the verge of tears. At home, Carl lies beside his toilet with his legs wrapped around the toilet bowl and his head near the door. He stirs, opens his eyes, and they flit from side to side before he smiles. Carl leaves his apartment and locks his door, turning to find elderly, white-haired Tillie holding a hammer; she smiles and shrugs. Carl puts up shelves at Tillie's while Tillie knits. Tillie shakes her head. Carl's shirt is trapped in the door, and he tugs at his shirt, yanking it out and rolling backwards down a flight of steps. He sits up to see a scary dog charging towards him, but the dog's chain stops it just short of Carl, who is frozen in terror as the dog snaps its jaws inches from his face. A look of pained realization comes over him. Tillie pushes Carl back onto her bed and puts her false teeth into a glass. At work, Carl looks at an invitation on his computer. In his office, Norman receives the response and, beaming, gawks at the screen. Norman springs out of his chair excitedly and gives Carl the thumbs up through the glass wall of his office; Carl salutes him, and Norman salutes back. Carl pulls a silly face, and Norman hides behind a wall then jumps out. Carl pretends to look away, then looks back at him sharply. Norman turns his glasses upside down and flaps around like a bird, crossing his eyes and holding his hands out without his glasses on. Carl winds sticky tape around his head and tapes his nose up so it looks like a pig's snout, causing his face to look deformed and lumpy, and he sticks out his teeth. Norman looks uncomfortable and retreats, taking out cash. A bed is delivered, and Carl jumps on his new bed, where he's balanced a glass of wine on the corner that doesn't fall over. In a guy's room, Carl learns to play guitar, then takes off in a light aircraft with an instructor beside him. Carl sits at a desk in a Korean class, where his classmates laugh, and the teacher gives him a withering look. He ladles soup for homeless people while the vagrant is on his phone. Carl snatches a flier from the guy outside the cafe, pauses, checks his flier, then inside, Carl walks up to the bar and sits. It's the guy from outside the cafe, who walks up to the barman.",
    "720": "Rose swings the ax and hits the cabinet door, missing the first mark by several inches, and then approaches Jack. Rose grips the axe handle with both hands and moves her hands apart. Jack stretches the chain across the pipe and closes his eyes as Rose closes her eyes, swings, and cuts the handcuff chain in half. Jack lifts his hands and smiles, and they move into the corridor. Rose points to the flooded stairway, but Jack pulls her toward the opposite end of the corridor. Outside, passengers paddle two lifeboats away from the Titanic, and in one lifeboat, Molly and Ruth stare at the ship, now tilted forward with its bow nearly submerged. A flare shoots up from the bridge deck and explodes. On the boat deck, passengers crowd around the remaining lifeboats, and as Lightoller seats people in the lifeboat, one woman toting luggage tries to climb aboard. Lightoller pulls a sobbing gray-haired woman away from her husband and puts her in the boat. An auburn-haired woman cries and kisses a brown-haired man. Cal turns toward Lovejoy as he approaches. Rose follows Jack, who uses the axe to break through the door and into the corridor. A steward addresses them and follows Jack and Rose, but they glance back, causing the steward to stop in his tracks. Lightoller picks up a woman and places her in a boat as Andrews rushes over. Lightoller gazes out at several partially filled lifeboats moving away from the Titanic and motions to waiting passengers while several full lifeboats are lowered to the water. Fabrizio and other passengers pop open the third-class gangway door and peer out along the ship, but two seamen pull the passengers back in and close the door. Tommy and others stand at the locked gate atop the third-class stairwell as two stewards unlock the gate. A woman and several men rush through the open gate, and the stewards push back the men, punching them and hitting them with axe handles. One steward pulls out a small handgun and points it at the crowd now contained behind the closed gate. Jack and Rose reach the bottom of the third-class stairs, and atop the stairs, Tommy grips the gate and glares at the armed steward. Tommy glowers, points at the steward, then runs downstairs where Fabrizio rushes over, and Jack hugs him. In the suite, Cal removes the heart of the ocean, along with some cash, from the safe and puts it in his jacket pocket before glancing at Lovejoy, who opens his jacket, revealing a handgun in a shoulder holster. Cal closes the safe, locks it, and walks out. Elsewhere, Jack and the others run along a crowded corridor, and Jack leads them down another corridor, where they pass a mustached man flipping through a book and studying a sign on the wall.",
    "664": "Flash glares as Peter walks out of the swing doors, causing a tray to be trapped on the swing shot. Later, Peter strides towards his locker, examining his wrist as he goes. Flash marches after him, pushing students out of his way. Peter stands staring at his unopened locker when he hears a paper airplane zooming down the corridor towards a fly hovering by the fire alarm bell. In slow motion, he hears a spit wad being propelled from a blowpipe, followed by a fist. He swerves to his side as Flash's punch lands on the locker door. Flash, using his left hand, aims two punches at Peter, who dodges them. Then, in slow motion, Flash throws another punch, which Peter narrowly avoids. A punching white follows, and Peter arches his back as if doing a limbo dance to evade it. To avoid Flash's colleague, Peter flips into the air, somersaults, and lands on his feet. Flash charges again but fails to connect. Peter grabs Flash's arm, then punches him. Flash slides on his back down the corridor, collides with a teacher carrying a tray, and ends up with more food on him. MJ looks at him in wonder, Flash's crony and Harry seem awestruck, MJ is unsure, and Peter looks confused and a little frightened. He races off, running across a street intersection and coming to a gateway leading into an alley. Out of sight of passersby on the sidewalk, he scrutinizes his wrist where the web shot from, then turns over his hand to examine the swollen bite mark. He looks up and sees a spider's web woven around the coils of barbed wire above the gateway entrance and moves his hands closer to his face, noticing barbed bristles beginning to grow on the pads of his fingertips. Peter stares at the brick building behind him and, placing his hands on the surface, starts to climb. With ease, Peter scales the high-sided brick building, his fingertips almost sticking to the surface. Halfway up, he stops and looks down. Peter runs across the roofs of tall buildings, leaping across the gaps between them. Two children playing with a skipping rope are oblivious as Peter launches himself into the air above their heads. He lands on another roof and comes to a halt at the edge, once again scrutinizing his wrist. Opposite him, across the road, is a crane. Peter thinks for a moment, then loops from his wrist to the crane, thrusting his arm forward towards the jib.",
    "1153": "Filch fires the cannon by mistake as Cedric swallows hard and takes a deep breath, while in the competitors' tent, Harry sits alone in nervous trepidation. Harry walks out into a circular arena hewn from the rocky hillside and surrounded by a stone wall. High in the wooden terraces, Ron and Hermione stand amongst the cheering spectators. Harry resembles a gladiator in a Roman arena as he glances around cautiously and moves towards a gleaming golden egg standing amongst the gray rocks. He is knocked off his feet by the force of the dragon's tail, the massive head and body of which are covered with sharp, lethal spikes, as it blasts flame. Harry leaps for safety up a high rock, while the tethered dragon flies to the end of its long chain and lashes out angrily, giving Harry a vicious blow with its tail, flinging him onto the rocks below. The Hungarian Horntail flaps its huge leathery wings as Harry scrambles to his feet and dodges another burst of flame, causing the crowd to flinch and Karkaroff to laugh. As the dragon flaps towards him, Harry climbs out of range, but it lunges after him, baring its teeth. Taking shelter behind a huge rock, Harry sees his trusty broomstick zooming towards him while the dragon belches out another burst of flame. Harry leaves the rock, leaps away from the dragon, and jumps onto his Firebolt as it swoops down into the arena, with his friends cheering him on. The angry dragon stretches out its neck, breaking the chain, and the creature flies free. Followed by the furious dragon, Harry zooms around the arena, bursting out through the stands over the heads of the startled onlookers, wings tearing through the canopy and scattering professors who scramble to their feet as Rita Skeeter straightens her spectacles. Pursued by the dragon, Harry flies over the valley towards the school, narrowly avoiding colliding with a tall stone tower. The dragon launches after him as Harry swoops low over Hogwarts, with a faint mist rising. As he flies, Harry checks over his shoulder, but the dragon is nowhere to be seen. As Harry rounds one of the towers, the dragon appears and knocks him off his broomstick, causing Harry to fall onto a stiff roof and hurtle downwards, stopping his fall by grabbing desperately onto a narrow parapet. The dragon settles on a nearby turret as Harry dangles from the parapet, his gloved hands clutching a spiked pinnacle, seeing his broomstick far below. The dragon scrabbles across the turret onto the roof above Harry, and as the pinnacle snaps, Harry plunges down onto a windowsill, hanging on desperately as the sill collapses under him, while the dragon claws its way across the roof towards him, dislodging tiles like a colossal bat.",
    "1033": "Alex is already dressed, and he looks at her, bleary-eyed, as she leans down and kisses him, causing him to beam before Alex goes. Ryan and Natalie have breakfast at the hotel's outdoor cafe, sitting at one of many tables under a blue umbrella while she stares at him. They walk along a pier where Natalie has the photo of Julie and Jim. Natalie holds up the photo, which blows into the water. Ryan kneels on the edge of the wooden pier and reaches for it but falls in the water. In his hotel room, wearing a white towel and robe, Ryan dries the cut-out with a hair dryer. Ryan drags his case through the airport, with Julie and Jim poking out of the top, looking a little wrinkled and worn. In Detroit, the airport is shrouded in a snow storm as Ryan and Natalie drive along an icy road, glancing at each other awkwardly. Ryan parks in an office car park, and he and Natalie get out as she holds an arm full of strategy packets. A security guard leads them through a busy, open-plan office into a smaller office where Craig is on a computer screen via a video feed. Ryan looks at the screen and frowns while she smiles nervously and prepares the packets. A thickset bald man appears on a computer screen in front of Natalie. Ryan sits with her, and they look up to realize Mr. Samuels is in the next office on the other side of an opaque glass screen. In distress, Mr. Samuels' chest heaves as he picks up the packet, looks down, and starts to sob. Ryan frowns and looks between Natalie and Mr. Samuels on the screen, as the heavyset man shakes with grief. Natalie's eyes rove, she licks her lips, and Craig watches on his screen. Mr. Samuels looks down, startled, gets up, walks out, and Ryan and Natalie watch him wipe his hand across his face as he walks past the office therein. Natalie looks unsettled, nods slightly, looks down at a list of 40 names, flitting her eyes nervously, with number one being Mr. Samuels, and she crosses it out. In the snowy car park, Ryan talks to Craig on his cell phone while Natalie leans on the car. Ryan frowns as he listens, hangs up, and turns to Natalie. Later, in the north terminal of Detroit airport, Ryan and Natalie stand silhouetted against a large window with the nose of a jet looming outside. Standing on a moving walkway, Ryan looks at the wedding invitation with Natalie behind him, her smile fading. Natalie walks ahead, and Ryan stares thoughtfully at the wedding invitation and the RSVP slip before stopping, turning around, and heading back the way he came.",
    "548": "Indy and Henry run down the mountainside to the shoreline, where Indy reaches for his gun, tucked in his pants. He opens the gun's chamber and swings around as a Messerschmidt comes in for another pass. Henry hands his case to Indy, then suddenly spins around, screaming and shouting into a flock of sea gulls with his umbrella. Thousands of sea gulls take to the wing, and the Messerschmidt's whirling propeller blades shred them into a feathery white puree that splatters against the cockpit and clogs the engine. The engine sputters, causing the Messerschmidt to fall from the skies and explode off camera. Indy stands stunned like a statue as Henry walks back to him, and Indy wears a proud expression as he watches Henry walk down the beach. Meanwhile, the Sultan is seated in his royal chair, flanked by Walter Donovan and Vogel, and surrounded by his minions. Donovan holds the missing Grail Diary pages as he and the Sultan walk together through an archway. The Sultan gets up from his chair and walks toward the trunk, only to go past it and inspect the Nazi staff car parked nearby. He points to the engine under the hood, and it is revealed to be Kazim, the spy at the court. Elsa comes down the stairs toward Donovan and Vogel as Sallah drives his car through the crowded streets with Indy beside him and Henry in the back seat, while Sallah waves his arms and shouts to a camel herder. Henry removes his hat and hits Indy with it. Elsa and Donovan's party, consisting of a supply truck, tank, and various other vehicles, move along through the box canyon, with Elsa, Donovan, and Vogel traveling in an open car. The tank is a vintage World War I model with enormous treads, and the Turkish soldiers wear native dress, carrying both carbines and sabers. Brody sits alongside Elsa in the rear of the car carrying Donovan. Henry and Sallah are at Indy's side as he views Donovan's party in the distance, with a car containing all their supplies parked nearby. Then Donovan notices a reflection from the hills, and at that moment, the tank fires a shell in their direction. It whistles overhead and blows up the parked car, causing Indy, Henry, and Sallah to cover their heads as automobile fragments rain down upon them. Kazim peers over a rock, pointing his rifle at the group below, as bullets explode off the vehicles and cliff. Donovan and Elsa duck as a Nazi soldier falls from the tank, with bullets exploding around him, while Kazim's men, members of the Brethren of the Cruciform Sword, continue to fire.",
    "189": "Annie calculates a moment while Lindsey is back watching the TV Horror-thon and her eyes light up. Annie and Lindsey come out of the Wallace house, with Lindsey carrying a bowl of popcorn and Annie having a coat over her negligee. They walk down the street to the Doyles, the wind blowing strong and whipping the negligee around Annie's legs as they make their way down the street. The SHAPE steps into the glow of the streetlight and watches them. Tommy runs to answer it and opens the door, where Annie and Lindsey stand. Lindsey sees the TV and runs into the living room, taking off her coat, sitting in front of the TV, and eating her popcorn. She glances at Annie's coat as Laurie glances at Lindsey. Before Laurie can say anything else, Annie rushes out the door. Laurie closes the door and looks in at Tommy and Lindsey engrossed in the Horror-thon. Annie hurries across the backyard and steps into the garage, walks to her car, tries the door, then quickly turns and walks out of the garage. Annie wanders through the empty house looking for her purse, finds it in the front room, takes out her brush and lipstick, and stands in front of the mirror primping. She glances up at her image in the mirror. Meanwhile, Tommy hides, preparing to jump out and scare Lindsey. Lindsey gets up from the couch to search for Tommy and turns around looking for him. For a moment, he glances out the window and sees the figure of a MAN carrying what seems to be a BODY across the Wallace's backyard. Tommy SCREAMS and jumps out from the curtain, scaring Lindsey, who also SCREAMS and begins crying. Laurie rushes in from the kitchen, finding the children in tears. Tommy points out the window, and Laurie bends down to comfort her. Tommy turns away from Laurie and Lindsey and walks over to the couch in front of the TV set, and almost instantly, Lindsey stops crying and follows him, sitting up next to Tommy and hugging him. Laurie shakes her head and walks back into the kitchen. Meanwhile, the old Myers house looks ominous and foreboding silhouetted against the dark, whishing trees. The camera tracks behind the hedge where Loomis sits waiting. Suddenly, there are noises from the street, and three boys, Keith, Richie, and Lonnie, creep up to the edge of the sidewalk in front of the old house, staring fearfully at the dark, tomb-like structure. Loomis parts the hedge in front of him and stares. For a moment, Lonnie hesitates, then slowly moves through the front gate up toward the porch, while Loomis watches the young boy walk toward the house, unsure whether he should interfere or just watch.",
    "42": "Everyone at the table stands together at the rail watching. A woman rises on tip-toes and kisses a man gently; he only looks at her. She kisses him again, and he responds a little better. As she starts to kiss him again, he stops her. The man hangs up the phone, swings his feet out of bed, spears his slippers, and reaches for his robe at the same time. He shuffles sleepily to the door as Gideon exits his room and goes to the elevator. The cage is there; he opens the door, enters, closes the sliding grill, and presses a button. The cage starts down, but Gideon begins sneezing. Suddenly, the elevator stops between floors and the lights go out, then just as suddenly, the lights come back on and the elevator resumes moving down. Gideon shakes his head and leans back, whistling again until the cage comes to his floor and starts past it, leaving him confused. The night porter, asleep behind the desk, does not notice as the elevator continues past the lobby level toward the basement and out of sight. Silence follows as the motor stops, then a series of sneezes ends with a terrifying shriek. Rudely awakened, the night porter runs to the elevator shaft as his shoes squeak. He looks up, sees nothing, then looks down, presses the call button, and the motor starts. An instant later, the cage appears and stops; the night porter opens the gate, pulls back the grill, and the camera rushes past him to pick up Gideon. Gideon's body sits on the floor of the cage in a grotesque, sprawling attitude resembling a puppet with its strings cut, except Gideon has no strings to cut—only a throat cut from ear to ear. In a close shot, Grandpierre appears doubly apoplectic as the camera pulls back to reveal Reggie and Adam in their bathrobes. Reggie shrugs, and she and Adam exchange looks before Grandpierre turns and leaves. Reggie and Adam start down the hall toward their rooms. Before hanging up, Adam reflects on Tex's words, then looks behind him, smiles softly, hangs up the phone, and heads for Reggie's door. Reggie slips back into her robe and goes to the connecting door, undoes the bolt, and opens it for Adam to enter. He takes a bag to the bed, dumps out the contents, and begins examining the items one by one, taking one out of an envelope before putting on his glasses to read it. He hands her the glasses, and she looks through them.",
    "44": "After she hangs up, she briefly looks at Tex's body, shudders, and then hurries to the door. As Reggie leaves her room and goes to the elevator, she notices that it is in use after pressing the button, so she goes to the stairs and starts down. Between the landings, the stairs curve around the open elevator shaft, and as Reggie comes down the stairs, the cage with Adam inside rises into view. For a moment, she stops and their eyes meet before Reggie starts running downstairs. Adam pushes the emergency stop button and starts the cage down. As Reggie comes off the stairs, passes the elevator gate, and starts toward the lobby, the cage is a few feet behind her. Reggie continues to run between the first landing and the lobby, with the elevator following. A taxi stands by the curb as Reggie leaves the hotel and runs to it. Adam tries to look past him to see Reggie but gives up and goes back toward the ticket booth, on the run. The camera leads Reggie as she runs through the nearly empty passageway, her footsteps echoing against the tile and concrete walls. The jumble of advertising posters passes rapidly, forming a moving band of letters, women, cartoons, and colors. Reggie pauses for a moment at a sign indicating two different directions, with an arrow for each. The camera pans sharply, 180 degrees, to pick up Adam rounding the corner in hot pursuit. Reggie starts down the platform, looking behind her every few steps, and suddenly looks up in surprise to see Adam across the tracks on the opposite platform; he has evidently made the wrong turn back in the passageway. They stare at each other for a moment before a bell rings, announcing the arrival of a train. Adam turns, running back through the exit behind him, as the approaching train can be heard. As the train pulls in and comes to a stop, the gendarme opens the door for Adam and escorts him out. Adam turns once more to look at Reggie as he goes, then quickly returns to the exit door and looks at the platform. From Adam's point of view, featuring him as he hurries from the car, he finds his way blocked by five nuns in large, white butterfly hats, taking him a few precious seconds to work his way around them. He stands on the platform as the train doors slam shut, the latches click, the whistle blows, and the train pulls out. He looks around in all directions for some sign of Reggie. As Adam enters the deserted area, there is, miraculously, no sign of Reggie. The camera pans to a phone booth, where we see Reggie's hand reaching up to dial a number.",
    "1029": "At the Hilton, Ryan sits in the low-lit bar, savoring a cool drink, as he watches a young woman who is staring at her cellphone with a set of car keys in her other hand. She looks at her key fob and is incredulous. They sit, comparing loyalty cards, and she stares at the card. Alex's eyes sparkle as she studies the concierge key and smiles thoughtfully. Ryan smiles, and they head to a room. Alex is an attractive woman with long, straight auburn hair. Ryan tries a swipe card at a door, but it doesn't open, so he uses another card to open the door, and they go in. Alex, in her 30s, with a curvaceous figure, walks across the room, naked apart from a tie around her waist, and lies on the bed, where the sheets are unruffled. Ryan is laying on cushions on the floor. Alex and Ryan sit facing each other and open their laptop computers, type an entry, and close their computers. Ryan stands by as Alex opens her hotel room door, she turns to him, they kiss, and they smile. She goes inside, closes the door, and he hangs a sign on the handle. Ryan swims in the hotel swimming pool, gets his shoes shined, and hires a car, as Hertz employees swipe his loyalty card through card-reading machines. In a gents outfit, Ryan looks at ties, then takes out his cellphone and looks at the display. Circular fields in various stages of production stretch to the horizon, with the fields being green, brown, and muddy yellow. There are grid pattern city streets, and Ryan arrives in Omaha. In his apartment block, Ryan pulls his case along a hall, lets himself into his small, sparsely furnished apartment, puts his keys on a worktop, pulls back a brown plastic concertina screen, and lays his case on the bed. A young woman comes in holding a large envelope and knocks on the worktop. Ryan takes out a large photo of a hugging couple stuck on a board, she smiles at him fondly and goes, and Ryan looks at the photo of the smiling couple. In a modern office building, the boss, Craig Gregory, has a meeting with Ryan and his colleagues. Prim, ponytailed Natalie stands by a screen, and a guy appears on the screen. Ryan frowns, worried, and goes to see Craig. Ryan smiles bitterly as she sits facing him. Chastised, Natalie sits back and looks down. Later, Craig goes to see Ryan in his office, where Ryan is standing, staring at a map of the U.S. Ryan turns to Craig and raises his eyebrows. Craig curls a piece of paper, holds up a finger, and shakes his head while Ryan screws up the piece of paper and throws it in the bin.",
    "209": "She screams, but the noise is cut off by the swinging door as George and his mother sit down at the table. Harry sticks his head through the kitchen door, and she follows Harry into the kitchen, leaving Pop and George. George and his father eat at the table, with a great similarity and understanding between them. Harry and his mother emerge from the kitchen, Harry balancing pies in each hand and on his head, and the camera pans with them as they cross. George and Pop remain at the table when Annie comes in with some dishes, then exits, only to return again from the kitchen and stop serving to hear his answer. She gives George a look and heads back to the kitchen. Bailey smiles and turns to George, stopping when he realizes he has hurt his father. To cover his embarrassment, he looks toward the kitchen door and calls to Annie, who is listening through the glass in the door. George and his father sit at the table, and at one end of the room, an orchestra plays. George wends his way through the dancing couples toward a supper table, carrying plates and pies with Harry. Several boys take the plates from him, and George looks at them, feeling grown up and out of place as Sam Wainwright enters behind Harry, waggling his hands at his ears as he talks. George swings around, delighted to hear a familiar voice. Sam is assured and breezy, wearing collegiate clothes, and George and Sam wiggle their fingers at their ears, saluting each other. An elderly, fussy school principal approaches George as Violet Bick enters and turns to face George, waving her dance program at him. Marty Hatch enters and suddenly stops as he sees Mary, staring at her while she talks to Freddie, a glass of punch in her hand. She turns around and sees George for the first time, losing her poise and staring at him. George stares back at Mary, who is smiling. Mary and Freddie are briefly together before Marty enters the scene, followed by George. Mary hands her punch cup to Freddie, and she and George start dancing, with the camera following them as they dance. A whistle is heard offscreen, stopping the music, and Harry is on the orchestra platform with the whistle in hand. As the music resumes and couples begin dancing again, George and Mary look at each other and start their Charleston. We see a series of shots of various couples doing their routines, some good, some bad, with Freddie needing no more. He leans against the railing around the dance floor, looking daggers at George.",
    "1185": "The tables are spread with a banquet of mouthwatering food, cakes, sweets, pies, and shiny red apples. Harry looks at the empty chair beside him. Suddenly, Professor Quirrell bursts into the hall. Professor Dumbledore gets to his feet. Quirrell faints. As the students follow quickly into the Hall, Snape disappears through a side door. Harry and Ron run back down the long stone corridor towards the girls' bathroom. They hide as they see a monstrous shadow ahead of them. The troll is dragging a heavy club. Wiping her eyes, Hermione comes out of the toilet. She sees two green legs as thick as great tree trunks. Terrified, she stares up with horror at the troll's lumpy, green body blocking the doorway. Its horrible head, which looks like a squashed, green potato, is almost touching the high ceiling. Raising the club, the troll moves ominously towards her. Hermione locks herself in a toilet. The troll swings the club and smashes it along the row of cubicles. The flimsy partitions fall on top of Hermione. The boys burst into the bathroom. As more cubicles are smashed to smithereens, they throw broken pieces of wood at the troll. Ron hurls a length of metal pipe. Hermione hides under a row of wash basins. Terrified, she cowers against the pipes as the troll smashes a sink off the wall. Harry pulls out his wand. He grabs the swinging club and scrambles up onto the troll's back. He tries to shake him off. Harry hangs on with one hand. But before he can use his wand, he accidentally rams it up the troll's nostril. The angry troll holds Harry upside down, swinging him from side to side. Ron takes out his wand. The troll's club flies up into the air and hovers. Then, it falls and hits the troll hard on its ugly, green head. The troll drops Harry. He scuttles out of the way, as the troll reels dizzily around then crashes heavily to the ground. As the dust settles, Hermione creeps out from under the row of sinks. Water sprays out of a shattered pipe. She looks at the troll nervously. Harry pulls his wand out of the troll's nostril. He wipes it on his cloak. Ron smiles at Harry. Quirrell steps forward. He jumps as the troll gives a snot. At breakfast, Snape appears. Harry notices that Snape is limping. Harry's snowy owl flies into the great hall skimming over their heads. It drops a long thin parcel. Harry catches it. They unwrap the brown paper, to reveal a streamline broomstick with a highly polished handle. Stroking the white owl's feathers, Professor McGonagall smiles at Harry. Wearing leather gloves and scarlet and gold cloaks, the Gryffindor Quidditch team assemble in the player's tunnel.",
    "1014": "A bright white light is held aloft by a statuesque woman wearing a long, white robe with a blue sash draped around her, standing on a cliff before a cloudy sky. A boy leaps off a jetty towards a lake and is frozen in midair as the traffic helicopter for a local news program flies over Sacramento, California. Names appear beside the white silhouetted symbols for a woman, then a man, which have red hearts on them. A young woman comes out of her house, talking on her phone, and a phone rings. The smart, attractive, blonde woman, Abby, arrives at work at the local TV station, KSXP, in a control room where a cooking show is on a studio set, and Technical Director, Cliff, turns to Abby. The chef swigs wine from a bottle, and Mary has a swig as Abby's boss, Stuart, switches off his monitors in the toilet. In a restaurant, Abby sits at a table with a guy, and she takes out his profile, causing him to look peeved. Later that night, Abby walks past an illuminated fountain and heads along a path through the pretty ornamental gardens outside her apartment building. She lets herself in her front door, and her cat, D'Artagnan, trots over while Abby looks thoughtful and a little sad. As she gets ready for bed, a TV plays in her bedroom, and D'Artagnan treads on the remote and changes channels. He gobbles a marshmallow on the end of a long skewer and slurps a coffee. Abby looks at Mike haughtily, and grinning, he shakes her hand. Abby paces in her office and rolls her eyes on the studio lot as he gets between them and snogs her. Larry throws Georgia over his shoulder and carries her off while Abby is lying on the floor in her office closet, frowning and sagging as she pulls the closet door shut. A girl cycles past a garage apartment on a leafy street as Mike walks into the apartment, dumps his bag on a chair, and presses play on his answer phone, frowning and crossing himself as he grabs the answer phone. Mike goes next door with his nephew, where Mike's sister, Elizabeth, has a cake for him. The upstairs of Abby's apartment has a balcony with light streaming through open French windows. In her bathroom, Abby runs her fingers through her long, blonde hair as the cat is by a broken fishbowl and D'Artagnan trots out of the window, up a tree with Abby standing underneath. She climbs and looks across to a neighboring balcony with French windows open to reveal a handsome, muscular guy wrapping a towel around his waist. Abby clamps her hand over the cat's snout and ogles the guy as he flosses his teeth and Abby grins. The branch breaks and she hangs upside down.",
    "484": "A woman passes the window, pauses, and peers out before quickly going away from the window, allowing us to see her in clear silhouette. After seeing the woman, Mary expects to get some attention and dashes out into the rain to her car, gets in, opens the side window, and begins to honk the horn. After a moment, a young man opens the front door of the house, pauses, and starts down the path. Mary leaves her car and dashes for the shelter of the porch. Seeing that Mary is on her way to the porch, he runs quickly, the umbrella unopened in his hand, and reaches the porch a moment after Mary. He stops short, looks at her, then at the umbrella hanging uselessly in his hand, then back at her, and gestures her into the office, standing back to indicate that he will go after her. Mary goes into the office, and the young man, Norman Bates, somewhere in his late twenties, thin, tall, soft-spoken, and hesitant, follows her in and closes the door. He is now behind the counter, pushing forward the registration book, as Mary places her handbag on the counter. She takes the registration book, picks up the pen, and is suddenly struck with the realization that she'd better use an alias, so she writes the name Marie Samuels. Norman removes a key for Cabin One, and we see that there is a remaining key on the board. He goes to the door and opens it, revealing that the rain has slowed down considerably. Mary follows him to the door, goes out on the porch, waits, and watches as Norman runs to her car, gets in, and drives it to the parking space in front of Cabin One. Mary walks along the porch and waits before the door of Cabin One. Norman gets out of the car with a suitcase, runs to the door, opens it, pushes the door open, puts his hand in, and switches on a light. Mary goes into the cabin, and Norman follows her, places the suitcase on the bed, goes to the window, and opens it. Mary closes the door, goes to the suitcase, opens it, and starts to take out a dress, with her handbag next to the suitcase. She glances down into it, pauses, drops the dress, reaches into the handbag, takes out the money-filled envelope, stares at it almost with regret, contemplates hiding it, decides to, and starts looking for a reasonable hiding place. She looks about at the closet, the drawers, etc., realizing all such places are obvious. Catching sight of the newspaper in her bag, she hits on a solution, opens the newspaper, places the envelope within it, lock-folds the paper again, and then places it on the bedside table as if it were there for later reading.",
    "525": "Mickey, reacting, hits his forehead and starts pounding the door again as the movie cuts to a beautiful snow-covered church downtown, complete with courtyard and wrought-iron fence. A pedestrian walks by with an umbrella. The music continues as the film moves inside, where the choir is seen singing behind an altar glowing warm gold. A fairly large congregation sits in darkened pews as the film cuts to the back, where Mickey, his arms crossed, stands underneath some stained-glass windows, watching and listening to the inspiring music. The choir continues to sing as the movie cuts to Father Flynn in his office. He picks up some large, heavy books from a shelf near his window and walks over to Mickey, who's standing near his desk, already holding several tomes. Father Flynn puts the books on top of Mickey's pile; Mickey, flipping through the top one, awkwardly carries his bundle to the door. Next is seen a close-up of a painting of Jesus Christ on the cross, complete with crown of thorns and holy expression. The hymn plays on, loudly, as the camera moves back, revealing Mickey, standing outside a barber shop window, looking at the Christ, playing and shuffling from side to side to get its eyes' 3-D effect. Mickey turns from the window, shrugging, and starts to walk down the street, past a fruit and vegetable store with open-air-displayed flowers, past several briskly moving pedestrians. With the hymn still playing, the screen goes black briefly. Mickey opens the door, the light from a hallway illuminating him. He's just entered his apartment. He closes the door and walks through his dark foyer; he carries a brown bag. He switches on the light and, walking past his spiral staircase, past several framed pictures on the wall, he makes his way to his living room coffee table. Mickey pulls a crucifix out of the bag; he looks at it, then puts it on the table near a pile of books and some objets d'art. He then takes out a copy of the New Testament, putting it on top of the crucifix. Then out comes a framed picture of a saint. It too gets put on the growing pile. Next comes a large loaf of Wonder Bread and a large jar of Hellman's mayonnaise. Mickey sets them on top of the saint. Lee is walking down the street, looking around her. She passes some office buildings, a store's large display window; she stops when she sees Hannah. Her sister is waiting outside the Art Deco facade of a restaurant; she's looking in the opposite direction. Lee taps Hannah on the shoulder; Hannah, surprised, turns and gasps. She turns and walks towards the restaurant entrance.",
    "859": "Sandra goes behind the counter and into a gloomy corridor where she stops and looks at a door slightly ajar with light peeping through the gap. She steps towards the door, pushes it wide open, and enters the office, where shafts of bright sunlight stream through the small window above the desk, bathing her face in golden light. Sandra moves a chair to the wall, stands on it, and looks out the window to see Howard bound to an inverted cross, with enormous blisters bubbling on his skin. As the blisters on Howard's exposed arms and chest throb, Sandra climbs down off the chair, and Kyle runs in and grabs her around the waist, but she elbows him aside. Audrey wakes up and runs to the office where Sandra is heaving the desk away from the door, then pushes Audrey away and runs outside. Percy grabs Sandra around the waist to turn her away as Howard's stomach explodes in a shower of steaming liquid. Percy heaves Sandra back into the office, where she flops on the floor. Charlie stares at Percy, leaning in the doorway, as he stares blankly into space, then falls flat on his face. His back is burnt off, steam wafts around his exposed organs, and later, in the storeroom, Percy lies under a white sheet while Bob leans on the covered corpse with a wretched expression, and Jeep stands in the doorway as Bob's face twitches. In the diner, Sandra, now bound to a chair with wrists tied behind her back, sits as bright shafts of light stream through gaps between planks nailed against the window. Kneeling in front of Sandra, Audrey takes a pill from a pot as Sandra, with tears on her face, nods. Audrey pops the pill in her mouth, offers Sandra a drink through a straw, and smiles, but Sandra narrows her eyes and fixes Audrey with a cold, bitter stare. Kyle walks in, prompting a shaken Audrey to get up and follow Kyle. Meanwhile, Charlie sits looking pensive as Audrey tries to tune the radio, turning the dial and moving the aerial around. Michael shakes his head, and Charlie looks down at her belly. Standing in the bathroom, Charlie lights a cigarette, has a puff, regards her pretty face in the mirror by the light of a lantern and a couple of candles, with an expression fraught. She gently runs her thumb over her pregnant belly, then throws down the cigarette sharply, stamps on it, grabs her jacket, walks out, and sits alone in the kitchen with her feet up. She looks up and smiles at Jeep before taking her feet off the chair.",
    "1110": "A spider, bigger than a man's hand, jumps out of the box and scuttles past Harry and off down the corridor. Harry stretches out his hand, but a wind seems to draw him away as the door slams shut. Back on Harry's desk, the book opens and glows with light. Harry lands back in his chair in the school courtyard where they look at each other guiltily. As Hagrid walks towards the school, a boy rushes out past him, and they all run to the boys' dormitory, stopping in the doorway. The floor is covered with scattered books and papers, broken picture frames, and feathers. The mattress and pillows of Harry's four-poster bed have been slashed, and drawers have been emptied out. Hedwig the Snowy Owl sits on the desk as Harry searches through a pile of books on the floor. The Gryffindor team heads for the pitch, and in the hospital wing, Madam Pomfrey is standing next to a bed where a petrified girl is lying. Harry and Ron stare with horror at the stiff figure and a hand mirror. Hermione's eyes are wide open and staring as Harry gently strokes her outstretched hand in the Gryffindor common room. She sweeps out, and concerned, the students look at each other as Harry turns to Ron. In Hagrid's cottage at the edge of the dark forest, his dog Fang raises his head, and Hagrid picks up his crossbow, kicking open the door. Harry and Ron hide under the invisibility cloak as Lucius Malfoy opens the door and steps inside, stopping near the boys under the cloak. Fudge goes to take it, but Dumbledore stops him, taking the scroll and staring straight at Harry and Ron. Lucius Malfoy looks around suspiciously, crosses to the door, and giving the boys one last look, Dumbledore follows him. Fudge looks confused and stares at the huge dog as they leave, and the boys reappear. Lines of spiders are following each other up the wall and out of the window as Harry lifts down a heavy lantern, and the huge hound follows them outside. They look up at the light from the cottage window while the spiders crawl down the wall and on to the ground. Ron watches the spiders nervously as they scuttle after each other away into the forest. Harry starts walking and Ron follows Harry reluctantly, with Fang dropping ahead as they make their way through the dark night into the gloomy forest. Fang sniffs the ground as they are led deeper into the shadowy forest, terrified of spiders. Ron walks on his toes trying not to tread on them, while Harry ignores him and keeps on walking. Harry stops and holds up the lantern, revealing that the spiders have led them to the mouth of a large tunnel dug into the sandy soil under the roots of a tree.",
    "289": "She gets up from Jeff's lap and puts the overnight case on the table, then goes to the window and looks toward the song-writer's apartment, where the party has grown considerably larger, with an assortment of well-dressed people crowded into the studio, drinking and eating. Lisa stands listening, entranced, while Jeff watches her. She sits down on the edge of the divan near Jeff and leans toward him. Jeff's tension eases off a little, but he is eager to talk. Doyle looks back toward Thorwald's bedroom, and we see the dark apartment beyond him. He turns his head suddenly at the sound of Lisa coming out of the kitchen, rotating the brandy to warm it. She is quite beautiful and holds two large brandy snifters, the stems between her fingers. She continues rotating the brandy and then comes forward, handing one snifter to Jeff, as Doyle reacts to her appreciatively. She offers the second to Doyle, who sort of smiles and takes the snifter awkwardly, bowing his head slightly, but his eyes remain on her in a fixed stare. Lisa smiles in return, turns around, and goes back into the kitchen. Doyle stares after her, ignoring her remark, still not recovered from the first sight of her attractiveness. Then, quickly, his eyes move down and to the left to the open overnight case with its displayed lingerie. Slowly, Doyle's eyes travel back to Jeff, who quickly guesses what's on Doyle's mind and picks up the phone, turning his head to Lisa, who answers. Doyle looks suddenly interested and asks tersely, his head snapping back to Jeff, who answers. Doyle's head moves back to Lisa as she answers with a touch of pride in her voice. Before Doyle can comment, Jeff asks impatiently. Doyle smiles at Jeff and then strolls over to the table, where he puts out his cigarette and puts down the brandy snifter, then goes to the window and looks out as they watch him expectantly. His voice is flat and to the point as he speaks without looking at them, and Jeff and Lisa stare at him in astonishment. Jeff then recovers and answers with some anger. He starts to place the room and spins around, his face losing all its friendliness, as she replies with some sarcasm. Lisa and Jeff converse, with Jeff reasoning and Lisa cutting in spiritedly. Doyle starts to pace up and down, throwing out a hand in careful explanation, while Jeff is resentful of Doyle's comments to Lisa. Doyle has turned away into the center of the room and swings around, as Lisa speaks again with continuing sarcasm, and Doyle comes toward the camera again.",
    "738": "A bearded man knocks into Jack and spills his beer on Rose. Bjorn slammed Thomas' fist to the tabletop. Rose pulls Tommy's cigarette from his mouth. Rose puffs on it. She blows out smoke and hands Jack the hem of her skirt. As Jack holds onto her dress, Rose slowly lifts her heels and rises onto her toes. Jack gazes down as Rose stands on her tiptoes and collapses into Jack's arms. Cal's manservant, Lovejoy, descends halfway down the staircase and peers around the room. He spies Jack holding Rose in his arms. The couples hold hands as they dance in a line through the crowded room. Fabrizio grabs Rose's hand and she grabs Jack. The line of dancers snake through the clapping drinking crowd. The next day, Rose and Cal eat breakfast at a table in the private promenade. Cal shakes his head. As Rose stirs her coffee, she and Cal exchange glances. Cal stands and flips over their dining table. Cal walks away. As he steps through the doorway, an aproned woman rushes over to Rose, then bends and picks up dishes. Rose crouches to help. Rose lays her hand on dark haired Trudy's shoulder and sinks against her chair. Later in Rose's room, Trudy laces up the back of Rose's corset. Ruth steps in. Trudy curtsies and steps out. Ruth walks to Rose and ties the laces of her corset. Turning her head, Ruth covers her mouth. She closes her eyes, exhales, and drops her hand. Ruth turns back to Rose. Ruth gazes at Rose, then reaches out her hands. Gently cradling Rose's face, Ruth kisses her cheek. She turns Rose back around, then continues lacing the corset. Rose grimaces as Ruth tightens the laces. In the dining room, a man plays piano as first class passengers, holding sheet music, sing. Rose stands between Cal and her mother. Jack descends the grand staircase. One hand in his pocket, Jack strolls toward the dining room where two stewards stand outside its doors. One steward wearing a dark suit steps in front of Jack. Inside, Lovejoy steps toward the door. Lovejoy emerges. Lovejoy hands the money to the steward. The two stewards escort Jack away. On the bridge, a crewman steps up to the captain. Captain Smith reads a note, then smiles at Ruth. Outside, Jack climbs a railing, then hops onto a deck where a boy wearing a cap winds a string around a top. The boy spins the top on the deck. Jack steps toward another railing, pauses, and picks up a black bowler hat and long coat from a chair. Donning the hat, Jack wets his fingers and plasters down his hair. Wearing the hat and coat, Jack grabs Rose's arm.",
    "890": "They both look over at Darcy, who glowers before striding away. Lydia and Kitty drag Denny and the other officer away. Lizzie looks puzzled and a little disappointed, but her bad humor disappears when she spies Charlotte across the room. She hurries over to her happily. Mr. Collins, all in black, prances over to the lady next to Lizzie. He holds out a hand to Lizzie, who reluctantly takes it, and they cross the floor to join the dance. They curtsey and bow, circle each other. Then, he returns to the line of men. As Lizzie dances, Mr. Collins leers at her, then, normally, makes to follow her in the dance. Darcy is watching with amusement. Lizzie sees him looking and glares. Darcy's face drops and then returns to his usual stern composure. He slowly walks around the dancers passing Mrs. Bennet deep in conversation. He watches Jane and Bingley performing the intricate moves of the dance. As they cross each other, briefly holding each other's outstretched hands, Darcy seems to take more of an interest in them. He looks contemptuously at Lydia dancing with gay abandon with the officers. Darcy turns back on himself stopping by flickering candles, his eyes once more drawn back to Lizzie, skipping in a circle with her dance set, her dark hair swinging like a ponytail. Darcy's gaze is steady, his high white shirt collar and dark coat frame his stern features. Another dance is taking place. Charlotte and Lizzie are talking. Darcy is standing before them. He bows. They curtsy in return. He bows once more and leaves. Lizzie resignedly leaves Charlotte's sight. With the men on one side of the floor and women on the other, Lizzie and Darcy stand opposite to each other looking serious. The men slowly bow and the dance begins. The gentlemen and the ladies grasp each other's hands, and circle one way, then the other. Lizzie and Darcy maintain steady eye-contact throughout. As they move away from each other, then double back to cross over, a slight smile is playing across Lizzie's lips. Darcy's face betrays no emotion. They form a straight line with another couple before releasing hands, turning and coming to a brief halt facing each other. The dance forces them away from each other. She sighs heavily raising her eyebrows. They circle each other holding hands. Darcy is still serious. The passing of the dance leads Lizzie away for a moment, then back again. They separate to allow a couple to move between them, then they return to being opposite to one another. Lizzie hides a look of amusement as the dance continues. The nine couples move in unison watched by other guests, a magnificent chandelier hanging over their heads.",
    "742": "Skeeter looks away troubled as her mother weighs her words carefully. Skeeter, looking at her handsome, regal-looking mother, nods in acknowledgment but then lowers her eyes. Smiling warmly, Charlotte leans in and kisses Skeeter on the forehead. Skeeter tries to smile but is overcome by sadness, and Charlotte hugs her tightly. Out in the sunshine, Minnie is strolling towards Celia's house with a bag of groceries, fanning herself in the heat, when a red Chevrolet Corvette Convertible rolls into view. Minnie's eyes shift, but she doesn't quicken her pace. The car zooms right up behind her, and she turns to see Johnny at the wheel. She hurries towards the house, throws down the grocery bag, and picks up a loose branch before tossing it away. Johnny helps pick up the groceries, hands her her bag, and with a gentle guiding hand at her back and a good-natured smile, he walks her towards the house. In the heavily decorated dining room, Celia, in an off-the-shoulder dress, carefully places a dish of cookies into the center of the table, alongside a cooked ham, several cakes and pies, and other dishes of food. Johnny, taking off his jacket, leads the way into the dining room and stands next to his wife. Minnie looks bemused, then her lips crease into a smile as Celia beams from ear to ear. Johnny pulls out a chair for Minnie, and as Celia serves up, Minnie looks admiringly at the spread in front of her. Minnie and Aibileen, smartly dressed, hurry to church where the whole congregation stands. Looking bewildered, Aibileen joins in the clapping, then looks from smiling Pearly to smiling Minnie, who proffers her the book, and she stares at it numbly. With her eyes lowered, she takes it from him, and finally, summoning up a smile, Minnie, standing with the congregation, lifts an approving eyebrow. Aibileen beckons her to join her, and she, too, seems suddenly shy, stepping up next to her friend in front of all the people. The two women stand arm-in-arm facing the packed church. Outside her home, Skeeter leafs through the pages of signatures, her expression solemn, hesitating to meet their gaze. Aibileen holds out her hand to Skeeter, who smiles and nods through her tears. Back on duty, Aibileen lets herself into Elizabeth's kitchen through the back door, her arms loaded with groceries. Hilly is with Elizabeth and her baby son, and Mae Mobley runs up to Aibileen, but Hilly blocks her. Elizabeth hurries out of the room with the baby as Hilly eyes Aibileen with ice-cold menace. Aibileen grabs Hilly's arm, and with her lips trembling, Hilly holds Aibileen's firm gaze then runs off into the next room. Aibileen blows out her cheeks as she tries to catch her breath.",
    "947": "The man heads off as bearded, middle-aged Meinhard gets out of a carriage outside of the Addrelle de Fleuve, with a rough looking bloke hovering nearby with another identical man, keeping an eye on Meinhard. At a gypsy camp in the countryside, men practice their horse riding skills as Holmes and Watson drive up on the outskirts of the camp in an open carriage. A man comes over to hold their horse while Watson calls over to a group of men and nudges Holmes, who appears to be asleep. A gypsy man indicates a bearded man holding a goose, and the gypsies surround Holmes and Watson, who smile politely. The man takes it, then Watson knocks him cold, causing the atmosphere to become more strained. A man opens his jacket, revealing a knife, and Sim pushes through the crowd with her bag, which the gypsies have taken off Holmes. The man Watson punched watches as they eat a meal, with Watson looking up from his bowl and frowning while Holmes glares at him. Sim hands the drawings to the gypsy man, who passes them to Holmes, and Holmes licks the red stain before turning conspiratorially to Watson. Holmes drinks from a proffered bottle as Watson gets up and dances energetically with a gypsy outside, with Sim joining in too, while Holmes watches and twitches his shoulders in time with the music. At the castle home of Mycroft Holmes, Mary walks into a study and finds him completely naked. She takes the telegram and goes as Carruthers goes, while Stanley, the dithering ancient butler, turns around. Under a leaden sky in Paris, a carriage with Imperata stenciled on the side pulls up on a side street, and Sim, Holmes, and Watson are ushered from it into a building where they pass two men wheeling a coat-of-arms shaped cake on a trolley. They are led into a busy kitchen, making their way past chefs working at worktops until they are stopped and searched by another man. Holmes notes an empty baking tray, some royal icing in gold leaf laurels, a shield, and a newspaper on a worktop before he, Sim, and Watson are ushered down some stairs to emerge in a basement room where a man, Ravache, sits at a table with his back to them, eating. Watson sniffs a piece of paper as Holmes and Sims sit down. Ravache takes a gulp of red wine, wipes his mouth with a napkin, sips his wine, and then shoots himself in the head. Upstairs in the kitchen, his colleagues hear the shot and run off to investigate while Holmes gets to his feet, and Watson fires warning shots up the stairs as Holmes stares into an alcove.",
    "766": "The torch flows brightly as the shining light gives way to the pitch-black darkness of space, where a shining parabola cuts through the inky blackness. The curving edge of planet Earth is illuminated, dwarfing further planets in the distance, while the glowing rings of Saturn arc around the planet's central sphere. Fast solo flares erupt from the surface of the sun, with tendrils of white-hot flame flickering around the billowing molten components, leading to a swift transition to Earth on a rainy night. The gates of a mine open, and a taxi drives through, carrying the spectacled 30-something Adrian Hold, who spots a young boy sitting by a key, cuddling with a toy boat. The driver ignores Adrian and drives through a puddle, splashing the boy and his boat. Inside the Institute of Astrophysics at the University of New Delhi, they stand on a rickety, descending limb. The lift reaches the bottom where a bearded man has been switched over, and Gurdeep grabs ice buckets. At a computer terminal, another screen displays the solar eruptions, and Adrian frowns at the screen. Gurdeep pours ice around Doctor Lokesh's feet, and a door opens into a dark chamber containing a water tank. Gurdeep helps Satin open up the large tank as Adrian stares down into the tank, where the water inside bubbles and boggles. Meanwhile, Adrian arrives at the Lincoln Plaza Hotel in Washington D.C., where he takes a document from his bag. A barely 40-something Anheuser frowns at Adrian, takes the document from his hand, and puts his drink down on a waiter's tray, walking off with the document while fishing a pair of glasses from his top pocket on the way past Adrian. Anheuser reads the document in a quiet corner of the party while Adrian stands behind him. Anheuser frowns, looks up, and turns as Scotty, with Adrian's duffle bags still in his arms, watches Adrian follow Anheuser from the party. During the day, police try to control an anti-G8 protest as a car drives across a spherical building. The distinguished-looking 60-something US President Wilson enters the G8 Summit, scanning around a large table where many other people are either standing or seated. An interpreter leaves the station, and a large number of the other people present file out of the room, leaving Wilson looking around as the double doors close behind him, with eight heads of state remaining. Meanwhile, military choppers fly over the shoreline village as locals board trucks, including a young villager named Nima. Soldiers stop Nima's brother Tenzen from following the truck as it drives away, and villagers raise their hands while Tenzen raises his hat. The Kernel points, and the villagers look up as controlled explosions detonate high in the mountains, while MI Techs Officer Isaac arrives outside his suite.",
    "1361": "Abby steps away, not wanting to ponder Larry's balls anymore than she has to, and she walks in on a shouting match between Josh, a leftist angry news writer, and Dori, the entertainment-leaning co-writer. Javier, the new fat weatherman, takes a huge bite and they all laugh. Abby talks to Stuart Wardlow, KPHX's curmudgeonly general manager, and looks worried but nods in response to him. She then rips out an extra two feet of floss and holds up her clipboard, which has a guy's E-Harmony profile and photo. Abby stops flossing and looks at Joy, and there's an awkward silence between them before she pulls out another piece of paper and hands it to him. She hears a noise coming from her bedroom and sees D'Artagnan's paw in the fish bowl, trying to scoop up a goldfish. He holds up several books, reading the titles, then drops the books, picks up a can of gasoline, and pours it on them. Mike shoves a burnt marshmallow into his mouth, mimes swallowing, and then we pan off the television to the bed where Abby watches, appalled. Mike hangs up the phone, and Abby, now infuriated, picks up the phone and begins dialing as we intercut between the stage and her apartment, with Mike continuing his rant. Irritated, Abby begins to compulsively remake her bed while Mike bowls over laughing. Abby and Joy make their way into the conference room where Dori and Josh are already present, and on TV, Mike's face appears. Joy looks at Abby, who holds up a piece of paper for Stuart to read, and then she spins to face him. Abby is pacing on the verge of hysteria when there is a knock on the door, and Mike appears. Abby glares at him, and he stares back, surprised, as she gags and pushes past him, walking out. Abby strides down the hall with Georgia and Larry, then Mike gives a cocky wave and Abby and the control room crew watch the proceedings. In the control room, Abby smirks, but then looks like she's going to pass out as Cliff shrugs. Larry grabs Georgia and kisses her hard; after a moment of resistance, she melts into his arms and he throws her over his back, hauling her off the set. Abby is sitting in a ball in her closet when Mike's sister, Elizabeth, walks in wearing a nurse's uniform and holding a cake box. She hands him the cake box, gives him a kiss on the cheek, and he grins. Elizabeth fumes, jabbing the earpiece in his ear as he crosses to a candle-lit table with a fancy dinner placed in the center and several books beside it, while a man plays violin nearby.",
    "676": "A car crashes through, prompting Peter to dive across the table at MJ, grabbing her and pulling both of them to the floor just as the car flies past their heads and lands upside down on its roof in the middle of the cafe. Peter helps MJ to her feet, and they hear thuds coming from outside. The ground shakes as Peter sees the three-pronged pincers at the end of a mechanical limb approaching the cafe, supporting Octavius. One limb drags Peter to Octavius, while another removes Octavius' shades. The limb clutching Peter throws him across the cafe, causing him to slam against the back wall and fall to the floor amidst debris. Octavius smiles at MJ, then uses a limb to grasp her firmly and stride away with the other three, while he remains elevated, limbs protruding from his metal spine as they climb up a building, eventually disappearing from view. Peter bursts from the rubble, stands firm, and runs onto the street. His vision is blurry with his glasses on, but clear without them. After taking them off and dropping them to the ground, a lens pops out as it bounces. Peter clenches his fist, looks around, and, with determination, strides on. At the Bugle, Robbie enters the editor's office, and Jonah's eyes grow weary at the sight of the Spider-Man costume hanging on the wall. He turns away as Spider-Man once again swoops and soars through the streets of New York, propelling himself with webs between tall buildings. As Spider-Man approaches the Westside Tower, Octavius climbs over its clock face, and Spider-Man lands on the flagpole at its peak. A limb clashes with the pole, and a hand-to-hand fight ensues, with Spider-Man's two fists against Octavius' six limbs. Spider-Man is thrown but manages to grab a clock hand until a limb knocks it off, causing him to fall. He shoots webs at the clock face, catching the falling hand with another web before flinging it at Octavius, embedding it in the wall next to him. However, Octavius' limbs break it in half and hurl the pieces at Spider-Man. A limb punches Spider-Man down, but he attaches two webs over Octavius and pulls him, resulting in both men descending together and crashing onto the roof of a passing train. Bouncing along the carriage roofs, they rise and face each other as the train continues between the city buildings.",
    "682": "Underwater, the body of Octavius, the four limbs still attached to him, floats downwards, as does the sphere, and the entire lab sinks below the surface of the river. High on a crane, Spider-Man has woven a web over which he crawls to MJ, and he lies beside her way above the river, the lights of the city twinkling far below them. She looks earnestly at him, and he stares at her. She screws up her face and fights back tears. Down below, a convoy of squad cars speeds towards the waterside. Up on the web attached to the crane, MJ turns to face Spider-Man once more, and he half-smiles. Later, he eases her down towards the ground with an ever-lengthening string of web emanating from his wrist. As she glides elegantly down from on high, the convoy of cars draws closer to her, their lights flashing. The lead car slues to its left and stops, and the passenger door opens and out steps John, who looks up at the descending MJ. As she lands on the bridge of a boat, John races towards her, and she turns on hearing him approach. John leaps from the pier onto the boat, then clambers upstairs as MJ descends towards him. Meeting in the middle, they hug tightly. As John nuzzles her neck, MJ looks across and up to the crane, where a distant figure squats in true Spider-Man pose. Peter slips on the mask, looks at the city, then round to MJ, before leaping into the night sky carried by a web. Tears trickle down MJ's face as she rests her head on John's shoulder. Meanwhile, Harry sits alone in the apartment, fondling the blade of the dagger with which he'd intended to kill Spider-Man. Hearing a noise, Harry gets to his feet, the dagger in his right hand, and takes a few paces forward and listens. A door opposite him swings open, and Harry looks anxiously around and stares up at the balcony surrounding the room. He turns to the full-length mirror and stares at his late father, shakes his head, then flings the dagger at the mirror. It crashes through his father's reflection to reveal a room beyond. Stupefied, Harry moves to the mirror doorway, avoiding the jagged pieces of broken mirror, and slides through into a brick chamber. There are cobwebs, which he brushes aside as he strides through, then turns, catching sight of something out of the corner of his eye: the mask of the Green Goblin. Harry crashes into a set of shelves filled with spherical bombs, there are row upon row of the weapons his father once used, and Harry catches sight of a cylindrical vial containing a phosphorescent green liquid. He picks it up, examines it, then marches into another section of the secret chamber.",
    "1170": "Harry lines up next to the keeper, Oliver Wood, and swallows nervously. The gate opens, and the teams step forward. One after the other, they fly out of the player's tunnel and swoop around between the tall spectator towers, which surround the oval grassy arena. A student introduces the game. In the stands, Gryffindor supporters wear red and gold scarves, while Slytherin's colors are green and white. The Slytherin team fly out in their green cloaks. Standing around the oval arena, the spectators cheer on their teams, with other spectators seated at the top of tall towers hung with heraldic designs. The players hover above the Quidditch trunk, which stands quivering in the center of the pitch. Madam Hooch kicks the trunk, and the lid falls open as three boars fly out. She lifts out the red Quaffle and throws it high into the air. A Gryffindor chaser, Angelina, grabs the Quaffle and heads straight for the goal. The spectators duck as the players swoop low over their heads. The Slytherin players try to hit Angelina off, but she's too quick for them. She aims for the center hoop, and the Quaffle sails straight through the middle, putting points on the scoreboard. Harry is nearly knocked off his broomstick by a passing Bludger. Hagrid cheers on the Gryffindors, while Snape stares and Quirrell looks nervous. The Slytherin captain gives Angelina a slight kick. Dodging a Bludger, he hurls the Quaffle towards a hoop, then scowls as Oliver skillfully knocks it away and gives him a cheeky smile. The Gryffindors capture the Quaffle, ducking and diving, passing it around the team from chaser to chaser. Well placed in front of the goal, Angelina catches the Quaffle and hurls it straight through the center of the hoop, past the helpless Slytherin keeper, adding twenty points on the scoreboard. The Gryffindor supporters are ecstatic. The Slytherin captain aims again for the goal, but Oliver catches the Quaffle, and the captain smiles angrily. Snatching a bat from a beater, he deliberately hits a Bludger straight to Oliver, who falls backwards through the hoop and hurdles downwards, landing heavily on the dry sand below the goal. Harry stares with disbelief at the cheating Slytherin captain. Malfoy and his cronies celebrate while Professor McGonagall watches anxiously. A Slytherin sails over the beater's head and shoots accurately at the hoop; the Quaffle flies through, giving ten points to Slytherin. Harry clenches his fists with frustration. The Slytherin captain points at Angelina, and with his teammate, on each side, jostles and confuses her. She collides with one of the tall spectator towers, tumbles down behind the canvas covering, and lies without moving on the gravel path below.",
    "476": "He stands shaking, staring wildly. Constanze gets up, perplexed. Overjoyed, she stops and kisses his hand. He raises her and then clasps her to him clumsily. They stare at one another: Constanze in total disbelief. He glares at her. Salieri sits at his desk, staring up at the cross. Salieri stares at the cross. Salieri stirs himself. A servant appears. She looks at him inquiringly, and drops the portfolio on the floor; pages of music pour out of it. To its grand and weighty sound, Constanze starts to undress, watched by the horrified Salieri. He opens his mouth in distress. The candle flickers over her as she removes her clothes and prepares for his embrace. CU, the fireplace. In it lies the olivewood Christ on the cross, burning. Mozart chuckles delightedly. Salieri offers him a glass of white dessert and a spoon. Mozart takes it absently and goes on talking. Hysterical barking and howling. The hall is full of dogs, at least five, all jumping up and dashing about and making a terrific racket. Mozart, dandified in a new coat and a plumed hat for the occasion, has arrived to teach at the house of a prosperous merchant, Michael Schlumberg. Bluff, friendly and coarse-looking, he stands in his hall amidst the leaping and barking animals, greeting Mozart. Suddenly the girl rises. Mozart smiles at the parents. They smile nervously back. Mozart slides along the bench, raises his hands, and preludes over the keys. Instantly, a dog howls loudly. Startled, Mozart stops. Mozart stops. Amazed, Mozart starts to play the Rondo again. The dog howls louder. He bows to them and leaves the room. Both men embrace. A cramped, low-ceilinged little room which nobody has tidied for ages. Also, there are many empty wine bottles; musical instruments - among them a mandolin, a viola, a forte-piano with the black and white keys reversed - books and abandoned plates of food. Mozart clasps his father's arms. Leopold is now seen as an aging, travel-stained man in clothes that need repair. His face is lined, and he is obviously not in perfect health. He carries the bag across the room. Constanze lies in bed. She sits up, startled. He opens the door of the bedroom. Constanze, who looks ill and tired, stares at Leopold. Leopold stares back from the doorway. He closes the door again. He picks up some pages of manuscript. Laughingly, the bystanders take it up, especially the children. As Leopold glares furiously about him, the actress succeeds in getting Constanze's wig firmly onto his head. Everybody bursts into applause. Applause. All the bystanders are watching. SMASH CUT: Salieri's masked face whips around and looks at her. A repetition of the shot of Mozart at the forte-piano, wearing Constanze's wig and emitting a shrill giggle.",
    "312": "Evan gets no answer from Lenny, who stands in the exact same spot. Evan spins to face her, grabs his psychology textbook from under his seat, gets up, and turns in his exam. He flashes a confident smile, opens the window, and checks out his Psych project: a small maze with several flatworms at one end and a bowl of cornflakes at the other. Cricket puts on her Doc Martens as Evan watches the worms. Plenty of underage students carry pitchers of beer to their tables while Evan and Thumper play pool against two young women. Heidi, beautiful and wearing ripped jeans with no makeup, is there. Thumper seems oblivious to their taunts as Evan knocks the three-ball in the side. Another barrage of popcorn hits Thumper's jacket, although his hand clenches on the cue, and he meekly shuffles away to the opposite side of the pool table from the cackling Greeks. Evan and Heidi, making out, burst through the door and fall on the bed. Evan's shirt is unbuttoned, and Heidi strokes his chest, but suddenly Heidi stops and sniffs the air. Evan drunkenly crosses the room, grabs two beers from the mini-fridge, and Heidi takes one. Heidi then looks under the bed. Color drains from Evan's face as he realizes what he's reading. As Evan reads, the world seems to almost imperceptibly vibrate around him like a tuning fork. He looks around, utterly confused by his surroundings. Before an answer comes, Tommy smiles at his good fortune and swings the plank, hitting Evan's head. Evan is sent sprawling backward, his forehead bleeding freely as Tommy knocks him hard in the ribs with his boots. Evan writhes in agony, his face against the ground. Lenny moves toward the gunny sack, lifts it, and tugs desperately on the rope that traps Crockett inside. Tommy spins around and flashes an evil smile. Evan, beaten and bloody, reaches out with his last bit of strength, grabs Tommy's foot, and holds on, but Tommy yanks his leg back, breaking Evan's grip. Tommy smiles viciously at Lenny, traumatized to watch Tommy pick up the lighter fluid and spray a liquid fuse from the campfire to the soaked gunny sack. Evan comes to with Heidi slapping him awake. After getting his bearings, he grabs his jacket and exits, leaving her dumbfounded. Evan drives and, exhausted, finally pulls into Lenny's driveway. Now 20, Lenny is making a model airplane in a room filled with model airplanes. Mrs. Kagan, grayer and fatter, opens the door and escorts Evan inside. Lenny looks up to see Evan, his jaw dropping. We see Lenny's working on the model again, in his own world. Evan picks up a model airplane from the desk but is startled and drops the model on the desk.",
    "1220": "Corpses litter the remains of the village, and huts and trees are on fire as the commander watches, his eyes hidden behind his sunglasses. Green forests surround a misty mountain that towers over a lake, where Rambo's boat sits serenely at its home harbor. Rambo sits on the deck with his elbows resting on his knees, toying with the crucifix Sarah gave him in his sinewy hands, looks up thoughtfully, and then stands. Sheets of lightning bombard dark mountaintops, and a montage of flashback images of Rambo in combat suddenly fills his thoughts before Rambo lies in a hammock. He climbs out, and in the rain-soaked darkness, a figurine silhouette holding an umbrella stands in the half-light, lowers the brolly, and walks toward him. Rambo switches on a light to reveal Marshall, a middle-aged man with neat gray hair, wearing a dark overcoat over a collarless pale blue shirt. Rambo starts thinking about something and then walks toward him, before beating a piece of hot steel, shoving the metal into burning coals, and dousing the white hot metal in water, which cools to form the shape of a machete. On a rainy morning, Reese, one of a motley collection of mercenaries in Rambo's boat—including bearded Diaz and En-Joo, handsome stubbly School Boy, and bald Lewis—sings, while Rambo sits at the tiller, watching them. Lewis stands at the prow of the boat, looking out at the river, while Rambo stares at Lewis blankly. Lewis returns the stare, and Rambo looks vacantly ahead. With an angry glare at Rambo, Lewis returns to the prow of the boat and continues his belligerent surveillance while Rambo gazes out across the water surface as a flock of birds takes off en masse. A watchtower at a military camp is surrounded by razor wire as troops eat in a large mess tent, and one idly throws leftovers over his shoulder into a cage of female prisoners outside. Three soldiers troop out of the mess hut as the Burmese flag is raised on a pole, beneath which are two ranks of downcast male prisoners, now army draftees. A drill instructor thumps one in the stomach, and the camp huts sit on timber with above-ground supports as foundations. Sarah lies bound beneath one, where the foundation is divided into two sections, and in the section next to Sarah, two fat pigs fight over food. Through the slat, she watches a soldier walk away from the hut as the commander and the subordinate have an overview of a larger compound in which the pigs roam freely. Opposite the soldier's vantage point and above the piggery is a cage in which the downcast male survivors of Michael's party kneel, their hands tied behind them, and their faces muddy. One lifts his head and catches the commander's eye.",
    "585": "He enters Whip's room with a video camera as a nurse helps Whip from the bed exposing his buttocks. The nurse leaves the room. Harling places his hand on Whip's head and leaves. Whip closes his eyes. Whip is startled awake. He looks around the dark room, then clicks on the light. He peeks into the corridor as a nurse walks by the reception desk. He quickly limps down the hall using a cane. He sees Nicole sitting on the stairs smoking a cigarette. She rises to leave. She sits. Whip leans against the wall facing her. He lights a cigarette. She shakes her head. A patient climbs the stairs. Nicole tosses her pack. The gaunt man stands by his IV pole. She shakes her head. She glances at Whip. The bold man turns to Whip. Cigarette hanging out of his mouth, the man picks up the IV pole and walks down the stairs. She wipes a tear from her eye, offers a smile, then stands and climbs up the stairs. A black Cadillac lurches out of the hospital parking structure and passes the news crews parked outside. Harling opens a beer and takes a swig. He hands Whip a package. A bundle of cash. A car turns into a dirt driveway. The car passes a dilapidated shed on the right and pulls up to a large older farmhouse. Whip stops the car. Whip places a bag beside the door and reaches above one of the wooden posts supporting the veranda roof. He grabs a hidden key. He enters a cozy, fully furnished living room and looks around. A retro stereo sits on a cabinet against the wall with framed photos. Whip, his eyes still covered by a bandage, looks around. Whip carries a plastic bag into the kitchen and places it on a dining table. He plugs in a charger and checks his iPhone. It shows 127 voice messages. He leans on a bureau and pulls out a prescription bottle from his pocket. He glances at the pills, then at a decanter of whiskey. Another liquor bottle is near the stereo. He licks his lips and clenches his jaw. Using a cane for support, he strides into the bathroom and dumps the pills down the toilet. He collects the bottles of liquor and the decanter and turns on the stereo. He empties the bottles in the sink. Then, he dumps the empties in the garbage. He takes a case of Corona and some other beer cans from the fridge, and also, drains them. He dumps the cans in a bin. He takes a bag of marijuana from a wooden box in a drawer and flushes it. He continues his chore with determination as he moves from cabinet to cabinet, removing and tossing bottles and cans.",

On a crowded tourist beach by a Majorcan hotel, Brian is bare-chested playing football with his kids, while Peter cavorts around with them in the impromptu game. Fat holiday-makers laze on lounges as a man smears some cream over his obese folds. Brian kisses Peter's cheek playfully and holds his arms aloft to celebrate scoring, as Barbara frolics in the surf with Peter and the kids. Wearing aviator shades, Brian nods smiling, with them beckoning him to join. His face becomes sober as he turns over the back page of the paper to see the sport headline. By the hotel, a waiter points Brian out to a man in a panama hat and blazer, who wanders down the sandy beach carrying a briefcase towards Brian, now lying on his back in the sun. The man in the blazer dabs sweat from his face as he stands over Brian. Still wearing his shades and an intrigued expression, Brian raises himself up onto his elbows, looking up at Archer. Peter marches off along the jetty away from Brian, leaving him pacing furiously, hands on hips then on his head in despair. In a home game, a Luton Town player in orange stripe weaves through the lead-footed Leeds midfield as Bremner sulks beside Clough on the bench. Behind them, Don makes his way to a seat with the directors and eyes Brian gloatingly. A Luton striker scores and the Leeds fans cheer as Brian escorts his team down the tunnel, finding Cussins waiting. The Leeds players trudge into their dressing room as Cussins leaves Brian with his hands on his hips. Brian makes to follow Bremner into the dressing room but has the door slammed in his face. The players, now showered and in their fashionable clothes, join the directors in the long, narrow lounge, with Brian traipsing in last to face Cussins. A player obliges, as Cussins eyeballs Brian then turns to the players. Brian wrinkles his nose with distaste as Bremner, sat beside Giles, winks at him. Brian nods and swallows hard, his new young signings looking troubled as their manager steps into the corridor. Jimmy finds Brian outside the door, with Manny Cussins in the boardroom. Brian smarts, straightens his jacket, and glances around the board members as Cussins glances at the other directors. Brian leads Nigel down the corridor, passing Don's photo, then finds himself in makeup for Yorkshire TV. The presenter knocks on the door, and Brian winks and smiles wistfully. Now, in the studio, the floor manager leads Brian to his seat before the cameras. Brian notices two other chairs and sits as the tall, handsome presenter leads a bullish Don through the dark studio into the lights of the set.",

Captain Smith stares across the wheelhouse. He gazes through a window at the rising water, then places one hand on the helm. Water pours in beneath the door. In the smoking room, Andrews checks his pocket watch as the glass slides off the mantel. He opens the clock on the mantel and adjusts the time. He shuts the clock, then leans against the mantel, gazing downward. An elderly couple lies in bed as water streams beneath them. The man kisses the woman. A red-haired woman leans over two young children lying in a bed. The children sleep. Elsewhere, a Degas painting of a woman wearing a long tutu floats beneath water.

People work to right the overturned lifeboat. One sailor slides down a rope. Fabrizio puts on the lifebelt as water surges around him. Water rushes over the listing ship, causing some people to fall into the water. Fabrizio opens the knife and Cal backs away from the rushing water. Fabrizio and others try to cut the ropes. Inside, people slip and fall near the Grand Staircase. Guggenheim, wearing a top hat and formal wear, sits in a chair, watching with wide eyes. Outside, people fall into the water as others run up the deck from the approaching water. In the wheelhouse, Smith stares wide-eyed as water covers the glass windows. Outside, on one of the decks, passengers wade through waist-deep water toward the lifeboat in the middle of the ship. Fabrizio slices through the rope with his pocket knife, partially freeing the boat but causing it to tip onto its side. Cal climbs onto the high side of the capsizing lifeboat. Railings pull themselves onto pieces of floating debris. Several people run toward the back end of the Titanic, which is now tilted up at a slight angle. Some passengers hang from ropes or leap into the icy sea. Jack and Rose make their way to a railing near the rear of the ship and turn back. Jack grabs Rose's hand and runs through the crowd. They make their way to the crowd. Water swamps the base of the first funnel as it sinks below the ocean's surface. Inside the ship, seawater floods the grand staircase. Passengers and crew grab onto anything they can as the water rises. Jack climbs over a railing and helps Rose climb over.",
    "958": "Footage of his first birthday shows his mother blowing out a solitary candle on his cake and then picking him up in her arms. Now Joe is about three years old, and his mother measures his height against the wall and kisses a cut on his hand better. Joe watches as the footage changes to him with his mother at Christmas; on screen, she smiles as Joe holds up a present. He watches somberly as on screen, his mother picks him up and plays with him in the garden, and she laughs into the camera. Un-shed tears form in Alice's eyes as she watches. Captured together on the home movie, Joe and his mother play together on some distant summer's day, and Joe waves at the camera. Joe looks over at Alice, who is sitting with her back to him, her shoulders heave and tears roll down her face, struggling to find the words as Joe stares at her. Alice watches the last bit of footage which is of Joe's mother pushing him on a swing. The film runs out and spins around on the reel. Joe and Alice see the rattling noises coming from the strange cube Joe took from the crash site; it vibrates across the tabletop. Alice wipes the tears from her eyes, and Joe picks up a pencil and gently prods the cube. It continues vibrating, and he and Alice exchange a look. The cube shoots off the table and smashes through the wall, leaving a hole in the wall and a poster of the space shuttle pinned to it. Joe and Alice go over to the hole and peer through it, seeing the lights of the tomb and the water tower in the distance. They exchange a look. Later, Alice carefully slips her key into her front door and opens it, steps into the hall, and puts the key in a dish on a sideboard. She sees Louis sitting in the front room, goes in to him, and finds him smoking and drinking. Wounded, she runs outside, grabs her bicycle, and rides off. Louis comes running out after her. Fighting back tears, Alice cycles grimly on, with Louis coming after her in the yellow Coupe. She glances nervously over her shoulder as the V8 barrels after her, then rounds a corner, and the coupe clips the curb as it takes the corner. Alice jams her brakes on and pulls a u-turn in the road, cycling back past Louis. Taking his eye off the road, he careens into the back of a parked car. Hearing the impact, Alice stops and looks back. As she stares at the wreck, she doesn’t notice a massive creature moving behind her.",
    "788": "The vans are up the roadside, and as Gin gets closer, he sees it's Marcus waving a torch. Gin stops in front of Marcus, who moves his Stetson and gets out of the car with a wary expression, shaking his head weirdly. Marcus gives him a helpless look, and Gin heads back to his car while Marcus smiles. Gin lifts the bonnet of his Chevy, and with the bonnet up, Gin steps back from the car. Marcus steps forward with the jump leads but can't reach the battery, so he backs away from between the car and the van as Lois starts the van up. Gin leans back against the grill of the Chevy and lights himself a smoke. Marcus nods to Lois, and she drops the van into gear, hits the gas, and crushes Gin between the two vehicles. Lois reverses, and Gin slithers down the grill of the Chevy onto the ground. Marcus walks up to him, sighs, and walks to the van. He removes the jump start cables from the van, returns to Gin, and clips them onto his ears. Back at Thurman's, Willie opens the front door to Sue, who's got a bag of groceries, and he eyes her figure appreciatively. In the kitchen, Thurman and Willie make necklaces out of pieces of popcorn, adding them to a big bowl. In the hall, Sue stands on a chair to put decorations on the tree. Willie stares, mesmerized by her backside, and begins fondling it. She pushes his hand away, so he reaches up and unzips the back of her skirt. She quickly does it back up and gives Willie a kiss. In the lounge, Grandma has conked out on the sofa. Sue carefully removes her slippers and then peels off her sheer, hold-up socks, handing one to Willie, and they pin the socks up at the fireplace. They exchange a smile and leave Grandma to slumber on. Later, Willie is at the front of the house lighting the candle bags Herb had come around organizing. Thurmond comes out of the house and walks over to Willie as one of the bags catches alight. Willie stamps out the blazing bag and looks around awkwardly. Thurmond looks down sadly, and Willie relents, bemusedly shaking his hand. Thurmond hurries off into the house, and Willie allows himself a faint smile. Once Thurmond is gone, Willie turns around and goes back to lighting the candle bags. In the mall, the security guard bids the last shoppers farewell. Lois is among the shoppers, making a show of looking at a price tag on a table laden with sweaters and, at the same time, pushing the table into a new position.

    "1107": "As the evening sky is tinged red by the setting sun, the sun slowly sinks below the horizon. In the sprawling suburbs, the streets grow dark and the lights go on in the rows of houses, with a light shining from an upstairs window. In the bedroom, a dark-haired boy wearing round glasses is looking at an unusual photo album, and as he turns a page, the people in the photographs are moving and they smile at him. He turns to a snowy owl in a padlocked cage and Harry pulls a face. In the kitchen, his Aunt Petunia is decorating a meringue gateau while Uncle Vernon is fastening his son's bow tie. Dudley scowls at Harry knocking into him as he passes, and the three of them stare ominously at Harry. Harry goes upstairs as the guests arrive, finding a small wizened creature with floppy ears and a long pointed nose jumping on his bed. The creature is wearing a filthy rag and is banging his head. In Harry's bedroom, Dobby grabs a lamp and hits himself, and Uncle Vernon hears the noise upstairs and leaves. Vernon opens the wardrobe, and Dobby has a bundle of letters. Harry chases him downstairs, and Dobby stops at the kitchen door. On the table, stands the huge meringue gateau decorated with green and mauve whipped cream and red cherries. Dobby clicks his fingers, and the gateau rises into the air, then clicks his fingers again, and the gateau floats out of the kitchen. Horrified, Harry follows it into the sitting room where the creamy dessert hovers over Mrs. Mason. Dobby clicks his fingers, and the gateau falls on her head, covering Mrs. Mason in cake and cream. Dobby clicks his fingers and disappears. Vernon fixes bars outside Harry's window. Asleep in bed, Harry suddenly wakes. Looking puzzled, he reaches out for his glasses and puts them on. Getting out of bed, he goes across to the window and stares through the bars at the dark night sky. A faint light appears far away above the rooftops, gradually getting nearer, and to Harry's surprise, the light becomes two headlights of a blue Ford Anglia with a white roof that flies down over the neighboring gardens and hovers outside Harry's window. The lights disturb the snowy owl, and Harry stares at the three redhead boys in the car. Dressing quickly, Harry packs his trunk, and Ron fixes a hook to the bars on the window, wrenching them away. The Dursleys wake as the car boot flies open and Harry pushes his luggage out into it. Vernon unlocks the padlocks on Harry's door, and Harry passes Hedwig's cage to Ron. Harry dives for the window but Vernon grabs his foot as the car zooms away, and Vernon falls headfirst out of the window.",
    "1325": "Michael slowly turns around, and Estevez rushes in to restrain Michael, grabbing his wrist with fingers tightening. In an instant, Michael moves like a blur, breaking the cop's arm and spinning him around to use as a human shield. Michael takes charge, holding a gun to Estevez's head and facing off with Burton as the street lamps begin to flicker and strobe, adding to the confusion. Burton squeezes his eyes shut in pain, his whole body quaking, and heels clicking the pavement, like some massive pressure is building inside him. His eyes snap open, focused, as the force inside him now takes control. Estevez looks at his partner with confusion, but Michael seems to know exactly who he's talking to. BLAM! Burton shoots his partner in the head, Estevez drops, leaving Michael without cover. Burton re-aims, but Michael is faster, already firing back. Bullets rip up the concrete. SMASH! The squad car window shatters, Burton's chest explodes, and he goes down, leaving Michael the only one left standing. Smoke rises from his gun. With soldier-like efficiency, Michael picks up the rifle bags and loads them into the trunk of the squad car. He gets in the car and floors it, roaring away as the flickering street lamps finally go out in rapid succession, a wave chasing him and plunging the entire city into darkness. Jeep bolts awake, breathing hard and covered with sweat. He switches on a lamp, illuminating his incredibly cramped bedroom. He's got shaggy hair and a sensitive face, seemingly not fond of sunlight. A couple of ancient Silverstream trailers are bathed in the eerie blue light of night's final moments, looking like they haven't moved from this barren ground in decades. A single strand of colored Christmas lights dots the trailers' roof lines, marking the season. One of the trailer doors creaks open, and Jeep steps wearily out into the cool western morning. He gazes up to the diner's slanted roof where a large sign glows like a beacon in the darkness. He pauses, contemplating the sign, and then turns to see Charlie, a very pregnant girl about twenty, standing in the trailer doorway and rubbing the sleep from her eyes. She approaches Jeep, sees the strain in his eyes, and he struggles for a moment before nodding. A glimmer of a smile crosses Jeep's face, but he turns away, dejected. Charlie smiles sadly at him, touched by his sweetness, but she isn't on the same page. Jeep nods, trying to hide the fact that he's hurting inside. Bob Hansen, the late 40s owner and proprietor of this roadside establishment, attempts to fix the old TV hanging in the corner above the counter by banging on it.",
    "28": "Laszlo turns off the light and sits down on the couch next to her. It grows strained and a silence falls between them; Ilsa still cannot look at him. Ilsa finally turns to look at Laszlo, and he bends down and kisses her cheek. He kisses her on the cheek and goes out the door. She stands there for a few seconds, then crosses to look out of the window. She sees Victor walking down the street and closes the blind again. The figure in the archway is gone. Ilsa gets a cloak from the bedroom and leaves the hotel room. Carl is busy figuring as Rick and Carl sit by the bar and look over ledgers. Carl looks up at Rick and laughs. Ilsa comes over to meet Rick, and he walks over to the window with Ilsa following. Rick walks over to a table and opens a cigarette box, but finds it empty. There are tears in her eyes now, and he turns away to light a cigarette, then back to Ilsa. He stops short as he sees Ilsa holding a small revolver in her hand, pointed directly at him. He moves closer to her, and her hand drops down with tears in her eyes again. She turns and walks away from him, but Rick follows her and takes her in his arms, where she is lost in his embrace. He presses her tight to him and kisses her passionately. From his window, Rick watches the revolving beacon light at the airport. Ilsa sits on the couch, and on a table before her rests a bottle of champagne along with two half-filled glasses. Rick walks over to her and sits down with Ilsa. Ilsa puts her head on Rick's shoulder and snuggles closer to him. They run inside the entryway as the headlights of a speeding police car sweep toward them, and the lights move past them. They flatten themselves against a wall to avoid detection. Laszlo and Carl make their way through the darkness toward a side entrance of Rick's. Laszlo and Carl enter and cross toward the bar, out of breath from their exertion, as Carl goes behind the bar. Rick and Ilsa hear voices below. Rick crosses to the door, opens it just enough to see below, and turns off the light. Ilsa stands just in back of him and makes a move as if to go out to the balcony, but Rick pushes her back, and she withdraws behind the door. Rick walks out to the balcony railing and sees Carl attending to Laszlo, who appears to be injured. Both Carl and Laszlo look up as Carl looks up wonderingly, then starts toward the stairway and climbs the stairs. Carl enters Rick's apartment and sees Ilsa.",
    "473": "Mozart is suddenly delighted and throws the door wide open so that the guests can see into the private apartment where the Archbishop sits, and he can see them. Colloredo is clearly discomfited by this reception of his employee, smiling and bowing uneasily as they include him in the small ovation. Mozart stands in the corridor, out of the Archbishop's line of sight, bowing and giggling, and encouraging the applause for the Archbishop with conducting gestures. Suddenly irritated, Colloredo signs to Arco, who steps forward and shuts the door, ending the applause. Salieri, in this vast room, is standing and looking at the full score of the Serenade. Instantly, we again hear its lyrical strains. Salieri reads the score of the Adagio in helpless fascination, but suddenly the music snaps off as Mozart stands before him and lays down the score. Mozart takes the score, bows, and struts briskly out of the room, while Salieri stares uncomprehendingly after the jaunty little figure. At a table sits Emperor Joseph II, eating his frugal dinner and sipping goat's milk. He is an intelligent, dapper man of forty, wearing a military uniform, surrounded by his Chamberlain Johann Von Strack, Count Orsini-Rosenberg, Baron Von Swieten, First Kapellmeister Giuseppe Bonno, and Salieri, who wears decorous black as usual. At a side-table, two Imperial secretaries use quill pens and inkstands to write down everything of importance that is said. Salieri looks defiantly at Orsini-Rosenberg. In a somber room which serves as both a bedroom and a study, opposite an image sits Salieri at his desk, on which stands a pile of music paper, quill pens, and ink. He occasionally tries notes from the march he is composing on an open forte-piano with some difficulty, scratching notes out with his quill and ruffling his hair without a powdered wig. The Salesman puts the second wig on Mozart's head, who pulls a face of doubt in the mirror and giggles. Mozart turns and comes into the salon, where another group awaits him, consisting of Von Strack, Orsini-Rosenberg, Bonno, Von Swieten, and Salieri in a room containing several gilded chairs and a forte-piano. All bow and say, \"Good morning, Your Majesty.\" The Emperor produces a paper, goes to the instrument, sits, and plays the first bars of it, but plays a wrong note. Mozart throws himself to his knees and, to Joseph's discomfort, kisses the royal hand with fervour.",
    "768": "Nema stops the truck and climbs out. He looks back down the road to where Jackson stands with arms raised. They run to the truck. On the ground, Captain Michaels leads Anheuser's team across a walkway, where there are many other walkers with people crossing to the waiting arks. Nora sees them and addresses Anheuser. They spot the Saudi prince and his family. Anheuser walks off with Michaels, and Nora pats Adrian's shoulder and follows them. Crowds trudge along the Nampan Plateau, among them are Satnam and his family. They stop and look around to see a gigantic tsunami heading for the coastline. The huge waves tower over Satnam and head straight for the refugees. Adrian is shown into a cabin on the escape ship, glances around, picks up a goblet, and takes his ringing mobile from his bag. Leaving his phone switched on, Satnam crouches down and holds his son's face in his hands. They're deep in prayer as the tidal wave comes closer. Satnam and his wife hug their son between them as Adrian listens. Adrian throws away the goblet. On the Arc bridge, Adrian rushes across the bridge to Scottie. The images have been called up, and Adrian turns to Anheuser. They look at another screen, and Scottie hits a button. The old watch at the screen now reads 2 hours, 6 minutes, and 17 seconds. Anheuser turns away after moving his spectacles closer to a group of people sitting at another bank of monitors. A revised countdown appears on their screens. Nema drives the truck with his grandparents in the cab with him. In the back, Jackson is with his family, Gordon and Tamara. Little Noah lies asleep, his head resting on Gordon's shoulder. Gordon glances up and sees Jackson watching them, stares ahead, and speaks without looking at Jackson. He turns his head, and they pass a sign for utility gate 17 east. Nema stops the truck, and Tenzen opens the gate. Nema looks over his shoulder and nudges the kids forward. Kate spots Nema's grandma, and Tenzen glances up at Lily and Noah, then beckons them forward. Yuri and the others are in the ship bay. Yuri thumps the security guard as he looks behind, and the crowd pushes past and enters the bay. Yuri overlooks the arc as Tenzen leads Kate, Jackson, and the others towards the mountainside, which opens to reveal the ship bays. She calls on a passing science officer. Tenzen leads everyone up a launch tower staircase. On the bridge, Jackson and Noah head up the launch pad. Noah stares up at the anchors dangling from a gigantic ship's hull as the wind ruffles his hair. Jackson grabs Noah, and they hurry up towards the ark. The Russian President is led onto an ark bridge by his interpreter.",
    "745": "Elizabeth waves to Mae Mobley and drives off, and the little girl strokes Aibileen's cheek, prompting Aibileen to smile softly and kiss her on the cheek. They hug each other fondly. At a bus stop, several maids from the locality are climbing aboard, while Minnie, in a green straw hat and spotty dress, carrying a pie and a fan, peers out from the door of an empty bus. Seeing the coast is clear, she gets out, and Yule Mae, standing next to Aibileen, spots her. Minnie looks nonchalant as Skeeter strides up, and Aibileen glances behind her at the bus door closing, watching it drive off with a doom-laden look on her face. A white mother pushing a pram slows down as she passes. Aibileen takes the slip of paper and then trudges off. Skeeter studies a State of Mississippi pamphlet on the conduct of non-white and other minorities while Aibileen's voice reads the words. Aibileen answers as Minnie, with her pie, rings Hilly's doorbell, and Hilly eyes the pie, loftily indicating she should wait. Minnie's face stiffens, and she sinks to the floor. Aibileen rings off, her eyes lighting on the paper with Skeeter's number propped up on the phone. In a church, young Preacher Green invites the choir to stand, and Aibileen thinks on his words. Later at home, Aibileen hurries to the door and ushers Skeeter in, inviting her to follow to the sitting room of her spotless little house. Skeeter sits down on the sofa and unties the headscarf she's wearing while Aibileen stays standing, dressed in a yellow dress with elbow-length sleeves and a scalloped detail down the front, pursing her lips with a faint sigh. Visibly nervous, she pours tea from a white china pot into a china cup, spilling a drop on the saucer. A silver spoon on a white napkin is set next to the cup, and there's also a plate of jam tarts. As Skeeter takes hold of the cup, Aibileen hastily wipes up the spill in the saucer and, smoothing the back of her dress, sits on the arm of an easy chair facing Skeeter. At the kitchen table, Skeeter reads from a list of questions as Aibileen looks mournfully at the photograph of the graduate student, and Skeeter follows her gaze. Aibileen turns away to face the window, blanked out by the strong sun outside, puts down the cutlery she's holding, and nods mutely, seeming to conduct an internal dialogue with herself. Skeeter carefully considers the proposal as Aibileen produces a notebook and her reading glasses, standing in front of Skeeter with the notebook open in her hands. Cracking a brief smile, she sits back down, and they stifle their giggles. Sometime later, Skeeter puts her notes in her briefcase.",
    "1328": "Impossibly, Gladys is still standing. She lets out an inhuman scream and scrambles across the diner, knocking tables and chairs over in her wake. Bob pulls a shotgun from behind the counter, and Gladys smiles sweetly before slapping him clear across the room. The shotgun clatters to the floor at Jeep's feet, and he snatches it up and aims at Gladys, who turns calmly to face him. Jeep is about to fire when the old lady's eyes go all white, and he freezes, stunned by her words, overwhelmed with fear that paralyzes him. Gladys rockets straight at him, but Jeep is too afraid to move and clamps his eyes shut, bracing for the end. A rain of bullets rip into Gladys, taking her down like an animal. Jeep slowly opens his eyes, his gun still cocked, and sees Gladys lying dead in a smoldering, bloody heap at his feet. He turns to see Kyle with smoke rising from the barrel of his silver-plated Western Arms 45. Sandra is on the floor with her husband, blood pouring freely from his neck. Kyle stares at the dying man, hesitates for a moment, and then rushes to help. Obeying, she cups her hands over the hole in his neck, desperately trying to stop the flow of blood leaking out between her fingers. Percy scrambles over with a first-aid kit, and together he and Kyle get to work on Howard's neck. A few feet away, Charlie helps Bob, bruised and bleeding, to his feet. Kyle shoots him a look, and they realize it's pedal-to-the-floor time for the eighty miles ahead. Audrey leans forward from the back seat. Up ahead, the dark clouds Jeep saw earlier have closed in, descending onto the highway like a wall. They are black and undulating, and suddenly hundreds of tiny bugs begin to hit the windshield. That's when they realize those aren't clouds. The Escalade enters the swarm, and the car is pummeled by insects, the windshield instantly covered in black and red bug guts. Bob is hunched over the steaming sink, pounding a can of light beer. Jeep is leaning against the wall, looking as if he's about to puke or faint, and Bob, noticing Jeep trembling, rests a hand on his shoulder but cannot get the words out. Before Jeep can respond, they hear the sound of the front door. Bob and Jeep appear from the back as Kyle, Percy, Audrey, and Sandra carry Howard into the diner, all of them stumbling and gasping for air, while Charlie moves in to help and Percy races for the back. Bob, Kyle, and Jeep quickly drag Gladys's body, wrapped in the plastic tablecloth, a short way from the diner, warily eyeing the curtain of flies no more than a hundred yards out.",
    "110": "A large black recruit with a strange look on his face, much like Forrest's, looks up from his seat, and Bubba moves his case over, making room for Forrest to sit down. Bubba hands Forrest a handkerchief, and they shake hands. Bubba's mother, a robust woman in a cook's uniform, carries a bowl of shrimp into a dining room and sets it down on a table in front of a wealthy white man. Bubba's grandmother also carries a bowl of shrimp into a dining room and sets it down on a table in front of a wealthy white man. The Drill Sergeant moves down the line to the next man while the recruits sit at the base of their bunks assembling their rifles. Bubba speaks to Forrest as Forrest finishes assembling his rifle while the other recruits are still working on theirs. The Drill Sergeant rushes up to Forrest, looks at his stopwatch, and then walks away as Forrest begins to disassemble his rifle. Bubba continues talking about shrimp in his slow southern drawl as Bubba and Forrest shine their boots. They are on their hands and knees scrubbing the floor with toothbrushes. Later, Bubba lies in his bunk and looks up quietly, and Forrest also lies in his bunk and looks up. A young private tosses a Playboy magazine onto Forrest, who picks it up and turns the page, revealing Jenny as she poses with a school sweater on, and that's all. Forrest looks up with shock, cranes his head up for a closer look, then in his army uniform, steps into the foyer of the club. The EMCEE steps out onto the stage, and the men laugh. Jenny kicks a man's hand, and he yells angrily as he sits back down, then tosses his drink on her. Forrest walks up to the man and grabs him, tossing him to the ground. Another man tries to grab Forrest, but Forrest shoves him down too. Forrest climbs up onto the stage, picks Jenny up, guitar and all, and carries her, but Jenny struggles and frees herself. Forrest steps back in surprise, and Jenny shoves the guitar at him. Jenny walks off as Forrest holds the guitar and follows after her. Forrest follows Jenny over a bridge outside the nightclub, and Jenny turns and looks over the bridge, then at the light of an approaching vehicle. She steps into the street, runs, and flags down the approaching vehicle. A pickup truck pulls over as Jenny looks at the driver, walks toward Forrest, looks at the driver again, and then walks up to Forrest. Jenny takes a last look at Forrest and then climbs into the truck.",
    "751": "People are reflected in the mirror of a shop changing room, peering in nervously as Dr. Mathison sits beside a black woman who's lying down, gazing into a blanket wrapped bundle. The women smiles at the wriggling bundle as the doctor gently lifts it and looks inside. Still reflected in the mirror, the doctor looks up at the saleswoman and then back at the baby, frowning. A man is leaning against a train window, staring out as the train pulls away from a station. He straightens up, leans back in his seat, wearing a dark gray suit, with the top button of his pale green shirt undone and his tie loosely knotted. The little hair he has is close shaved, leaving just a dark shadow. Glancing between the seats in front of him, he sees a little girl lying almost upside down, staring back at him. He grins at her, but the grin fades, and he leans towards the window again, rubbing the inside corner of one eye wearily. A slim woman in her late 20s, wearing a blue top, stretches up to place her coat on the overhead rack, and as she does, the top parts company with her black trousers, and the man gazes at her exposed white midriff and the section of ivy tattoo climbing through the gap between top and trousers. He flirtively slips off his wedding ring and drops it into his jacket pocket. The young woman sits down, glances at some leaflets, drops them in the seat pocket, straightens her shoulder-length brown hair, tucks down her top, sits back, and closes her eyes. The man looks down at the seat pocket in front of him, stretches forward, and picks up a magazine, then picks up a second magazine, looks at it himself before passing it to her. The man looks down, swallows, and looks at her again, watching another train pass and looking down before turning to her again. They shake hands, but she looks down at the magazine again, then up at him with her smile gone. She folds and unfolds her arms, tucks her fist under her chin, and shows him her wedding ring. She stands, picks up the leaflets, and moves down the aisle of the train, and his head drops. He pulls his wedding ring from his pocket, hesitates for a moment before slipping it back on, and settles back in his seat. Glancing between the seat backs, David sees a little girl in front sitting up now, her blonde hair pulled off her face and held by yellow clips, watching him and smiling. He moves out of her sight towards the window and leans against it frowning slightly, his eyes closing, while outside, trees and shrubs form a green backdrop along the track side.",
    "75": "We stay on the house at leisure, hearing him lunging, shoulder to door, and the squeaking of hinges and splintering of wood, creating an ultra romantic image of shelter and peace. Frogs or river noises are heard off-screen, followed by the rattle of running footsteps as the children, their backs to us, sprint towards the boat through a light mist as in the previous shot. We shoot over Bess's turned photograph of Birdie, close, passed out in his rocker while the children run through the open door in the background and John runs up to Birdie. John grabs Birdie's shoulder; Birdie half-rises and falls face down on the floor, then rears on one elbow and looks up at John before falling face down again. John grabs Birdie by one ear, turning his face up, and Birdie looks earnestly at John. John masterfully takes Pearl by the hand and leads her into the night. We shoot from the river as they struggle through the sumac and pokeberry weeds at the edge of the river towards the skiff, whose prow, tethered to a willow, is seen throughout this unmoving shot at our extreme right. When they come opposite the skiff, which is a few yards out from shore, Pearl, frankly bored, dangles her doll and yawns as John, finishing undoing the rope from a willow root, looks up and around, checking on pursuit. On the bank above, in the mist, a man, the Preacher, goes along a river lane on horseback, walking the horse away from us. We descend to a poor riverside farmhouse where John and Pearl tether a boat in front of it, eat hot boiled potatoes, glance at each other, and turn away towards the lane in the background. John and Pearl proceed towards the house, and we shoot from within the open door of the kitchen as they advance to the edge of the porch where a tired farm woman stands by the door within. We shoot over her, and she leaves the shot briefly (we hold on the children), re-enters, and goes to them with a bowl of steaming potatoes. They take hands-full and make to eat, turn away, and walk towards the boat as she looks after them. Preacher stands behind the flames, in the foreground an old man sits profiled on a box, other workers, all men, sit around the fire, resulting in a short silence as they look at Preacher without liking. The old man spits into the fire, creating a spurt of steam as the spit strikes. He comes down to the water with a full landscape in the background, and we shoot over two sitting rabbits as they watch, their ears up. The skiff passes with Pearl playing with a doll and John unsnarling a line. The skiff passes again, and we pan in a big barn near the river, then to a lighted house; willows line the shore.",
    "1123": "Even Ginny Weasley refuses to catch his eye. Harry puts down his quill and closes his book. He gets up from the table and puts his books under his arm, sensing that all the students are staring at him as he quickly walks out of the room. In the corridor, Harry hears the disembodied voice again and follows the sound. Harry looks around nervously and, taking a deep breath, walks slowly around a corner, stopping at the horrible sight ahead of him. Lit by flaming torchlight, he sees the ghost of Nearly Headless Nick hanging stiffly in mid-air, and a boy, Justin, lying petrified on the ground, his eyes wide open, his arms stuck out in front of him. Harry kneels beside Justin and touches his stiff fingers. Filch the caretaker appears stealthily behind him. Still kneeling beside the petrified Justin, Harry notices a line of spiders quickly scuttling across the floor. They follow each other up the wall, over the stone windowsill, and out of the open window. As Harry watches them go, Filch returns with Professor McGonagall, who hurries along the corridor towards Harry and regards the scene with horror. She walks briskly away, and Harry follows her towards an archway with a fiery torch burning on each side. Filling the archway is a huge stone statue of a griffin, with the head and outstretched wings of an eagle and the body of a lion. Harry steps towards it. Professor McGonagall spreads her long fingers and points them at the statue, which slowly turns, and Harry steps onto the circular staircase behind it. As the griffin continues to revolve, Harry is gradually carried upwards. At the top, he steps off and walks down a passage towards a large wooden door leading to a cluttered, circular room lined with glass cabinets, the walls hung with moving portraits of elderly wizards. The heavy wooden door swings open, and Harry peers cautiously inside. Harry walks up some steps into a smaller room lined with shelves of old books. On one of the shelves high above his head, he catches sight of a patched and shabby pointed hat. As he stares at the crumpled hat, it starts to speak. The hat scowls, and Harry turns as he hears a faint sound. Behind him, a decrepit bird with tatty orange feathers is balancing on a perch. Harry moves towards the bird and smiles at the odd-looking creature. To his dismay, it suddenly bursts into flames. Harry takes a step back as the bird becomes a pile of ash below its perch. Dumbledore appears at the top of a flight of stairs just as a tiny head pokes out from the pile of black ash, and the baby bird opens its beak.",
    "414": "Ben watches it. Ben's face is shown as he watches. He continues watching, and the scene pulls back to reveal that they are in the Taft Hotel Room. Ben is sitting on the bed, leaning against the headboard, watching the television set on a stand facing the bed. The camera pulls back to a wide shot of the room, lit only by the light from the television set. Mrs. Robinson walks into the shot, half dressed, passing between Ben and the television set and then going out of frame. Ben continues to stare at the set as Mrs. Robinson appears again, passing the other way, and then passes back again. Now fully dressed and carrying her purse, Mrs. Robinson passes through once more and, without looking at Ben, goes to the hotel room door, opens it, and exits; the sound of the door closing is heard. Follow Ben as he gets up and moves to the windows of what is now his bedroom in the Braddock house. He opens the closed blinds over the window, revealing a bright sun outside. His bathing suit is on the window sill, and he takes it and puts it on. Ben moves to the bedroom door, opens it, and goes out. Mrs. Braddock is seen in the kitchen as Ben comes through the back door, moves to the pool, and dives in. The raft floats in the center of the pool as Ben swims toward us the length of the pool, then surfaces and, in one movement, pulls himself up on the raft, landing on top of Mrs. Robinson on the bed. He stays on top of her for a moment, then turns toward us and looks, where Mr. Braddock is standing by the side of the pool with the sun behind him. Mrs. Braddock steps in beside Mr. Braddock, followed by Mr. Robinson, and they blot out the sun as Mrs. Robinson steps in beside them. There is a long pause. The door opens and Mrs. Robinson enters, stopping to look at Ben, raising her eyebrows. Ben thinks for a moment and looks at her, as she pulls the covers down. He starts putting on his shirt while she sits on the edge of the bed, watching him and shaking her head. There is another long pause. Without looking at each other, they begin to take off their clothes at opposite sides of the room. Ben sits at the table, eating his breakfast and looking at the back of a cereal box, with Mr. and Mrs. Braddock also present. Benjamin looks at his father for a moment, then continues eating and reading. He slides off the raft and goes underwater, his hair streaming up and his eyes open. Mr. Robinson turns toward the sunroom.",
    "987": "Frowning, Benjamin plants his hands on the armrests of his chair and labors determinedly to stand up. He adjusts his leg with his hands. Benjamin stands, then collapses. The preacher points both hands at Benjamin. Benjamin struggles to his feet and stands shakily before the congregation. His posture's crooked. He takes a step. The congregation clap and cheer him on. The preacher freezes with his arms held aloft. Two concerned men rise sharply, and the preacher keels over. A white-robed pianist starts to play. The flag outside flies at half-mast. Music plays from a gramophone beside a grave. Benjamin, Queenie, and Tizzy are amongst the mourners. As the song ends, a man claps two cymbals together. An old guy. Benjamin eavesdrops on a conversation. Benjamin hobbles on crutches to the back door to watch Mr. Oti holding court in the garden. He turns to see Benjamin, who ducks out of sight. Indoors, diminutive, sharp-suited Mr. Oti takes a seat beside Benjamin. Benjamin turns gingerly to meet his gaze. The black African, Mr. Oti, smiles. Outside, on the sunny street, Mr. Oti tips his hat to one of three children playing baseball. Wearing a large, ill-fitting fedora, Benjamin struggles to keep up with him on crutches. Mr. Oti waves to a tram. On board, Bushman shares a cage with apes. He bares his teeth at three children in the whites-only section of the tram. They cower. They sit on a bench by tall stone columns. Benjamin presses his lips together and looks away, thoughtfully. Benjamin smiles at Mr. Oti, then looks away again. Benjamin sips root beer. They approach a woman in town. Oti hugs her. Dwarfed by Philomena, Mr. Oti walks away. Alone, Benjamin fails to reach a tram in time. He waves a crutch in the air as the tram glides off. Benjamin cuts a forlorn figure as he plods away. Night, Benjamin determinedly makes his way down a sidewalk. As he arrives at the familiar clapboard retirement home, Queenie lifts a sash window and stares down at him. At a basin. She goes and he stares at his wet, blistered hands. On the lawn, Benjamin turns to see a man watching him from the street. The man, his father, Thomas, gets into the back of a car. An elegant, gray-haired woman. The girl pirouettes. Benjamin sits with Oti, Philomena, Miss Fuller, and Daisy. Queenie takes Tizzy's hand. Miss Fuller reads to Daisy from an illustrated storybook. Benjamin sits with them. Night, age six, with long red hair, Daisy approaches Benjamin's bed. He sits up. She beckons him. Benjamin hobbles down a flight of stairs in the dark. Table linen has been thrown over some tables and chairs to form a tent.",
    "840": "He looks at his phone as his co-worker enters, and later, he approaches his co-worker in the garage. More co-workers step out and include Sandy in a circle, and wide-eyed, Sandy glances at his co-workers. Staring down, a smile creeps across Sandy's face as he considers, then he raises his gaze and nods. Now, Sandy's daughter kicks a soccer ball off a field, and her mother cheers from the sidelines. Sandy approaches his wife, who jumps back with surprise, and he speaks to her with his hands gently holding her face. Holding her hand over her mouth, she jumps with joy and gives Sandy a hug, then he smiles and lifts her off her feet. Now, the plump identity thief sips from a straw as she rides down an escalator; at a store, she tries on a ring, now in cosmetics, and two women laugh as they watch the cosmetics girl apply makeup to the redhead. At a cell phone kiosk, the man smiles. At the center of the mall, a mother and daughter sit on a jet ski, and the redhead buys it. At a Brookstone, she sleeps on a massage chair with her open mouth drooling, and an employee approaches, pokes her, then she sorts through a stack of Sandy's cards. Now, Sandy and his daughters brush their teeth, and in his car, Sandy smiles and bobs his head as he taps his thumbs on the steering wheel. He glances down at the dashboard, where the low-gas light blinks on, and his smile fades as he pulls into a gas station. At the pump, Sandy puts in his credit card, holds the card to his mouth, breathes on the strip, then wipes the card on his jacket and pushes the card in again. Inside, the attendant stands behind a clear protective glass, talking on an earpiece; the attendant swipes the card and talks into his earpiece, then points to his earpiece and slides Sandy the cut card. Now, in Sandy's car, a police car pulls up behind him, and officers emerge from the cruiser; Sandy peeks out the window as one of the officers approaches while the other officer stands back with his hand by his sidearm. The detective touches his phone, and now the detective returns with a file and hands Sandy the thief's haggard mug shot, leaving Sandy shaking his head. Now, the family man parks a Subaru, enters a modern office and passes a company logo, goes to a glass door, and pushes it open. He admires his new office as his former coworker, now new boss, approaches, and four cops stand at reception. Later, as men put lids on boxes, the lead detective approaches Sandy and his boss; Sandy faces his boss, who turns to the detective.",
    "935": "Holmes sees a stack of long-barreled pistols and is handed a magazine to load, but identical thugs come up behind him, one grabbing the gun and the other holding a piece of cloth over Holmes' mouth and nose, causing his eyes to close as he sinks to the floor. Watson returns to the spot where he left Holmes and finds a note pinned to a crate, reading it and turning it over to see Rene's sketch of a tall tower. He glances up at a lit tower nearby and moves off. Meanwhile, a small glass with liquid is held under Holmes' nose, and he stirs. Watson goes nearer to the tower as Moriarty turns to Holmes. A guard had apprehended Watson, but Moran shot the guard to get an aim on Watson. A meat hook is slammed into Holmes' shoulder, and he's hauled up on a rope. Moriarty lowers a stylus on a gramophone record, holding a telephone in front of the horn speaker, broadcasting the music over a speaker into the yard where Watson cowers in the darkness while Moran keeps a rifle trained from a walkway high up on the tower. Moriarty accompanies the singer, and Holmes, clutching the rope attached to the hook in his shoulder, is swinging about a meter off the floor. Moriarty pushes him, and Moran shoots at Watson, but the bullet ricochets off a metal pole. Moriarty spins Holmes around, and Watson breaks cover as Moran shoots, causing Watson to duck behind a platform. Holmes' screams are audible over the tenor as Watson climbs a ladder on the platform. Holmes spins in the air while Moran takes aim, his shot passing through a narrow gap between pieces of machinery, just missing Watson. Moriarty indicates to a henchman to lower Holmes to the ground as Watson holds his hat up to the gap in the machinery, and Moran puts a bullet straight through it. Watson looks around and sees a pair of ear defenders hanging on the wall. Moriarty rolls his eyes wearily and bends over Holmes, gripping the meat hook embedded in his shoulder with one hand and Holmes' uninjured arm with the other. Moran watches the piece of machinery, and a cover falls off it, revealing an artillery cannon. Moran retreats, desperately climbing down the tower to escape from the cannon Watson is operating. Watson fires the cannon at the tower, which collapses, smashing through the roof of the building where Holmes and Moriarty are. As the dust settles, Watson sits up on the platform wearing the ear defenders, climbs down from the platform, and runs over to the now ruined building, searching through the debris and finding Holmes half-buried under the rubble.",
    "74": "The narrative starts by approaching a riverside village and centering on an open touring car as it drives along a river road. We stoop low towards the car's driver, who is dressed in dark clothes, a paper collar, and a string tie. As he drives, he talks to himself, nods, smiles, and touches his hat, thinking of a widow with a hidden stash of bills in a sugar-bowl. He shifts into second gear, climbing a steep little hill, with the stones of a country graveyard gleaming in the last daylight. He starts fast and noisily down a steep hill while she works hard in the presence of off-screen music. In contrast to the sad burlesque audience, he stands out with a sour and aggressive expression. The camera moves in for a head close-up, focusing on his hand labeled H-A-T-E in tattoo across four knuckles. He slides his hand into his pocket before the labeling is seen. His head slants into a cold smile and one eyelid flutters. A hand descends onto his shoulder, and he glances up behind him as he bends down to speak quietly into the preacher’s ear. The scene shifts to a grim stone-turreted façade with an American flag idling at the top center. Two children, John, who is nine, and Pearl, who is five, sit in the grass in a sentimental picture. They work together on Pearl's doll with John struggling to get on a difficult shoe but eventually proudly exhibits the shod foot. They look off-screen and get up with Pearl dangling the doll. A Model-T Ford approaches rapidly on an uneven dirt road and careens towards them, swinging into the side yard as the camera pans and stops. Ben Harper half-falls out of the far door with a blood-stained shoulder and wild eyes, looking dazedly across the car at them. A hefty, simple man of thirty, he emerges clear of the car with a revolver in one hand and a bloody roll of banknotes in the other. As he moves forward, two police cars appear in the distance, coming fast with sirens. Ben and his children become smaller in the distance as police cars approach in the background. Pearl hugs her doll while in the background, troopers exit their cars, fanning out cautiously to surround Ben with guns in hand. Ben backs away from his children, raising his hands with a gun in one hand. The camera pulls back to enlarge the group shot, showing the role of the troopers. Two troopers approach Ben from behind. He runs forward, clasps his stomach with his mouth open, and one trooper smacks the back of Ben's head with a pistol barrel.",
    "1318": "It is early morning and the parking lot is empty except for Marcus' van. The Mercedes eventually pulls in, parking beside him. Marcus throws open the back of the van, revealing the components of the water drill in various prop gift boxes. Willie wears a forbearing smile. He shakes his head and chuckles as Marcus tosses him an empty red Santa sack. Marcus stares. Jesse, the security guard, unlocks the door and opens up for Willie and Marcus. They enter in costume. Willie lugs the filled sack and seems to be straining. As Willie and Marcus enter the store, Gin Slagel drives by their cars, carefully noting their tags. Willie drops the bag with a loud thud. Willie follows Marcus behind the Wonderland backdrop. Marcus points to an air duct in the ceiling. He gets up and walks away. Gin sits at his desk sucking in a Pall Mall filterless. Bob Chipeska sits opposite. A bus clears frame, revealing the kid as he walks toward the mall. Cheering, the six bullies engulf the kid. Willie follows. Willie enters. He goes up and tries to yank the hand, which the hysterical Kid yanks away. As Willie drags him to the sink and runs water over the cut, the Kid takes great gulping breaths and finally manages to say. Willie grabs a vodka bottle standing open on the counter and liberally pours some on the hand. The Kid shrieks. Marcus and Willie go about the business of being a Santa-Elf team. Willie sees off another child. Willie stares at him. Marcus returns to the velvet rope to find Gin Slagel waiting stone-faced. Marcus sighs. Gin leaves. Willie's eyes do not leave the spot in space. The Kid turns to go. Willie beckons him. He displays an envelope. The Kid's eye is indeed black and blue. He reaches self-consciously up to it. Willie, dreamy, refuses to take the bait. Marcus stares at him. Lois, her face set in pruney disapproval, flips slowly through a rack of furs. She somehow senses his presence; without bothering to look around she murmurs. Lois is in the driver's seat. Gin's Ford 4 X 4 speeds around the corner and Marcus flags him down. SCREEEEECH! Gin slams on the brakes, then backs up and pulls over. He emerges from the 4 X 4 with road rage on full brew, and strides over to the van. He shakes his head in disgust. Grumbling, he goes back to the 4 X 4 and drives it into position. He gets out and raises the hood. The two vehicles face each other nose-to-nose, several feet apart as Gin opens the hood. Marcus seems to have a little difficulty reaching the battery terminals.",
    "162": "He holds up his hand for attention and forces a smile, then starts reading. It is flat and dull, like someone reading a speech to themselves, and those in the crowd who had hesitated before wandering off shrug and continue on their way. Gandhi is unnerved by it a little but he struggles on -- louder, but just as colorlessly. This last has come more firmly, and he lifts his head to the crowd, as though expecting a reaction. Three or four committed supporters applaud as on cue, but his technique is so inexpert that it draws nothing but blank faces from the bulk of them. He glances nervously at Ba, who is embarrassed for them both now. He holds it up. A constable glances at the police sergeant. And he turns and drops his pass in the wire basket over the fire. The flames engulf it. The police sergeant's eyes go wide with disbelief. The crowd murmurs in shock. At last Gandhi has got a reaction, but the dropping of the card has been as matter-of-fact as his speaking, with none of the drama one might expect from so startling a gesture. He takes Gandhi's notes from him, and faces the crowd. It is the end of the speech. He looks at the crowd. Gandhi harrumphs -- gesturing to a shallow box Singh holds. Kahn turns back, extemporizing rather lamely. He is facing the crowd. Behind him, Khan holds himself erect and slowly takes his own card from his pocket. He holds it aloft and then lowers it resolutely into the wire basket. The crowd reacts and the sergeant turns just in time to see it dropped in the flame. He gestures to a constable, who turns from the crowd and marches to Khan, seizing him by the arm and marching him to the paddy wagon. As he passes the sergeant, the sergeant takes his billy club, and faces the crowd, rapping the club menacingly against his hand. Behind him, Gandhi wavers indecisively a moment, then takes the box from Singh and moves to the fire. Gandhi is at the fire. For a second, his eyes lock with the sergeant's -- and then nervously, he takes a card and drops it in the wire basket, and another. Again, a murmur from the crowd turns him. Gandhi, on his hands and knees, blood trickling from his abraded cheek, has picked up a card from the ground and he leans forward apprehensively, his eyes fearfully on the sergeant, but he drops it defiantly in the basket. The sergeant's fury bursts -- and he slams the billy club down on Gandhi's head. Gandhi sags to the ground. Ba screams. She starts to run to him, but the other women seize her.",
    "881": "She leads Kate by the hand to a picnic laid out on the lounge floor. Sitting on cushions in front of a roaring fire, under a sheet stretched out like a safari tent, the trio share the pizza. Zoe pretends to be an elephant, and the three then play pick-up sticks with bread sticks. By the light of several candles, Zoe acts out a charade as wax drips down tall candlesticks beside a half-empty cafetiere of coffee. Zoe fast asleep on a cushion, Nick crawls round to her and lifts her from the floor. His shadow casts on the side of the sheet tent as he carries her out, while Kate takes out a small tray with two espresso cups on it. She pauses to look down the hallway and watch Nick gently carry Zoe to her bedroom before turning back and staring ahead thoughtfully. Later, the pair are tidying up when Nick opens the fridge and takes out the Tupperware box Kate found in his bag. They sit on the lounge floor with a tiramisu between them; Kate's face brightens as she tastes a spoonful. The candles and firelight illuminate the room as Nick moves across to sit beside Kate, reaching out to wipe a spot of cream from the right side of her mouth, and licks the cream from his finger, gazing intently at her. Kate's face is turned towards Nick, but she looks away briefly and nods. He reaches behind Kate and moves nearer, lips almost touching, she leans back against his arm. Kate shifts awkwardly as Nick puts on his scarf and stands, picks up his jacket from the back of the sofa, and puts it on as he enters the darkened kitchen to retrieve his pants. Kate smiles serenely to herself. At the therapist, he spins around in his leather chair, and Kate furrows her brow. Kate joins the headmistress in her spacious office, then leaves. In the park, Zoe is walking on the benches, then runs off, leading Kate to chase after her. Zoe narrowly avoids being hit by a Yellow Cab as she runs across a busy road, and Kate dodges the traffic to follow her, but ultimately steps back and watches helplessly as Zoe runs off. Later, Zoe is on her bed looking at the photo album, and as she flicks through it, she finds a peacock feather like the one she was playing with shortly before the car crash and sighs, her eyes welling with tears. Kate goes down to Sean's apartment where, in the dark and deserted kitchen, she and Nick share a plate of food and drink red wine across the serving counter, talking happily together. Finally, in the pouring rain, Nick dashes out of his truck outside Kate's apartment building.",
    "1278": "Stars drift slowly in the blackness of space and a moon glows silver in the darkness, seen from the mountainous surface of the Earth. Letters form around the moon, and a circle of reflected sunlight and the Earth form the two Os. In 1928, a blizzard lashes the Karakoram mountains in India. In a tent, a candle glows in a lantern, and a cup of snow is placed on a gas burner. Climbing spikes are sharpened, and wind tears at the canvas walls of the tent. A light shines outside, then goes dark, and a bearded climber looks puzzled. He emerges from the tent in thick furs with a climbing ax and a rope wrapped around him, and he pulls on goggles to protect his eyes. Beams of light radiate skywards from behind a rocky ridge as the climber carefully ascends a snowy slope and inches up a near vertical cliff. He plunges his ice ax into the rock and hauls himself up over the edge of the rock face, standing slowly upright and moving forward as the wind howls around him. He moves on, steadying himself with the ice ax, raising his goggles to stare at a glowing ball embedded in the snowy rock. Lights pulse inside the orb as he approaches it, closing on the object, which is about 10 feet high, with a crystalline surface and shadows and lights swirling inside. He reaches out a laser mutant hand on the orb and slowly runs his hand over the surface, eyes narrowed above his snow-crusted dark beard, then raises the eye axe. Light shines out as he breaks the crystalline crust, squinting at the intensity of the swirling brilliance within. He is enveloped in a brilliant light of overwhelming intensity, and the eye sac lies on the snow as the climber lies next to it, his eyes closed. He awakens and rises slowly, seats up, and looks around. There is a spherical hole in the snowy rock face, but the orb is gone. The climber looks at his right hand, finding the mitten has a hole in it. He removes it, revealing a round coin-sized scar on the back of his hand, frowns, and checks his palm, too. He seats on the snow-covered rocky ground and looks skywards through the swirling snow. An object seen through an electron microscope appears on a screen. The tutor is slim, with dark hair tied in a ponytail, and she smiles hesitantly. Cars stream across an arched iron bridge over a river as the tutor drives a small silver hatchback. A computer game character has a sword across his back, and Jacob has got long dark curly hair. The tutor, his guardian, is white, and Jacob is black. She crosses to the bed where he's concentrating on the game and sits beside him.",
    "1221": "The volunteer looks down on Rambo's boat where Lewis stands in the stern with his back to Rambo. Lewis points to himself and looks at Rambo, who ignores him. Rambo fixes him a glare but remains expressionless, then turns away and spits into the river before staring ahead again as Lewis walks away in disgust. Handsome and rugged School Boy glances up the boat at Rambo. The military camp at night has a truck sitting at the end of two rows of huts. In the pigsty cell, Sarah looks up through the floorboards into the hut where the commander appears, with a short, neat mustache, takes a pull on one of his ever-present cigarettes, blows smoke, smirks, and walks away as Sarah rests her head against the wall of her prison. On the river, the boat rounds a promontory with its headlamps off. Lewis leans pensively on the boat's prow, turns to look at the stern, and Rambo stares back at him before Lewis turns away. The boat pulls alongside the harbor where Michael's party were dropped, and the mercenaries disembark laden with various weapons and bandoleers, including automatic rifles with telescopic sights. Two rebels approach along the path leading to the gangplank as Rambo walks up the gangplank. The party of mercenaries, BN the rebel, and the boy tracker set off into the forest while Rambo solemnly watches them go, turns away, and walks back to the boat. BN and the boy lead the mercenaries through forest undergrowth as School Boy's rifle is particularly bulky, and they cross a small stream. En-Joo wears a khaki hat, and Diaz has a shirt covering his hair. Resting against a tree and partially covered in vines is a dull gray object, bullet-shaped but with fins at one end, which Lewis regards warily, while the rest of the mercenaries pay the bomb little attention and move on. They pass a cave mouth on a craggy mountainside where inside there's a small collection of nervous-looking locals, comprising women, children, and old men, and the mercenaries move on as En-Joo, Reese, and Diaz each give the locals a backward glance. At the village paddy field, the water is clear but there is pale brown mud beneath it, with sticks of plant poking into the air and trees reflected in the water's surface. A decomposing human corpse lies partially submerged in the water with a dead buffalo beyond it, as BN and the mercenaries overlook the field. More corpses lie at the edge of the field, and Reese holds his shirt against his nose as a woman's severed head hangs from a post. Lewis turns to look, and there are two bodies hanging from bare rafters in the remains of a hut. The boy nods and leaves, and the mercenaries make a wary record of the ruined village.",
    "713": "Jack points toward the settee, and Rose steps to the settee, then stretches out on it. Rose drapes one arm along the back of the settee, lays her hand on the pillow behind her head, and places her right hand near her temple. Smiling, Rose lowers her head and licks her lips. Jack peers over the top of his sketchpad, draws a line, and, looking from the paper to Rose, he sketches. Jack grins as he draws, runs his charcoal across the paper creating faint arcs, jerks his head to toss his hair out of his eyes, and adds details as he fleshes out the sketch. Jack smiles as he darkens a shadow under Rose's breasts, while Rose gazes at Jack as he draws. With his finger, Jack rubs various parts of the charcoal drawing, including Rose's hand, forehead, and face. Rose stares expressionless, and gradually, wrinkles form around her eyes, and she transforms into her older self. The crew members and Rose's granddaughter, Lizzie, stare at her, and Brock and Lizzie exchange smiles. Jack signs and dates the drawing, then blows on it, closes his sketchbook, and hands it to Rose. They kiss. Later, Rose writes on a sheet of paper, and Jack steps up to her. She hands him the case holding the Heart of the Ocean. Jack walks into the next room and slides the case into the safe. In the first-class smoking room, Lovejoy approaches Cal, who stands, as the Titanic moves slowly. On the bridge, the helmsman turns the ship's wheel as a ship's officer steps up to Captain Smith, who looks down as he stirs a slice of lemon in his tea, then walks off. Stepping back into Rose's suite, he blows on his hands, and wearing an evening dress, Rose joins him. Rose grabs Jack and pulls him through the sitting room toward a door. Lovejoy steps into the suite as Rose and Jack hurry into Rose's bedroom, and Rose closes the door. Lovejoy strides through the sitting room as Jack and Rose step through another door into a corridor. Lovejoy bursts into another room as Jack and Rose hurry down the corridor. Lovejoy opens a door and glimpses Jack and Rose, who walk faster, prompting Lovejoy to follow them. Jack and Rose run to an elevator, dash into the elevator, and the operator slides the grate shut. Lovejoy runs up to the elevator and slams his hands against the grate, and as the elevator descends, Lovejoy glares through glass at them. Rose raises her middle finger, then waves, and Lovejoy hurries to the staircase. The elevator opens, and Rose and Jack spill out as Lovejoy runs down a staircase while Jack and Rose scramble from the bottom of a different staircase. Jack bumps onto a food table.",
    "1382": "As the Whomping Willow begins to thrash, its violence oddly muted at this distance, Lupin takes a stick and pokes a knot on the trunk, instantly calming the Willow. We look upward, seeing the tops of the trees etched against the darkening sky. Bats fly toward us, and we follow one as Buckbeak snags it, a tail twitching briefly between his beak before it disappears with a slurp. Harry and Hermione sit together in the lengthening shadows, and Hermione looks at Harry, nodding and not wanting to press him further, then glances beyond the trees toward the Whomping Willow. Shadows emerge under a full moon, revealing Black, Harry, Pettigrew, Lupin, Hermione, Ron, and Sleepwalking Snape. Harry studies himself and Sirius. Hermione glances toward the Willow, and Harry looks back to the tall grass as the werewolf is frozen. As a chill wind rises and the leaves of the trees tremble, eerie shadows flutter over the moon, greasy as smoke, revealing Dementors. Hermione eyes Harry warily as he is transfixed, staring hungrily toward the outcrop. The lake begins to freeze, and one after another, Dementors drop from the sky, vanishing in the cyclone. Desperately, Hermione's eyes flash to the cyclone and the pitiful sight of Harry and Black at the water's edge, dying. Harry's face changes, and he draws his wand, slashing through the trees down to the rocky outcrop, the exact spot where his father appeared. Poising his wand, he looks out over the sea of Dementors on the other side of the lake. A wisp of silver escapes his wand, hovering like a mist, then blooms magnificently, and the trees explode with light. The lake blazes with reflected fire, and Harry stands utterly still, wand extended to the heavens. Across the lake, the Dementors retreat, and Harry waits, still as a statue, until each one is gone before simply letting his arm drop. Whoosh! Harry and Hermione plunge into frame astride Buckbeak, soaring toward the castle. Hermione contemplates this as Sirius paces within a small cell, a man condemned, but he is stunned to see them. Ka-boom! The cell door rockets to the sky. Black claps Harry's shoulder, looking him in the eye, and with a twinkle in his eye, Dumbledore swings open the door as Harry and Hermione enter, catching the faintest glimpse of themselves across the room just as they evaporate. Ron blinks, turns, frowns, then glances to the other side of the room. Hermione glances mischievously to Harry, who jumps. Lupin turns, smiling through haggard eyes, as the Marauder's Map lies open on an otherwise bare desk. Harry nods, looks back at Lupin, unable to disguise his shock at Lupin's appearance, and eyes the open desk drawers and the bare bookshelves.",
    "806": "Ferris pulls himself free and clambers over the wall. He makes a call as he limps across wasteland. Skip parks the BMW on a busy street, and he and Ferris get out. They walk into a health clinic. In a treatment room, Ferris sits up on a bed. A doctor attends to him. The doctor leaves, and the pretty young nurse, Aisha, walks in. She gets a packet from a cabinet and goes to Ferris. She looks at the deep, bloody bites on Ferris' leg. She looks at his bloody hands and cut arm. He smiles, and she prepares a syringe. She walks around to him, smiling. Ferris studies her as she holds up the syringe and flicks it. He winces as she injects him in the stomach. He calls Hoffman. Hoffman gets in his car next to his daughter. Two men in suits open gates, and the Mercedes drives into a courtyard. It stops behind another car which Hani is leaning against, smoking. Ferris gets out of the Mercedes looking a little apprehensive. He walks up to Hani. He throws his cigarette away. Hani leads Ferris along a corridor. Hani goes to a door with a window in it and knocks on the glass. On the other side, a man lowers a flap, and Ferris looks into the room. Hoffman's agent, Zayed Ibishi, is naked and tied down on a table. A man whips him. Ferris turns away. Ferris watches the flogging, his eyes narrowed. A young man wearing a black kufi wheels a bicycle with heavily laden panniers out onto a street. He stops by some bins, lifts the lid of one of them, and takes out two paper cups. He takes a piece of paper from one of the cups. The young man wheels his bicycle away. Noordermarkt. A bustling, covered marketplace. People are crowded in the street and around flower stalls. A young man with his black hair swept back locks a car, then notices a tourist lining up a photograph. Head down, the man briskly walks past the tourist, pressing the keys of a mobile phone. The car explodes, sending shock waves through the marketplace. Black and white frame-by-frame images of the explosion, which is blanked out by static. Smoke hangs over the marketplace. Ferris, in his apartment, and Hani, at home with his wife, watch the news. Al-Saleem watches the report. Ferris meets Marwan. Ferris looks at Hani, who's sitting in his car. Ferris sits in the back next to Hani, and Marwan shuts the door. They drive across the desert in a convoy of black cars. The photos Ferris showed Hani. On a vast expanse of brown earth, a suited man stands beside a kneeling figure, whose head is covered with a black hood.",
    "115": "Neff sits before the dictaphone. Neff comes through the reception room doors with his hat on and his briefcase under his arm. As he walks towards his office, he runs into Keyes, who is wearing his vest and hat but no coat. Keyes is carrying a file of papers and smoking a cigar. He stops by a majolica jar filled with sand, takes a pencil from his vest, and stands over the jar, extinguishing his cigar carefully so as not to damage it, then puts the half-smoked cigar into his vest pocket with the pencil. They move on and stop at a door lettered in embossed chromium: EDWARD S. NORTON, JR., PRESIDENT. Keyes opens the door and they go in. As Keyes and Neff enter, the door to Norton's private office opens, and Mr. Norton is letting out three legal-looking gentlemen. Norton, who is about forty-five, very well-groomed, and rather pompous in manner, sees Keyes and Neff. Neff puts down his hat and briefcase, and he and Keyes pass the legal-looking men and follow Norton into his office, which is naturally the best in the building; modern but not modernistic, spacious, and very well furnished, including flowers, smoking stands, and easy chairs. Norton has gone behind his desk, and after Keyes comes in, Neff closes the door quietly. Norton disapprovingly looks at Keyes in shirt sleeves and smiles frostily. Keyes and Neff sit down while Norton remains standing and walks up and down behind his desk thinking hard. There is a charged pause as he looks back and forth between Keyes and Neff. The dictograph on his desk buzzes, and he reaches over to depress a key and puts the earpiece to his ear, then replaces it and turns back to Keyes and Neff. Keyes and Neff start to get up just as the secretary opens the door. Neff stands staring at the door and then relaxes with an obvious effort of will as Phyllis comes in wearing a gray tailored suit, a small black hat with a veil, black gloves, and carrying a black bag. The secretary closes the door behind her. Mr. Norton goes to meet her and turns a little towards Keyes, arranging a chair for Phyllis, who sits and nods silently. Neff stands behind a false mantel, completely deadpan, staring straight at Phyllis, and their eyes meet for a fraction of a second. She makes as if to rise indignantly, turns, and walks out, the door closing after her. There is a pregnant pause, and Keyes stands up, grabs the glass of water out of Norton's hand, and drains it in one big gulp while Norton watches him almost stupefied.",
    "514": "Mickey stares at the X-ray, horrified, and is then seen leaving the hospital. He strides slowly, his shoulders slouched, his hands in his pockets, and his voice is heard over the screen as he crosses the street, continuing his self-absorbed walk on the opposite side while occasional traffic goes by. Mickey brushes against a heavyset man who gives him a nasty look, but Mickey is so dazed, he doesn't even notice. The dark bedroom is abruptly lit as Mickey, lying in his bed, wakes up with a start and turns on his night-table lamp. Mickey, still ruminating, stands up, fixes his pants, and walks out of his bedroom loft into a dark upper hallway. He walks down a spiral staircase into the dark living room, and the film cuts to a flashback of Mickey's past. Dr. Smith, sitting behind his desk, faces the camera, with rows of periodicals lining the wall behind him. The camera moves to Dr. Smith's point of view: Hannah and Mickey are sitting on the opposite side of the desk, looking stunned. The camera moves back to the stunned Mickey and Hannah, following Dr. Smith with their eyes as he walks back to his high-backed leather chair behind the desk and sits down. As he talks, the camera moves closer and closer to his face. Mickey and Hannah walk on the sidewalk, oblivious of the passing pedestrians, with Hannah crying and blowing her nose. Hannah sobs, clutching her tissue to her face as they walk offscreen, and the film cuts to Hannah and Mickey's living room, which is brightly lit and cluttered with pillows and plants. Norman and Carol, his wife, sit on the couch drinking coffee. Mickey walks from the kitchen into the living room, holding a half-eaten chocolate cake on a serving plate while the sun pours through the windows he passes. Hannah is briefly seen in the background, preparing more coffee in the kitchen. Mickey puts the cake down on the coffee table, which is already crowded with assorted plants, plates, and a bamboo tray holding utensils and napkins. Mickey sighs and flops down on an adjoining couch, rubbing his forehead. Norman chuckles, and Mickey starts to pace. Hannah, her hands clasped near her face, glances briefly at Carol and sighs. Mickey pauses for a moment, collecting his thoughts, then stops his pacing and looks at the group before starting to pace behind the couch anew. Norman and Carol remain silent as Mickey stops pacing and leans on the couch behind Norman, rubbing his hands on his knees, then leans back against the wall. Norman and Carol turn to each other, reacting, and Carol glances at Norman and chuckles nervously while he takes a sip of coffee. Hannah reaches for the cake as Carol and Norman exchange glances, reacting.",
    "349": "They cartwheel into the air and land in a heap. The horse is dead. Theoden lies dying beneath it. The Witch-King swoops down on his Fell-Beast, and the Fell-Beast lands on Theoden's dead horse. The Fell-Beast opens its wicked jaws, and a Rohan soldier stands before the beast. The Witch-King laughs. The Fell-Beast lifts Eowyn from her feet. Suddenly, with a mighty sword blow, the Fell-Beast's head is severed, crumpling the creature to the ground with its vast wings outstretched, sending the Witch-King sprawling. The Witch-King rises from the wreckage. Eowyn stands before him, the Fell-Beast's blood dripping from her sword. With a shrill shriek of hatred, he knocks Eowyn backward with his mace. Stunned, Eowyn tries to stand and is hit once again with a crippling blow. Eowyn tries to block the blow, but her shield shatters into many pieces as the Witch-King towers over her. Meanwhile, an Orc commander hurries to the Anduin River docks, close to the city. Large black shadows slide across the docks as sailing ships approach. A sinister black sailed ship glides into the docks, followed by nine other Corsair ships. Aragorn leaps from the leading ship and charges across the docks, roaring at the top of his lungs, followed by Legolas and Gimli. The Orcs are surprised by the three charging towards thousands of them. Suddenly, the Army of the Dead leaps straight out of the sides of the ships. They charge across the surface of the water with frightening speed, overtaking Aragorn. The Orcs scream at the sight of 5000 spectral warriors. The spectral warriors swarm into the flank of the Orc army, creating a rolling mountain of ghouls that sweep all before them away. The Orcs have no defense as their weapons cannot make contact with the ghosts. Meanwhile, Merry is on the ground and sees the Witch-King standing over Eowyn, pulling her to her feet. Merry drives his sword into the back of the Witch-King's knee, causing his sword to burst into flame and his arm to be shot with pain. Eowyn struggles to her feet, pulling off her helmet, and her long hair tumbles onto her shoulders. With her last strength, Eowyn thrusts her sword into the Witch-King's face. Eowyn's sword shatters into many shards, and the Witch-King topples back dead, with black ooze leaking from his robes and armor. A shuddering cry, fading into a shrill wail, passes with the wind. Meanwhile, Aragorn and Legolas battle the Orcs, and Legolas jumps onto the back of a giant Mumakil, bringing it down. He lands on his feet in front of Gimli.",
    "556": "The two struggle, rolling from side to side, coming perilously close to rolling right off the edge. Things get even more serious when Roscoe pulls a knife. Finally, he raises his head and thrusts his horn through the roof. As the horn smashes through the wood only inches from Indy's head, Indy and Roscoe stare at the horn in amazement as they continue to struggle. Smash! The horn comes up again -- right. Indy kicks Roscoe away. Roscoe rolls to the edge of the car but keeps from falling. Indy flips over onto his stomach. The wooden trap door explodes as a bullet is fired from within. The door is pushed open and Halfbreed and Rough Rider hurry out of the car. Indy gets to his feet -- looks ahead -- sees a water tank alongside the track directly up ahead. In an instant, he calculates his approach -- times the distance -- and leaps for the tank's water spout. He catches it perfectly, but his velocity causes the water spout to rotate a full 360 degrees. With Indy hanging on, feet kicking, the water spout deposits him back on the train, onto the roof of a stockcar, where he looks up to see Fedora walking toward him. As Indy edges away from Fedora, a portion of the stockcar's roof collapses and Indy falls through into the car below. Indy crashes down from above. Dust rises. The men, including Roscoe, pull Indy through the hole in the roof. He stands to face them as Rough Rider points a gun in his direction. Roscoe makes a grab for the Cross -- but Indy doesn't let go. A tug-of-war ensues until a snake wiggles out from Indy's shirtsleeve and wraps around Roscoe's hand. Roscoe screams bloody murder -- releases his grip on the Cross and tries to shake off the snake. He leaps onto the next car. Indy swings down to the caboose. He glances back at the men and quickly opens the door to the caboose, stepping inside, which contains the circus magic equipment. Indy rushes to the rear door of the caboose but can't open it. He hears Fedora coming and dives into a magic box. Fedora smiles confidently and advances toward the box. The box unexpectedly collapses; all four sides flop away. Fedora is mystified, frustrated, and angered. He rushes out onto the balcony and sees Indy running along the tracks, turning up a street of modest clapboard houses. Indy bursts through the front door holding the Cross in his hand. A husky barks as Indy runs past in search of his father. Indy charges in.",
    "364": "GANDALF spurs SHADOWFAX forward with PIPPIN clinging tightly to the horse's mane, while FARAMIR remains at the rear, sword in hand, trying to fend off a deadly assault as the fell-beasts dive low again. GANDALF thunders into view, raising his staff, and a shaft of white light suddenly stabs upward, causing the Nazgul to swerve away as sunlight streams through a hole onto Pelennor Fields. The Nazgul circle away from the sun rays, spiraling higher and higher, and with the Nazgul defeated, GANDALF and the Rangers ride toward the safety of Minas Tirith. IORLAS runs toward the gates, yelling, and the great gates open, allowing GANDALF, PIPPIN, FARAMIR, and the Osgiliath survivors to ride in, despite nearly 100 wounded. As GANDALF pulls SHADOWFAX up, FARAMIR steers his horse through the crowd, suddenly staring at PIPPIN, with GANDALF reading surprise in his eyes. FARAMIR shakes his head, and GANDALF is deeply troubled. Elsewhere, FRODO and SAM follow GOLLUM up a dizzying stairway carved into the sheer cliff, with narrow, unevenly spaced, and broken steps so steep they climb like a ladder, trying not to look at the long black fall below. FRODO's foot slips, and he hangs precariously from the rock face, with GOLLUM peering down from above. FRODO tries to clamber up onto the ledge, and as he does, the ring slips out of his shirt and dangles in full view of GOLLUM, who rears back in shock and tenses like a cat. FRODO, with his head bowed, struggles to pull himself up as GOLLUM's fingers close in on the ring. SAM teeters on the precipitous stairs, and a startled FRODO looks down at SAM, losing footing, as SAM’s horrified face observes GOLLUM suddenly grasp FRODO's arm, pulling him safely onto the ledge. GOLLUM glares down at SAM, blinks to mask the malice in his eyes, and whispers in FRODO's ear as FRODO looks at SAM, his hand straying to his neck, closing tight around the ring. High above Osgiliath, the sinister profile of the Witch King seated on a fell beast is observed as Gothmog stands awaiting orders, and Gondorian soldiers react upon Minas Tirith, anxiously crowding around GANDALF dressed in oversized armor. PIPPIN kneels before DENETHOR, kissing his proffered ring as DENETHOR gently raises PIPPIN's head, their eyes meeting. DENETHOR addresses his meal as FARAMIR finally realizes the truth, and for a brief second, DENETHOR seems to hesitate. FARAMIR bows low to DENETHOR, turns to leave, stops, then turns back.",
    "901": "Purvis's beady eyes peer downward, deep in thought. Later, Purvis uses a candlestick phone. On the other end, a boyish agent, Sam Cowley, nods, hangs up, and grabs some maps. As Sam's team arms up, Purvis and his armed peers board a prop plane on an airfield. Now, under a dim table lamp, a hand turns on a boxy radio. He lies down on a modest twin bed. Dillinger picks up his pocket watch off the nightstand, opens it and admires a photo of Billie on the inside of the cover. Dillinger's profile grows blurry as the view focuses on the radio beyond. Now, on a forest road, two motorcars douse their headlights as they creep forward and park on the dirt shoulder. Purvis, Winstead, and several others in trench coats climb out of the vehicles. Purvis closes his door most of the way but leaves it cracked open. The men advance, armed with their rifles and submachine guns, as the G-men cross the shadowy woods. Purvis and Winstead stand shoulder to shoulder as they spot the lodge a few hundred yards off. Purvis looks Winstead in the eye. The partner G-men filter outwards through the trees toward the lodge. Inside a warmly lit barroom. Outside, Purvis passes in and out of light as he treads forward. Toting a rifle, Baum comes up on his left. Meanwhile, Winstead rounds past a tree. Inside, Baby Face approaches a couple eating dinner. He pats a guy on a barstool then faces the couple. Outside, Purvis spies a window framing a view of two women, a tuxedoed man and a fourth person drinking and smoking inside. As he stalks closer, three working-class men exit the lodge. Purvis watches them closely from behind a tree. Inside Dillinger's room, a framed religious icon hangs on the wall over his bed as he rests. Outside, the car backs up. Purvis aims his Tommy gun. The car starts forward. Purvis and two of his peers open fire. The shots knock out the headlights and riddle the car from top to bottom with holes. Inside, Dillinger springs awake, grabs his Tommy gun, and goes to a window. In the barroom, Baby Face returns fire through a window, as does Dillinger from the second story. As muzzle flashes light up the night, indoors and out, Winstead carefully lines up a rifle shot from the base of a tree. Now in Dillinger's room, Wedge joins the shootout. As Purvis sprints for a tree closer to the disabled car, Baby Face unleashes a barrage of fire from a barroom window. Purvis takes cover and reloads. As he makes a run for the car, shells fire from the launch, and outside, Purvis sees the car's lifeless occupants.",
    "627": "Behind him, shrubs growing outside the farmhouse are buffeted by the growing wind. Merrill eyes the crops suspiciously, then retreats. He picks up the cotton sack, jogs up the steps to the farmhouse veranda, and hits indoors. Morgan and Bo are glued to the TV screen in the closet. Graham and Merrill arrive. They stand and watch. Graham looks uneasy. Merrill is deep in thought. The presenter shifts fearfully. Unflinching, Graham stares directly at the television screen. Standing rooted to the floor, Graham continues to scrutinize the images on the TV, his features sagging mournfully as he reflects on the presenter's words. He wanders off, leaving Merrill alone with Morgan and Bo. The two children are mesmerized by the screen. Merrill kneels down on the floor beside them. Looking up at Merrill, pale with worry, Morgan turns back to the TV. Graham is now in the room. He moves to a window, which is being partially boarded up on the inside, and peers out. He then takes a plank of old wood and secures it over the window, blocking out the light completely. Outside, the silver pipes of a wind chime knock against each other. Then, more chimes are disturbed by the strengthening breeze. Graham sits indoors in dim lights, staring and failing me ahead. Merrill sauces into the room and stops next to Morgan and Bo, who are standing against a wall. Graham nods. Graham smiles. Graham turns to look at his brother. Graham beams. His lips spread into a smile. Later, in the dimly lit kitchen, pans and bowls, one full of empty eggshells, are stacked up into two sinks. On a worktop lies a sharp knife along with a skinned onion, some potato peel on top of a tomato. Graham, Merrill, and the two children sit silently at the dinner table in the next room. Shifting awkwardly in his chair, Graham casts a fleeting glance at the others. Graham's taken aback. Graham's lips tremble slightly. Morgan's eyes are swollen. He reaches over and stabs his fork into a piece of molten toast, then sits back down. Merrill watches in disbelief as Graham tucks into his mount of food. Bo, sitting next to him, is in tears. Upset, Graham winces as he eats. Observing him, Morgan gets up from his chair and goes to his dad who is now throwing down his fork and sobbing uncontrollably. Morgan leans into his father who hugs him tightly, then pulls Bo to his other side. Merrill is staring self-consciously at his plate when Graham's hand reaches out and tucks him in the family embrace. Graham's body rocks as he cries. At the other end of the table, the red lines on the baby monitor begin to flash.",
    "1032": "Natalie's taken aback as Ryan grins when they arrive at the hotel. Natalie's face crumples, and she starts to sob. Ryan frowns awkwardly and holds out his hands as she falls into his arms. Ryan then sees Alex and gives her a little embarrassed wave. She comes over, and Natalie shoots Ryan a look before frowning. Natalie raises a drink to her lips as Alex smiles broadly. Natalie looks down thoughtfully, and Ryan gives an I-told-you-so look as Natalie appears uncertain. They walk through the lobby and go to the registration desk for the Alpha-tech party. Ryan and Alex casually pick up name badges and neck bands, and, looking a bit shifty, Natalie does the same and follows them around a corner. The threesome clip their name badges to their neck bands and hang them around their necks. Alex reads Natalie's name badge. At the party in the hotel ballroom, Natalie, Alex, and Ryan are at the bar getting drinks. They turn around and survey the scene where people stand at small white tables with shiny balloons floating on ribbons above them. Ryan, Natalie, and Alex go stand around a table, and Natalie has a gulp from her drink. She nods and smiles, looks at Alex, and then walks onto the dance floor. Alex grabs Ryan, and they dance together while Natalie wanders about on her own, moving to the music. A young guy with a stubbly chin bops about and notices Natalie. He leans to her, and she smiles, then looks at her name badge. A DJ on the stage is a big black guy, and Ryan and Alex have their picture taken in front of a backdrop of a giant wave. They squat, hold out their arms, and pretend they're surfing. Natalie and Dave pose for pictures, and a bit drunk, she drapes herself all over him. Dave holds Natalie up as they leave the photo area. On the dance floor, Alex and Ryan face each other and shout while everyone points in the air and jumps around. Later, Ryan and Alex are at the table where he hands her a key card, and they both smile. Natalie sings karaoke on a yacht in the harbor as a few drunken party guests, including Dave, are there. Alex and Ryan sit on a platform at the back of the yacht, and he dangles his feet in the clear, blue water. They gaze at each other, then share a lingering kiss. The power fails, and all the lights in the yacht go out. Ryan and Alex look back toward the city lights, some distance away. Everyone gets a ride back to land in a small pontoon boat. They jog up onto the sandy beach, and a courtesy bus delivers the group to the hotel. They run into the entrance barefoot, and Ryan wakes up in bed.",
    "717": "The steward removes Jack's coat, while the master-at-arms frisks him, and the steward pulls the necklace from the pocket. Cal takes the necklace and walks past Rose. The master-at-arms handcuffs Jack as Lovejoy passes the coat to him, and the master-at-arms carts Jack away. In the chartroom, Andrews unrolls the ship's blueprint, and Andrews, Smith, and others study it. Andrews stares at the blueprint and turns to Smith, who glances away with his brow furrowed while Murdoch swallows hard. A ship officer enters and stands in a doorway as Smith turns toward Ismay. Alone in the sitting room, Cal walks toward Rose, who blinks and gazes at him. Cal stares at her, opens his mouth as if to speak, then slaps her face and grabs her. The steward enters, and Cal releases Rose. The steward fetches two life belts and stewards open the cabin doors in third class. Smith writes coordinates and hands the message to dark-haired Jack Phillips. Smith takes off his hat, glances at the door, puts his hat back on, and walks out. Phillips stares at Smith slack-jawed, exchanges glances with Bride, a young brown-haired man, then puts on a headset and sends a telegraph. On the boat deck, officers supervise and swing them out over the water as Chief Officer Wilde stands at lifeboat four and yells to a man on an upper deck. Andrews enters the A deck foyer where dozens of passengers chat and drink as musicians play, a waiter approaches Andrews with drinks on a tray, and nearby, Molly Brown stops a brown-haired steward. Molly passes Cal, Rose, and Ruth, who turns to her two maids, and the maids leave. Rose stops Andrews as he wanders past, and Andrews pulls Rose aside, with Cal standing nearby who leans forward. Andrews nods and walks off. Meanwhile, in his office, the master-at-arms handcuffs Jack to a vertical water pipe as Lovejoy stands nearby. A dark-haired crewman rushes in, and Lovejoy pulls out a handgun. As he leaves with the crewman, the master-at-arms hands Lovejoy the handcuff key. Jack and Lovejoy stare at each other as Lovejoy sits in a desk chair. On the bridge, Bride runs up to Smith while Lightoller, a man with short, light brown hair, and Murdoch hurry over to Smith. Lightoller glances at Murdoch and rushes to passengers as band-leader Wallace Hartley leads the band onto the boat deck and the band plays. In steerage, a steward hands out life belts to third-class passengers, and Fabrizio follows Tommy, who grabs a life belt and puts it on. They stand behind a crowd of passengers on the stairs leading to the main deck, where at the top of the stairs, a steward stands behind a locked gate as a young brown-haired boy turns to his auburn-haired mother.",
    "381": "Mildred cuts in to dance with Edward, but it's hard to hear over the music. Edward stops dancing, and after a brief moment, he heads for the edge of the crowd, walking down Main Street. The townspeople stop dancing, disbelieving and some shaking their heads, saying poor Edward Bloom's gone crazy. Jenny runs to him and would tackle him if she could, but Edward keeps walking. In various shots, Edward negotiates the thorns in his bare feet, which is horrible and almost unendurable, and then it gets worse. The trees ahead are moving, and at first it just seems to be the wind blowing the branches, but as the wood cracks and groans, it's unmistakable: they're trying to block him. Snake-like white roots shoot out of the ground, grabbing for his ankles. He leaps up, kicking off one tree trunk to grab another one's branches and swings off, lands, and rolls. Now all the trees are moving to block him, towering over him in the flashes of lightning. As he ducks under branches, the chain holding the Key to the City gets caught, and he's almost strangled, but the chain finally breaks, and the silver key disappears into the mud. Scrambling forward, he looks for a way out, but the trees have encircled him, their spiky crowns bending down to crush him. He screams up at the night until his breath is gone. With a sudden calm, another lightning flash occurs, and suddenly the trees are back where they've always been. Edward is lying shoeless and torn in a muddy puddle, staring up at the rain and laughing. His bare foot steps onto asphalt, and Edward turns to see to his right, a larger, paved road. Edward looks down at his muddy, bloody feet, and with that, the men start walking down the larger road. Edward and Will sit at opposite ends of the table, with Sandra and Josephine in the middle. Although Edward has a small plate of food in front of him, he hasn't touched it. He's exhausted from the trip downstairs but determined to maintain the family dinner ritual. The other three eat awkwardly, each clink and scrape of a knife or fork resonating. Will finally breaks the silence, and as Will scoops out another serving of potatoes, Edward suddenly speaks, and all three stop to listen. She smiles. He tries to recollect, but it's already gone. Josephine motions, asking if it’s okay for her to sit on the bed, and he nods. She shakes her head, and a long beat passes. Then, deadpan, Edward rolls his eyes, why not. Josephine leaves, heading down the hall to get her camera. We stay with Edward in bed as he grimaces, a flash of pain showing that around others he's hiding how much it hurts, but alone it's clear how bad it is.",
    "1187": "Pettigrew grabs Lupin's wand, turns back into a rat, and runs off, leaving only a pile of clothes. Hermione grabs Harry's arm to stop him from following. Lupin's fingers turn to claws, he bursts out of his clothes, his limbs grow thin and twisted, his face becomes a long snout with sharp teeth, and he flings Sirius aside and stands whimpering. Hermione slowly approaches, and the creature looks at her pathetically before howling to the moon. Snape appears, and the werewolf lashes out at him. The black dog leaps out of the shadows and knocks the werewolf to the ground. The animals face each other growling, then both leap to the attack, colliding in mid-air, then falling, snarling and biting. The dog runs off, chased by the werewolf. Harry follows and sees the werewolf hurling the dog against a rock. Harry throws a stone and hits the werewolf on the back of the head, causing it to turn slowly and lope menacingly toward him. It stops, lifts its head, and runs toward the sound of howling. From where the dog fell, a figure gets up and limps away through the bushes. Harry follows the figure, hurrying through the trees toward the moonlit lake, running down the bank and across the stony shore to the edge of the water. Sirius is lying on his back, his eyes closed, with a bloody claw mark on his shoulder. The water lapping the shore stops moving as a sheet of crackling ice spreads over the surface of the lake. Sirius opens his eyes and shudders with horror. Harry looks up to see a swarm of hooded Dementors circling above their heads, their black cloaks fluttering behind them. One swoops down and attacks Sirius. Harry pulls out his wand and points it at the Dementors, forming a silver mist as a protective shield that holds the Dementors back. But the power of Harry's wand fades, and the Dementors return to the attack. He cries out in horror as he falls back onto the stony beach beside Sirius. The Dementors circle overhead again, then swoop lower and lower, hovering over the two figures lying helpless below as life is gradually sucked out of them. A faint, silvery breath floats from Sirius' half-open mouth, illuminating his face. Exhausted, Harry lifts his head and, to his surprise, sees the Dementors floating harmlessly. He sees something shining on the far side of the frozen lake: a magnificent silver stag with huge antlers stands facing him, glowing amongst the trees. Harry gazes at the beautiful animal as the dazzling light surrounding the stag grows even brighter. As the Dementors start to move again, they are turned back by a powerful invisible shield and swoop away over Harry's head.",
    "843": "He casually pours out the Barbicide disinfectant and drops the glass container on the floor, then flips open a Zippo lighter and strikes it on his leg. Her mouth hangs open, and she points to the desk. At night, in Sandy's car, Diana smiles as she applies makeup. He faces forward with a stern gaze and shakes his head. As they enter a restaurant, a young red-haired waitress greets them, then walks away smiling. He signals the waitress, and she turns, shocked to see Sandy. She glares at Sandy and leaves as he looks upward. The waitress returns with a mound of food, and she pulls her thumb from Sandy's soup. As the waitress leaves, Diana takes a large bite of ribs. In a motel, they approach the front desk, and she leaves. Diana enters The Foxhole, where a husky bearded man in a cowboy hat notices her and nods to himself as Diana sips her green beverage. He turns away, and she notices his Mercedes car key and thick gold ring on his pinky. The man smiles, sits beside her, removes his hat, and extends a hand, wearing a turquoise bolo. They toast and down their shots. They sit at a table with several empty shot glasses, and as they drink another shot, Diana slaps the table. Sandy enters and scans the room, smiling as he approaches their table. She points at Chuck and places a hand on his shoulder. Big Chuck nods, and she leads him to the dance floor. Diana and Big Chuck shimmy, and with her eyes on Sandy, Diana pinches Chuck's nipples through his shirt. Spinning around, Diana bends over, and Big Chuck twirls his cowboy hat behind her like riding a bronco. She stands and they continue dancing with her eyes on Sandy, who motions toward the door. Facing Chuck, Diana shimmies in place and suddenly drops into a split with her face by his crotch. Big Chuck points finger guns at Sandy as Diana dances on the floor. They enter a motel room where Sandy sets down his wallet. Chuck walks into Diana's arms, and Big Chuck whips off his belt, swinging it up from his crotch like an elephant's trunk and hitting Sandy in the face. Chuck gives him a final belt slap, then drops it. He aims a finger gun at his crotch and unbuttons his pants, dropping them. She spanks Big Chuck as he rapidly knocks his knees. Diana swipes the anxiety pills, and stumbling back, Chuck pulls up his pants. Big Chuck grabs her hips from behind, and they fall backwards onto the bed. Big Chuck spreads his legs in the air and sits up as Diana drops a pill into his cup, then pours two drinks as he twitches drunkenly.",
    "333": "A long drawn wail comes down the wind, like the cry of some evil and lonely creature. Sam grabs Merry and Pippin as the Hobbits quickly scramble down the bank, hiding under a mossy log. The sound of hooves is close. A sinister mounted Ringwraith steps into view, hooded and faceless, mounted on a huge snarling black horse with insane eyes. Frodo freezes in terror. The Ringwraith pauses right beside their hiding place, sitting very still with his head bowed, listening. Beads of sweat gather on his brow. The Ringwraith suddenly slides off his horse, leaning over the mossy log and peering suspiciously into the woods. From inside the hood comes a sniffing noise as if he is trying to catch an elusive scent, his head turning from side to side. He is drawing the ring out of his pocket, with trembling hands, his face fevered and sweating as if in the grip of some terrible internal struggle. Merry desperately hurls the mushrooms across the road. The Ringwraith spins around at the sound and darts to the far side of the road with frightening speed. Frodo instantly slumps as if a psychic link had been broken. Frodo is staring, a look of shock on his face at the ring lying in the palm of his hand. The Black Rider turns and departs. Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin hurry through the trees, slipping and sliding on the muddy ground. Merry moves past Pippin toward Frodo, watching intently, while Sam keeps looking around nervously. The four Hobbits sprawl on the ground, holding their breath. The silhouette of a Black Rider looms against the skyline. Merry looks at his friend, realizing Frodo is in deep trouble. The Hobbits break cover. Suddenly, a Ringwraith bursts out of the forest toward them. Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin are running toward the wide, placid Brandywine River and the ferry. The Hobbits stampede across the wharf and tumble onto the ferry. Frodo races across the wooden wharf, followed by the Ringwraiths. He leaps into the ferry, shrieking with rage. The Hobbits cover their ears. Sam and Merry shove off with the poles. The ferry slides out into the river, just as the Ringwraiths arrive. The Ringwraiths wheel their horses toward the north and gallop away along the riverbank, quickly disappearing into the fog. Lights of Bree, a small village of stone and half-timbered houses, are nestled against a low wooded hill. Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin approach the gatehouse, wild-eyed, ragged, and out of breath. A thick hedge surrounds the village, and a great gate bars the western entrance. A surly gatekeeper glances down at them. The gatekeeper swings his lantern onto the Hobbits, bathing them in an uncomfortable yellow spotlight. The Hobbits gratefully enter Bree, the gatekeeper eyeing them curiously in the lantern light.",
    "872": "He pretends to spoon more of the sauce, and Kate opens her mouth, ready to taste it. Nick draws the spoon away a couple of times and watches her full lips open and close. Then, he leans over and plants a kiss to one side of her mouth. The couple move apart slightly, and Kate pulls off her blindfold. She moves back in towards Nick. Nick's face edges towards Kate's, and this time he kisses her fully on the lips. The couple begin to kiss more urgently. Kate brings her hands up to cup Nick's face, and she stands. Her eyes are closed, and her face is relaxed into a serene ecstasy, as Nick kisses her neck then returns to her lips. Finally, Kate falls into Nick's embrace. Next morning, Nick strides down the hallway rattling a spoon in a saucepan. In Zoe's room, Zoe, Kate, and Nick are piled into a photo booth. Outside, Kate screams with glee at the pictures. The trio walk down a cold, sunny New York street. Nick has Zoe on his shoulders. All three wear coats, scarves, and woolly hats. They dart across a busy street to a Chinese vegetable shop. They leave the shop. All three wear cycling helmets as they pedal a bicycle made for three. The sun sets against the Manhattan skyline as they pedal alongside the river. Nick sits up front. Later in the evening, they come across a street artist copying a fantastical picture of a ballerina onto the pavement in colored chalk. Nick and Kate hold hands. Zoe beams up at them as she admires the drawing. The staff are gathered at the restaurant to review the menu. In the kitchen, Nick completes a vegetable garnish on a dish and lays it out for a waiter. Kate eyes him with suspicion. Paula strolls in from the dining room. Nick is wide-eyed with surprise as he watches Kate stride off to the walk-in fridge. He joins her. The couple stare at each other. From the kitchen, they're framed in the window of the fridge door. Kate is left thoughtful. She returns to her apartment, where a woman in her 60s waits on the sofa. Kate locks the apartment door, turns out the hall lights, and saunters back into the room. Passing a side table, she presses a button on the answer phone then lifts a remote and turns off the music. Kate stares thoughtfully. She heads towards her bedroom. Zoe cuddles up to her furry kangaroo. Kate goes into her room. Zoe rolls onto her side. At the restaurant, Paula tackles Kate as she prepares dishes. Kate interviews a series of applicants. At the apartment, Zoe watches TV as Kate works at her desk.",
    "191": "The camera pulls up from the Bailey home and travels up through the sky until it is above the falling snow and moving slowly toward a firmament full of stars. As the camera stops, heavenly voices are heard, and as each voice is heard, one of the stars twinkles brightly. A small star flies in from the left of the screen, stops, and twinkles as Clarence speaks. The stars fade out from the screen, and a light, indistinguishable blur is seen, which slowly begins to take form. We see a group of young boys on top of a snow-covered hill preparing to slide down on large shovels. One of them makes the slide and shoots out onto the ice of a frozen river at the bottom of the hill, where George Bailey is at the bottom of the slide. As each boy comes down, the others applaud, and there is a series of shots as four or five boys make the slide down the hill and out onto the ice. On top of the hill, Harry makes his slide very fast, passing the marks made by the other boys, and his shovel takes him onto the thin ice at the bend of the river. The ice breaks, and Harry disappears into the water. George jumps into the water and grabs Harry, and as he starts to pull him out, he yells. The other boys lie flat on the ice, forming a human chain, and when George reaches the edge with Harry in his arms, they pull them both to safety. Five or six boys are coming toward the camera, arm in arm, whistling, and their attention is drawn to an elaborate horsedrawn carriage proceeding down the other side of the street, in which we catch a glimpse of an elderly man riding. The boys continue until they reach Gower's drugstore, which is old-fashioned and dignified, with jars of colored water in the windows and little else. As the kids stop, George comes in and crosses to an old-fashioned cigar lighter on the counter, shuts his eyes and makes a wish, clicks the lighter, and the flame springs up. George crosses over to the soda fountain, where Mary Hatch, a small girl, is seated, watching him, and goes on to get his apron from behind the fountain. Mr. Gower, the druggist, peers from a window in the back room and is seen taking a drink from a bottle. Violet Bick enters the drugstore and sits on one of the stools at the fountain. George is behind the soda fountain putting on his apron, and Violet, who is the same height and age as Mary but infinitely older in her approach to people, observes him.",
    "636": "Graham's silver station wagon drives along the freeway and passes a large modern church. The station wagon parks beside other vehicles outside a parade of shops, and the family gets out. Merrill feeds the parking meter, and Morgan holds his hand out to Graham. Graham hands Morgan some cash, and Morgan and Bo head off down the sidewalk together. Graham watches them as Morgan holds out his hand and Bo takes it. Graham turns and calls to Merrill, who strolls off in the other direction. Morgan is in a bookshop watching the news coverage with the middle-aged proprietors, while Graham waits at the counter in a pharmacy listening to a radio. The young shop assistant comes to the counter with a paper prescription bag and leans pensively on the counter. Tracy's face crumples, and Graham looks awkward. Meanwhile, Merrill is in an army recruitment center looking at posters where a gray-haired man in a sergeant's uniform sits at a desk with a poster of Uncle Sam behind him. Merrill turns to the sergeant, and Cunningham stares up at Merrill. Merrill gazes apprehensively down at Cunningham, then laughs. Cunningham gives Merrill a pamphlet, and Merrill stares at Cunningham, then nods. A scruffy young man is filling out a form. Lionel smirks, with stubble on his chin and wearing a t-shirt and sleeveless biker jacket. Merrill folds up the pamphlet and puts it in his pocket, then walks solemnly towards the door. He stops just behind Lionel and jerks as though about to hit him, causing Lionel to flinch, and then Merrill leaves. In the bookshop, Bo sits at a table and sips a glass of water as a cola commercial comes on TV. Morgan holds the book out to the lady. Meanwhile, in the pharmacy, Tracy thinks. Merrill, Morgan, and Bo are already eating in a pizza restaurant when Graham comes in and sits at their table. The other three nod, and Graham sighs and nods back, then glances out of the restaurant doorway. His expression hardens when he sees a young dark-haired man of Asian descent strolling down the sidewalk and opening the back door of a brown Chevrolet four by four. Morgan follows his father's gaze and looks out of the doorway at the man, and Merrill also gazes out at the young man. Graham and his family stare fixedly out at the young man, who shuts his car door and glances over at the restaurant, seeing the family gazing back at him. His mouth opens in surprise as Graham takes a deep breath. The young man looks unsettled as he gets into his driver's seat, fires up the engine, and the four by four swings out of its parking bay and accelerates off down the road. Graham turns back to the table and takes a bite of pizza, while Merrill, Morgan, and Bo continue looking out at the street.",
    "480": "They pause and Norman pauses. Norman walks past Sam, giving him a quick, disapproving glance, goes onto the porch and into the office. Sam and Lila follow Norman. Norman crosses to the desk, goes behind it, and takes the key to cabin number twelve off the keyboard. By this time, Sam and Lila have entered and are almost to the desk-counter. Sam scans the counter, looking for a registration book. Lila moves closer and studies the book as Sam signs in. When Sam has finished, he closes the book and hands it back to Norman. As he starts for the door, Sam laughs. Norman stops, turns, and looks at him. Sam smiles, takes a bill out of his pocket. Norman reluctantly goes behind the counter, lays down the key to cabin twelve, takes a receipt book out of the drawer under the counter, and starts to write. Lila steps to the desk, picks up the key quickly, and starts out. Norman looks up and gazes at her as she goes out the door. Lila comes along the porch, pauses before cabin one, and tries the door. It opens. She closes it quickly as she hears Sam and Norman coming out of the motel office and continues down the porch. Sam considers a moment, nods agreement, and rises. He goes to the door, opens it slightly, looks out, then back to Lila. Lila goes to the door. He holds it open, and she goes out. Sam closes the door, joins Lila, and takes her hand. Together, they walk along the porch toward Cabin One. They pause before the door of Cabin One. Sam motions Lila to wait and hold still, then goes on to the office, opens the door, and calls in. Sam lifts the piece of paper off her finger, studies it, takes out his wallet, presses the wet scrap to his driver's license shield, puts it back in the wallet, and puts the wallet away. She starts out of the bathroom. Sam takes hold of her arm and stops her. Lila nods quickly, hurries to the door. Sam gets to it first, opens it a slight crack, looks out, then opens it wide enough for Lila and himself to pass through. Lila comes out, turns to her left, and goes along the porch toward cabin twelve. Sam remains at the door, then turns right, heading for the path. As he passes the office, he is shocked to see Norman standing just inside the open door. Sam starts into the office. She watches Sam disappear into the office, waits until she hears the door close, then looks about for another way to reach the house.",
    "671": "He raises it to his lips to find that it's already been drunk. He tips it upside down, and its little umbrella falls to the floor. Back inside, Harry staggers up to him. He slaps Peter's face a second time. Peter's head swings to one side, then he turns to face Harry. The two eyeball each other before Harry, tight-lipped, turns and walks away. Peter lowers his head. Her arms folded, MJ looks slightly flustered as the guests applaud. She opens the palm of her hand towards John and moves up to the podium to join him, watched by a stunned Peter. Peter raises the camera to his eye. The lights of the Empire State Building form the backdrop for Spider-Man to swing slowly and gently through the city. He stretches out his right hand and flexes his wrist. He tries again and again, then falls. He lands face down in a puddle. Rises, pulls off the mask then flexes his wrists. Still nothing happens. He studies his fingertips, then looks up at the building to his right. Standing alone in an alley, he moves to the building. Places his hands on its surface and starts to climb. He moves rapidly up the outside of the building, climbing with ease. He starts to slip down, then comes to a halt. Grasping for a handle, he slips back into the puddle. He shakes his wet hands and leans back against a rubbish skip. He notices a newspaper hanging over the side. He grabs it and screws up his eyes to try to read the headline and focus on the picture. In his room, he tosses it away. Looking dejected, Peter sits on his bed. He takes the back of his left hand up to his forehead and wipes his brow. Octavius is at the desk in his lab, the four mechanical limbs busying themselves around him. One holds a cigar to his mouth. Another lights it for him. Octavius raises the dark glasses he's wearing from his eyes. Puffs on the cigar, then blows the match. Louise and MJ in a shoe store. Peter's at his doctor being examined. He points to his head. The doctor nods, then heaves himself up onto the examination couch to sit beside Peter. He nods again, and Peter reflects. Peter sits in his room, his head against the wall. Big flashes illuminate the darkness. Peter's eyes are bright. Sitting in the front seat of a car, the old man holds out his hand. Peter looks at the hand, only inches from him. He purses his lips. His face screws up and his eyes flicker. He turns his gaze on Uncle Ben who stares right back at him, a sad expression on his face.",
    "1151": "Dumbledore reads the name written on the parchment, and Viktor punches the air. His friends congratulate him as he rises from his seat and shakes Dumbledore's hand before leaving the hall. The flame flares again, and Dumbledore reads a second piece of smoldering parchment. Beaming with pleasure, Fleur shakes Dumbledore's hand and follows Viktor. Smiling broadly, he shakes Dumbledore's hand and follows Viktor and Fleur out of the hall. Crouch uncovers a magnificent crystal and silver trophy. Snape steps forward alarmed as the goblet of fire flares once more, and Dumbledore turns in surprise as the blue flame leaps high into the air. The flame turns red, and Karkaroff glares as sparks fly from a piece of scorched parchment, which flutters down into Dumbledore's hand. He reads it, and all eyes turn to Harry, who sits down nervously. Hagrid shakes his head while Hermione forces Harry to his feet. Ron glowers as Harry walks hesitantly towards Professor Dumbledore. The piece of parchment is still smoking at the edges when Dumbledore thrusts it into Harry's hand. Looking stunned, Harry walks the length of the hall, uncomfortably aware of unfriendly looks from his fellow students. Snape narrows his eyes as Harry passes him, and Professor McGonagall pats his shoulder reassuringly. Mad-Eye Moody gives him a hard stare, and a pair of iron gates opens in front of Harry. The other three competitors look surprised to see him as Dumbledore bursts into the room, followed by Karkaroff, Snape, Crouch, Moody, Professor McGonagall, and Madame Maxime. Dumbledore grabs Harry, and every eye in the room is focused on him. He swallows nervously as rain pours from the mouth of a gargoyle outside. In a high tower, the Hogwarts professors meet and consult together, and Professor McGonagall looks anxiously at Dumbledore, who puts his wand to his temple. A thread of memory drifts into a bowl, and a parchment with Harry's name surfaces. Later, Harry sits on his bed while Ron hangs a wet towel beside the stove, climbs into his four-poster bed, and turns his back. Harry scrambles into bed, takes off his glasses, and pulls up the covers as Ron looks across at him. Ron lies awake, his face buried in his pillow. The competitors pose for a photo, and she looks at Harry. In a tiny room, a green quill hovers over a notebook as Rita pushes Harry inside. The quill writes while she winks at him, and Harry gestures to the quill. A small black owl swoops over Hogwarts School, heading towards a tall, isolated tower. Harry is waiting in the owlery as the black owl flies in through the window. He takes the note from its beak, unfolds it eagerly, and reads, then sucks his pecked finger. On Saturday night, he hurries down into the Gryffindor common room.",
    "993": "At night, a green light pulses through a mist at the edge of a body of water as snowflakes drift through the dark sky, beyond which stands a stately Victorian building. Inside, the narrator, Nick Carraway, is with a doctor who sits, listening, while Nick sits with his head resting on his hands. Nick goes to a window, paces around the room, and his handsome face is set in a haggard, weary frown. The streets of New York are crowded with people, with frantic traders on Wall Street, money piling up, dancing girls, and illicit booze being bottled, as a red biplane does a corkscrew dive above a skyscraper. A younger, fresh-faced Nick looks up from the busy street, smiling. At work, Nick is on the phone, and a girl beckons from the beach towards a spectacular mansion with an ornate garden where men play polo on the lawn. In his trophy room, Tom hurls a football at Nick and charges at him, barging him through double doors. Nick looks around and finds himself in a large salon with several pairs of doors open as long white drapes billow across the room in the breeze, beneath an ornate crystal chandelier. A young woman cavorts on a couch, and as the servants close the doors, the beautiful blonde-haired young woman rises on the couch and pulls him over it. Another young woman, a brunette, sits with her, and Nick turns to Daisy as Tom glowers at her. The butler, Henri, gestures towards the doors, which are all opened by servants, as the drapes billow into the room. Later, dinner is served at a long table on the terrace, and at the sound of a telephone, Daisy's smile fades as her eyes dart nervously. Handsome, debonair Tom goes into the salon with Daisy going after him. Nick smiles at Jordan as Henri opens the doors, and Daisy and Tom return, with Daisy closing her eyes despairingly as they stop by rose bushes. She glances round at Tom, watching from the open doors of the salon, looking tearful, and then gazes wistfully into the distance, beyond the lavish gardens, past the green beacon and across the Bay of Consequence, towards West Egg and Gatsby's mansion. In the dark, a man walks towards the end of a long, narrow, raised dock which juts out into the bay. Nick drives along a tree-lined lane, parks his car in front of his cottage, and gets out, looking over at the dock. Nick walks closer and sees the suited man standing at the end of the dock by railings, watching as the man slowly raises his right hand. Way off in the distance, across the water, the bright green beacon pulses. In the sanitarium, Nick stands at the window, tapping the frosted glass, as outside, snow continues to fall.",
    "347": "Reluctantly, Pippin hands the palantir to Gandalf, who immediately smothers it in his cloak, and looks back at Pippin troubled. A group of riders gallop towards the Rohan city of Edoras. Eowyn stands alone outside the Golden Hall, waiting. Inside, a roaring fire, a lamb roasting on a spit, long tables laden with food, and barrels of wine make a banquet ready for the returning soldiers. Amidst the cheering crowd, Eowyn moves towards Aragorn with a chalice, and their eyes meet. Eowyn looks at her uncle as Theoden follows her gaze and watches concerned as her uncle moves away, disturbed by his tone. Merry and Pippin are in full voice, on top of one of the tables, holding very large mugs of ale in their hands, while Gandalf laughs and claps at the hobbits. Aragorn steps up beside Gandalf, smiling at the floorshow, and Gandalf turns quickly to Aragorn, watching his friend's face, seeking reassurance. Frodo and Sam lie asleep amidst scrubby bushes near a stagnant pool, with Smeagol nearby, muttering in his sleep. Smeagol wakes suddenly, shaking, his face drenched in sweat, eyes wide in horror, as his features transform into the malevolent face of Gollum. Smeagol glances over his shoulder at the sleeping Frodo and Sam as he clambers off his rock, silently sidling towards the edge of a stagnant pool. He stares into the murky depths of the water, where the surface ripples as the face of Gollum appears as Smeagol's. Smeagol is seen choking Deagol, with fingers locked tight around his throat as his eyes flicker open. Sam's image is mirrored in the water as he smacks Gollum on the head with his pot, drops the pot, and flings himself on top of Gollum, who screams and flails wildly. Frodo staggers over to Sam and pulls him off Gollum, who is huddled on the ground sobbing, as Sam makes for Smeagol again with a look of murderous rage. Frodo grabs Sam's arm, but Sam pulls away and stares at Frodo at a loss, his face softening. Frodo beckons to Gollum, who turns slowly, staring at Sam through hooded, hate-filled eyes, and smiles. Aragorn joins Legolas on the steps to the Golden Hall, oblivious to the chill wind as they look out across the sleeping city to the looming mountain range beyond, with dark clouds marking the sky. Legolas looks at Aragorn with realization on his face. He is awake, sits up anxious, hops out of bed, and creeps towards the sleeping form of Gandalf. Pippin gasps with fright as Merry sits up, wiping sleep from his eyes, and moves on. A sleeping Gandalf lies with eyes wide open, but Pippin is undeterred.",
    "1191": "Harry jumps up onto the bed, and the book scurries underneath in a flurry of torn paper. Harry lies down and peers under the bed, watching the book, which lies still, then snaps once more and slithers out, turning this way and that before it slides back under the bed. Harry quickly unties his shoelace and dangles his shoe over the edge of the bed, dropping his shoe onto the floor, prompting the book to hurtle out, snapping its covers, as Harry jumps onto the book with both feet. In the corridor, a maid knocks at the room next door, and Harry goes downstairs. A ginger cat chases a rat down the corridor, passing a wanted poster for Sirius Black. On the Hogwarts Express, Mrs. Weasley passes Ron his rat, and a man is asleep in a compartment. Harry slides the door closed as steam billows from the funnel while the Hogwarts Express travels through the rain beside the edge of a vast lake. Harry peers along the corridor, and the door slides shut as the lights go out. Ron stares out the window into the rain as the Express stops on a viaduct, and one by one, the carriages go dark. The train lurches again, and the air turns so cold that they can see their breath. Ron pulls his hand away from the window as frost spreads across the glass, and ice forms in Professor Lupin's bottle of water while he remains asleep in the corner, wrapped in his cloak. The train lurches again, and Hermione shivers. Something appears out in the corridor, floating towards the door, something black, shapeless, and mysterious. It reaches out as the door slides open, revealing a horrible hand with long fingers like crooked, dead twigs reaching into the compartment. A hooded black shape looms in the doorway, as Hermione's cat spits and Ron's rat, Scabbers, hides under his coat. The hideous cloaked figure floats into the compartment and faces Harry, who stares helplessly at the terrifying creature that seems to draw the energy out of him, making his body go stiff. Professor Lupin throws off his cloak and points his wand at the threatening figure, which, in a flash of light, hurtles backwards and disappears. Harry loses consciousness and then opens his eyes, finding himself lying on the seat. Hermione hands him his glasses, which he puts on, and looking confused, he takes a piece of chocolate from Professor Lupin. He gets up, turns, and smiles as Ron and Hermione stare at him. Harry looks at the rain teeming down outside the window and stares at his own worried face reflected in the glass. Horseless carriages take the students up to Hogwarts Castle, where they assemble in the Great Hall for the welcoming feast, sitting at long tables with lighted candles hanging above their heads as they listen to the choir.",
    "886": "His eyes linger on her for a long moment as she talks to Charlotte, but when he realizes they're discussing him, he turns away. Resplendent in her green silk gown and fashionable feather hat, Miss Bingley tolerates the dancing, wheeling in and out with a haughty air, while Lizzie is up with Bingley, having a much better time. Miss Bingley and Mrs. Hurst watch the moment with disgust, slumped in a chair, as a sozzled Mr. Hurst taps his glass, demanding a refill. Mrs. Bennet gleefully watches Jane and Bingley dance together, but Darcy is not so pleased. They hurry to greet her at the party where Mary plays the piano, and several men in red and gold brocade uniforms of their regiment mill amongst the party-goers, while Lydia and Kitty are surrounded by officers. Darcy watches proceedings with his customary aloof air as Lizzie, on the opposite side of the room, catches his brooding stare and is momentarily affected before composing herself and turning to Colonel Forster. The Bingley sisters share a look. Lydia grabs a young boy and girl by the hand and leads them onto the floor, joined by several officers. Lizzie turns and looks at the intimate pair, and Mr. Darcy, aware of them looking at him, glowers. Lydia dances playfully as Lizzie makes her way across the room, under Darcy’s watchful gaze, until Miss Bingley sidles up to him, looking decidedly put out. As she backs away, his gaze remains on Lizzie. Now in the Bennets' dining room, Mr. Bennet raises his eyebrows before the scene shifts to Jane riding Nellie through a rainstorm, soaked through, while at home, Lizzie looks with concern at the storm outside and gives her mother a reproachful look. Jane makes slow progress before sitting in an ornate dining room, eating dinner with Bingley's sisters, where Miss Bingley gives her a patronizing smile as Jane closes her eyes, looking faint. Now, the Bennets eat breakfast, and Lizzie, Lydia, and Kitty walk arm-in-arm through Meryton, as Lydia looks around distractedly and they scurry away together. Lizzie, walking through a field holding her bonnet, climbs over a stile, the hem of her pale dress caked in mud, and lands in a quagmire, with her boots filthy. She gives a good-natured shrug and carries on towards Netherfield Hall, standing proudly in the distance, then walks under the shadow of a tree, startled when Darcy emerges around a corner, equally startled. She curtsies, becomes a little embarrassed, while he disguises a look of amusement, stepping aside for her to pass and following her as she strides towards the Hall.",
    "4": "He passes her the joint, then takes the Digicam and focuses it on her. We see her image on the TV as he videotapes. Jane looks into the camera, a loopy, stoned grin on her face. They laugh. She lays back on the bed. Her mind wanders for a beat. Jane looks at him and sits up. She smiles dreamily at him. He turns the Digicam off, and the TV screen goes blue. He lowers the camera and looks at her intently. He puts the Digicam down and joins Jane on the bed. A long moment where neither of them speaks. He caresses her hair, gazing into her eyes. We're flying above Robin Hood Trail. We see the Burnham's house below us as we approach it steadily. We're almost on top of the Burnham house now, as Lester, wearing sweatpants and running shoes, bursts out of the front door and dashes up the driveway. We're now at street level, as Lester runs toward us. He's in excellent shape; even his posture has changed, and he moves with the confident, easy swagger of an athlete. The endorphins have kicked in, and Lester grins, reveling in the sheer physical pleasure of his body. The blender grinds as Lester, still in his sweatpants, makes himself a high-protein shake. Jane watches him blankly from the kitchen table. Carolyn enters. Lester leans against the counter, drinking his shake directly from the blender pitcher, eyeing her. He's got a newfound sexual energy that makes her uncomfortable, and he knows it. Carolyn quickly rinses off her coffee cup, avoiding his eyes, and starts out. Jane looks at Lester to see how he reacts. And she's gone. Jane continues staring at her father. Finally, he glances over at her. Jane is stunned. She quickly rises, trying to get out of the kitchen before she starts crying. Angle on Lester, and the immediate regret in his eyes. We're outside Ricky's room, moving slowly toward the open door, through which we can see Ricky, standing at his bureau mirror, combing his hair. The scars on his face are almost gone now. A reverse angle reveals the Colonel standing outside the door looking in, watching Ricky with great tenderness. Then Ricky looks up at him, and the Colonel is suddenly self-conscious. Ricky emerges from the house, followed by the Colonel, who watches his son as he heads toward the Burnham house. Carolyn waves from the Mercedes, flashing an insincere smile. Jane leans forward from the passenger seat and glares at us. As Ricky starts to get in the car, Lester emerges from the house in his sweatpants. The Colonel watches, at first baffled, then impatient. Close on the Colonel's face: he looks confused.",
    "166": "The magazine Indian Opinion is printed, and stacks of it are lying around, while Albert West, a short Westerner, runs the simple printing press powered by a crude generator with the help of a small staff consisting of a Sikh, a Muslim, a couple of Hindus, and two young boys. Gandhi and Walker approach the tent from the river, with Gandhi discoursing earnestly, and upon reaching the entrance, he gestures in. Gandhi directs his remarks toward Charlie Andrews, who is sitting near them at a cluttered table, typing on an old typewriter. Charlie waves, and Gandhi shouts out to everyone over the noise of the generator, and they nod, with one of the Hindus bowing with hands clasped together. Gandhi hands Walker a copy of Indian Opinion, and they start across the relatively barren field toward other tents, with Walker glancing at the paper as Gandhi watches him, grinning. This interaction carries a weight and apprehension unusual for the rest of their conversation, and Walker views Gandhi with a little surprise as Gandhi seems caught by an ineluctable fact. Despite his reluctance, it conveys commitment, which Walker senses. They come to a site where a building is being erected, and a European, Kallenbach, is perched above a doorway on the half-completed structure, assessing its level with some Indians working below him. Gandhi turns to Kallenbach light-heartedly; Walker waves his notebook, and Kallenbach lifts his level in greeting, displaying a Star of David on his bronzed chest, while Walker looks around, grinning and shaking his head. Two women in saris are cleaning the toilet. Walker looks at him appraisingly, and after a moment of embarrassed doubt, he heads toward a half-finished building with wooden sides and a door but a canvas-covered roof, with an awning spread before it. Walker’s carriage is tethered nearby, with a Black driver standing in the sun waiting. In the background, two women are seen cleaning a latrine, and Walker glances at it as Ba looks at him coldly before turning back and walking into the building through the rear entrance. Gandhi, disconcerted by her attitude, tries to answer Walker with a forced grin. When a girl named Sora emerges from the building with another cup and place setting, Gandhi calls to the driver and enters the building, determined to find the cause of Ba's aloofness. Inside, Ba sits sullenly on a carpet near the rear entrance, and Gandhi, irritated like a husband, stands in front of her. The situation is hushed, with a sense of awareness that Walker might overhear them, yet it is brimming with suppressed anger as Ba looks at Gandhi with hostility.",
    "957": "Joe and Alice are in his bedroom, and he frantically tries to tidy up, quickly hiding an essay with a C minus grade. Looking embarrassed, he picks up a model train carriage, and Alice, in her zombie makeup, suddenly looks up at Joe, who smiles. Charles comes in as Deputy Tally shows Jack a map, and Deputy Rosko pauses to tune in his radio. The Air Force is searching the house the kids are filming in front of when Jack drives up, and the kids watch uncertainly as Jack takes the camera. Jack puts Joe in the back of his patrol car and goes over to talk to Colonel Nelec, whose expression hardens. Jack steps back over to the Colonel, and sitting in the patrol car, Joe watches as the two men shake hands. Later, Joe and Jack return home, where Joe, with tears in his eyes, glares at his father, and Jack glares back, struggling to contain his emotions. Jack turns away and marches out of the house, leaving Joe looking bleak. A tear rolls down Joe's cheek, and he wipes it away with his hand. At dusk, Joe cycles up a steep hill and enters the gates of a cemetery at the top, cycling on between the headstones. Joe sits silently staring into the distance, looking down at his mother's locket, which he holds in his hand. Hearing a noise, he looks up, gets to his feet, and takes a torch from his rock sack, shining it on a building nearby. Looking through a window, he can see earth being tossed about inside the building and, spooked, he runs off. Jack drives his patrol car through the gates of Lilian Air Field, where inside the compound, his car is immediately surrounded by heavily armed soldiers. Nelec sits at Woodward's bedside, and with his face lacerated from the train crash, Woodward glares stonily back at the Colonel from his hospital bed. Nelec leans in closer to him, then gives him a hard stare and walks away from the bedside as his aide, Overmyer, injects toxin into Woodward's drip, and he begins to convulse. Overmyer watches this passionately as Woodward dies, while the Colonel stands with his back to the bed and waits for it to go quiet. Back at home, Joe is awakened in the middle of the night by a knocking at his window, and he gets up, opening the window to Alice, who climbs in. He takes her hand to help her down off the desk and tries the light. A Cinay projector starts up, and Alice moves forward to watch the film, which shows footage of Joe as a baby with his mother, where he sucks on her locket as she holds him.",
    "263": "The rumble builds louder and louder until it is snapped off by a click. The front door handle clicks open, and Smalls stands in the doorway of the abandoned trailer, which is perfectly quiet. The room is a complete shambles from the fight, as sunlight filters in between the slats of the venetian blinds. Smoke from Lenny Smalls' cheroot ripples up through the light. After a momentary pause at the door to take in the scene, Smalls goes directly to a specific spot in the debris and nudges some of it aside with his toe, exposing a piece of paper. He bends down to pick it up but suddenly freezes with a soft grunt of surprise as he stands up with the piece of paper. It is Gale's picture of the Farmers and Mechanics Bank, baking in the noonday sun. Sitting in the front seat of their idling car, looking at the bank, Gale and Evelle look at each other. Gale reaches for his door, and as Gale and Evelle bang in through the door, Evelle holds a shotgun, and Gale holds a shotgun in one hand and Nathan Jr. in his car seat in the other. Everyone freezes, staring at Gale and Evelle. An old hayseed with his hands in the air speaks up, and there is a murmur of acknowledgment from all the people on the ground. Gale is tossing Evelle a sack and is looking in shock at the tellers' counter when a muffled voice from offscreen is heard. Evelle is momentarily abashed but then brightens as Gale registers understanding. Again, there is a murmur of acknowledgment from all the people on the ground. The camera is locked down on the roof of the rocketing squad car, looking past its flashing gumballs as the car approaches the townlet, its siren wailing. A teller is finishing stuffing the last of two burlap bags, and close on her hands, we see her putting in a cash packet that is really only a few bills and a sleeve surrounding and hiding a small plastic device. The teller hits a button on the device and it starts ticking; she shoves it into the sack. He is grabbing the two sacks and tosses one to Gale, who also picks up the baby as the two are backing toward the door. They bolt out the door, and the siren jumps in loud at the cut. It is the same locked-down shot over the gumballs as they peel out from in front of the bank. Gale is driving, and Evelle starts pawing through one of the sacks when a thought registers with Gale and Evelle at the same moment. They look at each other, and they both twist frantically to look in the back seat. Bellowing, KA-POP! With a loud flat crack, something detonates in the front seat, and the interior of the car is spattered with bright blue paint.",
    "1252": "The car drives off down the chic Parisian street, and Andy stares out of the window with a melancholy expression on her face, not looking at Miranda who sits beside her. In a flashback, Irv is seen looking at the list. Andy turns and looks at Miranda, frowns, shakes her head, then turns and looks out of the window. The two women stare at one another before Miranda puts on a pair of large sunglasses, smiles at Andy, and steps out of the car. A swarm of photographers are waiting hungrily outside the entrance of a grand building. Andy gets out of the car and watches Miranda as she makes her way through the throng. Andy ponders for a moment, then turns and walks off in the opposite direction. Expecting Andy to be behind her, Miranda turns back to address her, looks around in confusion, then sees her young assistant striding off across the road. Looking slightly perturbed, Miranda carries on inside. Andy walks towards an ornate green and gold fountain and throws her phone into it. With a smile on her face, Andy strolls off along the Place de la Concorde as the Eiffel Tower is just visible in the distance. The scene shifts to New York City, where the Manhattan and Brooklyn suspension bridges stretch across the East River through the endless sprawl of buildings. A casually-dressed Andy is sitting in a coffee shop reading a newspaper when she looks up as Nate walks in and sits down in front of her. Andy stares down for a moment, then looks at Nate earnestly, while Nate gazes into Andy's sad eyes with a smile flickering across his lips. He leans back in his seat, nods, and Andy looks down wistfully before smiling. Nate shrugs, and Andy looks up at him, with Nate beaming at her. Andy smiles back, then looks down coyly, then gapes. As she walks down a set of steps leading to the pavement, a smile spreads across her face. Dressed in smart jeans, a black polo neck, and a brown jacket, and still wearing a large grin, Andy walks down a busy street, takes a mobile phone from her bag, and begins to dial. Emily gapes in surprise, then composes herself, hangs up looking genuinely touched, and allows herself a brief smile before looking over at Andy's replacement. Out on the street, Andy's smile fades as she sees Miranda leaving the building. Miranda finishes talking on her mobile as a silver Mercedes pulls up. As Miranda, wearing large Jackie O-style sunglasses, makes to get into the car, she suddenly spots Andy standing across the street. The two women regard each other for a moment, then Andy smiles and raises her hand in a wave.",
    "929": "As Bond walks calmly down the corridor, Greene and his party are hurrying for an exit, and they come face to face. On stage, guns are drawn, and the hero is shot as men chase Bond. He runs through a crowded restaurant, and shots are fired, taking down a bystander. Bond waits in ambush, and a pursuer engages in a gun battle in the restaurant. Bond escapes into the kitchen area, where a man body checks him, but Bond shoots him pointblank through the body. He ducks as a door flies open in front of him and tips over a pan of oil, which bursts into flames, allowing him to get past the gunman as the hero dies bloodily on stage. He marches the man away with a gun at his neck, holding him at the edge of a roof. Greene gets in his car, and Bond's prisoner tries to break free, but Bond sends him off the roof, and he lands on Greene's car. Bond straightens his tuxedo as the grim driver gets out and finishes him. In London, an operator is looking at Bond's photos, and M stares at her screen, registering surprise. He walks pensively away from the desk, then goes back, grins, and walks off. Bond is in the back of a powerboat flying an Italian flag at the stern, heading towards a promontory topped by a grand villa overlooking the turquoise blue sea. Bond approaches a stout wooden door, but she can't walk off, so he drops photos on the table and helps himself to white wine. Bond grins as Mathis looks up at his glamorous younger woman, and Bond drains a glass. In a bar on a plane, he looks at a picture of the dead Vespa, picks up a necklace from the bar, and sips a martini. Mathis joins him, and Bond slips the photo into his pocket as they study one another. Bond stays at the bar, and then he and Mathis move through immigration where a redhead in a raincoat stands waiting. They get in a taxi which drives through the busy downtown traffic and gets down from the taxi as Fields strides into a rundown hotel. Bond heads back to the taxi and she obeys, tight-lipped. The statue of an eagle spreads its wings beneath a blue sky dusted with clouds as they are still bickering and are led through the airy tile and marble halls. Bond casually tosses the keys on a sofa and strides through the spacious, modern furnishings eyed by Fields. She stands looking lost while he casts a critical eye over the bedroom and marble en-suite bathroom. He takes off his jacket, walks into the bathroom, Fields grins, and goes to the bedroom. Bond answers the door naked.",
    "714": "He and Rose run through swinging doors into a white corridor, then stop. Lovejoy runs up to the elevator, then scans the area around himself, and peers in a door's round window. Rose rushes down the corridor. They turn a corner and stop at a closed door. Jack opens a different door. They step inside as Lovejoy turns the corner and tries to open the door. Inside, Rose holds her hands to her ears. Jack peers down a ladder at rising smoke. In the boiler room, men shovel coal into the furnaces. Near them, Jack helps Rose down the ladder. Jack and Rose run through the smoky boiler room, past men shoveling coal, as one man turns to watch them run past. Rose and Jack run through drifting smoke until a metal door opens. Jack and Rose step through it and into the cargo hold. They look around themselves as they walk past crates and stacks of boxes. Leading Rose by the hand, Jack hurries around a stack of crates, then stops at a gleaming black car. He lets go of Rose's hand, then peers inside the car. Jack steps around Rose to the passenger door, holds out his hand, and opens the door. Rose takes his hand and steps up into the passenger compartment. Jack shuts the door. As Rose glances around herself, Jack steps into the open-sided driver's seat. Rose pulls down a glass partition, reaches over Jack's shoulders, then pulls him into the passenger compartment. Sitting on the seat, Jack puts his arm around Rose. They gaze into each other's eyes as they interlock their fingers. Rose lays her head on Jack's shoulder, then kisses his fingertips. She places Jack's hand on her breast, and they kiss. The Titanic leaves a long wake in the dark ocean. In a metal crow's nest attached to a mast, Murdoch, with his collar up, peers over the railing outside the wheelhouse. In the backseat of the car, Rose slaps her hand against the back window, then slowly slides it downward. Naked and his face dripping with sweat, Jack lies on top of Rose. He breathes heavily as they gaze at each other and kiss. Rose strokes Jack's hair, then kisses his forehead. He lays his head on her chest. Two stewards with flashlights step down a short corridor and into the cargo hold. Cal opens the safe, pulls out a note and Jack's portfolio, as Lovejoy approaches. Cal opens the portfolio and studies the drawing of Rose, reads the note, and his forehead tenses as he closes, then opens his eyes, glancing at the note again. In the hold, the two stewards creep toward the car, and one steward shines his flashlight in the car's steamed-up windows.",
    "125": "She leads him towards the door, and on the way, he picks up his hat. In the background, Dietrichson begins to ascend the stairs, carrying his coat and glass. Phyllis and Neff move close to the door, and Phyllis opens the door a crack. Both look at the stairs, where Dietrichson is going up. Phyllis takes her hand off the doorknob and holds on to Neff's arm. They look at each other, and the look is like a long kiss. Then, Neff goes out with a briefcase under his arm and comes down the steps to the street, where his Dodge coupe is parked at the curb. He opens the door and stops, looking in. Sitting there in the dark corner of the car, away from the steering wheel, is Lola, who wears a coat but no hat. Lola gives him a sly smile, and Neff is a little annoyed. Neff gets into the car, puts the briefcase on the ledge behind the driver's seat, closes the door, and starts the car. They drift down the hill, and Neff looks at Lola curiously, while Lola meets his glance. Neff brings the car to a stop by the curb, turns around, and looks towards the car. Zachetti walks towards the car, and Lola has opened the door. Zachetti comes up, and Lola steps out of the car, catching up with Zachetti, and they walk away together. Slowly, Neff puts the car in gear and drives on, his face tight. Behind his head, light catches the metal of the zipper on the briefcase. There is a fair amount of activity, but the place is not crowded. Neff comes along the sidewalk into the shot, passing in front of the fruit and vegetable display and going between the stalls into the market. He stops by the cashier's desk and buys a pack of cigarettes. As he is opening the pack, he looks back casually beyond the turnstile into the rear part of the market, where the shelves are loaded with canned goods and other merchandise, and customers move around selecting articles and putting them in their baskets. Phyllis is seen among them, standing by the soap section, with her basket partly filled. She wears a simple house dress, no hat, and has a large envelope pocketbook under her arm. Phyllis is putting a can of cleaning powder into her basket. Neff enters the shot and moves along the shelves towards her, very slowly, pretending to inspect the goods. A customer passes and goes on out of the scene. Phyllis and Neff are now very close, and during the ensuing low-spoken dialogue, they continue to face the shelves, not looking at each other. She hesitates, then opens it, and Neff looks around quickly, slips the policy out of his pocket, and drops it into her bag.",
    "829": "She turns to face the camera and undoes the ties on her dressing gown. She takes a deep breath and drops the gown to the floor. She does a big, cheesy grin as the camera takes a picture, then frowns and shakes her head. She sets up the camera again and tries a variety of poses, attempting to be sexy. She rips a cute kitten poster off the wall. She prints out one of the photos, puts it in an envelope, and writes Cal’s name on the envelope. She stops decorating the envelope. She opens the front door to find a bunch of lilies. Jessica picks up the bunch of flowers and reads the note. She shakes her head and stares out into the night. Cal is doing guerrilla gardening again. Cal puts the tools back in the shed. From in the house, Cal turns towards the house. He watches as Molly and Robbie hurry to the table. Emily traipses through the house to another room. She picks up a phone and dials. In the garden, Cal takes his phone out. Cal eyes Emily nervously. Cal watches Emily, who is not in the basement at all. Emily smiles. Cal's eyes are full of tenderness. Emily hangs up and looks down sadly. Cal hangs up, still watching her from the garden. Emily heads back to the kids. The wheels of a trolley rotate on a shiny floor. Cal is in a DIY store with Robbie and Molly. Cal picks up a wooden trellis. Jacob is in a wine shop. Jacob turns to Hannah. He pinches her nose, then kisses her. They head off. In Jessica's bedroom, her mom, Claire, is putting away clean laundry. As she puts something in her drawer, she spots the envelope. She takes it out to see Cal's name written on it in big letters. She opens the envelope and partially pulls out the photo from inside. She gasps, horrified. Emily drives her SUV along her leafy, suburban street and turns into her driveway. Robbie is standing in the front garden. Her brow furrowed, Emily stares at him. He waves. Her brow furrowed, Emily stares at him. Claire comes down the stairs in a state of shock. Bernie is sitting on the couch, watching TV. Bernie takes a swig of Coca-Cola. Claire grabs Bernie's shoulder from behind the couch and hands him the envelope. Bernie gives Claire a little frown and turns back to the TV. Absentmindedly, he opens the envelope and glances down at the photo. He freezes. There are several photos in there. He goes through them. His jaw goes slack. Jessica, who is lying on the floor nearby, spots the envelope. Bernie races her from the couch to the door.",
    "233": "Michal carries a bag of provisions and puts them on a table while Szpilman goes immediately to the window and looks out. There are views of the city, but in the street below, opposite, is a hospital and, on the corner, a building flying a Nazi flag and guarded by a sentry, standing at his sentry-box. Michal comes up behind Szpilman, makes for the door, nods, and goes. The sound of the padlock closing. Szpilman takes in the room, sees the piano, is still for a moment, then goes to it. He sits on the piano stool, adjusts its height, opens the lid, removes a cloth covering the keys, gazes lovingly at the keyboard, and flexes his fingers. Then, without touching the keys, his fingers floating just above them, he plays passionately. Snow falling. Szpilman alert, hearing the padlock being unlocked and then opened. The door opens and Michal enters, accompanied by a man, aged about thirty, Szalas, confident, a little brash. In whispers, Szalas and Szpilman shake hands. Szalas produces a quarter bottle of vodka, thumps the back of the bottle so that the cork flies out. He finds glasses and pours, gives the others their vodka. Szalas shrugs, finds the vodka, pours two glasses, unwraps the package to reveal sausage and bread, takes a bite of sausage, chewing deliberately, slowly. Szalas goes to the window, looks out. Szpilman thinks for a moment, then takes off his wristwatch, hands it to Szalas. Szalas pockets the watch, makes for the door, stops, grins, downs Szpilman's vodka, gives a mock salute and goes. The padlock is locked on the other side. Sunshine floods in through the windows. Szpilman lies inert on the bed, weak, starving, ill. The sound of the padlock. Dorota, no longer pregnant, and Michal enter, come to the bed. In whispers, Szpilman barely has strength to open his eyes and focus on them. He mutters incoherently. She starts for the door, and he leaves. The padlock sound. Dorota goes to the kitchen, wets a towel, comes back to the bed, kneels it, places the towel on Szpilman's brow. He focuses on her, smiles, then suddenly winces with pain. She looks at him, barely audible. The Doctor and Michal leave his line of vision. Szpilman looking down from the fourth-floor window. Peaceful. A few pedestrians. An everyday atmosphere. At the far end, at the T-junction with a main road, a tram rumbles down the street and comes to a halt, disgorging passengers on the far side and so out of sight. The tram continues on its way, now revealing the few passengers who alighted—women, an old man with a stick.",
    "560": "A limo is parked beside a private airliner that bears the Donovan corporate logo. Brody peers inside to Donovan and Indy, who opens the Grail Diary and thoughtfully turns through the pages. Their journey is SUPERIMPOSED over a map tracing a course from New York City to Venice, Italy. Indy and Brody disembark from the Water Bus onto the Boat Landing as other gondoliers steer their boats in the water. Suddenly, a woman with attractive features, blonde hair, and bright, intelligent eyes approaches Indy, looking at him with an appraising expression that is brazenly flirtatious. Indy grins, enjoying the repartee. The woman turns to Brody, who tips his hat. She introduces herself as Dr. Elsa Schneider and extends her hand to Brody. Indy's grin fades, and Brody registers a look of surprise. Indy, Brody, and Elsa walk along the narrow canal, lined with buildings on either side. As they cross over a bridge to the opposite side of the canal, Indy steals a flower from a street vendor and holds it out to Elsa. She hands Indy a slip of paper, which he then extends to Brody. Elsa leads them into a large piazza where people walk about and sit at tables in front of a large building, arriving at the front steps of the library. Elsa leads the way inside, and their heels click across the marble floor. Indy and Brody notice that the library contains many stained-glass windows. Elsa indicates four huge marble columns that go from floor to ceiling. Indy glances at the columns, then notices a stained-glass window depicting a Knight of the Crusades, lingering for a moment in front of the window. Once Elsa is out of earshot, Indy quickly whips out the Grail Diary and opens it to the sketch he noticed on the airplane. Brody glances at the Diary and then at the window, noticing that the Roman numerals in question are part of the window's design. Indy's eyes dart across the walls and ceilings, charged with the thrill of discovery as they travel up one of the four huge marble columns. He points to the stained-glass window, discovering that each column is numbered with a Roman numeral. Indy hurries toward Column VII, points again to the stained-glass window, and looks down at the scrap of paper in his hands. He walks past aisles of book-lined shelves, stops, turns, and looks down. He climbs a spiral staircase leading up to a loft, looking down at Brody and Elsa. Indy then rushes down the staircase and goes to the center tile where the two sides of the X intersect.",
    "1374": "Fred you said. They roll around fighting on the floor, and the crowd cheers. The room suddenly becomes silent as Viktor Krum walks in and puts his name in the flame. He looks at Hermione, and she smiles. Dumbledore approaches the blue flame, and it glows red. A name comes out. Everyone looks on anxiously. The Durmstrang crowd cheers. Another name comes out. The Beauxbatons girls cheer as Fleur walks up. Another name comes out. Hogwarts pupils cheer as Cedric takes the stage. People cheer, but the goblet glows red once more, and another name flies out. Dumbledore takes it and reads. Harry slowly walks up. Dumbledore gives him the paper. Harry is in a room with the other champions. Dumbledore bursts in and grabs Harry. Harry is silent. A woman appears in a puff of smoke. She's well-groomed and dressed colorfully. The four Triwizard champions are stood together in a group. She walks over to them and shakes each of their hands. She takes Harry by the hand into a closet. An owl flies in with a letter for Harry; he takes it and begins to read. The owl nips Harry's finger. The fire flares up a little, a face appears in it. Ron enters the room. Ron leaves. Harry goes to the fire again, but Sirius is gone. Neville waves. Hermione and Ron walk up to them. Ron whispers some words to Hermione. It's clear Ron and Harry are not on speaking terms with each other. Hermione walks up to Harry. Harry and Hagrid are walking through a dark forest. Hagrid is looking more dapper than usual and is carrying a big red flower. Madame Maxime calls out to Hagrid. Harry does as he's told. A huge flame fires up. We're zoomed in on a badge; it depicts Cedric on a bright yellow background. As Harry walks along, other pupils aim insults at him, saying he stinks. A young boy runs past. Harry gets to a doorway; two pupils stand in his way. They laugh, and Harry pushes his way through. He approaches Cedric, who is standing around with his friends. Cedric's friends hurl off more insults. Ron and Seamus are walking along. Harry approaches them. Draco calls out, he's sitting up a tree. Harry walks away, and Draco angrily tries casting a spell. Mad-Eye appears and quickly turns Malfoy into a ferret. Mad-Eye is making the ferret hover around. He sends it up the trouser leg of one of Draco's friends. He squirms and looks uncomfortable. Everyone else is laughing. Mad-Eye winks to Harry, and he laughs. Eventually, it comes back out, and McGonagall turns Draco back to normal. Draco runs away. Mad-Eye shouts after him. Mad-Eye takes off his prosthetic leg and takes a seat.",
    "984": "Robert and Caroline stroll through to the back as Daisy goes to the front doors. They gaze at each other, and a smile plays on Benjamin's lips as Daisy frowns. She strides past him to the windowed office, turns to him, and closes the door. Benjamin follows Daisy through a bright corridor to the back entrance, where outside, they share a look. Daisy turns and strolls to Robert's beige SUV, and Benjamin watches as she gets in. Her eyes remain fixed on Benjamin as Robert reverses onto the road, and Benjamin stands beneath a concrete canopy studded with lights, watching as the vehicle drives away. A strong wind buffets the hospital as Caroline returns to the diary. Benjamin opens his hotel room door to Daisy, who lowers her eyes as she steps over the threshold, and he closes the door of room 325. They stand in profile, silhouetted against the low light of his hotel room, and she nods. Daisy reaches out and gently strokes Benjamin's smooth cheek, and he tenderly massages her left shoulder. He draws her closer, and they hold each other tightly. He looks her in the eye and gently slides her coat off her shoulders. A TV set is in the room, and wearing only a bra and knickers, Daisy stands with her back to Benjamin, who's propped up in bed. He watches as she pulls her black leotard on, puts her coat on, and turns to face him. He looks at her with an air of sadness as she strolls to his hotel room door and leans on the windowsill as she walks to a taxi. Daisy gets into a yellow taxi outside her large, white house, and the cab pulls away. Now in her late 60s, Daisy addresses the cab driver as the taxi approaches the stately, white-clapboard edifice of the retirement home. An elderly black man sits at a table in the courtyard, sketching, as wrapped in a shawl, Daisy ambles up nearby and smiles weakly as she looks around. Daisy enters the building via the back door, where Queenie's daughter beckons her into the room. A bearded man with a name tag rises and gives her the diary. Daisy looks down, then turns on hearing a piano. She walks into the communal living area, where a figure is hunched over the keyboard of the piano. David and Queenie's daughter hover as Daisy approaches the figure, who turns and stares vacantly. He's a child of about 12, and she reaches out, but Benjamin recoils. He turns and looks at her, with cropped, sandy hair and acne. Daisy blinks and takes a slow, inward breath as she takes a seat beside him, and he narrows his eyes. She shakes her head, recalling when she was drying his hair with a towel, and little Benjamin stands on the high, gray-slate rooftop.",
    "371": "The man is none other than. The men shake, disbelieving this lucky coincidence. He's genuinely proud. Reaching the front of the line, Norther pulls two pistols out of his coat, firing both into the ceiling. Screams all around. The skinny security guard makes a halfhearted reach for his gun, but Norther waves him off. The guard takes out his gun and slides it over. The teller woman nods. Angle on Edward, not sure what to do. He has a gun, but he truly doesn't want to shoot Norther. The teller woman is already waving him to the back. He decides he better go. The teller woman is crying as she works the combination. Edward feels horrible. She pulls open the vault door. The inner sanctum of the Horizon Savings and Loan holds exactly one folding chair. Edward winces, but doesn't say anything yet. He rips it open, revealing just a little cash inside. Even some dimes and pennies. Caught, Edward has to confess. Edward continues his narration. Norther leans in the driver's side window. Edward looks over at Norther, the reality sinking in. The two men wave at each other as Edward drives off. At the last moment, Norther calls out. Sandra is watering the garden. Will (5) runs past her to greet Edward, just returned from another trip. We reveal the Bloom house, the nicest one in the neighborhood. Bubbles rise from his nose for a few beats, then stop. It's quiet, except for the distant splashing of water from the spigot. Edward's eyes are closed. A long beat. Another. Edward opens one eye. The other eye. He sits up to find sitting on the edge of the tub. He smiles, then pulls his knees up, making room for her in the tub. A beat while she considers. Sandra steps out of her sandals and climbs into the tub, facing him. Her dress is soaked, but she doesn't mind. When they separate, she has tears hanging in her eyes. He wipes them away. Perched awkwardly on a canoe, Will's made it through another file cabinet. He goes through the folders page by page, but usually ends up tossing the whole thing in the trash. He's about to toss a file when he stops. Takes another look. Something doesn't make sense. She hands him five dollars out of her pocket. He's out the door in a flash. While Will sips his iced tea, Jenny flips through a form she never expected to see again. She hands it back to Will. A long beat. Jenny is taken back by the suddenness of it. She's a tangle of conflicting emotions. Fair enough. Jenny takes a seat across from him at the table.",
    "550": "But the horse moves exactly at the wrong moment and Indy lands flat on his feet in a standing position. Indy stands up and successfully mounts his horse. Fedora and his men arrive at the roof's edge in time to see Indy climb into the saddle and gallop off. Fedora puts two fingers in his mouth and whistles, and a vintage truck and automobile come roaring out from behind the Pueblo, driven by two more gang members. The passenger in the car has his face concealed by the hat's wide brim, but his arm is out the window, and we see an olive-colored hand protruding from the sleeve of an expensive white linen suit. Indy spurs his mount on to greater speeds, but the autos not only keep pace with his horse. Indy veers off in a new direction toward a railroad track. The train is barreling down the track. Indy rides up beside it and he leaps from horse to train. He clings to the side of a boxcar as Halfbreed and Rough Rider leap from the truck onto the train. Halfbreed tries to grab Indy, but Indy leaps onto another boxcar. Halfbreed runs after him, but Indy leaps from the boxcar onto some covered boxes stacked on a flatcar. Indy loses his balance but regains it. With Halfbreed and Rough Rider still running after him, Indy enters the trap door of and finds himself crawling on a catwalk suspended from the car's ceiling. Several feet below are numerous vats containing all manner of reptiles: alligators, crocodiles, giant lizards, etc. Then, Halfbreed enters through the trap door, followed by Rough Rider. Halfbreed grabs hold of Indy's feet, but Indy kicks at him and he loses his grasp. Indy crawls away toward an opening on the opposite side. Halfbreed grabs at Indy's feet again; Indy rolls away and we see large bins of squirming snakes. The combined weight of the three people is more than the catwalk was intended for, and the bolts begin to rip from. Several bolts tear free, but it's Indy's end of the catwalk that drops down. He lands hard, with a splash into a vat of water where he finds himself eye-to-eye with an enormous anaconda. The head of this snake is so damn big, it looks more like a Tyrannosaurus Rex. Roscoe appears atop the reptile car and manages to grab Indy. Indy kicks at him. Roscoe grabs onto the side of the reptile car as Indy moves on to. Indy climbs over canvas-covered circus equipment. Roscoe follows, grabbing a long stick with a hook on it. He reaches forward and trips Indy, who falls onto the roof of the rhino boxcar. As a lamp falls from the ceiling with the impact of Indy's fall, hitting a huge black rhinoceros.",
    "1281": "She spots a razor and a shaving brush. He looks at her defiantly. She sighs and, carrying a washing basket, runs downstairs. Red and blue lights flash outside, as she crosses to the front door. A blonde woman in a blue top is standing among the group of police officers. Helen looks shocked. Motorcycle outriders prepare to escort the waiting car. A stern-faced woman with dark hair sits in the front seat. The blonde woman puts her arms protectively around the bemused Jacob. The convoy of two cars and four motorcycles pulls away. Lights flashing, they speed down rain-soaked streets. He points to the road ahead. Beyond the outriders, their side of the highway is empty. She stares at the expressionless agent who stares straight ahead ignoring her. More vehicles join the convoy rolling down the empty nighttime highway. Military vehicles and personnel maneuver as gates open to admit them. A Chinook helicopter stands outside a large hangar. The convoy pulls up at an aircraft. It's loaded rack down. The agent ushers the stunned Helen towards the helicopter. Inside, it's packed with soldiers and some civilians. Helen finds a space and sits down nervously. She looks across at a man with a dark, bushy beard. The twin rotor helicopter lifts off into the dark night sky. Floodlights illuminate a sports field teeming with equipment and personnel. The chopper lands mid-field. A soldier carries a heavy machine gun on his shoulder. As police cars escort more vehicles through the military throng, soldiers push racks of protective clothing along a walkway. A NASA space agency logo adorns the screen in a large lecture theater. It's on a collision course with the Earth. Graphics show impact location Manhattan. Helen stares. The screen shows one hour 18 minutes 43 seconds. The time is counting down. She tentatively opens the toilet cubicle door. She looks nervously at the woman in military uniform and nods. Choppers hurtle towards the bright lights of Manhattan. Helen looks shocked and stares out of the window of the chopper at the city lights. Helen and Yusef hold hands as the scientists brace themselves. Helen opens her eyes. A bright ball of light is moving through the dark sky above the illuminated city. It passes behind the towering Empire State Building. It illuminates the bell gothic façade of Saint Patrick's Cathedral and moves with swirling brilliance towards Central Park. Trees cast eerie shadows across the grass as people gather and stare up in horror. As Helen stares out of the chopper window at the object sinking towards the ground, powerful blasts of energy slow its descent, generating clouds of billowing vapor. The watching crowds are silhouetted in its intense light. The draft from the object's descent causes a tsunami of wind and vapor.",
    "695": "Harry smiles and winks, but a truck briefly blocks Peter's view, and when it passes, Harry has disappeared from the coffee shop. Peter turns and looks around the street, eyes wide, mouth half open. Later, he sits on the bed in his room, hands clasped between his knees, staring ahead with a cold and malevolent expression. Slowly, his eyes swivel to the corner of the room, and he turns his head toward the black trunk on the floor of the closet. Lightning flashes in a dark sky. In his father's study, Harry pours himself a martini and adds a couple of olives. Sensing Peter behind him, he smiles without looking around and sips his drink. Peter, wearing the black suit under his normal clothes, punches Harry. Peter's eyes widen as Harry stabs him in the thigh with a dagger. As they fight, a row of curved blades shoot out from Harry's forearm. Peter hauls him into a pummeled wall, and Harry swings at it, smashing his arm at Peter's head, but the blades get stuck in the pillar behind. Peter slams his fist down on Harry's arm, breaking off the blades. Harry kicks him across the table, and they circle each other. Peter kicks Harry through a glass partition, and Harry wipes blood from his mouth, diving at Peter who hauls him against another window. Peter throws Harry across the room, and Harry picks himself up. They run at each other and crash through into the secret goblin lair. As Peter chases him through the lair, Harry picks up the goblin sword and swings it at him, but Peter dodges the blade. Harry accidentally cuts through the table, tethering the sky stick, sending it spinning out of control. Peter pushes Harry's head up into the path of the sky stick, and Harry is thrown against a wall of glass shelves, crashing to the ground. Peter floors Harry with a final blow and walks away. Harry finds a pumpkin bomb and hurls it after him, but Peter lassos the bomb with a web and hauls it back, exploding in Harry's face. Peter strolls along a street, fastening his shirt collar over the Black Spider-Man suit, and several women passing by give him the eye. At a newsstand, the Daily Bugle photo shows Black Spider-Man robbing a bank. In the Bugle office, Brock is celebrating and hangs up a framed blowup of the front page. Peter comes up behind him and drops a photo on the desk, slamming Brock against the wall. Brock looks around, smiling nervously. Peter hands Robby, the sub-editor, the original print from which Brock faked the bank robbery shot. In Jameson's office, Jameson slaps the photo down. Floppy-haired Peter is in his hallway with Ursula.",
    "446": "At dusk, the electric lights are on when suddenly Don pounds the bar and explodes, leaving the bar silent except for the sizzling noise of the eggs and ham. Nat brings over a plate of ham and eggs, pours a jiggerful, and Don downs it. Nat fills it again, sits down to his ham and eggs, drinks his jiggerful, and taps the glass on the bar. From the street, Gloria enters wearing a shirtwaist and skirt, a foolish little hat, and high-heeled shoes with bows. He pours another drink as a round-faced, middle-aged man with pince-nez enters the bar. With his thumb, Nat indicates Gloria, and the man takes a couple of steps towards the door, then turns with a Guide of New York sticking from his pocket and walks out, bewildered. He downs the jigger of rye, and Nat breaks down and pours a drink. He takes off his hat, shakes the rain from it, peels off his raincoat, and is wearing a bowler and a straight raincoat. A crowd of people streams into the building, doing a land-office business, checking dripping umbrellas and apparel. With a quick gesture, he transfers a bottle to the pocket of his raincoat and rolls the raincoat up like swaddling clothes. In his suit's side pocket is a pint of liquor. Among the crowd is Don Birnam, who hands his coat to an attendant, his eyes lingering on its pocket with a certain tenderness before he turns and starts towards the auditorium door. Seeing an opening in the line at the cloak room counter, he steps into it and sits about five seats from the aisle between an elderly daughter and her age-old mother, and a middle-aged man and wife, glancing through the program as the curtain rises, changing the light on the group. Don looks up, thirst in his eyes, looks away from the stage, and tries to concentrate on the Metropolitan's ceiling, while powdered footmen pour wine into the glasses of the over-vivacious guests. Alfred and Violetta bat the drinking song back and forth as the chorus, glasses in hand, stands swaying, echoing each couplet. Don's imagination works at top speed as the first drops of sweat gather on his forehead, and he takes a handkerchief from his pocket to wipe it. The swaying echelon of choristers slowly dissolves to a row of raincoats like the one Don wore, hanging from hangers and swaying to Verdi's rhythm, as his eyes remain glued to the stage.",
    "1333": "The storm is passing now, blown by the driving wind. The camera rises up to find Javert, the officer in charge of the convict workforce, looking on, his face rain-lashed and expressionless. Behind Javert, through the storm rain, there is a glimpse of a forest of half-built ships, their ribbed frames like great skeletons in the mist. In the foreground, convicts are at work on another ship that is almost completed, laboring in the crashing spray. With a last great heave, the lines of convicts haul the damaged ship onto the slipway. Javert stands above the men on the top of the dock, as lines of convicts labor beneath him on the steep steps of the dock wall. Javert nods to the guards, and they begin to form the chained men into lines to return to their prison. Javert approaches Jean Valjean, seeing him and pointing his stick at Valjean in silent command. Valjean stares back for a moment, defying him, then drops down into the seething water and re-emerges with the great mast in his hands, held over his head. His head breaks water with his bitter gaze still on Javert, as he throws the mast ashore in a deliberate display of strength. Valjean walks away, hardly able to take in that he is free at last. He makes his way up a rising track, a worn knapsack on his back, and strides down the long rising road, pulling his thin coat close around him against the cold winter wind. He comes to a stop at the top of the hill, where he sees, lit by the rising sun, a wide vista of fields and towns and villages stretching into the distance, with the snow-capped Alps beyond. He passes a long line of laborers working and approaches the overseer. Behind and below him lies Toulon at the sea's edge. The overseer notices shaved hair showing under his cap. Bewildered, fearful, and suspicious, Valjean gets up and goes with the Bishop into the house by the church, where there is a simple table on which are laid bread and wine with silver cutlery. The bishop's sister, Madame Baptistine, stands, and two silver candlesticks light the room, illuminating walls painted with religious scenes. Valjean hesitates, and the Bishop looks from the silver to Valjean. The old Bishop holds out the two silver candlesticks, and Valjean, utterly bewildered, takes them. Amazed, Valjean looks up, and silenced by the Bishop's gentle tones, the policemen turn and leave. Valjean takes out his yellow passport and stares at it, then kneels in the church. Slowly, he examines the yellow passport and raises it high, as if to the altar. Valjean stands and turns, walking fast to the door of the church.",
    "826": "David is mowing the grass, wearing jeans and a white T-shirt with a deep V, and he grins back at Emily, who licks her lips salaciously. Cal wakes with a jolt, gets up, and a ball falls from a tree in Emily's garden as Cal falls out of the branches of the tree. He remains stock still and regards the house intently, then waters the flower beds, glances back at the house, and prunes one of the rose bushes. He treads over the lawn with shoes with long metal spikes on the bottom, trims the hedge, treads over the lawn the other way, and sidles across it. A security light comes on, he freezes, and then he makes a run for it. Cal plays catch with Robbie; they both wear baseball gloves, Robbie nods, and Cal raises his brows, squints at Robbie, and lobs the ball at him, who catches it in his glove and beams before throwing it back. Jessica's parents, ex-friend Bernie, and Claire are there as Cal sits on a chair alone in a corridor, his brow furrowed, staring ahead, and glancing to his right as Emily approaches from the other direction. Cal stands as she smiles shyly, and he beams brightly at her. They both take a seat on either side of a door in front of the lockers, shuffle awkwardly in their seats, and both knot and unknit their fingers. Cal looks down at the floor, nods, looks down, shakes his head, and Emily takes a deep breath as Cal smiles serenely before his expression becomes serious. Emily's eyes well with tears as Kate forces a grin, yanks the door angrily, closes her eyes, takes a deep, calming breath, stands, and touches her temple gently. Emily smiles coldly, turns to face Cal, gawks at him, and he raises his brow but looks down. She opens and closes her mouth, nods her head, and Cal shakes his head and stares at his feet, sighs, and a gentle smile creeps across his face as tearfully, Emily smiles. A crowd has gathered, Cal turns to Emily sheepishly, and she glares at him as he hangs his head, shakes it, looks up, and his eyes dart around. Emily walks away, and Cal turns to watch her go as Emily gets into her car and drives off. Bernie and Claire walk away as it starts to rain. Jacob sits alone in his smart, minimalist apartment eating a bowl of cereal and studying the packet, with a large black and white abstract painting hanging behind him. Emily drives through the night, shaking her head in disbelief at the wheel and blinks and sighs heavily as Cal leans against his car outside the school and lets the rain soak him.",
    "838": "Diana helps Sandy up and pushes him aside as the car accelerates. Diana rolls up the windshield and falls to the pavement. Pushing the airbag away, the skiptracer sees a squad car speeding straight at him. As he turns, a car T-bones him. Sandy kneels over Diana. Sandy's face tenses. She startles awake. She punches him in the throat. Sandy flails backward. Sitting up, Diana sees a squad car speed by, then glances behind them. Squad cars surround the skiptracer. An officer hops out with his pistol drawn. The skiptracer sits back, dazed. They arrest him as Sandy and Diana scurry away unseen. They exit the overpass through a construction gate and down a staircase. Now, in a parking lot, Sandy and Diana stagger toward the Chevy Caprice. He looks off as she enters the car. Now, with St. Louis behind them, Sandy cruises along with a joyful grin as Diana sleeps. Later, the sun rises in a pale orange sky. In broad daylight, Sandy drives through rural farmland. He checks the fuel gauge on a country highway. Sandy keeps his tired eyes on the road. Glancing over, he startles as Diana sleeps with her glazed eyes wide open. Sandy gently closes her eyelids and her head falls into his lap. He yanks her up by the hair and Diana's mouth hangs open. Our view quickly rises into the sky, following the sun through a full day. At sunset, they cruise toward the Denver skyline. At night, Sandy parks the beat-up car outside his apartment and enters with Diana. His daughters run into his arms. Sandy's brow rises at his approaching wife. They share a long, loving kiss as Diana enters, her sheepish eyes averted to the floor. She connects eyes with Trish. The young girls extend their hands. Diana shifts her gaze to Sandy, who flashes a grin. Now, the Pattersons eat dinner with Diana. Trish looks at her husband, who glances at their guest and takes a bite. Sitting across from Diana, Sandy's daughters stare warily at her. Diana smears potatoes on her forehead. Jessie plops food onto her forehead with a fork. Later, Trish dries dishes in the kitchen. Diana timidly walks in and puts her hand on the counter. She removes it and straightens. Diana shifts her weight and steps closer. She outlines her groin and chest. Trish awkwardly blinks at her. Diana starts to go, then turns back. She gazes earnestly at Diana. The redhead leaves the kitchen. Watching her go, Trish clutches a plate and drying cloth. Her gaze wanders to the floor. Now, in bed, Sandy lies on his side. He rolls to his right and sidles up next to his wife, who lightly touches his shoulder.",
    "873": "Zoe returns to watching the black-and-white gangster movie on the TV, her eyes darting around as she thinks. Suddenly, she rises resolutely from the sofa, strides out of the open-plan lounge and down the hallway, past the double doors opening onto Kate's desk, ignoring Kate, who remains at her desk. In her room, Zoe sits on her bed with a scarlet-haired smiling rag doll resting on her drawn-up knees, pulls up the doll's striped skirt and red polka dot top, considers the words with downcast eyes, then replaces the doll's clothing, and stares into the doll's face. Wearing a white dressing gown and with damp hair, Kate strides down the hallway and is later outside Zoe's school. They drive around in Nick's blue pickup truck, and Kate holds her hand to her mouth, runs her hand through her hair, moves around to the side of Zoe's bed, catching sight of the cuddly toys on her pillow, considers them briefly, then picks up the furry kangaroo. They drive past leafless trees into the bleak, deserted cemetery, where Zoe returns the hug that Kate has given her. Both crying, Kate kisses Zoe's cheek and gently wipes away her tears before the pair separate. Zoe mouths an acknowledgment, then turns to pick up her red rucksack, and they stand. Kate brushes off her long, black coat and takes Zoe's hand as they walk away from the grave towards Nick, who's been watching from a distance. Amid the faded flowers on the grave is Zoe's peacock feather, fluttering in the breeze. Nick drives Zoe and Kate home, and as he pulls up, Zoe turns to him. Kate and Zoe climb out of the truck, and Kate hands her the keys. Nick offers his hand, which Kate takes, her eyes fixing longingly on him. Nick squeezes her hand, she pulls away, closes the door, and looks at Nick through the window. Kate stands alone in the sunlit street as a truck drives away. In the busy restaurant kitchen, Bernadette reenters, and brandishing an uncooked steak held high on a carving fork, Kate marches out of the kitchen through the dining room and up to table seven. Kate tears off her apron, thrusts it at a waiter, and strides out. Paula stares blankly as Kate hails a cab and gets in. On her therapist's roof terrace overlooking Manhattan, Kate turns and eyes the man with realization. In a shabby elevator, Kate clutches a copper saucepan wrapped in a tea towel, steps out onto a landing lined with a discarded metal trolley and window grill, hesitates, then knocks. Without taking his eyes off Kate, Nick steps back from the door, revealing an open-plan loft apartment beyond.",
    "206": "George comes running into shot as the wind blows as it has all through this sequence. He is frantically looking for Clarence and leans on the bridge railing, praying as he sobs. Suddenly, the wind dies down and a soft, gentle snow begins to fall. A police car pulls up on the roadway behind him, and Bert comes into the scene. George backs away and gets set to hit Bert again but then touches his lips with his tongue, wipes his mouth with his hand, and laughs happily, his rapture knowing no bounds. He practically embraces the astonished Bert and then runs at top speed toward town. George's wrecked car is smashed against a tree. He comes running into shot, sees the car, lets out a triumphant yell, pats the car, and dashes on. He turns and runs through the falling snow up the main street of the town, passing some late shoppers on the street. As he runs, he notices that the town is back in its original appearance. George notices a light in Potter's office window and races across the street, where Potter is seated working at his desk with his goon by his side. George pounds on the window and runs off as Potter looks up from his work. The lights are on, the Christmas tree is fully decorated with presents stacked around, and Carter the bank examiner, a newspaper reporter and photographer, and a sheriff are waiting in the hall for George. George comes dashing in the front door, grabs his hand and shakes it, and the photographer sets off a flash bulb. George runs to the kitchen, gets no answer, and comes running back to the hall where the three children are at the top of the stairs in their pajamas. George starts to run up the stairs, and the old familiar knob on the banister comes off in his hand, which he kisses lovingly before putting it back and continuing up the stairs. George hugs the kids as Zuzu comes running out of her bedroom and he crushes her to him. As Mary comes through the door breathless and excited, the four men are watching with open mouths. Mary races up the stairs, where George meets her in a fierce embrace, and they embrace tearfully. He stops her with a kiss and she leads him excitedly down the stairs. Mary leads George, who is carrying a couple of the kids on his back, to a position in front of the Christmas tree. She runs toward the front door and flings it open as ad lib sounds of an excited crowd can be heard. Uncle Billy, face flushed, covered with snow, and carrying a clothes basket filled with money, bursts in.",
    "763": "David sits up and puts his head on one side quizzically, turns to see the weights on the ends of the bar, and Joseph walks up to him. David twists around to look at the other end of the bar while Joseph watches tensely. Joseph takes several paces back towards an open covered door. On the bench, David grips his hands out wider than his shoulders and takes the weight, drops the bar slowly to his chest, and pushes up until his arms are straight. He lowers the bar again and straightens his arms, while Joseph stares. Finally, David drops the bar back onto the supports. David's hands wrap around the bar slowly feeling for the optimum grip since even more weights have been clamped to the bar this time. David is frowning slightly, and Joseph stands in the cupboard. On his bench, David braces himself and lowers the bar to his chest. Arms quivering, eyes tight shut, face twisted, he presses it up to full extension, repeats the press, and replaces the bar. Above the bar, Joseph's white face appears upside down to David, standing two steps up the staircase. As the bar rises, two big paint cans appear taped to it next to the weights. David drops the bar back in its supports, his left arm flops to the floor, but with his right still gripping the bar, he holds himself upright. Joseph comes down the stairs and walks slowly over to David, who twists around to inspect the weights and the paint cans at either end of the bar. David's brow furrows, and Joseph gazes at him in awe. Elijah is lying in a hospital bed and nods almost imperceptibly. Inside, Audrey is sorting through papers on a reception desk as a nurse approaches her and points across the room. Audrey hands the nurse a yellow file, takes another one from her, and walks across the open-plan office. She leans through a doorway and smiles, sitting on a low couch in a treatment room. She looks up at Elijah, who's watching her from his wheelchair, and a metal frame keeps his right leg straight. The street outside the stadium is empty, and inside, along one of the shaded walkways, David, in his security uniform, leans on a wall, casually watching spectators as they crowd in through a gate. He looks away, stares at the ground, and after a moment, pushes himself off the wall, moves to the center of the walkway with his head down and hands in his pockets. The crowd streams past him, laughing and smiling. They jostle and bump him, some almost pushing him aside, but he doesn't react. A large woman in a pink coat, with blonde hair hanging over her shoulders, dragging a small boy by the hand, bangs into him.",
    "736": "Rose leans forward and spits while her mother and her friends stroll nearby. As Ruth steps up, Rose taps Jack's arm, prompting him to turn around and swallow. Rose steps towards her mother, then glances at Jack, and Molly, smiling at Jack, points to her own chin. Jack quickly wipes saliva off his own chin and waves as Rose and her mother walk off. Jack lifts his hands and shrugs. Elsewhere, Molly helps Jack into a black tuxedo jacket, and they gaze into a full-length mirror. At dusk, the Titanic trails black smoke from its four smoke stacks as it sails toward the setting sun. Later, a steward opens a door for Jack, who is wearing a white tie and shirt, and he smiles at the steward as he steps inside. He pauses, then walks toward an ornate railing and columns beneath the dome skylight. Jack steps to the railing and gazes down at a couple descending the ship's grand staircase, then glances up at the skylight and walks down the staircase to the landing where he studies a wall clock with an elaborately carved wooden casing. Jack descends past a winged statue, observing couples in formal evening wear strolling or chatting. He leans against a column, then notices a bearded man standing erect with his left arm behind his back. Jack stands up straight and places his own arm behind his back, nodding to the man as he and a woman stroll past. Jack watches the couple, then gazes up the staircase as Cal and Ruth descend toward him, with Cal eyeing Jack as they step past him. From the staircase's landing, Rose gazes down at Jack, who pretends to shake somebody's hand, practicing to be a gentleman. Jack turns and looks up at Rose, who is wearing a floor-length black lace dress. She smiles and descends the stairs toward him. Rose stops a few steps above Jack, who takes her white gloved hand and kisses it, then holds out his bent right arm for Rose, who takes it. She smiles as he tilts back his chin, nose in the air, and arm-in-arm, they stroll up to Cal. Cal and Ruth step arm-in-arm toward the reception room, with Rose smiling at Jack as they follow. Later, Rose and Jack descend another wide, curving staircase, passing a dark-haired woman speaking with a white-haired man, who gaze toward a group of people. Molly takes Jack's other arm as Rose, Jack, and Molly step into the large dining room. Mustached Astor returns as Jack and Rose stroll through the dining room and stop at their table. Jack waves his hand while Rose gestures across the table at him to put his napkin in his lap, and Jack gazes down at an array of silverware placed on both sides of the charter holding his plate.",
    "540": "Cafe customers are startled to see Indy and Elsa climb out of the sewer, wet and smelly. Indy looks around at the postcard-perfect setting and smiles. Indy's delight, however, is short-lived since Kazim and two other Turkish agents are running towards them with drawn guns. He grabs Elsa by the hand and the two of them run down the dock and leap into a motorboat. Indy fires up the engine and pulls away from the dock, but not before a Turkish agent jumps in with him. Elsa grabs the wheel and begins to steer the boat while Indy and the Turk trade punches. Kazim and his men rush to two more speedboats tied to the dock. They chase after Indy. Indy grapples with the Turkish agent. As Indy grips his arms, they see a gun in the agent's hand. It fires. As Indy fights with the Turk, he becomes aware of the speedboats behind him and two enormous freighters ahead of him, joined together by two giant ropes. Indy, having gained the advantage, leans on top of the Turkish agent. Indy finally delivers the punch that sends the Turkish agent flying overboard. Turning, Indy sees that Elsa has committed the speedboat to a course between the two freighters, now being pushed even closer together by a tugboat. It's purely academic at this point since the hulls of the two freighters loom up on either side of them like cavern walls. One enemy speedboat chases Indy between the two freighters. It's a race for daylight as the two freighters drift ever closer to one another. Indy's speedboat just manages to squeeze through the gap. But the enemy speedboat explodes as it is crushed between the two freighters, flying into the air and splashing back down into the water. They spin their boat around in a sharp half-circle to see Kazim's speedboat appear racing toward them. He stands in the moving boat, firing a machine gun at Indy and Elsa. The two boats race across the water nearly side-by-side. A chattering machine gun from Kazim's boat splinters the wood of Indy's boat, until finally the rear of the boat catches. The machine gun runs out of ammunition. Kazim puts it down and takes control of the wheel from one of the Turkish agents in the boat with him. As Indy's boat drifts toward the giant, turning propellers at the stern of another steamer, Kazim's boat draws up alongside and hits them. Indy steps into Kazim's boat. He knocks one of the Turkish agents to the deck, then turns his attention to Kazim. The two men trade punches as the boat spins helplessly in the churning water. Indy kicks Kazim in the face, knocking him into the water, then pulls him back into the boat, now being sucked through the churning water toward the steamer's giant propeller blades.",
    "718": "The mother glances at her young daughter, who nods. The two stewards exchange glances. Murdoch directs sailors lowering lifeboats filled with women and children. As one of the lifeboats tilts to one side, the passengers on board grimace. The sailors level the boat and lower it toward the water. A crewman fires a flare into the night sky. The passengers on deck, including Rose and Cal, gaze up. A young blond girl watches the flares and smiles. The flare explodes into separate fiery streams that fall. In the master-at-arms' office, Jack looks out through a porthole at the water, which almost reaches the middle of the glass. Sitting near Jack, Lovejoy places a bullet on a table and shoves the clip into the handgun. Lovejoy stands. He punches Jack in the stomach. Jack winces. Lovejoy picks up the handcuff key from the table, places it in his breast pocket, and leaves. Molly Brown helps a brunette woman. Cal smiles at Lightoller. Rose watches a tearful woman hug her husband. Ruth scans the passengers on the lifeboat. Ruth turns to Rose and smiles. Rose glares at Cal. Molly stands in the lifeboat. Molly helps Ruth into the boat. Rose's jaw slackens as she stares at Cal. Cal places Rose's life belt in the boat. Ruth and Molly reach toward Rose. Cal gestures. Rose walks away. Cal follows and grabs her. As she steps away, Cal grabs Rose and spins her toward him. Rose spits in Cal's face and runs off. The crewmen lower the lifeboat. In the master-at-arms' office, Jack peers at the water covering the porthole window. He bangs his handcuffs against the water pipe. Water floods a staircase and streams down a long corridor leading to the office. In the first-class corridor, Rose searches for Andrews. In another corridor, Andrews stops a steward and turns to a brunette woman, a blond maid. Andrews checks a passenger cabin. Rose runs to him. Andrews shakes his head. In the master-at-arms' office, Jack drops his head. Water streams in under the door. Jack climbs up the water pipe near the ceiling and bangs the handcuffs against the pipe. Elsewhere, Rose bumps into a steward as she runs to an elevator. As she reaches the elevator, an elevator operator with dark blond hair stops her. Rose shoves the operator into the elevator. The operator pushes a lever down as Rose closes the door. In the office, Jack tries to pull off the handcuffs. In the elevator, Rose's chest heaves. The elevator descends into rising water, which pours into the elevator. Rose opens the elevator doors and steps into a flood corridor. The operator pulls the lever up. Water empties out of the elevator as it rises.",
    "9": "An arrangement of fresh-cut roses in a vase against a white tile wall is seen. Instantly, the tile is sprayed with blood, matching the deep crimson of the roses. Ricky comes down the stairs, followed by Jane. Ricky opens the door from the dining room, then stops as Jane appears behind him. A pool of blood is forming on the kitchen table. Ricky enters the kitchen and slowly approaches Lester's lifeless body, wide-eyed but not afraid. He kneels, gazing at Lester's unseen face, and Lester looks back; his eyes are lifeless, but he's smiling a slight smile. Then he smiles, ever so slightly. We're flying across a white blanket of clouds, and eleven-year-old Lester looks up, pointing excitedly as a dot of light falls across an unbelievably starry sky. Ricky and Jane lie curled up on Jane's bed, fully clothed, looking at each other, alarmed. Maple trees in autumn send ghostly leaves fluttering slowly toward pavement. Angela stands in front of the mirror fixing her make-up, but then turns, frightened. Close-up on an ancient woman's papery hands as they button a cardigan sweater. Carolyn walks slowly toward the red door, drenched to the bone, clutching her purse tightly, while a 1970 Pontiac Firebird is in the driveway of a suburban home and the sun's reflection is in the windshield. The Colonel enters, wet and wearing latex gloves, with blood covering the front of his T-shirt. He paces in front of a gun case with the glass door open, and a gun is conspicuously missing from inside. Jane opens her bedroom door, staring at us, while a door opens to reveal four-year-old Jane dressed in a Princess costume, holding a lit sparkler and smiling shyly. Carolyn enters, terrified and still clutching her purse, shuts the door, locks it, then takes out a Glock 19. She opens the closet door, shoves the gun into a hamper, and, aware of Lester's scent, grabs as many of his clothes as she can, burying her face in them. She sinks to her knees, pulling several clothing items down with her, and begins to cry. In black and white, a younger Carolyn sits across from us on a spinning teacup ride, laughing uncontrollably as she twists the wheel, making us spin faster. We're watching the video Ricky showed Jane earlier of an empty white plastic bag being blown about, the wind carrying it in a circle around us, sometimes whipping it violently, or sending it soaring skyward, then letting it float gracefully to the ground.",
    "1204": "Marley's lying next to Connor, and Marley watches him leave and settles back down next to the sleeping lad. He leaves the editor's glass-fronted office, and the children are playing ball in the garden with Jenny when John arrives home. The kids, Jenny, and Marley tackle him to the ground, and John, the boys, and Marley head back to the house. Marley is having difficulty getting up the steps and later falls asleep in the dining room. The windy dog gets up and trots out, prompting John to put on a coat and go back outside. They use torches to search the rainy night, and Jenny switches the light on in the barn. The children are gathered together at a window, and she picks up Colleen with a reassuring smile. Patrick glumly follows his mother as John continues to search outside and walks down the drive towards the post box by the roadside. He flashes the torch around and spots Marley lying by a tree, and the dog whines as John touches his belly. A white-coated vet washes her hands, and close to tears, John leaves the surgery. He steps out onto the street, shrugging on his jacket, and walks, shoulders slumped, towards the car. He puts the key in the door, puts his hands on his hips, and sighs. Later, he arrives home, and she looks at the scrapbook and grins. Resting his cheek on his right hand, John doesn't look at her and examines his other hand, distractedly. Jenny puts an arm around him as he stares at the scrapbook of pasted-in columns. Morning sun shines on the big stone house, and John's asleep, slumped over the scrapbook. He turns to Jenny and smiles, while she slumps against a door frame in relief. Marley bounds across the large lawn and sits down by the road. As the school bus approaches, Marley trots up to the bus as Patrick and Connor get off, and Marley joins in the race. John and Billy walk through town past the tall clock tower of City Hall, and Sebastian and John grin broadly at one another. John looks back as they part, and Sebastian approaches two women. John drops his bag on a chair by the front door near to a baby grand piano, and there's a note on the dining room table. Marley's knocked over the dustbin in the kitchen and is having a feast, so he picks up the bin, and they go for a walk through a sunny meadow bordered by trees with golden autumnal leaves. Marley trots along beside John, who has his hands thrust in his pockets, and they sit down together on the path. John strokes Marley and studies his old friend, and the dog turns and looks at him. They sit, side by side, in the golden evening sun, looking out over the lush valley.",
    "259": "Hi runs down the second lane he comes to toward the front of the store, and a pack of dogs appears at the end of the lane, thundering up toward Hi, braying at the top of their doggy lungs, with the lead Doberman holding a paper 7-Eleven cap in his teeth. Hi reverses again and emerges into the back aisle, where a pyramid of cranberry juice explodes at his shoulder with a BANG. Hi looks and sees the Store Manager, a fat man in a white short-sleeved shirt with a lit cigarette in his mouth, standing in the raised platform-cubicle at the front of the store. The Manager cracks open his shotgun, inserts two cartridges with a THOONK THOONK into the smoking chamber, and Hi doubles back again toward the back aisle. The Manager is blowing out groceries on the shelves behind Hi as he coolly levels his police special and takes aim. Still on the dead run, Hi flings the carton of Huggies, which rockets straight at the camera, and futilely raising his gun to avoid impact, the carton catches him square on the chest. The force makes him stumble one fatal step backward into the back aisle, where he is hit broadside and bowled over by a rocketing shopping cart, propelled by an hysterically screaming shopper. Racing on down the back aisle, bellowing, and tracking from in front, beyond her, we see the pack of furiously barking dogs nipping at her heels as Hi emerges through the back door to find Ed skidding around the corner. Hi scrambles in the passenger side, and the car peels out of the lot. With a THWAK, Ed gives him a good hard slap, and Hi's head rolls toward the camera, his eyes fixed on something in the road ahead. Still focused on the road, he is opening his door, even though the car is racing along and absently concedes. In the extreme foreground sits the first carton of Huggies that Hi dropped in the middle of the road as the car approaches. As the car passes the carton, Hi's hand reaches from the passenger door and snags it, pulling the carton in and slamming the door shut. The scene cranes up to the car speeding away as Ed bursts in the front door, holding Nathan Jr. They look up, dumbstruck and mortified from the sofa where they have been watching TV. Ed is unmoved and storms into the bedroom, slamming the door. There is an awkward silence as Gale studies his thumb and Evelle stares at the ceiling, before Evelle finally turns to Hi, his gesture taking in the trailer and the entire domestic situation.",
    "450": "Behind the glass lies the folder of matches, which attracts Don's attention enough to make him push the glass to one side. The waiter takes the check, which is thrust between his vest and stiff shirt, and puts it face down in front of Don before hurrying on with the tray of drinks. Don turns the check over and puts his hand in his pocket, pulling out what cash he has, but he only has two one-dollar bills and some small change, which isn't enough. At that moment, the waiter returns, expecting to be paid, and takes the check before leaving. Next to Don, a couple is cooing, but on the bench between him and the girl lies her bag. Don thinks there must be some money in the bag as the man whispers something into the girl's ear, and she shakes her head. Don looks around the room, forming a plan, and inadvertently drops his hand on the bench beside the handsome leather bag with gold initials, M. M. The bag moves very close to his coat, and Don imperceptibly pulls it closer to himself, switching his cigarette and crossing his other arm so he can pull the bag up under his coat to his armpit, holding it close to his ribs. Don calmly smokes his cigarette as a great gentleman while the waiter comes back with the drink, and guests and waiters pass by. He points to a door at the other end of the room, and there is a tiny puzzled look from the waiter as Don walks slowly towards the washroom. The waiter pulls the table away for him, and Don starts to rise. The washroom has two washbasins, with a colored attendant brushing a customer as Don enters, carrying the bag under his open coat by the pressure of his upper arm. Between his fingers is a cigarette, making the whole thing look fairly natural. As Don picks up the cake of soap, he watches the attendant get a polishing rag and bend down to dust off his shoes. Don puts down the soap, pulls out the bag, opens it, and finds some bills between a compact, lipstick, and keys. He fishes out a ten-dollar bill, thrusts it in his pocket, and is about to close the purse when he sees the carnations. Smiling at the idea that flashes into his mind, he takes one of the carnations, puts it into the purse, closes it, and thrusts it back under his coat. Just as the attendant straightens up, Don puts both hands into the water.",
    "905": "Purvis empties his pistol into the man, and Baby Face drops onto his back as a plume of exhaled steam jets from his nose once. Purvis glares over his aimed pistol. Outside a small-town pharmacy, Dillinger returns to the heisted car, where Red leans, sweating and bloody, in the corner of the back seat. Dillinger pours antiseptic over Red's wounded abdomen, fusses with other supplies, applies gauze to the wound, and Red trains his puffy, exhausted eyes on Dillinger, his feeble smile fading. Dillinger slumps a little, then sits back, his blood-stained hand letting go of Red's shoulder. Eyes downcast, Dillinger stays seated by his deceased partner, swallowing and glancing at Red as his lips give a brief, irritated sneer, and he gazes downward. In a field office, Purvis faces his agents at night. On a city street, a scowling Dillinger drives past a parked car, which reflects electrical flashes from a passing train. Two agents sit in the parked vehicle, one a burly man with a Roman nose, peers at an apartment building across the street, while his partner sleeps. In the apartment, a seated Billie checks her watch, then turns up a radio, and the windows behind her show the passing train. Billie crosses the roomy, run-down apartment, then doubles back to a door, where a woman with similar short hair comes down a staircase, hands Billie a large, brown paper bag, and follows her into the apartment. As Billie dons her fur-collared coat, the newcomer takes Billie's seat by the radio. The woman wears a top similar to Billie's. As she skims a newspaper and turns up the radio, another elevated train passes in the windows. In the car, both G-men watch the apartment. In another car, two more agents see someone in an overcoat and fedora toting a paper bag across a dark alley, and the stranger ducks down a narrow passage and reaches out with a delicate hand to a brick wall—it's Billie in disguise. She comes to a street on the other end, carrying the brown paper bag, steps off the sidewalk between parked cars, and looks around in the middle of the street. A car's headlights illuminate and shine on her anxious face, and a car situated about a block away approaches and comes to a stop. Billie hops in next to Dillinger, who chews gum and smiles. Billie takes off the hat, kisses his cheek, and holds him as Dillinger drives off, and she rests her head on his shoulder. In the field office, Purvis and his agents listen to Madala, then the agents abruptly gaze out the door, and Purvis steps forward, arms folded across his chest. In the outer office, the solemn, burly agent stands with his partner, and as Purvis gazes at them, his eyes water.",
    "888": "Caroline Bingley paces the room, holding an open book in her hands, while Mr. Bingley prods the fire with his foot. Miss Bingley walks over to Darcy, who's engrossed in a book, and flirtatiously leans on his chair in order to read over his shoulder, but he ignores her and turns the page. With malevolent intent in her eyes, she crosses to Lizzie, who looks around her awkwardly, then shuts her book, stands, and sets off, arms linked, around the room with Miss Bingley. Darcy considers this for a moment, and Miss Bingley attempts to break the palpable tension by crossing to the piano as Darcy and Lizzie steadily hold each other's gazes. Jane and Lizzie are in a two-horse carriage as he beams at her, and Bingley steps away from the door, still grinning, raising a hand to bid them farewell. As the carriage leaves, Darcy watches its progress from a window and remains staring out of the window. Now inside the carriage, Jane smiles dreamily. A lady's hand is at work on a delicate piece of floral embroidery. Lizzie is walking through the countryside, with green leaves starting to turn brown, and she watches the progress of geese flying through the sky overhead. At the Bennet's dining table, he gives them a look as an austere-looking woman is also present. The obsequious Mr. Collins pulls up and clumsily climbs down from the carriage, causing Jane to stifle a giggle, and he bows to them reverentially. Now, a lavish dinner takes place, and Lizzie gives her father a look before she giggles. Mr. Collins gives Jane an ingratiating smile. Now the family is outside amusing themselves in the gardens as Mr. Collins is walking with Mrs. Bennet and looks at the girls carefully. Lydia and Kitty are playing a game with hoops, Mary is studying a book, and finally Lizzie is laughing and smiling with Jane. Mr. Collins bustles over to her, and she looks uncertain. Now the sisters are walking over a stone bridge, accompanied by Mr. Collins, who is exhausted from the walk. They make their way into the village, with carriages rolling past and people talking on corners. Lydia and Kitty rush ahead and stop at a shop window as Denny crosses to meet them with his companion. Bingley and Darcy ride by, with Darcy dismounting from his gray horse to join them. Mr. Wickham and Mr. Darcy spot each other, and a look passes between them before Mr. Wickham lifts his hat to him. Lizzie watches the exchange with interest and studies Darcy as he rides away sitting stiff and proper in the saddle. Lizzie and Kitty race in followed by Mary, and he backs away from them and takes a seat at a card table. Lizzie looks grateful for his departure as Mary starts playing the piano. At the whist table, Mr. Collins lays down a card, much to Mrs. Phillips's disgust.",
    "879": "Kate looks quizzically at Leah, who smiles and gestures towards Nick. He turns around and nods with a smile. Zoe frowns at Nick. Leah, wearing a thick winter coat, slings her bag over her shoulder as she leaves the staff changing room. Kate walks into her office, where Zoe is slumped over the desk fast asleep. Kate places a scarf around her neck, and looks down at her drawing of a sailboat and a dolphin that Zoe's resting on. Kate carries Zoe through the kitchen, and as she reaches the door, she turns back to Nick with a warm smile. He looks back at her kindly and watches them go. In Zoe's dark bedroom, Kate lays her sleeping niece down gently onto the bed. She undoes the laces on Zoe's red and white baseball boots and removes them. She places one of Zoe's stuffed toys down beside her, and Zoe immediately cuddles up to it. The next morning, Kate reaches out to turn off her square-faced alarm clock, which reads half-past four. She turns onto her back and opens her eyes sleepily. Kate pulls on a dark Berber-style jacket as she walks through to the lounge to pick up her mobile and heads towards the front door. Kate peers back up the hallway at Zoe, who's standing in her bedroom doorway clutching her cuddly Kangaroo. At the fish market, a bored-looking Zoe stands nearby, still clutching her cuddly toy, and yawns sleepily. Back at home, Kate and Zoe are asleep on the sofa. Kate stares and checks her watch, then hurries off. Later, they run along the pavement to the school, and Kate watches Zoe as she climbs the front steps, opens the heavy front door, and goes inside. At the restaurant, Kate and Leah are with a mustachioed man. Leah sniffs it, and he reaches into a bag, conducting Leah as she breathes deeply. Kate walks into her apartment with a smile, her long, dark hair hanging loose in large, soft waves. She hangs her bag on a hook by the door, drops her keys into the bowl, and begins to remove her coat, but her smile suddenly disappears. She grabs her keys and her bag and scurries out again. In a taxi, Kate jumps out and hurries towards the school, where Zoe's sitting on the steps. Zoe ignores her, stands up, and strides peevishly towards the yellow cab. Kate follows her and gets in beside her, pulling the door shut. At home, Zoe stomps straight into her bedroom, and Kate walks into hers. Kate's bedroom door opens, and she slowly steps out into the hallway, crosses to Zoe's room, and hesitates for a moment before knocking on the door.",
    "694": "Harry turns back to the stove and pours his egg, after which Mary Jane sprinkles on the cheese, and Harry adds some rocket. He flicks the omelette in half and tries to toss it in the pan, but half of it falls to the floor. Later, they read the script, and Mary Jane brushes Harry's dark hair back from his brow, meeting his adoring eyes. She pulls him towards her, and they kiss, but Mary Jane breaks off with a guilty look. Harry watches helplessly as she hurries down the black and white marble floored hallway into the lift. He storms into the study, grabs at the canter, and takes his wig, as his father's portrait glowers down at him. Harry gates, turns towards a tall mirror, and stares at his reflection, moving slowly towards it with an outstretched hand. As his fingers touch the glass, in a flashback, he sees Spider-Man standing over Norman's body and remembers pulling the Spider-Man mask off Peter's face. He remembers falling and waking up in the hospital, and his father looks back at him from the mirror. At night, Mary Jane comes home and hits the light switch, but the lights don't come on. Harry, in his Goblin suit, grabs Mary Jane by the throat, hovering on his sky stick as he holds her against the wall. Ursula, the landlord's daughter, smiles awkwardly as he hurries into the hallway. Peter nervously takes up the receiver. A couple strolls by the boating lake in Central Park as Peter, wearing a blue jumper over a blue shirt and jeans and clutching a small posy of flowers, stops in his tracks upon spotting Mary Jane standing alone in the middle of a graceful cast iron bridge. He hurries on to meet her and offers up the flowers, but she looks at them unhappily and turns aside, putting her hand over her eyes. Peter fumbles in his pocket for Aunt May's ring and, looking as if he's been hit in the stomach, watches in numb shock as she hurries away off the bridge. A little further along the lake, Harry leans against a tree observing the scene. He turns with a cruel smile as Mary Jane comes past, arms folded, glaring at him, and Mary Jane turns away angrily and carries on. Harry lets his head drop against the tree trunk with a smile of satisfaction. Later, he meets Peter in a coffee shop, draws breath, and Peter looks Harry in the eye before shaking his head and looking away in a daze. Blinking in shock and disbelief, Peter gets up and leaves as a waitress comes over to Harry with a coffee jar and Harry grins. Peter, crossing the road, turns and looks back.",
    "82": "He fetches a liquor bottle from beneath the rocking chair; about to pour he does a take at Bess's photograph. It stands in a cabinet frame: a fine-looking young woman in archaic dress, with sharp, accusing black eyes. He turns the picture away and splashes liquor into his coffee. They drink. John looks cautious. Birdie's face falls; he takes another drink. John puts his cup down and gets up. He heads for the door. John runs up the bank, not looking back. He runs up the street close to Spoon's and stops dead. He is horrified by what he sees. Group shot through door-glass, from John's viewpoint Preacher, Willa, and Pearl surround a little table. Walt stands by, puffing his pipe. Icey in the background, stirs fudge at a little soda-fountain stove. Willa looks both moved and pleased. Pearl, shyly flirting with Preacher, all but hides in Willa's skirts. Preacher dandles Pearl's doll on his knee as he talks. All the grownups are avid for his words, which we don't hear through the glass. We shoot through the door; he quietly enters. They look casually to John and continue talking. Over this John enters the shot and stands at the fringe of the group, staring at Preacher's hands and at the doll. He hands the doll to Pearl. John's eyes follow the doll. Preacher holds up both hands to John. John looks back at his hands. John stands still. They are impressed in their different ways. Slight applause from the adults. Preacher takes Pearl, with her doll, onto his lap. He does a little take. His eyes twinkle palely. Something new enters his eyes; a game has begun between them. A tight silence. Icey pours fudge into a buttered pan. Few men in proportion to women and children. We center Preacher. The women watch him and admire him. He gives Willa the eye as we pan to center Willa, who looks wooed and self-conscious. Icey enters the shot and whispers and beckons Willa and, as the singing continues, they leave the group and start towards a shade tree in medium ground, which we pan to center. They walk; singers in background. Willa nods. Icey, looking ahead, is displeased. They sit on the bench, their backs to us, partly concealed by the tree trunk. They look around. Icey and Willa enter the shot, their backs to us. They sit on the bench, their back to us. The children recede towards the river in background. Willa meekly keeps her head down. Singing continues o.s. Icey pivots and we pan over her to children by river. John looks up from pebble-skimming and loosens his tie. His brow is furrowed. He skims another pebble.",
    "703": "Harry falls to the floor of the building Mary Jane is on. Mary Jane runs to him. Peter desperately tugs at the black threads holding his wrists. He frees one hand and grabs a sharp spear of metal as Venom leaps at him. Cutting himself free, he knocks Venom away. Peter grabs two of the pipes. Venom falls to his knees. Peter spears the two pipes into the floor, grabs two more, and does the same, building a circular fence around Venom. The monster reels and half-disintegrates from the noise. Brock's face appears from within the symbiotic suit. Peter shoots a thread, pulls him free, and holds him through the bars. Behind Peter, the black spiky Venom suit assumes a life of its own, growing and flailing about. Peter and Brock look on in amazement as it tries to break out of its cage. Peter strikes the bells to make them ring then grabs a pumpkin bomb. Brock leaps in after the bomb. Peter puts a hand to his face to shield it from the blast. When the spot clears, there's nothing left of Brock or the symbiote. Behind him Flint materializes, sand pouring from his arm. Mary Jane runs down to where Harry lies on his back. She nods. Up above, Peter drops the tube he was carrying, his expression numb. Peter turns to find Flint right behind him. Peter's eyes narrow fractionally. As Peter listens, Flint's eyes become distant as he thinks back. In black and white flashback, Uncle Ben sits in his car. Flint comes up with a gun and taps on the window. Uncle Ben squeezes Flint's shoulder. In flashback, the accomplice runs up to Flint from behind and knocks him on the shoulder as he makes for the car. The gun discharges. Uncle Ben's eyes close, and he falls to the ground. Flint looks on, eyes wide with horror. He kneels over the dying man as his partner drives away. Flint lowers his eyes for a moment then looks back up at Peter. Peter frowns as he struggles to understand. Then lowers his grief-stricken eyes and nods to himself. He looks back at Flint who meets his steadfast gaze. Flint goes over to the edge of the skyscraper and looks down at the emergency vehicles far below. A pale, dawn light is spreading across the sky above them. He looks at the silver locket he holds in his hand, with its tiny photograph of his daughter, and turns back to Peter. His eyes brimming, Flint looks sorrowfully but steadily at Peter, who nods with a look of understanding. The ghost of a smile flickers across Peter's face. Flint nods faintly and starts to disintegrate into a whirling eddy of sand.",
    "1249": "Emily is standing on the stairs with another couple and spots Andy. Inside at the benefit, Emily and Andy follow Miranda around as she greets guests, prompting her as to who they are, while Miranda is wearing a black, off-the-shoulder gown. Andy spots Chairman Irv Ravitz with a chic lady on his arm. A tissue. A man waves at Miranda and turns to Emily, prompting Andy to step back. Emily looks gratefully at Andy, who smiles. Later, Andy is hurrying out of the benefit when she meets Christian coming up the steps, and Christian heads into the benefit. Andy is driven home through the busy New York streets and finds Nate watching TV alone. Andy shuts the door, puts down her bags, and walks over to him, carrying a single fairy cake with a lit candle on it. Dark-haired Nate looks morose as he sits forward and stops in the doorway, turns back to look at her, shaking his head sadly. Hanging his head, he turns and mooches off into the bedroom. Looking glum, Andy blows out the candle on the cake. Andy lets herself into Miranda's townhouse, carrying Miranda's dry cleaning and the book. She's wearing a cool monochrome outfit with black trousers, pale boots, and a big, floppy cap on her head. She puts the dry cleaning into the correct closet and is about to leave the book when she's summoned from one of the other rooms but cannot see Miranda. She yanks her cap off and smooths her fringe before heading in, where Miranda is in a chair in the lounge. Andy hands it to her. Miranda rises sternly, and Andy looks down. Miranda has turned her attention to the book as Andy stands and stares at her with her big doe eyes for a moment, then leaves. Andy strolls sadly through the city, mulling over her decision. It’s dark, and the swanky shop windows she passes are all lit up. She passes people sitting at tables outside a restaurant, shakes her head, and moves on. Yellow taxicabs pass her on the street as she walks past shop windows, one displaying a fashionable red coat. Back at home, Nate wanders out of the bedroom and finds Andy looking through some of her old articles and photographs, including one of her with her parents, and she picks up another photograph. Nate's shoulders sag, and he heads back into the bedroom and turns out the light as Andy rubs her neck, trying to ease some of the tension. Andy is at work early, and both Miranda's office and Emily's chair are empty. Andy stares across the anteroom at it, then picks up a clipboard and some papers. Miranda comes in, unbuttoning her coat, which has a striped collar.",
    "769": "The sequence begins with a scene where a figure scans around, followed by the Chancellor overlooking the loading bay. Yuri leads a fast-moving crowd across the wide boarding platform. As Tenzen and the others board the ship, Grandpa slips, prompting Jackson to quickly react and grab his arm. Tenzen acknowledges Jackson with a nod. The crowd on the boarding platform reaches a deep pit surrounding the ark, and when a man falls into the pit, the crowd halts in their tracks. The scene shifts to the ark bridge where the enormous rear life supports outside move into position. Jackson and the others are seen walking toward the hedge. A view from a height reveals the struggling crowd and the boarding platform below, where Yuri is heard saying something. From atop the hull, Tamara spots Caesar on the ground. Inside the hatch, Jackson holds a torch as Tenzen unwinds a sealed shaft. Caesar reaches Tamara just as the outer hatch closes, while Yuri looks on angrily, and Tamara gestures rudely at him before the hatch slams shut. Inside, Jackson, Gordon, and others shine torches as Tenzen uses a pneumatic drill. Nema looks up with hope as Tenzen opens a round hatch. On the control bridge, Adriane and Laura watch in horror as people outside fall off the boarding platform into the pit. Adriane crosses the bridge with a deep frown as Macarenka surveys a screen on his ark. Anheuser shakes his head at Adriane, who looks down with relief, while Anheuser hangs his head. Michaels picks up the phone on the control desk in a darkened corridor. Tamara uses her torch to light up various caged animals. As the gates open, a hydraulic ceiling lowers, knocking Gordon and Tenzen off a ladder. Jackson struggles to help the injured Tenzen and Gordon, who cling on just above grinding gears, with Gordon being dragged between the wheels. Uri tries to pull himself back onto the boarding platform from a lower ledge. Tenzen gets stuck between the gears and the swiftly descending hydraulic ceiling, as Jackson finds himself trapped between a wire fence and the ceiling. Tenzen's drill becomes entangled in the gears, causing sparks to fly. Jackson reaches out desperately as the hydraulic wall advances toward the gate, but the gears grind to a halt, and the wall stops. In the following chaos, hundreds of people leap onto the gate and board the Ark. Anheuser watches the chaos with anxiety and takes in his surroundings using a digital camera. Meanwhile, in a mountaintop monastery, flower petals are blown by the wind from a bowl as a Lama looks up from his seat on the floor, scanning around. In the distance, a gigantic wall of water crashes between the peaks of the snow-covered mountains, and Lama rings the monastery bell as the water rapidly approaches.",
    "192": "He drops the phone with a crash, grabs Mary by the shoulders, and shakes her. Mary begins to cry. He pulls her to him in a fierce embrace. Two meant for each other find themselves in tearful ecstasy. Mrs. Hatch is at the top of the stairs. She practically faints at what she sees. Cousin Tilly's face fills the screen as she cries. The camera pulls back, and we hear the sound of the Wedding March. People are crowded into the rooms: family, friends, neighbors. There is a din of conversation. Mary and George appear at the top of the stairs in traveling clothes, with Mrs. Hatch, red-eyed, behind them. Mary throws her bouquet, which is caught by Violet Bick. As they come out onto the porch, we see that it is raining. Nevertheless, Cousin Eustace has his camera equipment set up and is taking pictures of the group. George and Mary dodge through the rain and a shower of rice and get into Ernie's taxicab, which pulls away from the curb. Mrs. Bailey and Annie, the maid. George and Mary are in each other's arms. Ernie reaches over and hands George a bottle of champagne done up in gift wrappings. The cab passes the bank, and Ernie sees a crowd of people around the door. He stops the cab. Scurrying people under umbrellas are swarming around the bank doors. Panic is in the air. Attendants are trying to close down. Several people come running past the cab. George gets out of the cab and looks down the street. George runs off up the street toward the Building and Loan. They are simply-dressed people, to whom their savings are a matter of life and death. George comes in with an assumed cheerful manner. The people look at him silently, half shamefaced, but grimly determined on their rights. In their hearts there is panic and fear. An iron grill blocks the street entrance to the Building and Loan. A crowd of men and women are waiting around the grill. It has been locked. He quickly unlocks the grill door and pushes it open. Followed by the crowd, George runs upstairs and into the outer offices of the Building and Loan. George, followed by the still-silent people, comes in. Uncle Billy is standing in the doorway to his private office, taking a drink from a bottle. He motions to George to join him. George turns back cheerfully to the crowd. George vaults over the counter. The people ignore George and remain standing in front of the teller's window. They all have their passbooks out. George hurries into his office where Uncle Billy is waiting for him. He points to George's office. The telephone rings.",
    "1197": "Ron points, his hand shaking, as the huge black dog leaps over their heads, grabs Ron's leg, and drags him towards the tree. Still holding Scabbers, Ron is dragged under the roots, and Harry makes a grab for him, but a branch knocks Harry and Hermione over. The Whomping Willow waves its branches menacingly, and as they cautiously move towards it, the tree attacks them. A branch lashes down, causing Harry to lose his glasses. Hermione jumps over a swinging branch, but the next one lifts her off the ground, while Harry rolls over as the tree lashes out. He sprints off into flailing branches as Hermione is whirled above his head. Scratched by the sharp twigs, Hermione is twisted this way and that as she clings to the branch, being turned upside down. Harry finds his glasses and puts them on to see Hermione flying towards him. Desperately, she grabs hold of his T-shirt, and he is hauled into the air. They hurtle around until Hermione lets go, and Harry falls down the hole under the tree roots, with Hermione landing on top of him. Ahead of them is a flight of steps cut into the twisted roots, and they start to climb. Harry and Hermione climb up through a trapdoor under bare floorboards, where a faint light filters through wooden shutters. They go up a rickety staircase and along a dingy landing to a dilapidated room. Huge paw prints on the dusty floor lead across the room to a wild-eyed man with matted hair and a ragged convict's uniform. Hermione stands in front of Harry, but Harry pushes Hermione aside, knocks the man down, and threatens him with his wand, which flies out of his hand. Professor Lupin helps Sirius to his feet, and the children stare, horrified, as Sirius embraces him. Lupin narrows his eyes, looks from Sirius to Harry, and then gives Sirius his wand. Snape enters, and Harry slides Hermione's wand from her pocket, causing Snape to fly backwards. Sirius grabs the rat, which runs across the piano and scurries towards a rat hole, but Lupin and Sirius wave their wands, dragging out a pudgy little man with sharp, pointed teeth. He rubs his beady little eyes, and one finger on his left hand is missing. He tries to run, but they stop him. Pettigrew grabs Harry but is pulled away and sinks to his knees. Harry and Sirius help Ron out from the hole under the tree, and Hermione sits beside him. Sirius gazes towards the distant lights of Hogwarts, with Harry watching him anxiously. Lupin appears with Pettigrew and pulls him away. Hermione points to the sky as a full moon appears from behind the clouds, and they all stare at Professor Lupin. As the moonlight touches his face, his eyes turn green and his face distorts.",
    "502": "She picks up the check and looks at it. Harlan has led Thelma off to the far end of the parking lot, and he is trying to kiss her now. He is pushing her arms down and turning her head away. Harlan is pushing himself on her now, and she is beginning to push him away harder. Harlan has now pinned Thelma against the back of a car and is kissing her neck. He has her ass in his hands and is beginning to hump her. She is pushing him away as hard as she can, but he is relentless. He looks mean and dangerous. He lets go of her face and pins her arms behind her, holding both of her arms with one hand. With his free hand, he reaches down and starts to pull her dress up. Thelma is still struggling, and there are tears running down her face. A tight shot shows the barrel of Thelma's gun being pressed into the nape of Harlan's neck, as Louise's thumb pulls back the hammer. Harlan slowly raises his hands in the air, and Thelma darts out, pulling her dress down. Louise starts to back away, but the gun is still close to his face, while his pants are undone in the front. She is still backing away with the gun raised, and Thelma is inching away as well. Louise lowers the gun and stares at him for a second before turning and walking away. Thelma does, too. Louise stops in her tracks, takes two long strides back towards him, raises the gun, and fires a bullet into his face. The car behind him is splattered with blood. Thelma and Louise are both silent. Louise lowers the gun, and Thelma runs to get the car, coming careening up in reverse. Louise hops in, and Thelma peels out, spraying gravel. As they speed out of the parking lot back to the road, music is blaring from the nightclub. They hit the main road with tires squealing, and Thelma starts to cry quietly. Thelma pulls off to the side of the road. Louise gets out and starts to walk around the car, stopping when she gets to the back of the car and is sick. Thelma waits in the car and moves over to the passenger side. Louise gets in the driver's side, and Thelma's head moves almost imperceptibly. Louise studies Thelma's face and looks at her for a long time. Police cars are parked around, and the activity has died down. In the back of a police car sits the waitress with the door open, while a detective in a suit leans over the car door with his note pad. Louise did not realize she was doing it.",
    "799": "Rows of old film studio buildings are reflected in a shiny, gold surface, followed by a shaky animation of a figure wearing a long coat and a hat. The figure runs towards light, and its arms spread out, becoming wings as it takes flight and, as a bird, comes to rest. Al-Saleem, a bearded man wearing a loose-fitting robe and a pale cream cap, appears in a house where three young Middle Eastern men listen to him on a television. Meanwhile, on a cordoned-off street, a policeman pats the roof of a milk float that then drives off. Armed special branch officers in black run across wasteland as more officers huddle on a street corner while the milk float drives around. Officers make their way upstairs at the back of a boarded-up house and train their automatic weapons on the front of the terraced house. The Sikh milkman stops to pick up some pints of milk, and a marksman on the roof takes aim. Daylight floods through windows into the gloomy house as the milkman walks up to the front door, placing two pints of milk on the doorstep. One of the armed officers opens the back door and enters, alerting the three men inside. Bomb-making equipment is spread out on a table, and one of the men presses a key on a mobile phone, triggering a golden fireball that rips through the building. Police and civilians dive for cover as debris rains down, thick gray smoke fills the air, and plumes of smoke rise. Letters emerge from brief flashes of grainy surveillance footage of densely packed buildings bisected by streets. A casually dressed young man with a beard, Ferris, lies on a bed, deep in troubled thought with a pinched brow as he recalls sitting in a room watching a prisoner gagged and beaten to death with a cricket bat. In a large house, a craggy-faced man in his 40s, Edward Hoffman, dictates into a laptop while on TV. Ferris cocks a pistol in a meeting room. A car is blown up, and a soldier is shot as Hoffman talks to officials. Ferris, wearing jeans, a shirt, a casual top, and a baseball cap, sits at an Iraqi street cafe sipping coffee when a four-by-four pulls up. The driver, Bassam, with long black hair in a ponytail, yells to Ferris, who picks up his bag and coffee and gets in the four-by-four. Ferris sips his coffee as Bassam drives to a checkpoint on a dirt road where they're watched. Ferris looks at a stone house through binoculars, with goats swarming around in front. Bassam calls on his mobile while they're watched on a screen in a CIA surveillance room.",
    "301": "Suddenly she buries her head in her arms over the table and starts to sob, as he is unaware that Lisa is standing behind him and is also watching this little drama. Jeff, his glass in hand, looks out sympathetically. In the background, Lisa, having just placed a pair of candlesticks on the table, is returning to the kitchen. Both of them swing their eyes a little to the left. The kitchen-living room combination of the ballet dancer's apartment has now been made more presentable, with the ice box skillfully concealed by a large Chinese screen. Miss Torso sees that the cocktail glass of the third man is empty, and she takes it over to the window to fill it. She is the perfect hostess, animated and charming, with an added personal touch for each guest. Her every movement is followed admiringly by the eyes of the three men: one wearing a black tie, with a touch of grey in his hair, a Long Island socialite; a young, rather handsome, actor in a grey flannel suit; and a bright, pleasant young man who might possibly be from Wall Street, wearing a blue-pin-striped suit. She is behaving with a sophistication not apparent when first seen in the morning. Miss Torso is now wearing a cocktail dress that shows off her figure to great advantage, especially when she leans toward the three men to offer them a plate of hors d'oeuvres. All kitchen utensils have been put away, replaced by more attractive effects, and lamplight softens the surroundings. The man in the tuxedo follows her over, with a casual glance toward the others, stands beside her as she makes the drink, and looks at his watch with impatience, making a side comment to her about the lateness of the time. The latter two are engaged in an animated conversation. She turns, gives him a light kiss on his cheek as if telling him to be patient, but instead of pacifying him, it makes him more amorous, and he puts an arm around her shoulder and plants a heavy kiss on her cheek. She turns to face him, they look into each other's eyes for a moment, and she allows herself to be kissed on the lips, but only long enough to attract the attention of the other two men. With a little admonishing look, she moves away from him and makes him rejoin the other two, giving him a significant look. He ponders her last remark, then changes his look in another direction. The camera moves in until Jeff is in semi-closeup, alone.",
    "1089": "Aron, sitting with his legs drawn up in front of him, slowly gets up to his feet, and throws the cloth bundle over his shoulder as dark green conifers stretch as far as the eye can see. A man strides through the undergrowth and comes across Asael lying asleep by a tree with Aron in his arms. The stone-faced man in his late thirties, in a cloth cap and a brown leather jacket over heavy wool trousers, picks up a stone and tosses it onto the ground. Asael wakes up, gets to his feet, and Tuvia grabs him roughly. The two brothers hug fiercely, and Tuvia beckons to their youngest brother, and all three stand locked in a hug. Zus appears carrying kindling, and Tuvia nods bitterly as Zus fishes in his pocket, brings out the mezuzah, and tosses it to Tuvia, then drops the kindling to the ground. As Zus starts snapping the twigs, Tuvia glances at the Hebrew markings on the mezuzah and hugs Aron even more tightly. Zus hands Tuvia some vodka, and the four of them huddle together in the pouring rain, with Aron sitting with a coat on his head listening quietly. They have a little fire near to a stream. Tuvia crouches down next to Zus, who is the tallest of the three adults, while elsewhere in the forest, ants scurry over a mound of twigs. Aron pushes a stick into the mud with a curious expression and watches several ants climb onto it, brings the stick closer to him, and studies their movements. He reels around and spots a female figure running through the trees some distance away, gets to his feet, and starts to run after her. He stops between two silver birch trees and watches the teen girl run towards a gray-bearded man in a Homburg hat, shirt and waistcoat, and suit trousers sitting on a log with a little girl in his arms. Aron looks in another direction and sees a young man accompanying an old woman. From behind more trees, a man in a black hat and black overcoat with a smartly dressed woman are standing. Clutching his stick, Aron steps towards a mud ditch in the middle of a clearing, where the long winding ditch is full of dead bodies piled on top of each other, and Aron's eyes fill with horror. His brothers are sitting around the fire, and Zus and Tuvia look at each other. Aron has brought the old man and the child, and Tuvia lays the child down near the fire. Zus, armed with a rifle, watches the other people arrive, and he and Tuvia glance at each other in mute surprise as the old man weeps and strokes the little girl's glossy dark hair.",
    "30": "He smiles as he turns toward Rick. Suddenly the smile fades. In Rick's hand is a gun, which he levels at Renault. Renault halts for a moment and studies Rick. He walks to a table and sits. As Renault picks up the phone and dials, Rick takes back the letters. Strasser is on the phone. He hangs up the receiver and presses a buzzer on his desk. An officer quickly enters. He hangs up the receiver and, grabbing for his cap, hurriedly exits. The entire airport is surrounded by a heavy fog. The outline of the transport plane is barely visible. On the airfield a transport plane is being readied. A uniformed orderly uses a telephone near the hangar door. He hangs up and moves to a car that has just pulled up outside the hangar. Renault gets out while the orderly stands at attention. He's closely followed by Rick, right hand in the pocket of his trench coat, covering Renault with a gun. Laszlo and Ilsa emerge from the rear of the car. Laszlo and take care of his luggage. The orderly escorts Laszlo off in the direction of the plane. Rick takes the letters of transit out of his pocket and hands them to Renault, who turns and walks toward the hangar. Renault stops dead in his tracks, and turns around. Both Ilsa and Renault look at Rick with astonishment. Rick's intention suddenly dawns on Ilsa. Renault countersigns the papers. Ilsa's eyes well up with tears. Rick puts his hand to her chin and raises her face to meet his own. Major Strasser drives at break-neck speed towards the airport. He honks his horn furiously. Laszlo returns. Rick walks into the hangar and Renault hands him the letters. He walks back out to Laszlo. Rick hands the letters to Laszlo. Laszlo extends his hand to Rick, who grasps it firmly. On the airfield the airplane engine turns over and the propellers start turning. They all turn to see the plane readying for take-off. Ilsa looks at Rick and he returns her stare with a blank expression. He then glances at Laszlo, as does Ilsa. Then Laszlo breaks the silence. Rick watches as Ilsa and Laszlo walk very deliberately towards the plane. Rick puts a cigarette in his mouth. The door to the plane is closed by an attendant and it slowly taxies down the field. Suddenly a speeding car comes to a stop outside the hangar. Strasser alights from the car and runs toward Renault. Renault nods toward the field. Strasser turns to see the plane taxiing towards the runway. Strasser looks briefly at Rick, then makes a step towards the telephone just inside the hangar door. His eyes dart towards the telephone.",
    "438": "The camera goes slowly up to a sidewalk clock with a diadem of three balls, which stands outside the hock shop. The time is twenty minutes of one, but the clock says five minutes of four. Nat is at the bar with two or three customers listening to race results on a little radio. Don drags himself in, drenched in sweat, his breath as short and agonized as that of a dying man. He goes to the end of the bar closest to the door, hoists the typewriter on it with a final awful effort, and leans his head on it. A drink is shoved at Don, but he is shaking so much that he can't pick up the glass. He bends down, sucks half of it, then lifts the glass and drains the rest. Don holds out the empty glass to Nat, his eyes imploring, then takes the typewriter and drags himself out of Nat's place. Don emerges and starts dragging himself up the street towards home. As he passes the antique shop, he suddenly stops, noticing the wooden Indian Gloria spoke about, pointing up. Don walks into the house and goes to the second floor of this same crummy Third Avenue house -- dark woodwork, paint peeling from the walls. Beside the door at the head of the stairs, there are about three bells for the several occupants of the apartment within. Don drags himself up the stairs, puts down the typewriter, and inspects the name tags by the bells. He rings the bell beside it, then rings again. From inside, the door is opened by Gloria, wearing a dressing gown and bedroom slippers, her hair in the ruined elaborate hairdress of yesterday, her eyes blazing with anger. She slips into the apartment, leaving the door about three inches ajar. After a couple of seconds, Gloria reappears with a wallet, while Don leans against the door jamb, breathing heavily. She takes five dollars out and gives it to him. Don takes it with a shaking hand, and she brushes his forehead with the back of her hand. He takes her hand and kisses it, and Gloria looks at him, then at her hand. He bends, picks up the typewriter, and starts downstairs, with Gloria looking after him. A man looks at Don but doesn't answer, instead staring at him, terrified, before drifting away eerily. From the opposite direction, a male nurse comes, getting a pad and pencil from his pocket. Don has risen, wearing flannel pajamas like all the rest of the patients. Bim stands quietly watching him with a great big grin on his face. However, Don manages to make the swinging glass door past the benches and a collection of wheelchairs along the walls.",
    "630": "She walks over to the torch, picks it up, and shines it at Merrill, who's stacking crates and live sacks of dog food in front of the chute. He slides wearily down his barricade to the ground. Spotting a can of dog food on the floor, he picks it up and, rising slightly, reaches up beside him to slap it on top of the pile of sacks. Sitting back down on the floor, he looks across at Bo, and then picks up his torch, using it to search the basement for the others. The beam illuminates his brother, sitting on the floor, leaning against a pillar. Morgan is sitting between Graham's legs, his head pushed back into his father's chest. Merrill's eyes widened in alarm. Graham has one hand on Morgan's chest, the other gripping his son's shoulder. Bo stares at them wide-eyed. Graham rests his head against Morgan's. Bo goes to sit on Merrill's lap, tears welling in her eyes. Morgan holds the knees of his father's jeans tightly as he struggles with his breathing. Graham lifts his head slightly and stares angrily into the distance. His lips quiver. Merrill wheels Morgan on, mouthing silent words of earnest prayer. Morgan relaxes his grip on his father's jeans. Morgan lies back, his breathing returning to normal. Merrill stares across at them, blinking rapidly. He swallows. He turns his off. Bo turns hers off. In Graham's mind, he reaches the scene of the accident. Caroline talks to him. He stares at the ground, his lips trembling. Caroline nods. She smiles bleakly. Graham walks slowly past a police car and a huddle of policemen standing over Ray who's sitting on the ground, head bowed. A little way beyond is Ray's Ford pickup truck smashed into the tree, stretched into any of the front and a couple of paramedics standing by. They turn to look at Graham as he approaches. Back in the basement, the main light is on. Graham looks up. Merrill walks over to the radio. Graham stares blearily down at the floor. Graham looks up at Merrill in shock. Graham gets to his feet and takes a step towards his brother. Graham looks reflectively down at the ground. Merrill regards him accusingly. Graham frowns and shakes his head. Merrill steps towards him. Graham nods numbly, his mouth agape. They turn to look at Morgan asleep on the floor, his head resting on folded blankets. Graham glances at the door. Suddenly, thinking of something, Graham walks over to Morgan, and crouching down, lifts up the back of the boy's beige and brown check shirt. Graham glances up in relieved surprise and pulls the baby monitor out of the back pocket of Morgan's jeans.",
    "1386": "Hermione reads over the shoulders of others, while a flicker of fear passes through Harry's face as Bem, a Nigerian boy, stares grimly at the grainy image of Black. Beautiful flowers gleam in the dawn light, then slowly begin to wither. The dew freezes, the grass grows brittle, and seconds later, the Dementors sweep by. A tall wardrobe rattles violently as Harry, Ron, and several classmates regard it warily. Ron jumps, glances at Hermione, then whispers to Harry. Neville eyes the rattling wardrobe and steps forward queasily as everyone laughs good-naturedly. Lupin nods thoughtfully and leans close to Neville, whispering. Neville's eyes pop open in shock as he considers Lupin uncertainly, then nods nervously and takes a deep breath. Sparks jet from Lupin's wand, strike the doorknob, and the wardrobe bursts open. Instantly, Snape appears, eyes flashing hideously as he stalks forward. Neville backs away in fright and turns, seeing Harry step forward expectantly. Concern flickers through Lupin's face as the Jack-In-The-Box pivots on its spring, its face tumbling toward Harry, becoming more sinister, transforming into a Dementor. Harry starts to raise his wand, then freezes, transfixed as the Dementor looms closer and closer. Lupin steps between them, snapping his wand, and studies Harry curiously. Harry looks up and finds Lupin studying him as Lupin's eyes glaze in memory, then he blinks and smiles, turning to eye Harry affectionately. Harry smiles vaguely. Harry, Ron, and Hermione exchange dark glances when Ginny emerges from the crowd, her face ashen. The students dash to the landing, where all the paintings whisper fearfully. Filch's rheumy eyes peer up, searching the upper shadows, then narrow as he extends a crooked finger. High up, near the ceiling, the Fat Lady cowers in a portrait not her own, trembling. As the students react, Dumbledore's voice cuts through. The clock tower door's great groaning tumblers fall, spindles rotate, and cylinders fire into place. Windows: iron spikes, sharp as razors, rise instantly. One by one, deep in the distance, the lights of the Great Hall go out. Dementors appear, covering the frame, then separate like a curtain. The camera drifts through the silent room, over an ocean of sleeping bags, finding Harry lying awake, staring at the net of stars glimmering beyond the highest window. A gentle creak is heard and Harry's eyes shift to see Snape pass through the great doors and converge with Dumbledore. Dumbledore gazes at the students, refusing to take the bait, while Snape's eyes glitter darkly. Dumbledore gazes out over the slumbering students, and as his gaze finds Harry, Harry shuts his eyes and feigns sleep. As the students eye Snape with guarded curiosity, Malfoy finishes scrawling something on a bit of parchment and balls it up in his hands, and as he opens them, a moth flutters from his palms.",
    "633": "A path leads from the side of the circle, splitting into two prongs. A third crop circle has two straight lines at either side, and a circle of maize remaining in the center, with another path leading off from its side. It splits into three larger prongs, the central one of which points towards a smaller circle. Graham is on the phone as he looks out of his window at the yard. He bows his head. Graham steps into the kitchen, where one of the dogs lies on the floor near a puddle of liquid. Morgan and Bo lead the Alsatian into the backyard. Graham crosses the kitchen and pulls some paper towels off a roll, dabbing at the urine and saturating the towels. Then, he stands and walks back across the kitchen. A dark-haired woman in a police uniform leans casually in a doorway leading to the front hall, as Carolyn sighs wearily and gazes at Graham. In the yard, Morgan's at the smoking barbecue, where he sticks a fork in a chicken wing and turns it over. One of the Alsatians watches Morgan from the veranda while the other one, Houdini, lies slumped in the yard with Bo kneeling in front of him. Morgan walks across to Bo as she drinks from a large glass of water, kneels beside his sister, drinks from the tall glass, and then gives her the glass. Bo carefully pours the water into a metal dog bowl and slides it across the grass to Houdini. The Alsatian suddenly jerks his head up towards Bo, causing her to jump back in shock and Morgan to frown. Bo stands as Houdini stands up, causing Bo to freeze. The stalks all lie in the same direction, and Graham shakes his head. Carolyn looks across the field as Graham stares thoughtfully into space, rises, and slowly walks towards the edge of the circle. Carolyn stands and watches him with a slightly puzzled expression. Graham gazes across the field and then he and Carolyn emerge through the tall green crop, looking around anxiously. Graham spots something over to his left, strides briskly towards it with a concerned expression, and Carolyn follows him as they break into a jog. Houdini lies motionless on the ground near the climbing frame, with Morgan kneeling beside him and a barbecue fork sticking out of Houdini's throat. Morgan holds an asthma inhaler as he stares down at the dog, then looks up at his father through puffy red eyes. Bo sits up on a platform on the climbing frame, with her knees drawn tightly up to her chin, wearing blue sneakers and jeans under her pale flowery dress. Morgan looks back down and takes a puff of his inhaler while Graham stares at his son and crouches down beside Houdini.",
    "848": "Dark clouds cover half of the bright moon as a figure hurtles dying towards the ground. Long, bony fingers caress the street as the black-tied figure rises to its feet, revealing a slight man in his 30s with blood streaking the right side of his face, blond cropped hair, and a thick collar. He stares at lights in the sky which go out as rain falls. He throws himself against the wall and huddles beside it, holding out a broad-bladed dagger and pointing it in the direction of a barking dog behind a wire fence. The man rips open his black top, revealing a thin, toned body with tattoos and blood aligned with the streak on his face. He walks towards the dog in its pound, raises the dagger above his head, and brings it down with great force. A bright light shines on him, and a blue light ring falls over him, opening the collar around his neck, which falls to the ground. Rain washes blood across the ground and into a drain. Inside a building, a man in a suit carrying a torch walks between stacking shelves, some covered with cellophane, steps on a toy under a skylight, and bends down to pick it up. The man in the black coat jumps through the skylight onto him, knocking him and his torch to the floor. The man from the sky goes to a grubby men's room, removes his coat, opens a first aid box, uses a thread and a bent needle to stitch a nasty wound on his back with flesh torn away at shoulder level, watches his reflection in a mirror as he sews, and grasps the sink with his bloody hand as his blood drips on the floor. Now dressed, he marches to a door, removes a chain, switches on lights in an armory, and is dressed in black shirt, trousers, and light coat. He picks up two assault rifles with grenade launchers, a selection of assault and sniper rifles, and walks out of the armory with two bags in his hands. He reaches a door with a metal bar across it as two cops, Burton and Estevez, drive along a downtown street. The burlier of the two, Burton, glances out as they pass people on the sidewalk and holds up his fingers in the shape of a gun. A door explodes just in front of them, and a man is hurled into the air, creating a hole in the shape of a cross in the building. They watch as the man from the sky steps into the flaming surround, and Burton gets out and draws his gun.",
    "1242": "He jabs his finger while Peter stands by, frowning, as they watch Longson march off. On a dark, rain-sodden pitch, Bremner, in a yellow Leeds shirt, slides down a Derby player while Leeds players foul and head-butt their counterparts, and Brian bellows at Don. Bremner strolls up to Brian and shakes his hand on the touchline before smirking. Brian and Peter are dazed in the rain as the Leeds players trudge off, gesticulating at the Derby crowd. Longson stalks angrily down the corridor, past the away dressing room, to stand beside a hangdog Brian surveying his battered team, glaring at Brian before turning on his heel, leaving a rueful Brian to meet Peter's concerned look. Brian addresses the press assembled in the tunnel of Juve's Comunale Stadium and jabs his finger at a camera. Nurses wheel a gurney from an ambulance as Brian sits by Peter's hospital bedside, smiling and looking away. Their eyes meet and hold a loaded look for a moment before each drops his gaze. Brian storms into the Derby board meeting where Longson stares at the table as he smokes a cigar, while the other directors look away from Brian's plaintive looks. Shaking his head in disbelief, Brian wanders down to Longson, then hurls his tracksuit top on the table. Everyone gathered in the candlelit room turns to look at Peter as Brian crosses the room to him. Brian stands beside three grinning young men before the assembled press below the Leeds United sign in front of the stadium as Giles, Bremner, and Hunter watch from the training ground. Brian passes them in the tunnel, standing with his back to the pitch in the players' tunnel, smiling bitterly as Giles points past him towards the empty stadium at the end of the tunnel. Brian's smile wilts as Giles turns and saunters off with the other players, who pat him on the back as they go. Alone, Brian turns slowly and makes his way up towards the pitch, gazing at the empty stands. Alone in his stark hotel room, Brian lies on his bed, smoking and drinking, staring at the little girl playing noughts and crosses with the toy clown on the television test-card. A woman rides a tricycle past beach huts on the seafront promenade, girls flock across the beach by the pier, an elderly couple eat fish and chips, and more middle-aged folks snooze in deck chairs in the hazy sunshine. Brian pulls up with Peter in his Ford Zodiac on the seafront, and they stroll along passing a woman hobbling with a Zimmer frame as Brian's eyes drift away and he frowns. Peter points over the street to a hotel, and in the bar, the Brighton Chairman extends his hand to shake.",
    "910": "Taking a deep breath, she manages a brave nod, blinking back tears as she opens the door and hurries out, while Clark Gable stares after her and Dillinger watches with shining eyes. Outside, Purvis checks his watch, posted near the box office, looking across the street at Winstead and Hurt waiting patiently in the recessed storefront. Purvis turns, gazing toward the cinema lobby, where on the movie screen, Clark Gable faces William Powell with a cocky smile, as Dillinger watches with a defiant smirk. Gable turns away from Powell, who draws a deep breath and heads into a cellblock, followed by a guard who closes a prison door and locks it. Outside the theater, Purvis digs a box of matches from his pocket and takes one out, producing a cigar from his breast pocket and holding it ready. On the movie screen, Gable makes his way down the cellblock, flanked by guards, while Dillinger wears a faint, sad smile as Gable faces a fellow convict, maintaining a faint half-smile with shining eyes. Outside, Purvis shifts his tense, vigilant gaze, and in the movie house, words appear on the screen as patrons stand, filing out of their rows. Anna tensely gets to her feet and looks around, and a few rows down, Dillinger stands with Polly and dons his straw hat, while outside, Purvis watches the exiting patrons. At the storefront, Winstead and Hurt stand ready as in the parked car, the burly agent sweats at the wheel, his right hand trembling severely, using his left to steady it. Near the cinema door, Purvis watches movie patrons exiting the lobby, facing the street, striking the match, and lighting his cigar. With a hostile sneer, the burly agent rushes out of the car as Dillinger steps into plain view, walking between Anna and Polly, the crime boss smiling thoughtfully, his younger friend wearing a carefree grin, while Anna keeps her pace with a dour expression. Shoving a bystander aside, Purvis heads down the sidewalk after them, as the burly agent joins the flow of foot traffic with his gun raised, and Martin Zarkovich notices and roughly pushes two bystanders out of his way. Purvis moves with a deliberate stride and steady gaze, while across the street, Winstead and Hurt leave the recessed storefront. Meanwhile, the burly agent scowls, holding his aim as he gains on the crime boss, a few yards ahead, where Dillinger frowns, maintaining his wide swagger. Our view hovers at the back of Dillinger's head, then we see him frown as he looks over his shoulder and halts. As he and the burly agent lock gazes, the G-man's breathing grows shallow and he lowers his gun on Dillinger, who reaches into his pocket, as Purvis tries to push between a couple and Winstead shoves between another pair, brushing a man aside.",
    "624": "A set of swings and a climbing frame stand in a rural backyard, along with a picnic table and a brick barbecue, overlooked by an upstairs window. Inside, a framed photo on a bedside table shows a smiling family: mum, dad, a young boy, and a girl. The dad wears a clerical collar. Suddenly, the same man leans up on his elbows in bed, his eyes darting feverishly around the simply furnished room. He relaxes and sits up. The man, Graham Hess, comes out of his bedroom wearing a black t-shirt and pajama bottoms. He walks along the landing in his bare feet and comes to a closed door with some hand-drawn children's pictures stuck to it. Graham pauses for a moment to listen at the door, then returns to his bedroom, picking up some discarded socks on the way. He's in his mid-40s with short dark hair and a rugged handsome face. Graham crosses the bathroom and stares out of the door, his toothbrush in his mouth. He strides across the landing, opens the door to the children's room, and glances around. A younger man in a similar rural-style bedroom suddenly jolts and tumbles out of bed. He jumps to his feet and strains to listen. Graham rushes out of his wooden farmhouse and heads towards a whitewashed barn, while the younger man runs down a flight of steps from the other floor. Graham and the young man, Merrill, charge through a field of tall green maize. They stop when they reach a gap and look along a clear pathway, which cuts through the crop. A dark-haired girl of about six-years-old stands a little further down the path. The two men run over to her, and Graham grabs her by the arms. Merrill picks up Bo, and Graham dashes on through the maize. He reaches a fair-haired boy of about 10, who stares glassily across the field. Graham turns Morgan's head to face him. Morgan puts his hand around his father's jaw and turns his head to face in the direction he had been staring. Graham stands and slowly walks through the maize, followed by Merrill, who's still carrying Bo in his arms. Graham stops and glances around anxiously. He swallows hard and tentatively steps forward onto a sea of flattened maize stalks. Graham stares in wonder as he, Merrill, Morgan, and Bo come to the perimeter of a vast circular expanse of flattened maize. Two large Alsatians pace around uneasily in the center. An aerial view shows Graham and his family standing in the circle, which is about 100 yards in diameter. Another crop circle lies beside it, the same size but with a small semi-circle of maize still standing within it.",
    "531": "The mirror shatters. Mickey, holding the rifle, is seen running over to the shattered mirror. Mickey runs offscreen briefly to answer the door. He returns onscreen, panting; he looks frantically once again around the living room. Occasionally, he is obscured by a tree trunk on the opposite side of the street; a few taxis go by as he talks over the scene. The movie cuts to the exterior of the Metro movie theater, with its smoked glass entrance doors and its Art Deco feel. An old publicity photo hangs inside. Mickey's reflection is seen at the almost-transparent doors, as well as the reflection of the street and various cars whizzing by. His reflection walks towards the theater entrance; he continues his story. Mickey walks into the movie house. He is seen through the glass doors, which still reflect the street and traffic outside. He makes his way through the lobby into the actual theater. The film abruptly cuts to the theater's black-and-white screen, where the Marx Brothers, in Duck Soup, play the helmets of several soldiers standing in a line like a live xylophone. The film cuts back to the black-and-white movie screen as Mickey continues to talk. The movie cuts back to Mickey, sitting almost obscured in the dark theater. As Mickey talks, the film cuts back to the antics of the Marx Brothers on the black-and-white theater screen. The four brothers are now swaying and singing and strutting, their voices indistinct over Mickey's narration. The film is back on Mickey's dark form in the audience. As Mickey continues, the film cuts back to Duck Soup on the black-and-white screen. The Marx Brothers are sitting on a judge's bench, playing banjos and singing with the other cast members. They jump down from the bench, still singing. The Marx Brothers kneel, strumming their banjos, and the movie cuts back to Central Park. They pass some people, a cluster of buildings that look like castles, and the Manhattan skyline as seen through the trees, as the camera moves back, farther and farther away from them, showing a beautiful Central Park, frozen in time. They stroll offscreen. Mavis passes the table, licking some food off her hand. Hannah, in the background, is busy by the stove. As Mavis leaves the kitchen, Lee enters, carrying some empty glasses. Norma walks over to a glass-doored cabinet and takes out a bottle of gin. Norma unscrews the liquor bottle and pours some into her empty glass as Hannah stops her mashing, reacting. The movie leaves the kitchen and cuts to the doorway between the dining room and the living room. Two women stand by the partially set dining room table, chatting and arranging some plates, as Elliot strolls into view, sipping a drink.",
    "1208": "Climbing the wooden ladder leading to it, he cuts the rope securing a door and pulls it open. Michael is nearest the door. Rambo removes the blindfold. Rambo leaves, passing the footless corpse of the crucified man. At the dance show, one of the soldiers pulls on a cigarette, stands, and throws the butt at the dancing girls. A woman raises an arm to protect herself. The soldier raises his arms in triumph. Another soldier throws liquid at them. The women cower. Diaz creeps between two huts and is surprised by Rambo, who's waiting there. Rambo beckons to him. At the dance, a soldier with a can of booze climbs onto the stage with a grin on his face. He slaps one of the girls on the rump. She lurches forward. The soldiers jump and wave their arms ecstatically. Lewis runs past a hut with his weapon primed. Two guards in ponchos walk over the wooden bridge. Rambo takes cover in the timbers beneath it. The soldier on stage continues to humiliate a terrified dancing woman by pouring his can of drink over her head. Rambo wades up the stream. A soldier emerges from a hut onto a veranda. He angles a lamp above his head to illuminate them. He carries a spirit-type bottle of golden-brown booze in his hand. He swigs from the bottle and goes inside. He emerges once more. He plants his hands on his head and heads away across the sodden compound. BN sneaks up to the cage, breaks open a chain on the door, and motions the women to follow him quietly. Rambo continues upstream. It rises to meet the ground of the camp and is bordered by bushes. Yards from its end, Rambo spots a Burmese soldier pushing a young boy in front of him. Rambo ducks out of sight as they go by. The dance event descends into chaos. The soldier on stage slams one of the women to the stage floor. He picks her up and throws her over the arms of his fellows below. They begin to tear at her clothes. One trooper fights the others off and leads the girl away, keeping his comrades at arms' length. The boy is pushed into another hut, where the commander is sitting. The door of the hut remains open. The commander walks up to the boy and inspects him. The commander wears a tunic decorated with ribbons. It is open, and he wears a white vest and dog tags underneath. The commander strokes the boy's head. Rambo looks away in disgust. The door closes. Rambo emerges from hiding. He checks his watch, three minutes to two. Diaz hops over a timber fence and runs up the ladders to the volunteers' cage.",
    "444": "Don freezes, his eyes turning towards the door, horrified. He rises slowly from the couch and takes a few steps towards the entrance door, where Mrs. Foley, a middle-aged charwoman with a large utility bag over her arm, stands. He stands galvanized before going to the kitchenette, where he lifts the lid of the sugar bowl on the counter under the cupboards. There's nothing but sugar in the bowl, but lining the lid is a folded five-dollar bill, which Don takes out. He goes into the entrance hall and, even though Mrs. Foley can't see him, instinctively holds the five dollars behind his back. She closes the door, takes the key, and starts down the stairs. Don looks at the five-dollar bill, folds it neatly, pockets it, puts on his hat, and, with an afterthought, goes into the living room. The camera moves slowly toward a rack of liquor bottles, showing the shop, its window on Third Avenue, and its entrance door. From behind the rack, through the glass door, Don Birnam is seen hurrying up to the shop. He peers inside to make sure there are no other customers, then quickly steps inside and stands breathing heavily. He gives a quick glance in each direction to ensure he's not observed. A salesman, with his back to the camera, rises in the foreground as Don points to two bottles. The salesman takes two bottles from the rack and puts them on the counter. Don gives him the money and picks up the bottles like a miser grabbing gold. The salesman hands him a bag and steps out of the shot towards the cash register. Meanwhile, Don thrusts the bottles in the bag. The salesman hands him his change. It is a little short, and the necks of the bottles protrude, which Don pockets. Don takes the package and walks past a newcomer towards the door, hiding it gracefully like a football in a sneak play. Don comes out with the bottles in the paper bag and stops in front of a fruit stand. Screening his gesture from the ladies with his back, he picks up three apples and puts them in the top of the bag to camouflage the bottles. He puts down a coin, then walks down the street toward the ladies, flaunting a paper bag which is obviously full of apples. The lady with the dog sees him, and although he wants to start down the street, about twenty-five feet away stand two middle-aged Hokinson ladies, one of them kerbing her dog on a leash.",
    "427": "Eddie takes his cue ball from the cashier's cage and heads for a table, and as he passes Charlie, he mimics the cashier wickedly. The two go to a table where Eddie selects a house cue, then rolls it over the table top to test the roll and seems pleased. He runs his hand over the green felt as if he were caressing it, and his last test is to sweep the cue ball into the corner pocket. Eddie takes some balls out of the return box and throws them on the table, but Big John and Preacher lean forward in their chairs to listen in. Big John, with a stubbly cigar between his fingers, drifts over to their table, and as he walks off, Eddie smiles at Charlie, saying, \"Eight sharp.\" A departing customer holds the door for an incoming one: Minnesota Fats. Heads turn when he makes his punctual appearance, and Fats' clothes reflect his high station at Ames Pool Hall: a gray felt bowler hat, and an expensive, tailored overcoat, with a carnation in its lapel and two silk handkerchiefs peeking up from its breast pocket. He moves like a sultan through the room, past Big John whose eyes dip significantly, and over to the coat rack where Henry respectfully takes his coat and hat. The buzzard-like eyes of the cashier direct his gaze toward Eddie's table as Fats withdraws a cigarette from his gold case, then casually strolls toward Eddie's table standing apart and quietly observing the sharp, precise movements of his prospective opponent. Even though Ames is filled with players, there is little noise other than the clicking of pool balls. Fats and Eddie regard each other with amusement, sharing the private joke of pool hustlers, and at his command, Ames comes to life. Players drag their chairs across the floor and position them around the main table. Eddie, hand to his mouth, realizes that the big moment has arrived and beckons to Charlie for his leather cue case. The uniformed maids withdraw the cover off the green felt top, and Sausage, the racker, begins to bang the balls into the wooden racking triangle. Fats is in the washroom, scrubbing his hands and nails, while Eddie stands and screws together his inlaid, ivory-pointed cue as Fats dries his hands. He and Fats eye one another, and Henry helps Fats on with his coat. Fats carefully extends his palms so that Henry may sprinkle on some talcum powder. Sausage finishes racking, and they are ready to start. Fats, immaculate in jacket and tie, tosses a wad of bills -- his stake money -- onto the table, and Charlie does the same, counting the bills out one by one as Willie takes the money. Two balls are rolled to the end of the table, and Fats and Eddie, like two duelers, prepare to shoot for the break.",
    "991": "They sip their vodkas, and Elizabeth takes another spoonful of caviar. They each take another swig of vodka. A reporter interviews her on the beach, and Benjamin takes her hand, and she responds. He stares at her through his round spectacles, and she looks up at him and touches his face. She smiles, and they lean together and share a kiss. She gets up from the table and walks away. Wearing a suit, Benjamin takes the lift down to the hotel lobby. Outside, they open champagne and walk through the deserted, snowy streets, arm in arm, the streetlights dimly illuminating their way, while Benjamin shivers. In the hotel, Benjamin takes a room key off a hook behind reception and gets in the lift with Elizabeth, closing the doors as the lift rises. Elizabeth wears a fur coat and a hat with a broad brim, which casts her face in shadow, as they gaze at each other. They arrive outside room 57, and he unlocks the door. He holds it open and turns to Elizabeth, who falls into his arms, and they disappear into the room. Caroline smiles and keeps reading. Returning from work, Benjamin gets in the lift at the hotel, where Elizabeth's po-faced husband is the only other occupant. Benjamin avoids his gaze as the lift rises. In the evening, he and Elizabeth go to room 57, where Elizabeth kisses him twice as they leave the room. She starts to walk away down the corridor, looks back, smiles, and goes. He comes downstairs and finds the lobby deserted, as well as the dining room and the kitchen. He looks over at the bar, then takes a seat by the fire in the lobby. As the night wears on, Benjamin drifts off to sleep. When he wakes, people are milling around the lobby. Looking awkward, Mr. Mayes heads out of the bar, past Benjamin, while Captain Mike swigs from a coffee cup. Benjamin unlocks his door and finds a note has been pushed under it. At night, on board the tugboat, Benjamin, who'd just thrown a bucket of water over the side of the ship, goes below decks and lies on his bed, reading a magazine. One of the other sailors, Pleasant, calls down from his top bunk and hands Benjamin a big roll of notes, before lying back out of Benjamin's sight. Up on deck, Benjamin and the other crew members walk towards the prow of the tug, passing Mike, who's ringing the alarm bell, as they look out into the night. Up ahead of them, they see several burning ships on the dark horizon, while Pleasant runs up to a searchlight mounted by the wheelhouse. Dead bodies drift in the dark waters, and in the wheelhouse, the wheelman kills the engines.",
    "1112": "The car flies high over the tops of the tall trees, zooms over the forest, and lands heavily on the grass beside Hagrid's cottage. They stagger out as the battered car starts itself, reverses, changes direction, and drives away past Hagrid's cottage, disappearing into the trees at the edge of the dark forest. The sun rises behind the towers and turrets of Hogwarts School. In the hospital wing, Harry puts some fresh flowers on the table by Hermione's bed, and he and Ron sit sadly beside their petrified friend. Harry gently strokes her hand and notices something clutched in her clenched fingers—a crumpled piece of paper, a page from a book. Harry looks puzzled for a moment, then spots his reflection in the window and reads from the page again. Harry and Ron hide in the second-floor corridor where the teachers are gathering. Lockhart swaggers up, swallows nervously, and hurries away. Harry and Ron look horrified as the worried teachers leave and Ron reads out the message written in blood on the wall. They run to Lockhart's room, where Lockhart is packing, grabbing his wand. The boys point their wands at him, and he drops his. In the girls' lavatory, Myrtle spots the three of them coming in, points across the room, and floats away. Harry crosses to the ring of sinks set around the base of an ornate marble structure, looks up, runs his hand along the ledge above, twists the tap, and notices a raised decoration on the side of it—a copper snake. Running his finger over it, Lockhart looks aghast. Staring at the tiny snake, Harry concentrates hard, opens his mouth, and speaks. They all step back as the heavy top of the structure rises into the air, the sinks around the base divide and move away from each other, and the sink decorated with the snake slowly disappears downwards. As it reaches the ground, a heavy metal grill slides over it, uncovering a deep shaft. Lockhart looks down into it, then backs away, but they grab him, and he almost falls down the shaft. He stares down it as Ron gives him a push and Lockhart disappears. They stare down after him as Harry jumps, quickly followed by Ron. The shaft becomes a smooth pipe, and they slide down it and fall onto a floor covered with animal bones. They point their wands at Lockhart, who is covered in dirt. Ron notices the bones on the ground and makes Lockhart follow Harry through a huge pipe. The pipe leads to a low cave where something scaly is lying on the ground, and Lockhart faints. Leaping up, Lockhart grabs Ron's wand.",
    "202": "George regards the two of them with manly disgust; they are like two kids to him, and a nuisance. He starts over for the candy counter and gives Violet a paper sack containing licorice shoelaces. Violet gives him the money, jumps down off her stool, and exits, while Mary, watching, sticks out her tongue as she passes. George puts some chocolate ice cream in a dish, pulls a magazine from his pocket, shows it to her, and leans down to finish scooping out the ice cream, his deaf ear toward her. Mary, whispering, leans over and speaks softly. She then draws back quickly, looking down, terrified at what she has said as he turns back to the cash register, whistling. He observes the entrance to the prescription room at the end of the fountain as Gower comes to the entrance, bleary-eyed, unshaven, and chewing an old unlit cigar, with a gruff and mean manner. Evidently, he has been drinking. George turns back to the cash register when he notices an open telegram on the shelf. He is about to toss it aside when he starts to read it and then sets it down. A goodness of heart expresses itself in a desire to do something for Gower; he gives the ice cream to Mary without comment and sidles back toward Gower. Gower, drunk, is intent on putting some capsules into a box. George looks curiously at Gower, realizing that he is quite drunk. Gower fumbles and drops some of the capsules to the floor, with capsules spilling on the floor at their feet. Gower waves George aside, takes his old wet cigar, shoves it in his mouth, and sits in an old Morris chair in the background. George picks up the capsule box, not knowing what to do or say, turns a bottle around from which Gower has taken the powder for the capsules, and stands still, horrified. His fingers fumble, and his eyes go, harassed, to the bottle labeled poison. George comes out into the main room, and with an inspiration, he dashes out the door and down the street, followed by Mary's eyes. He stops as Potter's carriage is waiting at the entrance. Suddenly, he runs up the stairs to offices that are ancient and a bit on the rickety side. The office vibrates with an aura of crisis as George enters and proceeds directly toward his father's office. There is a counter with a grill, something like a bank. With him at the door, also listening, are Cousin Tilly Bailey, a waspish-looking woman who is the telephone operator, and Cousin Eustace Bailey, the clerk. As George is about to enter his father's office, Uncle Billy grabs him by the arm.",
    "519": "She slams it closed, distracted. Gail sighs. She pops a piece of gum into her mouth as Mickey continues to speak. Mickey sighs. Pedestrians pass. The camera moves up the hotel's facade, past its welcoming flags, to its ornate windows several floors up. Elliot, his back to the camera, is opening the door to Lee. Elliot closes the door behind her as she enters. They stand very close to each other, framed by the door and a stark, subtly striped wallpapered wall. They walk towards the camera, further into the room. Elliot puts his arm around Lee. The camera follows Lee as she walks towards the curtained windows, past a fireplace, a mirror, some innocuous pictures, a delicate table holding a lamp, the foot of the bed. She parts a corner of the curtains, looking out the window, turning when Elliot speaks. He walks over to Lee by the curtained windows. He takes Lee into his arms. They kiss, their figures almost silhouetted in the warm glow of the room. Elliot takes Lee's coat off without breaking the kiss. They embrace. They kiss each other lightly, then stronger, more passionately, their embrace much tighter. The harpsichord music begins to play again as the camera moves over the bed covers to reveal Lee, lying contentedly under the sheets, her hair fanned out on the pillows, one arm near her head. He enters the screen, sitting down on the edge of the bed next to Lee. He holds a cigarette. Elliot chuckles; they hold hands. Elliot leans down to Lee; they begin to kiss passionately. Lee walks along the sidewalk in the rain; she's bareheaded. A car drives by; a pedestrian passes holding an umbrella. Lee passes a restaurant well lit inside by hanging lamps. The baroque music continues as she enters the loft, her head soaked. She closes the door, touching her soaking hair. Lee walks through the loft's living room area, unbelting her coat, towards the bathroom. She passes Frederick, who sits at a table in the kitchen area, drinking a cup of coffee and reading the paper. As he talks, Lee is seen turning on the bathroom light. She takes off her coat, hanging it on a hook, then begins to dry her hair with a towel. Frederick takes a bite of his sandwich and another sip of coffee as Lee walks out of the bathroom, tossing the towel down on the counter. She takes a kettle and fills it with water. As Frederick continues his monologue, Lee is busy in the background: striking a wooden match and lighting a burner on the stove for the kettle, taking a glass out of the cupboard, walking into the bathroom for some pills, filling the glass with water in the kitchen sink, and taking her pills.",
    "1266": "He turns and checks behind him. He turns back and lifts up the golden snitch bequeathed to him by Dumbledore. The writing on it appears. Harry studies it. He lifts the golden snitch to his mouth and presses it to his lips. The outer casing opens. The inner casing revolves to create an opening. Inside, a polished octagonal stone. On one surface, a circle is inscribed inside a triangle, down the middle of which is a line. The stone floats out of the snitch. Harry places the palm of his right hand under the floating stone. He carefully clenches his fist around it. His eyes are closed. Harry slowly opens them and stares ahead. In front of him stand his parents, with Sirius and Remus. Lily stretches out her hand. Harry goes to take it, but his hand passes right through hers. They gaze at each other. Lily lowers her hand. Lily smiles. Harry turns to Sirius and takes a few paces forward. Harry nods at his father, James. Harry turns and gazes at his mother, then moves towards her. He looks across at his father. Sirius points at Harry's heart. Once again, Harry's gaze lights upon his mother. Harry unclenches his fist. The Resurrection Stone falls gently onto the forest floor. Voldemort stands in a clearing in the forest. Voldemort opens his eyes and glares at the gaunt-faced Death Eater. Bellatrix Lestrange walks up behind Voldemort, who takes a few paces forward. He turns around. Bellatrix lowers her head reverentially as he passes her, the Elder Wand clasped in his right hand. He stops and half turns his head. Bellatrix peers through the gloom and sees Harry coming into the clearing. Voldemort flexes his neck and looks back over his shoulder. He turns to face Harry. Hagrid sees him. Voldemort stares at the teenager who stands unwavering in front of him. Nagini slithers past Hagrid towards Voldemort, who steadies himself and raises his wand. Harry stands, unflinching. Harry closes his eyes. A stream of green light flashes from the Elder Wand and hits Harry full on. Bright white light. Harry comes to. He's clean-shaven, unbruised, and without his spectacles. He stands silhouetted against a completely white background. Behind him in the whiteness, there's a small bench. He walks over to it and bends down to peer underneath the bench. He recoils when he sees a tiny, skeletal, red, raw naked figure curled up in a fetal position. Dumbledore steps towards him. Dumbledore wears a silvery white robe in the vista of white. Harry looks around. He glances back at the fetal figure. They stroll along the platform and sit down on a bench. Dumbledore gets to his feet.",
    "358": "Merry sits up with a worried look on his face as Pippin unwraps the Palantír and gazes intently into it, horrifying Merry. As Pippin lays his hands on the crystal, a sickly pale light slowly spreads from the glass ball onto Pippin's face, and he suddenly starts to hyperventilate. The Great Eye of Sauron seems to leap from the fire, and Pippin is bathed in the fiery red light. Pippin sinks to his knees, his mouth open in a soundless scream, and falls backward, powerless to release the fiery. Gandalf wakes with a start just as Aragorn enters and wrenches the Palantír from Pippin's hands. Aragorn spins away, reeling backward, and the Palantír falls from his hands, rolling across the floor and causing everyone in the room to cower back. Gandalf throws a blanket over it, with angry disbelief on his face, and rounds on Pippin. Gandalf lifts the hobbit's slumped head. A lone white tree is silhouetted by flames. Gandalf stares at Pippin, frightened. Théoden stands in the Golden Hall, gravely listening to Gandalf, while Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli look on. Gimli lets out a sigh of relief. Gandalf turns to look at Théoden, who listens intently, saying nothing, as he knows Gandalf speaks the truth. Gandalf rounds on Théoden, who holds Gandalf's gaze, while Aragorn turns to look at Théoden. Gandalf turns on his heel and hurries along the streets, with Pippin and Merry running alongside trying to keep up. Pippin catches up to Merry, but Merry turns away, as it is too much for him. He turns on Pippin, and Pippin's face is shown as Merry strides away. Pippin is dumped unceremoniously onto the back of Shadowfax as Gandalf hurriedly prepares to leave. Merry thrusts a small package into Pippin's hand, and Pippin stares down at the leather-bound bundle of pipe-weed. A worried Merry exchanges glances with Gandalf. Gandalf mounts Shadowfax and spurs the great horse forward, thundering out of the stables, with a close-up on Merry's devastated face. Shadowfax carries Gandalf and Pippin out of the gate and down the winding road towards the plains of Rohan. Merry clambers up a watchtower, with Aragorn in pursuit, and watches his best friend disappear into the distance, knowing what it is to lose someone. Meanwhile, Arwen, escorted by a small entourage of elves, rides through the gathering darkness of a pine forest. As Arwen rides through the forest, a small boy of about five suddenly runs across the path in front of her. Arwen reigns in Asfaloth, intrigued by something about the boy, though she does not know why. As Arwen watches, the boy moves away, and the trees begin to thin.",
    "824": "Cal studies himself in a mirror and picks a shirt. They look through jackets, and Cal is measured for a suit. He opens his wallet and tries on a store trilby. In a jeans store, Jacob looks skywards and marches off, with Cal hurrying after him. Jacob turns back, shrugs, and slaps Cal's cheeks. In a hairdresser's, which is Cal's hairdresser, he steps out in his new garb. Jacob steps confidently over to Cal, and later, they sit in the bar together. Cal shrugs, and Jacob raises his eyebrows as Cal is wearing a sharp blue suit. Jacob and Cal approach a group of women on a couch. Amy looks down awkwardly, then turns away as Jacob points at Cal and she nods. Cal watches Jacob leave with all the different women, including two at the same time. A beautiful dark-haired woman with olive skin heads towards Cal, and he can't take his eyes off her. She wears a low-cut black dress and makes a beeline for him, shakes her silky hair from her face, and Cal smiles. She reaches the table and presents Cal with the bill, revealing they've racked up a bill of $837.57. Cal's smile disappears, and she presses the button, but the page comes out completely black. She screws her eyes shut as a guy spots her and stops, then comes into the room. In a classroom, a teacher writes on the blackboard while Robbie is texting on his mobile. At her locker, Jessica receives the text, frowns, shakes her head, and texts back. Robbie receives the text, stands, and a blonde girl smiles before he sits back down. Emily comes out of the assistant principal's office to Robbie, who is waiting, and they traipse out together. Robbie chuckles softly, Emily smiles, and puts an arm around his shoulder. In her office, Emily types at her computer and glances up as Robbie glides past her desk on an office chair, stopping opposite her. She glances at a photo on the shelf, then looks at Robbie, who shrugs. It's a photo of her and Cal. She lays it face down and turns back to Robbie, frowns, smiles, takes a deep breath, and continues typing. She nods somberly, knits her fingers together, and puts her head against her hands. David smiles, and Robbie shakes his head disapprovingly. Emily heads off, and David swaggers away, then pauses. He turns back and eyes Robbie, who stares back at him impassively. David heads back to Emily's office, glances around, and enters with a grin on his face. David sits, and Robbie pulls a lever under his chair, raising it so he looks down on David. She frowns at David, who waves, and Robbie places the photo of Emily and Cal firmly at the front of his mom's desk and marches out.",
    "490": "Malcolm points to the huge framed certificate propped up on a dining room chair, which is printed on aged parchment-type paper and housed in a polished mahogany frame. He slips on the sweatshirt as Anna's attention slowly moves to the framed certificate. She leans forward in her seat, reads the certificate out loud while Malcolm tries to tickle her, and then turns to Malcolm, who smiles. Anna takes Malcolm's hands and holds them steady, then lets go, her eyes emotional. Anna leans towards him, and they hold each other tight as their sweet laughter fills the house. Two giggling shadows appear in the bedroom doorway, trying to turn on the light, when a stranger slowly looks up for the first time, his eyes locking on Malcolm. The stranger suddenly moves forward into the doorway, causing Malcolm to stumble back onto the edge of the bed. Anna sees the stranger for the first time, her face draining of color. The stranger looks at Malcolm, half grins, as Anna's expression instantly changes. The stranger turns and glares at Malcolm, who stops all movement and stands. Tears fall down the stranger's face as Malcolm looks up at the sound of those words, and Vincent Gray stares with surprise through his tears. Malcolm lets out a deep breath like he just emerged from deep waters as Vincent's eyes burn at Malcolm, fully crying now. Vincent turns to the sink, his hand goes in, and he turns around, raises a gun at Malcolm, and fires. Malcolm clutches his stomach and folds like a rag doll onto the bed, and Vincent instantly moves the gun to his own head. Handwritten notes fill every line as Malcolm glances through the page and sees words and phrases circled throughout the file. Sitting on a sidewalk bench facing a row of brownstone homes across the street, Malcolm gazes blankly at the brownstones until a door opens, bringing him out of his trance as Cole Sear steps out of his front door. Cole is a munchkin of a boy with large, black eyes that seem to take in everything around him, his hair dark with a small patch of jet white on the side. Cole carefully locks the door behind him, reaches into his pocket, and slips on a pair of very large glasses that look comical on him. Malcolm rises to his feet, but when he looks up, Cole is gone. Malcolm barely catches a glimpse of the boy as Cole runs at full speed down the street and turns the corner. Stuffing the file in his bag, Malcolm starts running too, hauling down the sidewalk, and comes to a hard stop at a street intersection as Cole sprints across the empty lot, reaching the doors of a building.",
    "1102": "Sitting on his porch, he looks over at the road, where Sue helps two other women get out of a car. She walks over towards him as he sips from a beer can. He's tempted. They go next door. Walt opens the well-stocked fridge. He pats a child's head. Everyone gives him disapproving looks. Sue steers him away. At a buffet table, he looks at the buffet. Sue brings Walt another beer and finds him staring at the elder in ceremonial dress sitting across the room. The old man stares back. She goes over to Kor Khue. They go over to Walt. Walt sits down in a chair, and Kor Khue studies his craggy features. Walt looks thoughtful. Troubled Walt looks up at the diminutive Kor Khue, who nods. Walt gets to his feet and walks across the room. He looks into the next room, where some women are having tea. Sue watches him as he begins to cough. He coughed up blood onto the back of his hand. He quickly conceals it from Sue and hurries away upstairs. She follows him. Walt disappears into the bathroom and shuts the door behind him. He rinses his face in the basin and regards his reflection in the mirror. He dries his face. He opens the bathroom door. As he sits at the table, women fuss around him and load his plate with food. Sue wanders into the kitchen and finds him tucking in. Very reluctantly he gets up. Sue leads Walt down into the basement, where the younger generations of Hmongs have gathered. Walt looks singularly unimpressed. Sue smiles and goes towards Thao, who sits alone, away from the others. Walt leans against a tumble dryer. It rocks under his weight. He puts his beer down and fiddles about underneath the tumble dryer, adjusting its legs to stabilize it. Some of the youngsters look over at him, on his hands and knees. He notices them looking. He gets back up, pats the drier, and leans against it for a moment. Satisfied it's OK, he begins to wander across the basement. He eyes an attractive Hmong girl who's sitting with some boys. Walt notices she keeps glancing over at Thao. Walt drinks from a beer bottle and walks over to Sue who offers him a glass of clear liquid. He takes a sip and Sue wanders off. Walt puts his beer down and looks back over at the girl sitting with the boys. Walt glances over at Thao sitting on his own, looking miserable. She keeps looking at Thao. The girl gets up and walks up behind Walt. He turns around and sees her. She wanders off and he stares after her.",
    "632": "He stares into her eyes and nods. Graham's eyes fill with tears as he reaches out to take her hand in his and stares at her, puzzled, through his wet eyes as her head lowers. Graham remembers his conversation with Merrill, and his eyes, glazed with tears, focus on the alien as it rocks back and forth, leaning over its captive hanging limply over its arm. Graham turns slowly from the creature to face Merrill, spotting the baseball bat in its rack mounted on the wall by his brother. He turns back around to stare with stern determination at the alien. Merrill remains motionless, but then turns his gaze from the creature to Graham and looks behind him to the bat. The alien watches him, its small eyes glowing green in their sunken sockets. Merrill takes the bat down as the alien lowers its hand over Morgan's face, injecting a gray gash shooting from the spike into Morgan's nose. The alien turns, and Merrill launches himself at the creature, striking it in the back, causing the alien to drop Morgan and turn to face its assailant. Graham rushes over to pick up Morgan and the dropped syringe while Merrill strikes the creature in its abdomen. It falls into a side table, knocking over a glass of water, and as the water spills onto its shoulder, an angry red wound erupts in its green-gray skin. Merrill and Graham stare around the room at the collection of discarded glasses of water, and Graham turns to Bo in astonishment before hurrying outside with Morgan in his arms, Bo following him. On the veranda, Bo looks back into the living room through a broken window as Graham heads out onto the lawn. Merrill swings the bat at glasses on the coffee table, and the alien recoils as its skin is splashed with liquid. Crouched on the lawn, Graham, holding his son across his thighs, adjusts the syringe and thrusts it into Morgan's leg. Merrill prepares for another strike, slamming the bat into the alien, causing the creature to topple over, landing on its back and knocking against a small sideboard, causing glasses on the sideboard to tip over, with water cascading down onto the crib. The broken head of the bat lies on the floor, surrounded by shards of glass, while the alien takes deep, difficult breaths, its chest sinking and failing to rise. Merrill hurries out into the garden and crouches down by Graham and Morgan. Graham, his eyes closed, cradles his limp son as Merrill presses Morgan's neck and recoils, turning away. Bo's face creases as she begins to sob, but then Graham opens his moistened eyes and his face shudders. Merrill swings round as Bo looks on in awe, and Graham turns, hardly daring to look at his son as Morgan lifts his head.",
    "1065": "They stare at each other and she smiles breathlessly, Drover smiles suavely at her, and she grins broadly. Allsop signals to the band as Drover makes his way down the steps towards the teeming dance floor. He and Sarah move slowly towards each other, and she smiles in delighted disbelief while he grins, his hand casually in his left pocket, as they come together. She smiles demurely, and arm-in-arm, they head for the dance floor. Carney's wife and the other women stare at them, while up on a balcony, Fletcher grabs a black waitress' hand. Sarah helps him through the steps as Carney watches and swigs from a bottle, and Fletcher does the same. Carney watches the dance, laughing heartily and drinks deeply. Drover and Sarah dance cheek-to-cheek, she smiles and nods. In the night, lightning flashes over Darwin Wharf, and he looks at her seriously. She turns and looks up at the storm clouds then closes her eyes, tilting her face up to catch the rain. They kiss as it starts to pour down, and the crowds at the pub cheer the rain's arrival and dance in the street. At the outdoor theater, the audience leave their seats, all except Nullah, who continues to stare, transfixed, at the screen. The ball guests huddle on the colonnaded verandah of the house where Carney holds court, as people dance around Drover and Sarah in the rain-soaked street. Sarah holds her hands joyfully in the air while Goolaj remains in his seat at the theater smiling happily at the downpour. Smiling, Fletcher staggers towards the soaking dance floor, trips over a plant pot, and falls flat on his face. Sarah kisses Drover as Carney steps away from his daughter to approach Fletcher. Sarah and Drover continue to kiss passionately, their eyes lock together, but she closes the cab door rather than get in. A servant holds an umbrella over Carney's head as he walks up to the fallen Fletcher, scowls at his drunken son-in-law, and walks off, while Fletcher nods slowly, watching him go. On the screen, Dorothy clicks her emerald heels together, as Drover and Sarah run up the stairs to Sarah's room with the balcony. Indoors, they kiss passionately, break apart, and stare at one another. They look longingly at each other, and naked in bed, they make love tenderly. He kisses her neck, they touch gently, he slides the dress off her shoulders, and she opens the front of his shirt. She pulls the shirt off his muscled torso and, in just her petticoat, pulls him down onto the bed. They lie in each other's arms, naked, covered by just a sheet, as the door to the room swings closed, with lightning flashing and the rain pouring down on nighttime Darwin.",
    "662": "At the Genetic Research Institute, a monitor behind Peter displays the DNA of a new species of spider like the one which bit him. Meanwhile, a man in a green flight suit stands on a levitating glider. Norman turns to Strom as the general walks away, leaving Norman pensive. In a suburban house, Peter's Uncle Ben changes a light bulb while Peter, leaving his concerned aunt and uncle downstairs, absently makes his way upstairs to his room. He strips off his shirt and vest, his skinny frame wavering in front of a tall mirror, then collapses on his bed before rolling onto the floor. He grabs the tartan blanket from the bed and hauls it over himself. Flashing through Peter's mind are images of spiders, DNA, a helix being split, and another part being fused, sending a surge of power. At Oscorp, Norman strips to the waist and takes a bottle from Strom, gulping down its contents. He flings the bottle to the floor, lifts open the metal on the sliding trolley, and lies down on it. Strom fastens the manacles over Norman's chest, legs, and upper arms, firmly attaching him to the trolley. The grim-faced Strom hurries to a control panel as the trolley glides into a large glass chamber. The doors slide closed, the trolley raises from horizontal to vertical, and Norman remains firmly locked in. Strom looks on as Norman nods to him. Strom pushes a switch and watches as a large file containing a green liquid empties, vapor rising in the chamber and engulfing Norman. Strom observes a computer-generated image of the green gas level in the chamber rising and monitors Norman's physiology as his heart rate increases to 140. Norman's body convulses, prompting Strom to run to the panel and vent the gas chamber. Norman's head shakes, showing only the whites of his eyes before he flat lines. Strom enters the chamber and attempts heart massage standing up. The pulse returns, Norman's eyes flash open, and he grabs Strom by the throat, flinging him through the glass of the chamber. Now freed, Norman leaps out strong. Meanwhile, Peter wakes from his fitful sleep and picks himself up off the floor, reaching for his spectacles. He puts them on, then quickly takes them off, trying again before removing them once more. He holds them up in front of his face, realizing that when he looks through them everything is blurred, but when he moves them away his vision is clear.",
    "1082": "Asael covers up the potato stash with some sacking and climbs out of the hole. In one of the huts, Layla sits huddled at a table while Shimon and Malbin are trying to keep a chess game going on their knees. Weaver, the nurse, is rubbing ointment onto a man's frost-bitten toes. Rachel is sitting with her grandfather, and Lazar addresses those present. In his cabin, Tuvia knocks back some vodka and stares grimly ahead, and later in the snowy woodland, he comes into a clearing holding his horse by its bridle, strokes its white muzzle, and with a deep sigh takes his revolver out of its holster. Malbin, hurrying through the snow with an armful of kindling, stops in his tracks as Arkady insists on a bigger portion than the rest. Morosely, Tuvia watches the people elbowing each other out of the way and walks past Malbin without acknowledging him. Elsewhere in the forest, Commander Panchenko and Gramov ride ahead of the column of soldiers who are walking behind them. At their base camp, Zus gulps back some vodka and passes the bottle to Panchenko, who drains it and tosses it over his shoulder. Zus looks across at Viktor Panchenko and turns his face to the side. At the camp, Tuvia, in his heavy gray coat and hat, machine gun over his shoulder, steps into a dark cabin where Lilka is sitting by a stove. He puts the gun down, whips off his hat, throws a small log into the stove, smiles at her as he rubs his hands and his cheeks tense. He drapes his coat around her shoulders, and she thanks him with a nod. Reaching into his trouser pocket, he brings out his revolver, flashes her a brief smile, and she goes, observed from outside the door by Arkady who leers in at him. Lazar is with a wounded man as Tuvia sees Lilka setting off to find food. Lilka, wrapped up in Tuvia's coat and her shawl over her head with a bag over her shoulder, goes off into the wintry forest and wanders into a frosty dell. There are animal tracks in the snow ahead of her, and through the mist, she sees an Alsatian staring back at her. She starts to retreat, and the hound bounds towards her; she turns and runs as it leaps on her back, knocking her down. She leans up against a tree and watches in terror as it tears at the food stock with its sharp teeth. She stretches out her hand to reach the sack, and as the dog bares its teeth and leaps up, they both fall to the ground. She raises her head, holding the gun, and walks back to camp with the dead dog slung across her shoulders.",
    "275": "A policeman from inside the house is taking Nathan by the elbow, and as Nathan allows himself to be led back into the house, he calls back over his shoulder. We follow the two, hand-held, as the police lead Nathan toward the living room. The room is filled with policemen milling about in several different uniforms: local police, state troopers, and plainclothes detectives. The original policeman is leading Nathan to a table where a white-smocked technician is preparing an inkpad and exemplar sheets. The dialogue is urgent, rapid-fire, and overlapping. Byrum has taken Nathan's right hand and is rolling its fingers onto the inkpad, but Nathan jerks his hand away. Two men in conservative suits are approaching as Nathan gives his hand back and raises his voice at an offscreen bellower. Nathan is getting worked up and he grabs the overcoat being displayed by FBI #2. Nathan realizes that he's gotten ink from his fingerprinting all over the coat and furiously kicks it. Throughout the speech, Nathan stalks the room, working himself into a frenzy, furiously putting coffee cups onto coasters, generally cleaning up, hectoring the police, and swiping their feet off his furniture. Specifically, it is the hole in the muddy patch of earth that Gale and Evelle climbed out of. We are pulling back to reveal the feet—the shiny black patent leather shoes and blue pants cuffs—becoming quickly spattered—of several policemen milling about the hole, while German shepherds sniff around. With a roar, motorcycle wheels enter the frame, and the bike's jackbooted rider casually tools around the hole once; police step back, and dogs skitter away to give him room. He backs toward the camera and stops, standing astride the bike, while the whipcracking biker cue mixes up. The biker shakes his head; he doesn't think they went that way. Suddenly, with a loud whipcrack effect, the biker's head snaps to profile as he stares across the field, stock-still, having heard, smelled, or sensed something. The dogs milling around the hole also react, snapping to attention a split second after the biker, as a jackrabbit is bounding away at the far end of the field. After a moment, their attention returns to the hole, and his attention also returns to the matter at hand as he squints, concentrating. His bike rumbles. It is the bathroom where we earlier saw Gale and Evelle combing their hair, now empty. The bathroom is quiet except for the dripping sink and the faint rumble of an approaching motorcycle, which grows louder, then begins to recede as the bike shoots by the station. Suddenly, we hear the screech of the bike's brakes, and we are on the road outside the gas station as the motorcycle screeches to a halt in the foreground.",
    "251": "Vincent smiles and Mia giggles as Vincent turns around. We're in the living room of a modest two-bedroom house in Alhambra, California, in the year 1972. Butch's mother, around 35, stands in the doorway leading into the living room, next to a man dressed in the uniform of an American Air Force officer. The camera captures the perspective of a five-year-old boy as Koons steps inside the room toward the child, bending on one knee to match the boy's eyeline. When Koons speaks, he has a slight Texas accent and pulls a gold wristwatch out of his pocket, handing it to Butch. A little hand enters the frame to accept it. The 27-year-old Butch Coolidge is shown dressed in boxing regalia—trunks, shoes, and gloves—lying on a table catching a few zzzz's before a big fight. He wakes up suddenly, shaken by the bizarre memory, and wipes his sweaty face with a boxing glove. His trainer Klondike, an older fireplug, opens the door slightly, peeking into the room as pandemonium breaks out behind him in the hallway. A taxi is parked in a dark alley next to an auditorium, and we slowly dolly toward the parked car while the sound of the car radio is heard from inside. A young woman with Spanish looks sits in the car, drinking steaming hot coffee from a white Styrofoam cup as sportscasters continue their coverage. Esmarelda clicks the radio off, sips her coffee, and hears a noise from behind in the alley. She sticks her head out of the car door to investigate and sees a window about three stories high open on the auditorium side of the alley. A gym bag is tossed out into a garbage dumpster below, followed by Butch Coolidge, still in boxing trunks, shoes, gloves, and a yellow robe, leaping into the dumpster. Esmarelda registers the strangeness of this scene as Butch, soaking wet and naked except for his trunks, shoes, and gloves, hops into the backseat and slams the door. Esmarelda stares straight ahead and talks to Butch through the rearview mirror as he gets one of his boxing gloves off. Esmarelda watches in the rearview mirror, then presses a button to roll down the back window. Butch tosses his boxing glove out, starts untying the other one, and Esmarelda can’t stay quiet anymore. As he tosses his other glove out the window, he finishes wiping himself down and tosses the towel out. Silence ensues as Butch digs in his bag for a t-shirt.",
    "1193": "Hagrid lifts Harry down, and Malfoy struts forward. Buckbeak rears and attacks Malfoy, and Hagrid lifts Malfoy up. As Hagrid carries Malfoy away, the hippogriff gently nudges Harry, and he strokes its beak. Back at Hogwarts, a ghostly knight crashes through a window carrying a severed head, and a headless horseman follows him through the Great Hall. Harry stares at the picture of Sirius Black in the newspaper and sees a raging man with wild, staring eyes struggling violently with his prison guards. A foxglove grows in stony ground, and a Dementor floats past. Frost appears on the petals, and the flower immediately dies. A wardrobe, and he whispers to Neville. The wardrobe door slowly opens, and Professor Snape steps out, dressed as an old lady with a red handbag. Ron is pushed to the front, and Ron steps forward, reluctantly. Snape becomes a huge, black spider, and Ron's hair stands on end as it moves towards him, clicking its pincers. He reaches for his wand as it wears roller-skates and sprawls across the floor. Parvati faces a huge cobra and a jack in the box. Harry steps forward, and Lupin watches him closely. A hideous Dementor, and Lupin jumps in front of him. A full moon appears, half hidden by clouds, and the moon becomes a balloon, which zooms around the classroom and back into the wardrobe. Ron and Hermione follow the other students, leaving Harry alone in the quadrangle. Harry talks to Professor Lupin, and Harry grins, proudly. On the staircase, and the other portraits are distraught. Weeping and wailing, the painted characters run from picture to picture. Dumbledore and Filch, the caretaker, stare at the empty painting. Dumbledore runs his finger across the slashed canvas as Filch looks around, suspiciously. In a picture of the African plains, the fat lady hides behind a hippopotamus. The heavy portcullis is lowered, and the huge gates are closed and firmly secured by a system of strong iron locks, which swing neatly into place, one after the other. The Dementors keep guard outside the school as all of the students sleep in the Great Hall. Harry is wide-awake and listening. On the ceiling of the Great Hall, a star shoots across the celestial sky. A single autumn leaf flutters down from the Whomping Willow, then all the leaves fall at once and the tree shakes its bare branches. Snape enters the classroom and closes the shutters with his wand, and he pulls down a screen. They open their books. Malfoy has his arm in a sling, and he taps a projector and turns Ron's pages. Malfoy throws Harry an animated cartoon of Harry being hit on the head in a Quidditch match. An umbrella is whirled aloft by a gale force wind, and around the Quidditch pitch, sodden spectators stand in the driving rain, cheering their teams.",
    "889": "He falters for a moment, then his smile returns. Lydia and Kitty are enjoying a card game with the officers. Mr. Wickham, now resplendent in his red uniform, watches them with amusement before sitting down next to Lizzie. He leans forward in his seat. They smile at Lydia's celebrations. Lizzie looks thoughtful. Her eyes meet Mr. Wickham's and they smile at each other warmly. She watches him dance with Lydia and smiles to herself. A bedroom. She lowers her eyes coyly. Jane looks unsure. He giggles. A look between Lizzie and Jane. Lydia and Kitty are being pushed on a swing by two uniformed officers. Mr. Collins reluctantly follows Jane, leaving Wickham and Lizzie alone. They stroll through the garden together. She turns to him. They watch as Kitty jumps from the swing into the arms of an officer. Then, they set off walking again. Lizzie smiles contentedly to herself. Now, Mrs. Bennet rushes into Lizzie's room, where a maid is seeing to her hair. Lizzie pops out her cheeks. She runs out of the room. Mr. Collins is leaving his room. He's shocked to bump into the half-dressed Lydia. He tries to pass her, but the landing is too small. He covers his eyes and walks hurriedly past the giggling Lydia. Knowing the laughter is at him, he regains his composure before heading down the stairs. Night time at Netherfield Hall. A constant stream of carriages drop guests at the doors. Mr. Collins helps Lizzie and Jane down from their carriage. As they make their way up a flight of steps, Lizzie spots Darcy looking out of a window. He catches her eye, then turns away. The family makes its way inside, where their cloaks are taken by footmen in wigs. Jane and Lizzie look around the room excitedly before being received by the Bingleys. Lizzie steps away from her family and looks around the room searchingly. Mr. Bingley standing with Jane calls over to her. He offers her his arm, then leads them both through to the next room. Musicians are playing at one end of a large wooden-floored room. Mr. Bingley escorts the sisters proudly through the gathered guests, nodding greetings to uniformed officers and finely attired ladies. Lizzie looks around the other guests while Jane and Bingley chatter happily together. A hopeful smile plays across her lips when she spots a group of red-coated officers gathered in a corner. Darcy is standing a little behind the group. He turns his head, and he and Lizzie catch each other's eye for a moment before she hastily looks away. He continues looking at her. A beautiful smile crosses her face, when Denny breaks away from the others and joins her.",
    "410": "Ben turns and walks down the hall, then they enter the sunroom. She nods, and he looks at her as she pours herself a drink and hands him one. She turns on the phonograph, and Ben looks at her. They look at each other, and Ben is half standing. He puts his hand up and retreats around the other side of the chair. She looks at him, then Mrs. Robinson and Ben move out of the sunroom, into the hall, up the stairs, and along the hall to the doorway of Elaine's room. Ben moves into the room and looks up at the portrait while Mrs. Robinson watches him in the background. He steps back, and she turns her back. Ben reaches forward and pulls the zipper down, and Mrs. Robinson lets her dress fall to the floor. Benjamin walks out of the door and down the hall as the camera pushes with him to the door. We see the entire stairway and part of the downstairs hall as Ben gets to the stairs and starts down. She walks out of the shot, and Ben starts back up the stairs. Ben slowly climbs the stairs, gets to the top, and starts slowly down the hall. Ben walks quickly into Elaine's room, crosses to the bed, and puts the purse down. As he starts to turn back, he looks up at Elaine's portrait and notices a movement reflected in the glass. He turns quickly to see Mrs. Robinson, naked, shutting the door to the bedroom behind her. She smiles, and Ben leaps at the door, pushes Mrs. Robinson aside, struggles with the door, gets it open, runs into the hall, and down the stairs. Ben rushes into the sunroom and sits down, then jumps up to get the glass he had been drinking from and sits down again. There is the sound of the front door opening and closing, and footsteps approach the sunroom. Mr. Robinson enters, reaches for Ben's glass, takes it from him, then turns his back to Ben to mix the drinks. Mr. Robinson turns and brings Ben the drink, but Ben shakes his head and then nods. Mrs. Robinson enters, now wearing the dress she wore earlier. Ben starts to get up, then sits back down as Mrs. Robinson nods. He stands, and Mr. Robinson stands up with him as they start out of the sunroom. Ben nods and continues to walk toward us as the sun shines brightly. Standing and sitting around the pool are Mr. and Mrs. Braddock, their friends Mr. and Mrs. Arnold, and the Arnold children, Peter and Louise, who are eight or nine, while watching from across the fence on one side of the house are the young girl from next door and her boyfriend.",
    "1121": "Chasing after Harry, the Bludger crashes through the towers one by one. Harry swoops lower to the grass, but the Bludger follows him closely. Draco watches with a smug expression on his face as the Bludger crashes through another tower. Harry flies back over the arena to see Draco hovering in front of him, and suddenly he sees the Golden Snitch beside Draco's head. They both duck as the Bludger hurtles past. Then Harry heads for the Snitch, closely followed by Draco, who elbows him out of the way. Draco takes the lead as the Snitch disappears under the wooden scaffolding supporting the spectators' stands. Draco flies after it, closely followed by Harry, who swerves to avoid a solid wooden beam. The Snitch is too fast for Draco's grasping fingers, and Harry is still being chased by the heavy wooden Bludger. Determined to stay ahead, Draco grits his teeth and looks around in dismay as Harry catches him up and gradually overtakes. Now, close behind Draco, the heavy Bludger crashes into the wooden beams. They weave over and under the wooden struts until Draco catches up again and bashes Harry in the ribs. They fly neck and neck, the Snitch just out of reach, as they flash past Colin with his camera, who ducks. The Bludger flies over his head and smashes through a wooden support. Harry takes the lead again, and the Bludger streaks past them both, weaving from side to side in front of them and smashing holes in the sides of the structure. Suddenly, it turns and hurtles back towards them, and Draco's broomstick catches on a wooden strut. He somersaults into the air and lands heavily on the grass of the arena while Harry continues pursuing the Golden Snitch. As Harry stretches out his hand to grasp it, a rogue Bludger smashes into his arm. Wincing with pain, he grasps his broomstick between his knees, stretches out his good hand, and grabs the Snitch. Then he overbalances, falls off, and lands on his back on the soft sand beneath the goal post, where his friends rush to join him. The Bludger hits the sand beside Harry, and Hermione's spell works, causing the Bludger to explode in mid-air. Everyone runs towards Harry, and Lockhart pushes up Harry's sleeve as Ron and Hagrid look alarmed. Harry's arm goes completely limp and floppy, and he folds the wrist back on itself. Afterward, in the hospital wing, he drinks some medicine. Late at night, while Harry is lying fast asleep, a strange noise wakes him. He opens his eyes, sits up, and looks around, but the room seems empty until he puts on his glasses and sees a figure sitting at the end of his bed. The figure's fingers are covered in bandages, and Dobby jumps down.",
    "983": "Now a toddler, Caroline sleeps beside Daisy, and watched by Benjamin, Daisy wakes. They sit with Caroline in a park as Daisy stares at him, while chubby-cheeked Caroline plays with a toy caterpillar. Balloons decorate the dining room of their duplex, and parents sit at the table with their children. Benjamin goes to the kitchen and looks back into the dining room, where Daisy sits with little Caroline on her knee. A decorative figure of a little girl adorns the remains of a pretty, white birthday cake as the guests have departed. Daisy washes up in the kitchen, watching Benjamin through a Venetian blind as he sits on a wall outside, with Caroline in his lap. Caroline lets go of a yellow helium balloon, which floats away into the sky, and Daisy smiles. Benjamin watches Caroline sleeping in her cot, takes a bulging envelope from the old dresser drawer and a savings book from a small box, and puts them on top of the dresser with a house key. Daisy lies in bed, watching him, and they meet each other's gaze, sharing a long look. Benjamin retreats into the shadows and leaves the room as Daisy sits up in bed while he heads for the front door. Daisy throws back the bed covers, and Benjamin, zipping up his jacket, goes to his motorcycle in the cold, blue light of dawn. Daisy sits on the edge of the bed as Benjamin rides his motorcycle down the driveway, to the road, and she stands at her window, watching as he rides away. Caroline sits in the corner, turns a page of the diary to find a number of postcards bound with an elastic band, removes it, and reads the back of one. Sallow-skinned Daisy watches from the bed as Caroline leafs through the postcards, flipping another postcard over and reading it, while Daisy listens and closes her eyes. Caroline unfolds a letter as Benjamin backpacks through India, locals wash in a river, and he wakes in a sleeping bag, looking out over a beautiful, desolate landscape and mending his motorbike. Now a young man, he carries groceries down a street as a dying Daisy frowns. Fifty-something Daisy crosses her dance studio while little girls file through a windowed office as she puts an arm into one sleeve of her coat, switches off the studio lights as parents usher their children out of the building, then finishes putting her coat on as she starts across the darkened foyer. A figure stands by the door and steps forward; his mid-length hair is a sun-kissed blond, his build slighter, and his skin smoother, and he shrugs. Caroline is 12, Daisy hangs her head, they shake hands, and a gray-haired man enters. Robert looks confused, looks at Daisy who's fighting back tears, and then strokes Caroline's hair.",
    "1015": "The guy runs out, and his towel falls to the ground. Abby covers her eyes. Inside, D'Artagnan cozies up to the guy. Abby's mouth hangs open in a big, toothy grin, her eyes twinkle, and she is transfixed. The guy points to the door and reopens it. Abby dances for joy. On set, the makeup girl goes. Abby roughly forces an earpiece into Mike's ear. Outside, the chicks pull him in. Mike licks the red Jell-O off one of the girl's fingers and gives an approving nod. Abby takes deep breaths as Mike comes in with the bikini babes, who then head off. She walks off. Abby wakes up from her naked weather-girl nightmare. Abby and Joy are in the tea-break area of the office, looking at the ratings. Mike walks in, following Abby to her office. Sitting at her desk, Abby gives Mike a challenging look, picks up a card and the phone, and dials. Mike grabs a phone to listen on but hangs Abby up. Mike flops into a chair, puts the phone on hold, glances aside, and nods while looking at the timer on Abby's phone display. Abby looks thoughtful. At the hospital, handsome, clean-cut Colin keeps holding. In a cafe, in a boutique, they look at dresses with a saleswoman. Abby holds a dress against herself. On the way home, sitting in Abby's living room, Mike reaches down the side of the chair and picks up some knitting, frowns, and quickly dumps it back on the floor. Abby comes downstairs, looking extremely sexy in black stilettos and a figure-hugging, low-cut black dress that stops at her knees, with her long, blonde hair hanging loose in flowing curls. She smirks, strokes his chest, and he slaps her bum. Mike crouches behind the couch, smiles, and gives Abby the thumbs-up. Abby does a little victory dance, punching the air. At the baseball game, the pitcher pitches, and the batter hits. As Abby and Colin walk to their seats, Mike talks to Abby on an earpiece and sits nearby. She munches popcorn with an exaggerated shrug. The batter sprints around the field, and the fans stand up excitedly. Colin tries to get the attention of a food vendor. A girl grins at Mike and lifts the hot dog to her lips, but shocked, she spills her drink in Colin's lap. A cameraman films Abby as she rubs the stain, her head bent over Colin's crotch, and her hair swishes back and forth, making it look like she's doing something quite different. She looks up and sees herself in a heart-shaped video screen above the scoreboard, the Kiss Cam. Abby and Colin walk home."
