Specifically:\n\n1. **Active → Passive**: For each sentence in active voice, rewrite it in passive voice.  \n   - Example: “Alice closed the door.” → “The door was closed by Alice.”\n2. **Passive → Active**: For each sentence in passive voice, rewrite it in active voice.  \n   - Example: “The keys were left in the lock by Alice.” → “Alice left the keys in the lock.”\n3. **Preserve the general structure and punctuation** of the text, as well as any names or nouns. Do not change or remove information; simply adjust the voice from active to passive or from passive to active.\n4. **Retain capitalization** and any proper nouns or specialized terms exactly as written.\n5. If a sentence can’t be unambiguously classified as active or passive, use your best judgment to keep the text coherent.\n\n**Small Example**\n\n**Original text:**\nAlice closed the door. The keys were left in the lock by her.\n\n**Analysis & Transformation:**\n- “Alice closed the door.” (Active voice) → “The door was closed by Alice.” (Passive voice)\n- “The keys were left in the lock by her.” (Passive voice) → “She left the keys in the lock.” (Active voice)\n\n**Result:**\nThe door was closed by Alice.

This can include references to items, locations, actions, or any significant details. Insert a concise piece of external knowledge for each of these references. If real-world information is readily known, use that. If there is no clear real-world knowledge to draw upon, create a synthetic but plausible piece of information. Integrate the external knowledge naturally into the existing sentences without using parentheses or distracting formats. You may place this information before or after the relevant word(s), or embed it in the sentence as a brief clause. Do not remove or alter existing words, except where needed to maintain proper grammar after inserting the additional knowledge. Preserve the original meaning, sentence structure, and all punctuation and capitalization from the original text, adding only the external or synthetic knowledge.
