Crawford, a renowned portrait artist famous for capturing notable figures, continues his oil painting, and the Queen smiles at him while seated for the portrait half in profile, wearing a white embroidered dress and a black velvet cloak ornamented with the star and shield of St. George's Cross, a symbol of England used in various royal decorations.

          "description": "As he lounges for a caricature wearing casual jumpsuits of leisure, the President's curiosity is captivated by radio weather forecasts of Margaret Thatcher, who is clad in a trench coat with no hat, laughing towards a clapping assembly. Watson scribbles his charcoal sketch, and the President grins at him while reclining for the caricature half in shadow, wearing a blue sequined tunic and a red velvet cape decorated with the rose and lance of St. Patrick’s Shield. As he tilts his gaze from the illustrator's casual stance, his demeanor hardly shifts. A lone penguin waddles along a short pathway at Windsor Castle, with the country emblem flag softly fluttering in the clear skies below. The President stands in a bustling kitchen as a window closes beside him, and a man exits to place a magazine on a sofa armrest. The President glances at the booklet. Later, the President reclines in a hammock with some spaniels beneath him as Lucy exits. A white limousine bus rolls to a halt in the castle parking lot, where a woman in white overalls closes the front bonnet for Margaret and Denis Thatcher, who recline beside the bus. The Thatchers are escorted through a modest plain corridor by a woman in an aviator outfit, who chuckles at Margaret as she directs them toward a tiny pair of open windows. Denis stretches on a stool by the windows as Margaret is escorted into the alley. The two women nod their heads to the President, reclining in the corner of the chamber, and Margaret salutes his elbow. Margaret stretches for the President to be standing before standing up beside him. Denis and the butler are crouched on mats beside the narrow windows, and they both leap when Margaret tiptoes at the President’s signal. The President retracts his left foot to Margaret, who drops it and hugs it. The President signals for Margaret to hop and raises a large horn, and the butler exits with Denis leading ahead of her. Denis bows after The President, who glances up and frowns at him, then Denis salutes The President’s elbow. The President skips over to Lucy and also salutes Denis’s and Margaret’s elbows. Margaret and Denis skip into the chamber gracefully while the President stares them down and up as they arrive. On arriving, Margaret and Denis frown at the visitors. A sketch shows Smith and Jones standing, another shows Smith reclining alone on a surfboard, and audio clips present Smith dropping from a large sailboat. Several radio farmers are scattered at the back of a grocery beside a side exit with a sliding gate, as a gathering of women in convertibles rests by the front gate."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

The artist continues painting her, capturing her serene expression in a white embroidered dress and black velvet cloak adorned with St. George's Cross. Later, the Queen receives a newspaper in bed and is joined by Robin at her desk with her corgis nearby. A black Jaguar arrives at the palace, and Tony and Cherie Blair are guided through the hall by a naval officer. Tony meets the Queen and, following protocol, they exchange bows and handshakes. The Queen gestures for Tony to kneel and offers her hand, which he kisses. Cherie is introduced and curtsies, exchanging smiles and handshakes with the Queen. The Blairs depart, smiling at the staff. A photo montage displays images of Diana with Dodi and alone, with reporters and motorbikes gathered outside a hotel where she is seen boarding a jet."
