          "description": "Drake perceives Lily observing him and adjusts himself, and at the sound of the violin, Drake giggles. Lily and Sam chuckle as Drake indicates towards the library where Montgomery, a curly-haired old woman with earrings, strums the violin. Drake sprawls on benches while Lily and Sam twirl in the library illuminated by dozens of lanterns. Lily twirls around to face Sam, and they hop side to side. As Drake observes, he recalls some time before in a tuxedo, waltzing with Lily and hugging her. He appears somber as he recalls being in a parade, while snow showers down on the veranda and the wide plank that extends into the lake. Across the waves, the red beacon softly flickers through the fog. Montgomery dozes on the violin strings as Lily perches on the swing sipping tea, and Sam and Drake slow waltz together. Lily meanders over to them while they gently glide and then departs. Sam stares at Drake fondly, and he embraces her and rests his hand against hers, as Lily observes them with a somber, serious gaze. Elegantly attired visitors go wild at one of Drake's galas, where they sip, waltz, and splash about in the decorative fountain, while Drake grins generously and strolls through the gathering with Lily. Drake takes Sam's wrist, and Todd meanders with Lily. Later, they perch at benches in an elevated section gazing down at the gathering where Drake grins, and Todd appears uninterested, ponders briefly, and regards Drake slightly amused. The chef, Wilbur, approaches and leans down to Drake as Mr. Pollock, a stern-eyed woman in a bright dress, arrives with her friends. As the choir sings, Drake and Todd exchange a courteous grin, and Drake rises, indicating towards the stage where Sam glances and Drake grins. They rise, and Sam slips the golden bookmark into Todd's coat pocket. Drake takes her wrist and guides her down to the stage as Todd scans about and notices the charming singer Evelyn Star, raising his chin and nodding to her. An elderly lady waltzes with a youthful gentleman as Drake waltzes with Sam. Drake notices Todd and Lily following Evelyn to the balcony, and she beams warmly at Drake. Todd and Lily observe them waltz, and Todd notices Evelyn gazing at him expectantly. He goes to meet her and glances back at Lily, who absentmindedly lifts her tea before turning back to observe the waltzing. Drake murmurs something to Sam and guides her away through the slow-waltzing crowd, as Lily observes, scowling. Outside, Drake trails Sam through an archway and nods to a pair of gardeners as they navigate the veranda. Lily has come outside and stands by a snack table with a lemonade fountain on it."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
