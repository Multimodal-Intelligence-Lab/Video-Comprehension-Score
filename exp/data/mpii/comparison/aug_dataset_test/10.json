As the car comes to a halt, both Carolyn and Lester exit the vehicle. Carolyn takes a moment to observe the movers next door as they transport furniture toward the house, before she turns and makes her way into her own house, with Lester trailing behind her. Inside, the scene shifts to a dinner setting where Lester, Carolyn, and Jane are seated around a table illuminated by candlelight, with a bouquet of red roses elegantly arranged in a vase at the center. In a sudden movement, Lester turns his attention to Jane, who meets his gaze with a look of disbelief, as if questioning his sanity, while Carolyn watches the exchange intently. Without a word, Carolyn rises from her seat and heads toward the kitchen, leaving the room. Lester, noticing Carolyn's critical gaze upon him, remains silent, his eyes fixed on his plate. After a moment, he stands up, taking his plate with him, and follows after Jane. In the kitchen, Jane stands at the sink, methodically rinsing her plate when Lester enters the room. She turns to face him, her eyes locked on his, waiting for him to speak, but he hesitates, seeking her support, which she is unable to offer due to the awkwardness of the moment. Observing through the greenhouse windows, it becomes evident that the interaction between Lester and Jane is strained, though their words are inaudible. Jane finishes by placing her plate in the dishwasher and exits the room, and as she leaves, the camera abruptly shifts back to Lester, who calls after her.

Startled by the realization that he was being observed, Lester quickly dries his hands and casually tosses the towel onto the counter, where it lands beside a framed photograph of a younger Lester, Carolyn, and Jane at an amusement park.

A moving van, marked with the logo of a well-known local moving company, is parked in front of the colonial house next door to the Burnhams', echoing the classic American architectural style popular in the 18th century. Meanwhile, a luxury Mercedes-Benz pulls into the Burnham driveway, a symbol of Carolyn's aspiration for status and success, with Carolyn driving and Lester in the passenger seat. As they get out of the car, Carolyn, known for her keen interest in real estate, scopes out the movers next door who carry furniture toward the house, and then she heads into the house, followed by Lester. Lester, Carolyn, and Jane, their teenage daughter dealing with typical adolescent struggles, are eating dinner by candlelight, with red roses bunched in a vase at the center of the table, a gesture perhaps intended to add refinement to an otherwise tense atmosphere. Lester suddenly turns to Jane, who looks at him as if he's lost his mind amidst their strained father-daughter relationship, while Carolyn watches closely. Carolyn gets up, heads toward the kitchen, and is gone.

Throughout all this, Carolyn keeps repeating motivational affirmations to herself, a technique she picked up from a self-help seminar, arranging her sales materials on a desk, then stripping down to her undergarments. We see Carolyn working with fierce concentration as she cleans glass doors overlooking the patio and pool, scrubs countertops in the kitchen, perches on a stepladder to dust a cheap-looking ceiling fan in the master bedroom, and vacuums a dirty carpet that will never be clean, perhaps a metaphor for her own impossible pursuit of perfection.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
