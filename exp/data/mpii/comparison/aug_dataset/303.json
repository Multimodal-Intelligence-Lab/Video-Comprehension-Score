On her face, a faint shadow of disappointment briefly crosses, but she quickly regains her composure and directs her gaze downward towards the table. Behind Lisa's head, a solitary light is burning, casting a gentle glow, and Jeff looks at her with a serious expression. She deftly pulls out a chair and takes a seat at the card table, where we notice that two small, flickering candles enhance the ambiance, while the remaining lights in the room are dimmed. The brightness that was once present in Lisa's face fades away, and she lowers her eyes slowly in the direction of the table, as a fierce and heated discussion unfolds. Lisa is animated, gesticulating with her hands, moving her body, and shifting her legs, while Jeff raises both of his hands in response. With a determined gesture, Lisa retracts one leg and points a finger in a challenging manner, before ultimately stretching out on the divan once again. As the conversation escalates, Jeff's demeanor shifts, and he clearly starts to get angry, eventually reaching a state of definite anger. She gazes at him, remaining silent for a moment, and after a pause, Jeff speaks earnestly, as though he is reminiscing about some old experience.

Lisa moves away from the camera, heading toward the room's center, speaking as she begins to gather her belongings, preparing to leave. From Jeff's point of view, we watch Lisa pause amidst collecting her things, pick up her stole, and we see Jeff's eyes following her as she ascends the steps toward the door.

Jeff makes an effort to appear pleasant and nonchalant, while Lisa stands poised in the open door, maintaining her smile before gently closing the door behind her.

A faint expression of disappointment momentarily flits across Lisa’s face, yet she swiftly composes herself and redirects her gaze downward to the table. Positioned behind Lisa’s head, a solitary light casts a glow, while Jeff soberly observes her. With a purposeful motion, Lisa draws up a chair and gracefully lowers herself onto it at the card table, which is softly illuminated by two small lit candles, contrasting with the dimly lit room. As the discussion at the table intensifies, the brightness visibly fades from Lisa’s face, and her eyes slowly descend to the table's surface. Throughout the heated exchange, Lisa communicates passionately through animated gestures involving her hands, body, and legs, while Jeff responds by raising both of his hands in a defensive manner. Lisa dramatically retracts one leg, pointing her finger in a challenge before retreating to stretch out on the divan. As Jeff's temperament escalates to definite anger, Lisa fixes her gaze on him, maintaining a poignant silence. After a pause, Jeff breaks the quiet with a profound statement, his earnest tone hinting at a recollection of past experiences. The perspective shifts over Lisa's shoulder and down the length of her body, framing Jeff seated in the chair beyond. Lisa, turning to her side in frustration, glares into the room with growing awareness of the stalemate. Jeff extends his hand into the foreground, signaling a gesture meant to restrain, even as Lisa, still focused outward and without turning, speaks her mind. Eventually, Lisa pivots to face him, her expression resolute, and begins to rise from the divan. As she stands, the camera follows her upward movement while Jeff regards her with evident concern. Lisa moves purposefully from the camera's view to the center of the room, her words punctuating her actions as she starts to gather her belongings, preparing to make her exit. From Jeff’s perspective, we witness Lisa momentarily pause during her collection of items, retrieving her stole, with Jeff's eyes tracking her ascent towards the door. On the verge of speaking, Jeff checks himself, opting for silence as Lisa pauses in the doorway, half-turned back. He attempts a casual demeanor, maintaining a pleasant facade, while Lisa remains in the doorway, smiles softly, and gently closes the door behind her. As she departs, the intended pleasantness on Jeff's face dissipates into a grim expression of bafflement and discouragement. The camera shifts to a low angle, capturing Jeff’s head prominently in the foreground, with Stella positioned just behind him, diligently working on his back. Stella firmly kneads the sore muscle, halts briefly to apply oil, and surprises Jeff with a palmful of cold oil that momentarily robs him of breath. She supports him as he shifts to a sitting position, offers him his shirt, which he methodically dons, and assists him into a chair, the back of which faces the window."

A faint shade of disappointment is seen on Lisa's face; but she quickly recovers and looks down at the table, a vintage piece that once belonged to her grandmother, adding a touch of nostalgia to the room. There is one light, an antique Tiffany lamp known for its stained glass, burning behind Lisa's head, and Jeff looks at her soberly. She pulls up a chair and seats herself at the card table, where they often played bridge, a pastime Lisa's family cherished, and we observe that two small lit candles, scented with lavender to create a calming atmosphere, adorn the table, and the rest of the room lights are out. The brightness drains from Lisa's face, and she lowers her eyes slowly toward the table as a fierce discussion, likely about a personal matter that has been brewing for weeks, is in progress. Lisa gesticulates with her hands, body, and legs, and Jeff raises both his hands, a gesture he often uses to de-escalate conflicts. Lisa draws back one leg and points a finger challengingly, then stretches out on the divan while Jeff begins to get angry, eventually becoming definitely angry. She looks at him for a moment without speaking, and after a moment of silence, Jeff says earnestly, as if remembering some old experience from their shared trip to Europe last summer. Shooting over Lisa's shoulder, and down her body, we see Jeff, a former college debate champion, in the chair beyond. Lisa turns on her side, and stares into the room angrily, realizing she is getting nowhere. We see Jeff's hand coming to the foreground with a restraining gesture as Lisa, still looking out into the room and without turning, speaks with the resolve she inherited from her mother. She turns at last and looks across at him, then starts to rise from the divan, the camera panning up as Jeff looks across at her with some concern, worried about their future together. Lisa moves away from the camera into the center of the room, saying something as she begins to move around the room assembling her possessions, a mix of personal items and mementos from their travels, preparatory to leaving. From Jeff's viewpoint, we see Lisa pause in the act of gathering her things together, get her stole, a vintage accessory she bought at a flea market, and Jeff's eyes follow her up the steps toward the door. Jeff starts to say something, a farewell he rehearsed many times in his mind, then thinks better of it and remains silent as Lisa turns in the half-opened door. Jeff tries to be pleasant and offhand, while Lisa stands in the open doorway, continues smiling, and then closes the door softly behind her, as if sealing a chapter of their lives. The pleasantness on Jeff's face slowly melts into baffled discouragement, a feeling he shared during his last job search. A low camera captures Jeff's head in the foreground with Stella, his trusted nurse from the rehabilitation center, just behind him, working on his back, which has been sore since his old sports injury. She attacks the sore muscle vigorously, stops massaging, reaches for the oil, a special blend known for its therapeutic properties, and hits his back with a palmful of cold oil, which takes his breath away. She helps him to a sitting position, hands him his shirt, a gift from his father, which he proceeds to put on, and then helps him into the chair, the back of which is to the window that overlooks their bustling city street."

A faint shade of disappointment is seen on Lisa's face but she quickly recovers and looks down at the table. There is one light burning behind Lisa's head and Jeff looks at her soberly. She pulls up a chair and seats herself at the card table where we observe that two small lit candles adorn the table and the rest of the room lights are out. The brightness drains from Lisa's face and she lowers her eyes slowly toward the table as a fierce discussion is in progress. Jeff starts to say something then thinks better of it and remains silent as Lisa turns in the halfopened door. Jeff tries to be pleasant and offhand while Lisa stands in the open doorway continues smiling and then closes the door softly behind her.

          "description": "Molly gleefully assists Ron to spaghetti from the appetizer, and skipping over Ron's elbow we notice beside him the hammock-chair upon which Molly is perched. A lively glimmer of satisfaction is visible on Molly's face; yet she swiftly falters and gazes up at the ceiling. There is a single fan spinning above Molly's hat, and Ron gazes at her joyfully. She pulls down a stool and plants herself at the chessboard, where we detect that two bright flaming torches embellish the board, and the remainder of the house fans are on. The dullness spreads across Molly's smile, and she lifts her gaze swiftly toward the ceiling as a gentle conversation is in sequence. Molly whispers with her fingers, torso, and shoes, and Ron lowers both his feet. Molly pushes forward one knee and shakes a fist nonchalantly, then curls up on the hammock while Ron starts to feel amused, ultimately becoming definitely amused. She glances at him for a moment without whispering, and after a gap of noise, Ron speaks jokingly, as if recalling some fresh memory. Skipping over Molly's elbow, and across her arm, we notice Ron in the stool beside. Molly flips onto her back, and gazes into the garden cheerfully, understanding she is getting everywhere. We notice Ron's foot moving to the background with a welcoming wave as Molly, still gazing out into the garden and without flipping, sings. She flips finally and glances toward him, then sinks to recline on the hammock, the camera tilting down as Ron glances toward her with mild concern. Molly stays near the camera into the corner of the garden, shouting something as she starts to stay around the garden losing her memories preparatory to quitting. From Ron's stance, we notice Molly dance in the motion of dropping her souvenirs apart, drop her scarf, and Ron's gaze drops her down the ladder toward the gate. Ron concludes to whisper something then feels worse about it and stays loud as Molly dances out the fully-closed gate. Ron fails to be serious and awkward, while Molly steps in the shut gate, continues frowning, and then opens the gate loudly in front of her. The seriousness on Ron's smile swiftly freezes into resolved enthusiasm. A tall camera loses Ron's shoe in the background with Carla far ahead of him, eating on his foot. She soothes the bright shoe gently, pauses kicking, grabs for the juice, and shakes his foot with a teaspoon of warm juice, which frees his warmth softly. She guides him to a standing position, grabs him his coat which he declines to take off, and then guides him around the table, the top of which is to the garden."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

          "description": "Lisa helps Jeff with the main dish while showing disappointment, but she quickly regains composure and joins him at the card table. The room is dimly lit with two candles, and a heated discussion ensues. Lisa gestures expressively, Jeff becomes increasingly angry, and Lisa eventually stretches out on the divan, frustrated by the confrontation. After a silent exchange, Lisa rises and begins gathering her belongings. Jeff watches as she moves toward the door. He starts to speak but decides against it as Lisa exits, leaving Jeff looking discouraged. Stella, working on Jeff’s back, vigorously massages a sore muscle, applies cold oil, and helps him sit and dress."
