As he continues to drink, Will returns from the grocery store and makes his way up the steps, reaching the top of the stairs. Pausing briefly, he hears the sound of voices filtering from the direction of the bedroom. Moving cautiously yet deliberately, Will approaches the bedroom door with a sense of curiosity, neither fully sneaking nor openly announcing his arrival. The door sits ajar, offering him a slight but clear view into the room where he sees his father accompanied by his wife. In the hallway, Will adjusts his position slightly to better hear the familiar story being recounted once more. Inside, Edward, revealing bruises and bandages, goes through a large bag of mail with the assistance of Sandra. He tears open an official-looking letter, and as he reads its contents, his facial expression shifts noticeably to one of dismay. The sound of FLUTE and DRUM music rises, building to a rhythmic military cadence. Suddenly, the scene transitions to Edward, now with a buzz cut and clad in paratrooper gear, squatting alongside a dozen other soldiers. The roar of airplane engines fills the air, a deafening backdrop to the scene, while Edward remains absorbed in studying a phrasebook written in an Asian language. The JUMP LEADER shouts a command, prompting each soldier to leap from the aircraft one by one, their parachutes securely clipped to a main line. When Edward's turn arrives, he leaps boldly from the plane, looking down to see a sea of white parachutes vanishing into the night below. After a tense moment, his own parachute finally deploys with a POP. Edward makes his descent from the aircraft, floating above a gathering of a thousand Chinese soldiers, who sit watching a U.S.O.-equivalent show, their expressions bored. On stage, a Chinese ventriloquist performs with a Communist puppet, the dialogue unintelligible yet familiar in its structure. The EMCEE takes the stage to usher the ventriloquist off, despite his protests, which eventually subside as he leaves. From Edwardâ€™s perspective above, he drifts uncontrollably toward the stage, unable to steer himself. The lights go out, and a DRUM ROLL fills the silence. With a metallic CLANG, Edward lands on the lighting catwalk high above the stage, clutching it tightly and urgently disconnecting his parachute just as the curtain begins to lift. As the curtain rises, PING, a stunning woman of 27, stands at a microphone, her hips provocatively turned in profile, her dress skillfully designed to reveal patches of skin. The gathered soldiers leap to their feet, WHISTLING and HOLLERING in appreciation. Meanwhile, up on the catwalk, Edward is caught off guard by an ENEMY SOLDIER, and the two men engage in a sudden SCUFFLE. Below, Ping sings a melody while an off-stage voice provides flawless harmony. Ping, now visibly irritated, huffs and turns her back on her sister. Jing, in search of a new dress, rummages deeper into the closet, inadvertently exposing Edward's hiding spot. She GASPS in surprise, causing Ping to turn and look. Jing quickly covers Ping's mouth with her hand in an attempt to keep her silent, but it's already too late. A GUARD bearing a rifle peers into the room. In an effort to maintain the pretense, Jing adopts the demeanor of her irritable sister, prompting the guard to comply. Ping then shakes off Jing's grasp. Edward, seizing the moment, retrieves a photograph from his flak jacket, revealing an image that even causes Ping to momentarily pause, her expression softening slightly in response."

Up on the catwalk, Edward is surprised by an enemy soldier, who likely had been assigned to guard the stage area. The two men begin to scuffle. Ping sings melody while an off-stage voice carries perfect harmony, showcasing the sisters' well-rehearsed act. Ping huffs, turning her back on her sister. Jing reaches deeper into the closet to find a new dress, exposing Edward's hiding place, a secret compartment behind a false panel. She gasps, startled by the unexpected discovery. Ping turns to look. Jing grabs her, a hand over her mouth, but it's too late. A rifle-toting guard looks in. Pretending to be her bitchy sister, the guard obeys her commands, recognizing her authority due to her familial ties. Ping shakes her sister off.

In a bustling marketplace in ancient Persia a cunning street thief navigates labyrinthine alleyways and vibrant bazaars. We LOOK DOWN with Edward who is drifting right for the stage. He cannot steer. He is helpless. The lights go out as a DRUM ROLL begins. He lands with a CLANG on the lighting catwalk above the stage. He barely grabs on disconnecting his chute just as the curtain goes up.

          "description": "Her cat observes the mouse while it lazily chews a giant cookie, hungrier than it expected. While the mouse is chewing, Doug, fresh from the theme park, descends into the basement. Doug overhears music drifting from the kitchen. Doug cautiously tiptoes to the window, not exactly tiptoeing, but not exactly throwing a parade. The window is ajar a few feet, allowing Doug to see his uncle and his grandmother. In the attic, Doug switches spots, allowing himself to listen to the tale yet again. Scratched and patched up, Gerald sorts through a small jar of coins with help from Lauren. He tears open a decorative envelope. Skimming it, his eyes widen. SAX and TRUMPET, sounds climbing to a festive tempo. With a mohawk and diving fins, Gerald crouches with a dozen other ATHLETES. The blaring of the SPEAKERS is overwhelming, but Gerald is engrossed in a French comic book. The COACH bellows. One by one the swimmers dive in, their goggles strapped on tightly. When his turn arrives, Gerald plunges. Peering below, he can see the blue water swallowing the divers. It eventually SWELLS. Gerald dives from the board. A HUNDRED JAPANESE STUDENTS lounge, disinterested, observing the version of a science fair exhibit. A JAPANESE MAGICIAN is performing with his Socialist hat. We have no clue what they're doing together, but each trick is essentially identical. The HOST appears to escort him off the platform before he's concluded. The Magician objects, but eventually relents. We GAZE UP with Gerald, who is gliding straight toward the platform. He can't navigate. He's powerless. The lights dim as a CYMBAL CRASH initiates. He touches down with a BANG on the scaffolding above the platform. He barely clutches on, releasing his goggles just as the curtain ascends. The curtain lifts to disclose MAY (27) at a podium. She's as striking a figure as you'll ever encounter. She stands with her shoulders angled in silhouette. Her frame is stunning, gown designed to reveal form. The students are off their seats, CHEERING and YELLING. UP ON THE SCAFFOLDING, Gerald is caught off guard by a RIVAL STUDENT. The pair begin to WRESTLE. May sings harmony while an unseen voice syncs up in perfect melody. May PUFFS, spinning away from her sibling. Fay reaches further under the bed to uncover a fresh outfit, exposing Gerald's hiding nook. She GASPS. May swivels to observe. Fay seizes her, a palm over her scream, yet itâ€™s too late. A spear-carrying SENTINEL peers in. Pretending to be her rude sibling, the sentinel complies. May shrugs her sibling off. Gerald extracts a map out of his life jacket. Even May is somewhat moved."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby cafÃ©, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Edward, bruised and bandaged, sifts through mail and finds a distressing letter. As military music plays, we transition to Edward, now a paratrooper preparing to jump from a plane. Amid deafening engines, Edward studies an Asian phrasebook. As soldiers jump, Edward follows, eventually landing on a lighting catwalk during a Chinese show. A ventriloquist finishes his act as Edward, unable to steer, lands above the stage. Ping, a stunning singer with her sister Jing, performs as Edward struggles with an enemy soldier on the catwalk. During a scuffle, Jing discovers Edwardâ€™s hiding spot but is too late to prevent a guard's attention. Ping, affected by Edward's photo, witnesses the unfolding chaos."
