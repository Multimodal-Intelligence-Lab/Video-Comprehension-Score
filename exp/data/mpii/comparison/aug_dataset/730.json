As the site of the wreck is returned to by one lifeboat, a flashlight is shone by the dark-haired crewman over the debris-strewn water, where floating frozen bodies are amid pieces of furniture, barrels, and other wreckage. Several stiff corpses are prodded by the crewman using an oar, and bodies are pushed out of their path by a sailor leaning over the front of the boat as they row forward slowly. A dead woman and infant floating in the water are illuminated by the crewman's flashlight beam. Elsewhere in the debris field, her back is laid on by Rose atop a floating wooden panel, while Jack is floated beside her in the sea, his head and arms propped above water.

Between them, the dead crewman is floated with the whistle still in his mouth. Rose's smile fades as Jack is stared at by her and shaken again; a tear trickles down her nose. Her brow is furrowed by Rose, and tears are choked back as Jack's hand is stroked by her, while further away the lifeboat rows.

Jack's face lights up with a smile, but then he closes his eyes tightly and winces, while Rose, feeling the moment's weight, closes her eyes and leans her head against their intertwined hands, seeking comfort. Meanwhile, a lifeboat makes its way back to the site of the wreck, and a dark-haired crewman methodically shines his flashlight over the water, which is littered with debris, including pieces of furniture, barrels, and other wreckage, where frozen bodies float. With a steady hand, the crewman uses an oar to prod several stiff corpses, and as he leans over the front of the boat, a sailor carefully pushes bodies out of their path, allowing them to row forward slowly. The beam of the crewman's flashlight falls upon a tragic sight—a dead woman and infant floating in the water. Elsewhere in the debris field, Rose lies on her back atop a floating wooden panel, while Jack remains in the sea beside her, his head and arms propped above the water.

The lifeboat passes several yards away from her, prompting Rose to shake Jack's hand gently, smiling as she rubs his arm and sits up. Jack, however, floats motionless with his eyes closed, leading Rose to shake him more vigorously before turning her gaze toward the lifeboat. Between them, the dead crewman floats with a whistle still in his mouth. Rose's smile fades as she stares intently at Jack, shaking him again with increasing urgency; a tear escapes, trickling down her nose. With her brow furrowed, Rose struggles to hold back her tears as she tenderly strokes Jack's hand, all the while watching the lifeboat row further away. Trembling, Rose watches it recede into the distance, then lays her head down and closes her eyes in despair. The light from the rescuers' flashlight grows dimmer as they move on, prompting Rose's eyes to snap open. She sits up abruptly and carefully pries her hand out of Jack's grip. She kisses his hand one last time before releasing him, watching as Jack sinks into the icy water and disappears into the gloom. Determined, Rose slides onto her stomach to the edge of the platform, then rolls into the water, her breath forming clouds in the frigid air, and swims to the frozen crewman to retrieve the whistle from his lips.

          "description": "Fog droplets glint in Samantha's scarf as she grabs his shoulder and taps the side of his elbow. Samantha laughs, then opens her mouth and yawns, while Oliver opens his mouth and tilts his cap against their clasped shoulders. As one wagon gallops to the edge of the battlefield, the blonde farmer illuminates his lantern over the rubble-covered land, where frozen soldiers hover amid clusters of baskets, canisters, and other remnants. Using a rake, the farmer nudges several rigid statues, and leaning over the back of the wagon, a ranger shoves statues out of their path as they gallop backward slowly. The farmer's lantern beam highlights a silent youth and toddler hovering on the ground. Elsewhere in the rubble field, Oliver reclines on his stomach atop a floating metal sheet, while Samantha hovers in the river beside him, her hat and legs lifted above ground. Oliver whistles to himself as he stares up at the cloudy morning mist, his scarf and shoulders covered with dew, turning his cap as a nearby spark brightens the top of her hair. The wagon gallops several feet away from him as he pats Samantha's shoulder, grinning and scratching his nose, and stands up. Samantha hovers silent with her mouth open, and Oliver pats him softer, then peers toward the wagon. Near them, the silent farmer hovers with the buzzer still in his hand. Oliver's grin fades as he glances at Samantha and pats him once more; a chuckle slips down his cheek. Furrowing his cheeks, Oliver laughs out loud as he pats Samantha's shoulder, while the wagon gallops closer. Oliver shakes as she observes it approach, then lifts up his nose and opens his mouth. The spark of the heroes' lantern fades brighter as they drift on, and Oliver's mouth slams shut as she stands up and nudges his shoulder out of Samantha's clasp. He taps her elbow, then clasps her as Samantha climbs in the warm water and appears in the haze. Oliver crawls on his legs to the top of the raft, then spins into the air, his voice fading away in dreams, and jumps to the molten farmer to push the buzzer from her hands. Oliver starts to whistle into the buzzer as the heroes dim their sparks on him. On the space shuttle, the now greener Oliver shuts his mouth as laughter rolls down Benny's hands. As dusk falls over the desert, Nathan stands loudly on a cart with other travelers, while on another cart, a woman lets a sip from a goblet, then hands it to Tony. Nearby, Janet laughs against Emily, who stares into land with a vibrant face. Wrapped in a scarf, her hands glow as she turns down and is lively in blue sparks."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
