Meanwhile, Cavalieri, casting a fierce and accusatory look at Mozart, exits the stage in the opposite direction, striding towards her dressing room with her plumed head tossed in defiance. Salieri stands by and observes as Mozart hesitates for a brief moment, appearing uncertain and indecisive about whether he should follow the soprano or perhaps assist Madame Weber. However, when Constanze catches his gaze and tries to regain her composure, she manages to sit herself at her mirror and begins to remove her wig, leaving Salieri utterly astounded. The door swings open with a creak, Constanze makes her entrance, and Mozart swiftly and urgently ushers her out through the door. Cavalieri watches them leave, her voice breaking, soaring, and reaching an uncontrolled crescendo as she departs. The scene shifts to an elderly man speaking with intense and fervent emotion to the priest, while the youthful Salieri is shown kneeling in desperation before the Cross. At the same time, we witness Leopold now kneeling, remarkably, not in reverence to the Cross, but before the imposing Archbishop Colloredo, who sits impassively on his grand throne. Leopold, a man of sixty years once marked by his striking handsomeness, now finds himself exceedingly subservient and deferential as a courtier, showing his utmost gratitude by reverently kissing the Archbishop's hand, after which the Archbishop signals for Leopold to rise.

Meanwhile, he emits an awkward giggle, unsure of how to react, as Cavalieri fixes a piercing glare in Mozart's direction. Caught under the weight of her gaze, Mozart quickly shifts his eyes away from her, attempting to avoid any confrontation. As all this unfolds, Constanze moves to kiss the royal hand before her but collapses to the floor, unconscious. Her sudden fainting spell captures the Emperor's attention, and he stands momentarily, pondering the sight of her unconscious form, before stepping back to give space to the unexpected scene. After a brief analysis of the situation, he offers a gracious nod to everyone present and exits the stage accompanied by his Chamberlain. In contrast, Cavalieri, throwing a fierce look at Mozart that speaks volumes, makes her exit from the opposite side, her plumed head tossing defiantly as she heads towards her dressing room. Meanwhile, Salieri observes the unfolding drama as Mozart hesitates, torn between the impulse to pursue the departing soprano or to assist Madame Weber. His indecision is short-lived as Constanze, regaining some composure and catching his eye, makes an effort to steady herself. Choosing to retreat into her own thoughts, she sits at her mirror and carefully removes her wig, an action that leaves Salieri visibly astonished. The door swings open, marking Constanze's entry, and Mozart, quickly deciding to escort Constanze, ushers her out of the room with urgency. Cavalieri watches their departure, her voice breaking with emotion and escalating uncontrollably. In another scene, an elderly man converses vehemently with a priest while a younger Salieri, fraught with despair, kneels in prayer before the Cross as the narrative shifts to Leopold, who is also kneeling, but in a different context—before Archbishop Colloredo, who observes him with a detached demeanor from his throne. Leopold, appearing as a man worn by desperation yet still clinging to the vestiges of his former handsome self at sixty, adopts the role of a deferential courtier, expressing profound gratitude by placing a respectful kiss on the Archbishop's hand. In response, the Archbishop motions for Leopold to stand, and as the camera pulls back, the scene expands to reveal Leopold kneeling next to Constanze, with a priest standing before them. Behind them are Madame Weber, Josefa, and Sophie Weber, along with a lively lady clad in vibrant clothes, known as the Baroness. Breathing heavily, the Princess acknowledges the situation with a nervous nod while Salieri offers a brief smile, which falters almost imperceptibly when a servant enters the room, prompting Salieri to make his way into the salon. Here, Constanze stands, closely veiled and clutching a portfolio brimming with manuscripts. Upon Salieri's entrance into the salon, Constanze greets him with a shy curtsy and then unveils herself with equal shyness. Salieri accepts the portfolio and, setting it on a table, gestures towards a dish laden with glazed chestnuts. He offers the treat to Constanze, who takes one and places it in her mouth, prompting Salieri to observe her intently before he too takes a chestnut, adorned with a large gold signet ring on his finger. As he watches her consume the sweet, he offers her a gentle smile, to which she responds by taking another chestnut. Meanwhile, the old man engages the priest in conversation, while a close-up reveals the manuscript, distinctly penned in Mozart's handwriting. Oblivious to Constanze, who sits contentedly savoring the chestnuts with her lips dusted in sugar, the court composer paces the room, gripped by his own world of creativity and emotion. He meticulously reads each page of the manuscript, allowing them to slip from his hands and flutter to the floor upon finishing. His expression, a blend of agony and wonder, reflects the intense experience of a soul caught between beauty and profound pain. As if adrift in a stormy sea, he continues to circle the room, the pages cascading around him in a continuous, swirling white flurry, mirroring the tumult of his inner world."

She attempts to kiss the royal hand, a traditional sign of allegiance to the Emperor of the Austrian Empire, but faints instead, causing the Emperor, a figure known for his composure and measured reactions, to contemplate her prone body and step back a pace. He nods pleasantly to all, a mark of his diplomatic nature, and leaves the stage with his Chamberlain, a high-ranking official responsible for managing the household of royalty, while Cavalieri, with a savage look at Mozart, leaves the stage the opposite way to her dressing room, tossing her plumed head adorned with the extravagant headdresses popular in operatic circles of the late 18th century. Salieri, renowned as a prominent composer and contemporary of Mozart, watches as Mozart remains indecisive for a second about whether to follow the soprano or help Madame Weber, a character based on Constanze's real-life mother, but when Constanze catches him looking at her and tries to compose herself, she seats herself at her mirror and removes her wig, a common practice among women to maintain the elaborate hairstyles of the era, as Salieri looks astonished. The door opens, Constanze enters, and Mozart, torn between duty and affection, hurries Constanze out of the door. Cavalieri looks after them as they go, her voice breaking and rising out of control, a testament to the intense emotions often displayed in operatic performances. The old man, representing a future Salieri, speaks passionately to the priest, a symbol of his lifelong struggle with faith and envy, while the young Salieri is kneeling in desperation before the Cross, a poignant image of his spiritual turmoil, and we see Leopold, Mozart’s father who played a significant role in shaping his early career, kneeling now not to the Cross but to Archbishop Colloredo, sitting impassively on his throne, a powerful figure in the Salzburg court who often clashed with Mozart. Leopold, a desperate, once-handsome man of sixty, now far too much the subservient courtier due to years of navigating court politics, expresses deepest gratitude by kissing the Archbishop's hand, who then motions Leopold to rise. The camera pulls back to reveal Leopold kneeling beside Constanze, a priest facing them, with Madame Weber, Josefa, and Sophie Weber, her sisters who were both singers, and a merry-looking lady in bright clothes, the Baroness, a fictional character suggesting nobility, are behind them. Out of breath, the Princess nods nervously, and Salieri smiles at him, revealing his dual role as both friend and rival to Mozart, but Salieri's face falls almost imperceptibly as a servant enters, and Salieri goes into the salon, a private room used for entertaining guests. Constanze stands closely veiled, holding a portfolio stuffed with manuscripts, which likely include some of Mozart’s compositions, and Salieri enters the salon as Constanze drops him a shy curtsy and shyly unveils. He takes the portfolio and puts it on a table, indicating a dish piled high with glazed chestnuts, a popular delicacy in Vienna at the time, which he offers to her. She takes one, puts it in her mouth, and he watches carefully before taking one himself, wearing a heavy gold signet-ring that symbolizes his status and wealth. He smiles at her, and she takes another chestnut, as the old man faces the priest; close up, the manuscript is in Mozart's handwriting, a reminder of his prodigious talent. The court composer, oblivious to Constanze, who sits happily chewing chestnuts with her mouth covered in sugar, walks around and around his salon, reading the pages and dropping them on the floor when finished, his face agonized and wondering, shuddering as if in a rough and tumbling sea, experiencing the point where beauty and great pain coalesce, while more pages fall than he can read, scattering across the floor in a white cascade as he circles the room."

          "description": "Griselda bows, and the monkey snickers awkwardly as the butcher scowls at Rembrandt, who glances quickly away from the squirrel. The elephant tries to hug the queen's paw but tumbles instead, prompting the king to ponder her stretched-out trunk and shuffle backward a step. He winks cheerfully at all and exits the arena with his butler, while the butcher, with a fierce glance at Rembrandt, exits the arena the opposite way to her nest, shaking her feathered tail. Galileo observes as Rembrandt hesitates for a moment about whether to chase the parrot or assist Madame Curie, but when Griselda catches him glancing her way and attempts to regain her composure, she places herself at her vanity and takes off her bonnet as Galileo looks amazed. The hatch opens, Griselda steps in, and Rembrandt rushes Griselda out of the hatch. The butcher watches after them as they leave, her voice cracking and elevating uncontrollably. The elder tortoise argues fervently with the wizard while the young Galileo is bowing in despair before the Crescent, and we witness Einstein bowing now not to the Crescent but to Duke Wellington, lounging impassively on his stool. Einstein, a frantic, once-charming wolf of forty, now exceedingly much the submissive knight, shows profound appreciation by hugging the Duke's glove, who then signals Einstein to stand. The lens retreats to show Einstein bowing alongside Griselda, a wizard facing them, with Madame Curie, Guinevere, and Alice Curie, and a jolly-looking owl in vibrant garments, the Duchess, are behind them. Panting, the Duchess bobs anxiously, and Galileo grins at the tortoise, but Galileo's expression drops almost imperceptibly as a messenger enters, and Galileo slips into the parlor. Griselda stands closely cloaked, clutching a folder crammed with blueprints, and Galileo enters the parlor as Griselda gives him a timid bow and timidly uncovers. He retrieves the folder and places it on a shelf, pointing to a bowl heaped high with candied almonds, which he presents to her. She selects one, pops it in her beak, and he observes intently before taking one himself, wearing a heavy bronze trinket. He grins at her, and she grabs another almond, as the elder tortoise challenges the wizard; zoomed in, the blueprint bears Rembrandt's sketching. The kingdom jester, ignorant of Griselda, who perches contentedly munching almonds with her beak dusted in syrup, paces around and around his parlor, scrutinizing the sheets and dropping them on the ground when complete, his visage tormented and bewildered, trembling as though in a rugged and agitated river, encountering the juncture where splendor and immense sorrow converge, while more sheets descend than he can peruse, dispersing across the ground in a white flurry as he loops the chamber."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
