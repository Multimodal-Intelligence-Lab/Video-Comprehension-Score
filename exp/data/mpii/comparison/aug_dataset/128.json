Meanwhile, Neff, exhibiting great effort, hoists himself up onto the box positioned nearby and then gingerly maneuvers himself up onto the steps, all while ensuring his head stays lowered to avoid detection.

Once their attention is satisfactorily captured, Phyllis nods in acknowledgment and retrieves the ticket from their grasp. By now, Neff has successfully reached the top of the steps, and Phyllis promptly follows his ascent, joining him at his side to hand over the ticket. Standing intimately close, she leans in and kisses him, their brief moment shared before the redcap emerges once again from inside the car and descends back down the steps. Seizing this opportunity, Phyllis bestows another quick kiss upon Neff and swiftly makes her way down the steps. Observing the proceedings, the porter lifts the box as he and the conductor board the waiting train. Phyllis remains on the platform, energetically waving goodbye as the train lurches into motion, prompting the porter to begin closing the car door. With her farewell complete, Phyllis pivots and walks out of the frame, heading in the direction of the parked car. Inside, Neff and the porter are left behind, with the conductor advancing further into the car. Neff, meanwhile, turns partially away from the porter and holds the vestibule door open, then hobbles through the narrow passage. Most of the berths are made up, which Neff notices as he continues his hobbling journey, prompting other passengers and a nearby porter to courteously make way for him, recognizing his apparent disability. Neff persistently hobbles onward as several passengers immerse themselves in reading or writing under the dim lighting, which is gently illuminated by a light source from inside the parlor car. Having emerged onto the platform, Neff takes a moment to survey the tracks stretching behind him, standing in silence. He begins patting his pockets as though searching for some item, only to be interrupted by Jackson, who produces a small bag of tobacco and a packet of cigarette papers, then rises and exits into the parlor car. Neff watches Jackson's retreat intently, following his movement as he navigates back through the car. With a sense of purpose, Neff shifts to one side of the platform and peers ahead along the track, orienting himself with a careful eye. He sneaks a final glance back into the parlor car to confirm that no one is monitoring him before discreetly slipping the crutches from under his arms, testing his full weight on both feet. With a swift and decisive motion, he dismisses the crutches, letting them fall off the train onto the tracks below, and with urgency, he swings his body over the rail. Clinging to the railing momentarily, Neff casts a downward glance before relinquishing his grip to drop onto the right-of-way. The camera halts its motion as the train gradually fades into the obscurity of the night. After landing on the tracks, Neff collects himself, rubbing his knee while surveying the tracks and the adjacent terrain. In the near distance beyond the edge of the right-of-way, the silhouette of a dump becomes discernible, accompanied by the imposing shadow of the Dietrichson sedan. Its headlights flicker twice before extinguishing, signaling him. Mobilized by this cue, Neff breaks into a run towards the car, moving with a slightly awkward gait due to the improvised cast on his left foot."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

          "description": "Neff climbs onto the train while Phyllis distracts the conductor and porter. After giving Neff the ticket, she kisses him and waves goodbye as the train departs. Inside, Neff hobbles through the car, assisted by a porter and passengers. He checks his surroundings, ensuring no one is watching, then discards his crutches and drops off the train. Picking himself up after falling, he spots the silhouette of a dump and the Dietrichson sedan. When the headlights blink twice, Neff runs awkwardly toward the car due to his improvised cast."
