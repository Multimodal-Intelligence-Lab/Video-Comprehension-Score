The barman hands her the drink, and a burly man sits down beside her. She slaps the hand away, turns back to Fergus, and finds his seat empty. Fergus is standing across the road from the pub, sweating. Dil comes out of the pub, looks this way and that, searching for Fergus, who stands back into a shadow. Dave, the burly man, comes out, grabs her by the elbow, and she walks off. Dave follows, grabs her by the elbow again, and they walk with him holding Dil by the arm through a dilapidated street full of squats. They stop outside a door; Dil opens it with a key from her purse, and they both walk inside. Fergus stands there, observing.

It is mixed by the barman while the mirror is being stared at by her, staring at Fergus, who is trying to avoid her eyes. Her drink is handed to her by the barman, and a burly man is sitting down beside her. The hand is slapped away by her, Fergus is turned back to by her, and his seat is found empty by her. Standing across the road from the pub is Fergus, sweating. Out of the pub comes Dil, looking this way and that, searching for Fergus, who stands back into a shadow. Dave, the burly man, comes out, and her elbow is grabbed by him, and off she walks. Dave follows, grabs her by the elbow again, and walks with her arm being held by him through a dilapidated street full of squats.

A light is turned on in an upstairs room, and Dil enters, with her shadow silhouetted behind the curtain and the shadow of Dave entering behind her. He begins removing her blouse, and she stands absolutely still as he does so. In bed is Fergus, and Jody is seen as a bowler, running in slow motion toward the camera. The ball is released by Jody, and in bed, Fergus is seen, breathing heavily. Fergus takes a break, watches the batsman hit a ball, and imitates the batsman's motion with his sledgehammer. Then by a voice, he is interrupted, and Tristram Deveroux, a young Sloane type in a three-piece suit whose house it is, is seen by Fergus, and beside him stands Franknum, the cockney foreman. Work is resumed by Fergus, and it is now crowded with people, black, white, punky, and street chic, a lot of leather, with all the women heavily made-up. From the way through which Fergus walks, it is obvious he has never been here at night. He seems most out of place in his cheap suit, making his way through the crowd to the bar. Seeing him is Col, the barman, and he smiles, pushing a colored cocktail with a Japanese umbrella toward him. Fergus reaches for his wallet to pay, but he is interrupted by Col. Fergus tries to pretend he's familiar with the drink, and by implication, whatever norms of the place are.

Although she turns her face away from him, she cleverly uses the mirror to catch a glimpse of him, locking eyes through the reflective surface. The barman, moving with a sense of profound weariness, approaches Fergus, who is on the verge of speaking when suddenly, she interjects. The barman goes about mixing the drink, while Dil continues to fix her gaze on the mirror, her eyes unwaveringly set on Fergus, who fumbles awkwardly, trying his utmost to dodge her piercing stare.

Without hesitation, she slaps his hand away and turns her attention back to Fergus, only to discover his seat has become unexpectedly vacant. Fergus now stands on the opposite side of the street from the bustling pub, beads of sweat trickling down his face. Dil emerges from the pub, scanning the surroundings in search of Fergus, who conceals himself in the comforting shadows. Dave, the burly man, follows her out, and takes hold of her elbow assertively, guiding her as they begin to walk. Once more, Dave seizes her by the elbow, and they proceed through a dismal street lined with run-down buildings, with Dave holding Dil firmly by the arm. They eventually come to a halt outside a door; Dil retrieves a key from her purse and opens it, allowing them both to step inside. Fergus remains stationed outside, silently watching the scene unfold. A light flickers on in an upstairs room, and Dil enters, casting her silhouette against the curtain with Dave's shadow trailing closely behind. He starts to unbutton her blouse, and she stands motionless, letting him carry out the action without any resistance. Meanwhile, Fergus is lying in bed, and we see Jody, assuming the role of a bowler, running in slow motion toward the camera. Jody releases the ball, which transitions into a shot of Fergus in bed, his breathing becoming increasingly labored. Taking a pause, Fergus watches the batsman as he strikes a ball, then mimics the batsman’s movement using his sledgehammer. At this moment, a voice disrupts him, and Fergus turns to find Tristram Deveroux, a young man epitomizing the Sloane style, clad elegantly in a three-piece suit, whose house it is, standing alongside Franknum, the cockney foreman. Fergus resumes his work; the place is now bustling with a diverse crowd — people of all colors, featuring punky and street chic styles with a significant amount of leather, while the women are heavily made-up. From the way Fergus navigates through the throng, it's clear he has never ventured here during the night before. He appears notably out of place, donning his inexpensive suit, as he makes his way through the sea of people toward the bar. Col, the barman, spots him and greets him with a smile, sliding a vividly colored cocktail adorned with a whimsical Japanese umbrella in his direction. Fergus reaches for his wallet, intending to pay, but Col interrupts him, rendering payment unnecessary. Fergus makes an effort to appear as though he is accustomed to the drink and, by extension, familiar with the customs of the establishment. As he lifts the glass to his lips, the persistent umbrella obstructs him, leading Fergus to remove it, holding it in one hand while he takes a sip with the other."

Despite his attempts to remain inconspicuous, Fergus can't help but glance back toward her. Although Dil's face is turned away, she slyly observes him through the reflection in the mirror, catching his eye. Meanwhile, the barman approaches Fergus, his demeanor exuding a profound sense of weariness just as Fergus is about to speak when Dil interjects. As the barman efficiently mixes her drink, Dil continues to fixate on the mirror, strategically watching Fergus, who awkwardly tries to avoid making direct eye contact with her. Once the barman completes mixing her drink, he hands it over to Dil. At that moment, a burly man comes over and takes a seat beside her. She promptly reacts by slapping his hand away, dismissively turning her attention back to Fergus. However, when she looks back, she is surprised to find that Fergus’s seat is now empty. Fergus has discreetly exited the pub and is standing across the road, visibly sweating under pressure. Dil emerges from the pub, scanning the area anxiously in search of Fergus, who skillfully steps back into the shadows to avoid being seen. Just then, Dave, the burly man, also exits the pub. He approaches Dil, grabbing her by the elbow, and she reluctantly starts walking away with him. Dave persists, once again grasping her elbow while they navigate through a run-down street lined with squatter buildings. Eventually, they come to a stop in front of a door. Dil retrieves a key from her purse, uses it to unlock the door, and both she and Dave proceed to enter the building. Fergus remains outside, observing the scene unfold. A moment later, a light switches on in an upstairs room as Dil enters, her silhouette visible against the curtain, soon joined by the shadow of Dave. Dave begins to unbutton her blouse, and Dil stands motionless as he continues. Meanwhile, Fergus is depicted lying in bed, transitioning into a vision where Jody, portrayed as a bowler, runs in slow motion toward the camera before releasing the ball. Fergus, still lying in bed, breathes heavily, caught in the moment. Taking a break from this intense scene, he watches the batsman hit a ball on the field and mirrors the batsman's swinging motion with his sledgehammer. This moment gets interrupted by a voice, which catches Fergus's attention, prompting him to turn around and see Tristram Deveroux, a young Sloane type dressed impeccably in a three-piece suit, who happens to be the owner of the house. Alongside Tristram is Franknum, the cockney foreman. With the interruption over, Fergus resumes his work, and soon the place is bustling with a diverse group of people—black, white, punky, and street chic, with a noticeable prevalence of leather attire and heavily made-up women. From the way Fergus awkwardly maneuvers through the crowd, it's clear that he is not accustomed to being in this type of environment, especially not at night. His cheap suit makes him feel particularly out of place as he makes his way toward the bar. Col, the barman, notices Fergus's approach and greets him with a friendly smile, sliding a colorful cocktail adorned with a small Japanese umbrella across the counter toward him. Fergus hesitantly reaches for his wallet in an attempt to pay for the drink, but Col stops him, indicating it's not necessary. Trying to appear as though he's well-acquainted with the drink, and by extension, the social norms of the place, Fergus attempts to take a sip. However, the decorative umbrella persistently obstructs his attempt to drink, forcing him to remove the umbrella, hold it in one hand, and finally sip the cocktail with the other, hoping to blend in."

She has her face turned away but sees him in the mirror, a large ornate piece that reflects the entire room, and eyes him. The barman, with infinite weariness that comes from long nights of dealing with the bar's lively clientele, approaches Fergus, who is about to talk when she pipes up. The barman, known for mixing cocktails that draw people in from all over the city, mixes it while she stares at the mirror, staring at Fergus, who is trying to avoid her eyes. The barman hands her the drink, and a burly man, clearly accustomed to the rougher pubs in this part of town, sits down beside her. She slaps the hand away, turns back to Fergus, and finds his seat empty. Fergus is standing across the road from the pub, sweating under the streetlights that cast long shadows. Dil comes out of the pub, looks this way and that with a sense of urgency, searching for Fergus, who stands back into a shadow, a common hiding place from the prying eyes of the bustling street. Dave, the burly man, comes out, grabs her by the elbow with the casual force often used to assert control, and she walks off. Dave follows, grabs her by the elbow again, and they walk with him holding Dil by the arm through a dilapidated street full of squats, remnants of past protests and housing issues. They stop outside a door; Dil opens it with a key from her purse, a testament to her familiarity with the place, and they both walk inside. Fergus stands there, observing from a distance as if caught in a drama not meant for him.

Jody releases the ball, and we see Fergus in bed, breathing heavily.

Then a voice interrupts him, and Fergus turns to see Tristram Deveroux, a young Sloane type in a three-piece suit, whose house it is, and beside him is Franknum, the cockney foreman, both figures known for their somewhat elitist air amidst the working environment. Fergus resumes work, and it is now crowded with people, black, white, punky, and street chic, a lot of leather, with all the women heavily made-up, creating an eclectic, vibrant scene indicative of the city's multicultural nightlife. From the way Fergus walks through, it is obvious he has never been here at night. He seems most out of place in his cheap suit, a stark contrast to the fashion-forward crowd, making his way through the crowd to the bar. Col, the barman, sees him and smiles, pushing a colored cocktail with a Japanese umbrella that adds a touch of whimsy toward him. Fergus reaches for his wallet to pay, but Col interrupts, indicating that this particular drink is on the house. Fergus tries to pretend he's familiar with the drink, part of the social camouflage to blend in with the norms of the place. He lifts the glass to his mouth, but the umbrella keeps getting in the way, so Fergus takes out the umbrella, holds it in one hand, and drinks with the other, finally managing to enjoy the concoction."

          "description": "Jasper is observing Edith, who chuckles and hides her face in her sandwich, but directs her gaze back toward him again. He has his gaze turned aside but notices her in the window reflection and glances at her. The waitress, with endless annoyance, strides toward Edith, who is about to laugh when he blurts out. The waitress brews it while he peeks at the window, glancing at Edith, who is attempting to ignore his gaze. The waitress hands him the pie, and a lanky woman plops down next to him. He swats her hand away, turns back to Edith, and discovers her chair vacant. Edith is standing by the fountain across from the café, fidgeting. Jasper exits the café, glances around, searching for Edith, who steps away into a corner. Laurie, the lanky woman, exits, nudges him on the shoulder, and he strolls away. Laurie trails, nudges him on the shoulder again, and they amble with her clutching Jasper by the wrist through a desolate avenue full of shacks. They pause outside a gate; Jasper unlocks it with a coin from his backpack, and they both step inside. Edith stands there, watching. A lamp flickers on in an upper suite, and Jasper arrives, with his silhouette seen behind the drapes and the silhouette of Laurie following him. She starts to remove his jacket, and he stands utterly motionless as she proceeds. Edith is on a couch, and we see Martin as a gymnast, stumbling in slow motion, toward the lens. Martin tosses the frisbee, and we observe Edith on a couch, exhaling heavily. Edith takes a pause, witnesses the runner catch a frisbee, and mimics the runner's motion with her jump rope. Then a melody disturbs him, and Edith spins to view Lancelot Waverly, a youthful dandy in a double-breasted coat, whose villa it is, and near him is Dougal, the cockney supervisor. Edith resumes relaxation, and it is now packed with folks, all hues, gothic, and bohemian, with much denim, and all the men sporting hats. From the manner Edith drifts through, it is clear she hasn't been this way at dusk. She appears utterly misplaced in her worn sweater, navigating her path through the gathering to the snack table. Quinn, the waitress, notices her and grins, nudging a vibrant smoothie with an ornate stirrer toward her. Edith searches for her purse to settle the bill, but Quinn disrupts. Edith attempts to feign familiarity with the smoothie, and by association, whatever are the customs of the spot. She tilts the cup toward her lips, but the stirrer persistently obstructs, so Edith draws out the stirrer, grips it in one hand, and sips with the other."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Dave, the burly man, follows Dil, grabbing her arm as they navigate a rundown street. At her door, Dil lets them in, and Fergus watches a light come on upstairs, observing their shadows as Dave removes Dil’s blouse.\n\nLater, Fergus fantasizes about cricket with Jody. A foreman interrupts, and Fergus resumes work amidst a diverse crowd, looking out of place in his cheap suit. He heads to the bar where Col, the barman, offers a colorful cocktail. Fergus awkwardly pretends familiarity with the setting, struggling with the drink’s umbrella before removing it to sip."
