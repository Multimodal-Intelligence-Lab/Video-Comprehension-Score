We are looking down into the wall of the staircase from the point of view of the landing, where a branched candlestick held by Salieri's Valet ascends the stairs, accompanied by Salieri's Cook bearing a large dish of sugared cakes and biscuits. Both men are desperately worried: the Valet is thin and middle-aged; the Cook, plump and Italian, wearing shawls over their night-dresses and clogs on their feet, wheezing as they climb. The candles cast shadows on the peeling walls of the evidently old and decaying house. As they reach the salon door, a cat scuttles between their bare legs. The Valet tries the handle, and in horror, the two men stare at it as the door flies open, revealing Old Salieri lying on the floor in a pool of blood, an open razor in his hand. He has cut his throat but is still alive and gestures at them. They run to him, and we glimpse the room—an old chair, old tables piled with books, a forte-piano, a chamber-pot on the floor—as the Valet and the Cook struggle to lift their old Master and bind his bleeding throat with a napkin. The scene shifts to twenty-five dancing couples, fifty guests, ten servants, and a full orchestra at a Masquerade Ball, where music slows and reveals a crowded room of dancers executing the slow portion of a fashionable dance from the early 1820s. As the fast music returns, Old Salieri is carried out of his house on a stretcher by two attendants and placed in a horse-drawn wagon under the supervision of a middle-aged doctor in a tall hat. The driver whips up the horse, and the wagon dashes off through the still-falling snow, galloping through the snowy streets of the city. Inside, Old Salieri, wrapped in blankets and half-conscious, is held by the hospital attendants, with Doctor Gulden staring at him grimly. The wagon arrives outside the General Hospital of Vienna, and a wide, white-washed corridor is seen where Doctor Gulden walks down with Father Vogler, the hospital's Chaplain. Several patients, some visibly disturbed, wearing white linen smocks, are noted in the corridor as Doctor Gulden, in a dark frock-coat, and Vogler, in a cassock, walk. Salieri propels his wheelchair to the forte-piano and plays an unrecognizable melody, then another tune, and continues to play with growing enthusiasm.",

We are observing down into the barrier of the staircase from the perspective of the landing, where a branching candelabrum held by Salieri's Servant climbs the steps, accompanied by Salieri's Chef carrying a large platter of sweetened pastries and cookies. Both men are extremely anxious: the Servant is lean and middle-aged; the Chef, stout and Italian, wearing shawls over their sleeping-garments and clogs on their feet, wheezing as they ascend. The candles project silhouettes on the flaking walls of the evidently ancient and deteriorating abode. As they approach the salon door, a feline darts between their exposed legs. The Servant attempts the handle, and in dread, the two men gaze at it as the door swings open, showing Old Salieri lying on the ground in a pool of blood, an open razor in his hand. He has sliced his throat but is still alive and signals at them. They hurry to him, and we glimpse the chamber—an old chair, old tables stacked with tomes, a forte-piano, a chamber-pot on the floor—as the Servant and the Chef struggle to lift their old Master and bind his bleeding throat with a napkin. The scene shifts to twenty-five waltzing pairs, fifty visitors, ten attendants, and a full band at a Masquerade Gala, where music slows and shows a crowded hall of dancers performing the slow section of a trendy dance from the early 1820s. As the fast music resumes, Old Salieri is borne out of his residence on a stretcher by two aides and placed in a horse-drawn carriage under the supervision of a middle-aged physician in a tall hat. The driver urges the horse, and the carriage speeds off through the still-falling snow, racing through the snowy avenues of the metropolis. Inside, Old Salieri, enveloped in blankets and semi-conscious, is held by the hospital aides, with Doctor Gulden watching him sternly. The carriage arrives outside the General Hospital of Vienna, and a wide, white-washed corridor is seen where Doctor Gulden walks down with Father Vogler, the hospital's Chaplain. Several patients, some visibly agitated, wearing white linen smocks, are noted in the corridor as Doctor Gulden, in a dark frock-coat, and Vogler, in a cassock, walk. Salieri propels his wheelchair to the forte-piano and plays an indistinct harmony, then another tune, and continues to play with increasing zeal."

Our viewpoint, situated on the landing, allows us to look downward into the wall of this winding staircase, where we observe Salieri's Valet making his careful ascent up the stairs. In his hand, he holds a branched candlestick, its soft light casting a warm glow, and by his side walks Salieri's Cook, who is attentively carrying a large dish filled to the brim with an enticing assortment of sugared cakes and biscuits. Both men seem to be desperately worried and visibly anxious: the Valet is a thin, middle-aged gentleman, whereas the Cook is of Italian descent and noticeably plump. They are both clad in shawls that are draped over their night-dresses, with clogs on their feet, wheezing as they laboriously climb the winding staircase. The flickering candlelight casts eerie, unsettling shadows on the peeling walls of the evidently old and decaying house, contributing significantly to the somber and melancholic atmosphere. As they finally reach the salon door, a cat suddenly scuttles quickly between their bare legs, startling them. The Valet tentatively reaches for and tries the handle, and in a moment of horror, both men stare in shock as the door swings open, revealing Old Salieri lying on the floor, surrounded by a pool of his own blood, with an open razor clutched in his hand. He has attempted to cut his throat, yet he is still alive, weakly gesturing to them for assistance.

We are looking down into the wall of the staircase from the point of view of the landing, where a branched candlestick held by Salieri's Valet ascends the stairs, accompanied by Salieri's Cook bearing a large dish of sugared cakes and biscuits, a common delicacy enjoyed by the European elite in the 18th century. Both men are desperately worried: the Valet is thin and middle-aged; the Cook, plump and Italian, a nationality renowned for culinary excellence, wearing shawls over their night-dresses and clogs on their feet, wheezing as they climb. The candles cast shadows on the peeling walls of the evidently old and decaying house, reminiscent of many aristocratic residences fallen into disrepair during economic hardships. As they reach the salon door, a cat, often kept in households to control vermin, scuttles between their bare legs. The Valet tries the handle, and in horror, the two men stare at it as the door flies open, revealing Old Salieri lying on the floor in a pool of blood, an open razor in his hand. He has cut his throat but is still alive and gestures at them. They run to him, and we glimpse the room—an old chair, old tables piled with books, a forte-piano, an instrument central to classical music compositions of the era, a chamber-pot on the floor—as the Valet and the Cook struggle to lift their old Master and bind his bleeding throat with a napkin. The scene shifts to twenty-five dancing couples, fifty guests, ten servants, and a full orchestra at a Masquerade Ball, a popular social gathering in the early 19th century, where music slows and reveals a crowded room of dancers executing the slow portion of a fashionable dance from the early 1820s, such as the waltz or quadrille. As the fast music returns, Old Salieri is carried out of his house on a stretcher by two attendants and placed in a horse-drawn wagon, the primary mode of ambulance transport before motor vehicles, under the supervision of a middle-aged doctor in a tall hat, a common accessory signifying status in this period. The driver whips up the horse, and the wagon dashes off through the still-falling snow, galloping through the snowy streets of the city that resemble 19th-century Vienna, a center of music and culture. Inside, Old Salieri, wrapped in blankets, a precaution against the harsh winter cold, and half-conscious, is held by the hospital attendants, with Doctor Gulden staring at him grimly. The wagon arrives outside the General Hospital of Vienna, one of the oldest and largest hospitals in Europe, and a wide, white-washed corridor is seen where Doctor Gulden walks down with Father Vogler, the hospital's Chaplain and spiritual advisor for the patients. Several patients, some visibly disturbed, wearing white linen smocks, reminiscent of the typical hospital attire of the time, are noted in the corridor as Doctor Gulden, in a dark frock-coat, and Vogler, in a cassock, walk. Salieri propels his wheelchair to the forte-piano and plays an unrecognizable melody, then another tune, and continues to play with growing enthusiasm, perhaps in an attempt to reconnect with the music that defined much of his life."

Both men are desperately worried. the Valet is thin and middleaged. the Cook plump and Italian wearing shawls over their nightdresses and clogs on their feet wheezing as they climb. The wagon arrives outside the General Hospital of Vienna and a wide whitewashed corridor is seen where Doctor Gulden walks down with Father Vogler the hospital's Chaplain. Several patients some visibly disturbed wearing white linen smocks are noted in the corridor as Doctor Gulden in a dark frockcoat and Vogler in a cassock walk. Salieri propels his wheelchair to the fortepiano and plays an unrecognizable melody then another tune and continues to play. with growing enthusiasm."

          "description": "A dim glow brightens the monitor, randomly displaying a nineteenth-century fountain and a walkway of wooden planks. We are peering up into the ceiling of the hallway from the vantage point of the corridor, where a twisted lantern gripped by Beethoven's Gardener descends the walkway, accompanied by Beethoven's Butler holding a tiny platter of salted fruits and pastries. Both women are anxiously puzzled: the Gardener is short and young; the Butler, thin and German, donning cloaks over their tunics and slippers on their hands, coughing as they descend. The lanterns project shapes on the crumbling ceiling of the apparent new and flourishing palace. As they approach the study entrance, a mouse darts around their bare arms. The Gardener tests the latch, and in shock, the two women gaze at it as the entrance bursts shut, concealing Young Beethoven kneeling on the ceiling in a pile of feathers, a closed scissors in his foot. He has scratched his chin but is still awake and signals to them. They crawl to him, and we glimpse the chamber—a new bench, new cabinets stacked with scrolls, a harpsichord, a goblet on the ceiling—as the Gardener and the Butler attempt to lower their young Mentor and unwrap his scratched chin with a blanket. The scene switches to twelve jumping chickens, thirty swans, five attendants, and an empty stage at a Carnival Parade, where silence slows and uncovers a sparse space of animals performing the silent portion of a traditional tune from the late 1830s. As the quick silence returns, Young Beethoven is dragged into his palace on a wheelbarrow by three nurses and placed in a cow-drawn sledge under the observation of a youthful nurse in a short cap. The pilot tugs at the mule, and the sledge strolls on through the ever-rising rain, swimming through the wet paths of the village. Outside, Young Beethoven, encased in sheets and partly alert, is supported by the refuge nurses, with Nurse Rein staring at him joyfully. The sledge departs inside the Big Refuge of Berlin, and a narrow, dark-paved chamber is observed where Nurse Rein strolls up with Brother Bauer, the refuge's Poet. Various visitors, a few visibly amused, wearing light green gowns, are noticed in the chamber as Nurse Rein, in a bright blouse, and Bauer, in a vest, stroll. Beethoven steers his scooter to the harpsichord and sings an indistinct symphony, then another jingle, and pauses to sing with dwindling excitement."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

They find Old Salieri in a pool of blood, having attempted suicide with a razor. Desperately, they bind his throat and reveal his cluttered room during the struggle. The scene shifts to a Masquerade Ball with fifty guests and an orchestra when Salieri is carried out on a stretcher by attendants, overseen by Doctor Gulden. The wagon speeds through snowy Vienna streets to the General Hospital. There, Doctor Gulden and Chaplain Father Vogler walk through a corridor past disturbed patients. Later, Salieri, in a wheelchair, plays a forte-piano with increasing fervor."
