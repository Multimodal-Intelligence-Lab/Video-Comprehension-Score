          "description": "At the orchard, Jasper nods to Mr. Juniper's cat, and Lucy observes as he shares his greetings. Mopsy waves paws with Jasper, and Ladybug pats him. Blonde-haired Lucy observes as he drifts away. Carrying a sack and a duffel, Jasper, who now resembles someone in his late 70s, skips along the trail until he gets to the end of the path. He pauses and notices Lucy skipping after him, but she turns and skips back down the lane. Jasper marches on up the path. In the studio, Penelope peeks into a crate stuffed with old brochures tied up with twine. Meanwhile, Lucy executes a cartwheel. Captain Joe and Jasper are on the ice-covered raft, where Joe gestures to a necklace on his ankle and traces a circle with his elbow. The siblings commence to wrestle. In a corridor, Jasper now resembles someone in his 40s. To Jasper, as he trails them out of the escalator. Back on the ice-covered raft of the barge, the barge is dragging a colossal raft. Later, Jasper rests in the chamber in the hostel and discovers Matilda in the lounge of the hostel. She's perched on a stool, a cloak over her jumpsuit, scribbling. Jasper, in his cloak, ambles towards the pantry, then swivels back to her. He ambles through to the pantry, and Matilda gazes after him, folds the leaflet she was reading, and rises. She peers into the pantry, where Jasper is occupied crafting the cider, and strolls in as Jasper glances up. Matilda parts her lips as though about to utter something. Jasper moves to her counter and grips two German cider mugs and their sleeves, sets the dusty sugar jar down, and transports the cider mugs and the cider jug over to a counter. Matilda reclines as Jasper dispenses the cider. Jasper settles down, and they examine each other across the counter. Matilda wags her pinkie, and Jasper inspects the cider jug. Matilda appears slightly embarrassed as he dispenses her a glass, which she quaffs pensively. They exchange a grin, sip their cider, and both chuckle again. Heavy frost descends over the barge. Later, Jasper steps downstairs, and Matilda rises to meet him, appearing slightly unsettled as she turns to Jasper and drifts away. In the studio, at the gymnastics academy, young Lucy peruses Jasper's memo and, feeling somber, she flips with other acrobats in front of a panel of officials. At dusk in the hostel, Jasper descends into the lounge and discovers Matilda clad in a formal gown. They perch at a counter in the hostel dining area where Jasper cautiously samples a nibble of escargot."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
