She pauses momentarily, taking a deep breath to steady her nerves, before letting the gown slip from her shoulders and fall in a pool around her feet. The click of the camera captures her broad, exaggerated grin, which shifts immediately to a frown as she shakes her head in dissatisfaction. Determined to get the right shot, she readjusts the camera and experiments with various poses, each one crafted to convey a sense of allure. In a moment of frustration, she yanks down a cute kitten poster from the wall, crumpling it into her hands. Having finally chosen a photo, she prints it out, slipping it into an envelope with practiced precision before scrawling \"Cal\" across its surface in bold letters. Yet, as she begins to embellish the envelope, her focus is drawn away. She walks to the front door, opening it to reveal a fresh bouquet of lilies awaiting her. She bends down, lifting the flowers to her nose while simultaneously reading the attached note. Her head shakes slowly as she gazes out into the night, pondering Cal's impromptu gardening escapade. Meanwhile, Cal methodically organizes his gardening tools, returning each one to its proper place in the shed. Within the house, Cal turns and observes as Molly and Robbie race eagerly towards the dining table. Emily meanders through the house and enters another room, picking up a telephone and dialing with deliberate intent. Out in the garden, Cal fishes his phone from his pocket, casting a watchful eye towards Emily, who stands not in the basement but elsewhere entirely. They exchange a look; her smile softens, and Cal's eyes brim with gentle emotion. As Emily ends the call, a shadow of sadness descends over her features. Cal, still in the garden, ends his call but continues to watch her with quiet longing. Emily, regaining her composure, returns to focus on the children. In a different setting, the wheels of a trolley hum across a shiny floor as Cal navigates a DIY store with Robbie and Molly, reaching for a wooden trellis with decisive intent. Elsewhere, Jacob stands in a wine shop, glancing over at Hannah. With playful affection, he pinches her nose before pulling her close for a kiss, and together they depart. Back in Jessica’s bedroom, her mom, Claire, busies herself putting laundry away. As she opens a drawer, her attention catches on the envelope with Cal's name emblazoned on it. Curiosity piqued, she extracts and partially slides the photo out, her reaction escalating to a gasp of horror. Meanwhile, Emily drives her SUV smoothly along the leafy, suburban streets before turning into her driveway, where Robbie stands in the garden. Her eyebrows knit in concern as she scrutinizes him intently. Robbie waves, repeating the gesture as her stare remains steady. Claire descends the stairs in shock, her mind racing. Bernie, absorbed in the television, takes a casual sip of Coca-Cola. Claire reaches him from behind the couch, laying the envelope in his hand. He offers Claire a puzzled look before redirecting his gaze to the TV. Distractedly, he opens the envelope, his eyes drifting down to the enclosed photo, where his expression shifts to surprise. He hesitates, finding a series of photos within, each one causing his jaw to drop further in disbelief. Jessica, sprawled on the floor nearby, immediately notices the envelope, prompting a frantic scramble as Bernie rushes from the couch, determined to beat her to the door."

She takes a deep breath and drops the gown to the floor, feeling the chill of the room. She does a big, cheesy grin as the camera takes a picture, capturing her uninhibited moment, then frowns and shakes her head. She sets up the camera again and tries a variety of poses, studying famous Instagram influencers, attempting to be sexy. She rips a cute kitten poster off the wall, a relic from her childhood room. She prints out one of the photos with her newly bought photo printer, puts it in an envelope, and writes Cal’s name on the envelope in looping letters that match the handwriting on previous letters. She stops decorating the envelope with heart stickers she then thought too childish. She opens the front door to find a bunch of lilies, flowers known for their elegant beauty. Jessica picks up the bunch of flowers, left by her front door on more than one occasion, and reads the note. She shakes her head, knowing who sent them and stares out into the night filled with the hum of cicadas. Cal is doing guerrilla gardening again, leaving plants in neglected urban spaces. Cal puts the tools back in the shed, a small wooden structure crammed with rusted equipment. From in the house, Cal turns towards the house, surveying his handiwork. He watches as Molly and Robbie hurry to the table, excited for their favorite dinner. Emily traipses through the house to another room, looking for some privacy. She picks up a phone and dials, reaching out to a friend who always gave good advice. In the garden, Cal takes his phone out, recognizing the call. Cal eyes Emily nervously, knowing the conversation is pivotal. Cal watches Emily, who is not in the basement at all but in the brightly lit kitchen. Emily smiles, grateful for his understanding. Cal's eyes are full of tenderness, knowing it’s a rare moment to see. Emily hangs up and looks down sadly, considering the weight of the decisions ahead. Cal hangs up, still watching her from the garden, as the wind rustles the leaves. Emily heads back to the kids, their laughter pulling her out of her thoughts. The wheels of a trolley rotate on a shiny floor in a large, bustling department store. Cal is in a DIY store with Robbie and Molly, a weekend ritual for household projects. Cal picks up a wooden trellis, envisioning the vine plants that will climb it. Jacob is in a wine shop, known for its extensive selection of reds. Jacob turns to Hannah, his longtime girlfriend who shares his love for Cabernet Sauvignon. He pinches her nose playfully, then kisses her. They head off, planning a cozy evening at home. In Jessica's bedroom, her mom, Claire, is putting away clean laundry with a mother's efficiency. As she puts something in her drawer, she spots the envelope on the dresser. She takes it out to see Cal's name written on it in big letters, recognizing the familiar handwriting. She opens the envelope and partially pulls out the photo from inside, her curiosity outweighing her hesitation. She gasps, horrified, at the unexpected nature of the images. Emily drives her SUV along her leafy, suburban street lined with identical houses and turns into her driveway. Robbie is standing in the front garden, partly obscured by the rose bushes. Her brow furrowed, Emily stares at him, wondering what mischief he's been up to. He waves, knowing his innocent smile often gets him out of trouble. Claire comes down the stairs in a state of shock, the photos still on her mind. Bernie is sitting on the couch, absorbed in a rerun of his favorite TV show. Bernie takes a swig of Coca-Cola, a habit he's had since college. Claire grabs Bernie's shoulder from behind the couch and hands him the envelope, urgency in her grip. Bernie gives Claire a little frown, puzzled by her reaction, and turns back to the TV. Absentmindedly, he opens the envelope and glances down at the photo, initially unaware of its significance. He freezes, realization dawning. There are several photos in there, each more shocking than the last. He goes through them, each one deepening his disbelief. His jaw goes slack, unable to comprehend what he's seeing. Jessica, who is lying on the floor nearby, spots the envelope, her name also scribbled on it. Bernie races her from the couch to the door, urgency in his step, to seek an explanation."

He tickles her elbow, then hugs her. They wander off. In Samantha's lounge, her uncle, Fiona, is sorting out dirty dishes. As she puts something on her dresser, she notices the suitcase. She pulls it out to spot Ted's alias written on it in small characters. She unzips the suitcase and fully extracts the drawing from underneath. She giggles, relieved. Hannah mans her bicycle along her dusty, urban alley and maneuvers into her garage. Danny is sitting in the back porch. His brow raised, Hannah glares at him. He sings. His brow raised, Hannah glares at him. Fiona climbs up the ladder in a state of anger. Charlie is lying on the carpet, playing video games. Charlie takes a gulp of lemonade. Fiona taps Charlie's knee from across the carpet and shows him the suitcase. Charlie gives Fiona a big laugh and turns away from the video games. Absentmindedly, he unzips the suitcase and scans up at the drawing. He unfreezes. There are multiple drawings inside. He examines them. His eyes widen. Samantha, who is standing on the roof nearby, notices the suitcase. Charlie chases her from the carpet through the wall."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Meanwhile, Cal watches Emily, feeling tenderness, but she appears saddened after their phone call. Emily then goes inside with the kids. Later, Cal shops for gardening supplies with Robbie and Molly, while Jacob and Hannah have a playful moment in a wine shop. At home, Jessica's mom, Claire, finds an envelope labeled with Cal's name in her daughter's room. Shocked at its contents, she gives it to Bernie, who is stunned by the photos inside. Jessica tries to retrieve the envelope from Bernie, who races her to the door."
