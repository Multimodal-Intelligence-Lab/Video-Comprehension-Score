In response, Ferris exits the vehicle as well and positions himself casually against a wall within the confines of the surveillance room, while Bassam proceeds along the same track accompanied by Nizar. Observant as ever, Ferris takes out his cell phone and glances at it, only to be distracted by something shiny reflecting in the sky—it is the Predator drone, which is being maneuvered to a higher altitude. Meanwhile, Nizar climbs into the front seat of the vehicle, and Ferris, seated comfortably in the back, begins to peel and eat an orange. Nizar, showing signs of unease, glances downward pensively, then looks away into the distance, opening his mouth in contemplation before focusing straight ahead. With a deliberate motion, Nizar unzips his coat, retrieves a computer disk, and extends it to Ferris, who then watches the contents unfold on his laptop screen, revealing the image of Al-Saleem. Ferris decides to make a phone call using his cell phone to contact Hoffman, who is leisurely lounging on his yacht docked alongside a jetty near his expansive home, as Hoffman's wife emerges from the residence. Concluding the call, Ferris hangs up, slides on his sunglasses, and begins to walk purposefully down the track to join Bassam and Nizar, all the while holding his gun with intent. Hoffman, meanwhile, sits intently watching a surveillance screen displaying Ferris and Bassam, both engaged with their cell phones as they keep watch on Nizar, who rides along a bustling street in the town atop a moped. The men subsequently shoot at Nizar, causing him to fall, prompting four others to rush to his aid, carrying the wounded Nizar to the back of a van. Ferris, with precision, aims his pistol and shoots Nizar in the head before making a quick getaway. The surveillance feed captures this scene from an aerial perspective, allowing Hoffman to receive a call from Ferris, who is now walking alongside Bassam. The two, Bassam and Ferris, then drive along a rugged dirt road, eventually stopping at the crest of a hill, where Bassam carefully reverses the vehicle a few feet. Ferris stealthily approaches some rocks, takes out his binoculars, and peers down at a cluster of stone houses, where a man is busy by a fire, burning CDs and cassettes.

In a nonchalant response, Ferris decides to exit the vehicle as well, positioning himself in a relaxed manner against a sturdy wall within the confines of the surveillance room. Meanwhile, Bassam continues along the very same track, with Nizar accompanying him closely. Ever observant and alert, Ferris retrieves his cell phone from his pocket and gives it a quick glance, only to have his attention diverted by something glinting brilliantly in the sky—it's the Predator drone, which is being carefully maneuvered to a higher altitude. As this happens, Nizar climbs into the front seat of the vehicle, and Ferris, who is now seated comfortably in the back, begins to peel an orange slowly, savoring each juicy section. Nizar, exhibiting a sense of unease, glances downward pensively before shifting his gaze into the distant horizon, opening his mouth wide in contemplation before fixing his attention straight ahead. With a deliberate and thoughtful motion, Nizar unzips his coat, retrieves a small computer disk, and extends it towards Ferris, who then proceeds to watch the contents unfold on his laptop screen. The image displayed is that of Al-Saleem. Ferris, making a quick decision, uses his cell phone to make a call to Hoffman, who is leisurely relaxing on his luxurious yacht docked alongside a jetty near his expansive, beautiful home, as Hoffman's wife gracefully emerges from the residence. After concluding the phone call, Ferris hangs up, slides on a pair of sunglasses with precision, and begins to walk purposefully down the track to reunite with Bassam and Nizar, all the while holding his trusty gun with a sense of intent. Meanwhile, Hoffman sits intently, eyes fixed on a surveillance screen displaying Ferris and Bassam, both engaged intently with their cell phones as they keep a watchful eye on Nizar, who rides through a bustling, busy street in town atop a small moped. The men subsequently open fire at Nizar, causing him to tumble forcefully to the ground, which prompts four others to rush to his aid, hastily carrying the wounded Nizar to the back of a van. Ferris, with precise accuracy, aims his pistol and shoots Nizar in the head before making a swift getaway. The surveillance feed captures this dramatic scene from a high aerial perspective, allowing Hoffman to receive another call from Ferris, who is now walking alongside Bassam with a determined stride. The two, Bassam and Ferris, drive along a rugged and uneven dirt road, eventually coming to a stop at the crest of a hill, where Bassam cautiously reverses the vehicle a few feet. Ferris stealthily approaches a cluster of rocks, takes out his binoculars, and carefully peers down at a cluster of stone houses, where a man is busy by a fire, burning CDs and cassettes. He uses his radio to communicate with Bassam, who retrieves a rifle from the rear section of the robust four-by-four vehicle. Ferris, dressed in traditional robes, a warm jacket, and a skull cap, begins to make his careful way down the hill towards the Iraqi man by the fire. At the same time, Bassam positions himself strategically among the rocks, setting up the rifle's stand with precision. The man at the fire notices Ferris, frowning as Ferris engages him in conversation in Arabic and surveys the surrounding area with keen eyes. Through a telescopic sight, Bassam observes Mehdi, a bearded individual, as he emerges, and he promptly shoots him with accuracy. Ferris eliminates the man by the fire efficiently, and when another person unexpectedly appears from behind a nearby wall, Bassam swiftly takes aim and shoots him too. A young man then rushes out of the house, firing a weapon, prompting Bassam to descend the hill rapidly and make a call. Ferris, amidst the ensuing chaos, throws a grenade into the courtyard, charging in with guns blazing as he engages in an intense exchange of gunfire with the young man. At the same time, two helicopters approach the scene rapidly, their rotors slicing through the air with a loud whoosh as the young man cautiously peers out from his concealed position behind a sturdy wall."

Ferris then steps out and, after glancing around, positions himself against a wall in the surveillance room, carefully watching as Bassam continues his stride along the track with Nizar by his side. With a casual motion, Ferris pulls out his cell phone, his eyes drawn skyward as he notices a glinting object, which he quickly discerns to be a Predator drone ascending to a higher altitude. Meanwhile, Nizar climbs into the vehicle, taking the front seat as Ferris, seated comfortably in the back, peels and enjoys an orange, savoring each juicy segment. Nizar, seemingly nervous, casts his eyes downwards before turning his gaze away, his lips parting as if to speak but remaining silent, his thoughts appearing to consume him. In a methodical motion, Nizar unzips his coat, retrieves a computer disk, and hands it to Ferris, who accepts it and swiftly loads it into his laptop, attentively watching as footage of Al-Saleem fills the screen. In response to the unfolding situation, Ferris uses his cell phone to call Hoffman, who is leisurely seated on his yacht, tethered to a jetty next to his sprawling house, while Hoffman's wife emerges from within the house. Concluding the call, Ferris smoothly dons his sunglasses, then strides back down the track to rendezvous with Bassam and Nizar, all the while confidently brandishing his gun. Hoffman remains focused, eyes fixed on a surveillance feed displaying Ferris and Bassam, both engaged with their cell phones, as they monitor Nizar navigating a busy street on a moped. The tension peaks as the men open fire on Nizar, who tumbles to the ground, prompting four others to rush in and lift his wounded form, transporting him with haste to the back of a van. In a decisive moment, Ferris steadies his pistol and delivers a fatal shot to Nizar's head before making a swift escape. The surveillance screen offers a bird's-eye view of the chaotic scene, and shortly thereafter, Hoffman receives another call from Ferris, who is now walking alongside Bassam. The two men proceed to drive along a dusty dirt road, reaching an elevated vantage point where Bassam briefly reverses the vehicle. With cautious steps, Ferris sneaks up behind a cluster of rocks, extracting binoculars from his pack to survey a nearby cluster of stone houses, where he observes a man tending to a fire that consumes CDs and cassettes. Ferris relays this information to Bassam via radio, prompting Bassam to procure a rifle from the back of the four-by-four. Garbed in traditional robes, a jacket, and a skull cap, Ferris descends the hill toward the Iraqi man by the fire, as Bassam discreetly finds cover among some rocks, preparing the rifle's stand. The man at the fire, catching sight of Ferris, knits his brows in suspicion as Ferris speaks in Arabic, cautiously scanning his surroundings. Bassam peers through his rifle's telescopic sight, locating Mehdi, a bearded figure, and, with precision, takes the shot. In quick succession, Ferris eliminates the man by the fire, and as another adversary emerges from behind a wall, Bassam efficiently neutralizes him as well. Amidst the chaos, a young man dashes out of the house, firing as he goes, while Bassam races down and places a call. Acting swiftly, Ferris hurls a grenade into a courtyard, charging in with guns blazing and engaging in a fierce exchange of gunfire with the young man. Meanwhile, two helicopters slice through the air, drawing ever closer to the scene, as the embattled young man peers out cautiously from behind a protective wall."

Ferris also gets out and stands by a wall in the surveillance room, a high-tech facility equipped with the latest in monitoring technology, while Bassam continues along the track with Nizar. Ferris takes out his cell phone and looks at it, noticing something glinting in the sky, which is the Predator drone, an unmanned aerial vehicle used extensively for reconnaissance missions, being flown to a higher altitude. Nizar gets in the front of the vehicle, a rugged SUV designed for traversing difficult terrains, and Ferris, sitting in the back, eats an orange, a common snack in the Middle East known for its refreshing taste.

Ferris radios Bassam, who retrieves a rifle from the back of the four-by-four, a vehicle equipped for tactical operations. Wearing traditional robes, a jacket, and a skull cap, Ferris walks down the hill towards the Iraqi by the fire, while Bassam gets down by some rocks, setting up the rifle's stand for a steady shot. The man at the fire sees Ferris and frowns as Ferris speaks Arabic, the local language, and looks around. Bassam uses a telescopic sight to view Mehdi, a bearded man whose movements are monitored closely, as he walks out and then shoots him, eliminating a potential threat. Ferris kills the man by the fire, and when another man pops up from behind a wall, Bassam shoots him, showcasing their lethal coordination. A young man runs out of the house shooting, and Bassam drives down and makes a call to coordinate with their backup.

          "description": "Milo hops off and waves at Roger with his mitten as he trots along the beach. Roger also hops off and leans against a tree in the greenhouse, while Milo continues along the beach with Carlo. Roger pulls out his notebook and reads it, noticing something shimmering in the jungle, which is the hawk being guided to a higher branch. Carlo sits in the front of the bicycle, and Roger, perched in the back, munches on a banana. Carlo glances up nervously, then tilts his head, opens his umbrella, and stares ahead dreamily. Carlo buttons his jacket, pulls out a typewriter ribbon, and hands it to Roger, who then inspects the ribbon on his telescope, revealing Montoya on screen. Roger dials on his notebook to Griffin, who is lounging on his raft moored by a pier near his vast mansion, while Griffin's sister strolls out of the mansion. Roger disconnects, puts on his gloves, and trots along the beach to join Milo and Carlo, wielding his slingshot. Griffin lounges watching a greenhouse screen showing Roger and Milo, both reading notebooks, observing Carlo glide along a crowded avenue in a village on a skateboard. The friends tackle Carlo, who stumbles, and six women lift the injured Carlo, carrying him to the back of the cart. Roger wields a crossbow and tackles Carlo in the shoulder before darting away. The greenhouse screen shows the scene from above, and Griffin receives a note from Roger, who is strolling with Milo. Milo and Roger pedal along a gravel path, halt at the crest of a dune, and Milo pushes the bicycle backward a few feet. Roger sneaks behind some bushes, pulls out his monocular, and gazes down at a jumble of brick huts, where a woman stands by a cauldron boiling books and magazines. Roger signals Milo, who fetches a bow from the back of the tricycle. Clad in ceremonial gowns, a waistcoat, and a beret, Roger strolls down the dune towards the Spaniard by the cauldron, while Milo crouches by some bushes, assembling the bow's frame. The woman at the cauldron notices Roger and grimaces as Roger speaks Mandarin and glances around. Milo uses a magnifying glass to observe Ned, a clean-shaven fellow, as he steps out and then lobs a rock at him. Roger tackles the woman by the cauldron, and when another woman emerges from behind a shrub, Milo lobs a rock at her. A young woman dashes out of the hut yodeling, and Milo pedals down and sends a parcel. Roger pitches a frisbee into a patio, dashes in yodeling, and trades javelins with the young woman. Meanwhile, two flamingos glide towards the location as the young woman peeks out from behind a shrub."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
