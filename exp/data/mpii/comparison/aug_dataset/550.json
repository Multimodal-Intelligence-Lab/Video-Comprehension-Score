Indy's mount is spurred on to greater speeds by him, but not only is the pace kept by the autos with his horse. In a new direction toward a railroad track, Indy is veered off. Down the track, the train is barreling. Beside it, Indy is ridden up, and from horse to train, he is leaped by him.

In response, a vintage truck and automobile come roaring out from their hidden position behind the Pueblo, driven by two more gang members with apparent urgency.

This sudden movement causes Indy to land heavily and awkwardly on his feet, standing up rather suddenly. Despite this unforeseen turn of events, Indy quickly gathers himself, stands upright with determination, and with remarkable agility, manages to mount his horse once again. Just as this unfolds, Fedora and his men reach the roof's edge, arriving just in time to observe Indy's swift climb into the saddle before he promptly gallops away into the distance. Acting with urgency, Fedora places two fingers in his mouth and emits a sharp, piercing whistle. In immediate response to this signal, a vintage truck along with an automobile come roaring out with great speed from their concealed position behind the Pueblo, driven by another two gang members who display apparent urgency and determination. The passenger in the car remains shrouded in mystery; his face is hidden by the wide brim of a large hat. However, an arm extends outward from the car's window, revealing a glimpse of an olive-hued hand emerging through the sleeve of an immaculate, expensive white linen suit. Indy, resolute and determined to make his escape, spurs his horse to achieve even greater speeds. Despite his efforts, the vehicles not only manage to keep pace with his galloping horse, they also continue closing the gap between them and Indy. In a strategic and bold move, Indy veers off in an entirely new direction, aiming purposefully toward the railroad track. As a powerful train barrels down the track with force and momentum, Indy rides up alongside it, executing a daring leap from his horse to the train itself. He clings tenaciously to the side of a boxcar as both Halfbreed and Rough Rider leap from the truck onto the train in pursuit of him. Halfbreed makes an attempt to seize Indy, but Indy skillfully avoids capture by leaping onto a different boxcar. Undeterred, Halfbreed continues to chase after him, but Indy once again leaps, this time landing on some covered boxes that are stacked atop a flatcar. Although he briefly loses his balance, Indy quickly regains it and continues onward, with Halfbreed and Rough Rider persistently hot on his trail. Indy enters through a trap door, finding himself scrambling along a narrow catwalk that is suspended from the ceiling of the car. Below him, several feet down, are numerous vats filled with various reptiles: alligators, crocodiles, giant lizards, and more. Before long, Halfbreed enters through the same trap door, with Rough Rider following closely behind. Halfbreed manages to grab hold of Indy's feet, but Indy, through rapid kicks, breaks free from his grasp. Indy then swiftly crawls away toward an opening on the opposite side of the car. Once again, Halfbreed reaches out to grab Indy's feet, but Indy rolls away, revealing large bins filled with writhing snakes. The combined weight of the three people is more than the fragile catwalk is able to hold, and soon the bolts begin to tear away under the mounting strain. Several bolts break free, causing Indy's end of the catwalk to drop abruptly. He lands with a hard splash into a vat of water, only to find himself suddenly eye-to-eye with an enormous anaconda. The head of this massive snake is so large that it looks as formidable as a Tyrannosaurus Rex. Meanwhile, Roscoe climbs up to the top of the reptile car and manages to grab hold of Indy. In response, Indy kicks at him defiantly. Roscoe clings to the side of the reptile car as Indy advances toward his next challenge.

He quickly regains his composure, straightens up, and skillfully mounts his horse. Meanwhile, Fedora and his men rush to the edge of the roof just in time to witness Indy settling into the saddle and urging his horse forward into a gallop. In response, Fedora swiftly brings two fingers to his mouth and emits a sharp whistle, signaling a vintage truck and automobile to burst forth from behind the Pueblo, both driven by additional gang members. The passenger in the car keeps his face hidden beneath the broad brim of his hat, yet he extends his arm out of the window, revealing an olive-colored hand emerging from the sleeve of an expensive white linen suit. Determined to outpace his pursuers, Indy urges his horse to gallop even faster, but the autos match the horse's speed with ease. As the chase continues, Indy abruptly changes course, heading toward a railroad track where a train is thundering along. Galloping alongside the train, Indy matches its speed before making a daring leap from his horse onto the moving train, clinging tightly to the side of a boxcar. In hot pursuit, Halfbreed and Rough Rider jump from the truck onto the train, with Halfbreed making an attempt to grab Indy, who quickly evades capture by leaping onto another boxcar. Not giving up, Halfbreed chases after him, forcing Indy to leap once more, this time onto a stack of covered boxes on a flatcar. Momentarily losing his balance, Indy manages to steady himself and, with Halfbreed and Rough Rider still in pursuit, he spots a trap door and quickly enters it, finding himself crawling along a catwalk suspended from the ceiling of a train car. Below him are several feet of space filled with vats that house a variety of reptiles: alligators, crocodiles, giant lizards, and more. With urgency, Halfbreed follows Indy through the trap door, closely followed by Rough Rider. As Halfbreed catches hold of Indy's feet, Indy kicks out, causing Halfbreed to lose his grip. Seizing the opportunity, Indy crawls away toward an opening at the opposite end of the car, but not before Halfbreed makes another attempt to grab his feet. Indy rolls aside, narrowly avoiding the grasp, revealing large bins teeming with writhing snakes beneath him. The combined weight of the three men moving on the catwalk exceeds its capacity, and the supporting bolts begin to tear free from their moorings. In a sudden, catastrophic failure, the bolts at Indy's end of the catwalk give way, causing him to drop forcefully with a splash into a vat of water where he comes face-to-face with an enormous anaconda, its head so massive that it resembles that of a Tyrannosaurus Rex. Just then, Roscoe makes his appearance atop the reptile car and reaches down to grab Indy. Indy, fighting desperately, kicks at Roscoe, who then struggles to maintain his grip on the side of the reptile car as Indy continues. Indy scrambles over canvas-covered circus equipment, with Roscoe in relentless pursuit, grabbing a long stick equipped with a hook to trip Indy, sending him sprawling onto the roof of the rhino boxcar below. As Indy hits the car with considerable force, a lamp dislodges from the ceiling, crashing down and striking a huge black rhinoceros inside."

Indy, drawing on years of horseback riding experience dating back to his childhood in Utah, stands up and successfully mounts his horse. Fedora and his men arrive at the roof's edge in time to see Indy climb into the saddle and gallop off. Fedora puts two fingers in his mouth and whistles, a technique often used by ranchers to call for assistance, and a vintage truck and automobile, relics from the 1930s bootlegging era, come roaring out from behind the Pueblo, a historic village known for its adobe structures built by Native American tribes. The passenger in the car has his face concealed by the hat's wide brim, but his arm is out the window, and we see an olive-colored hand protruding from the sleeve of an expensive white linen suit, a style popularized by 1920s film stars. Indy spurs his mount on to greater speeds, but the autos not only keep pace with his horse, a testament to their finely-tuned engines. Indy veers off in a new direction toward a railroad track. The train is barreling down the track, its steam whistle echoing across the plains. Indy rides up beside it and he leaps from horse to train with the agility of a seasoned daredevil. He clings to the side of a boxcar as Halfbreed and Rough Rider, notorious henchmen with a reputation for ruthlessness, leap from the truck onto the train. Halfbreed tries to grab Indy, but Indy leaps onto another boxcar. Halfbreed runs after him, but Indy leaps from the boxcar onto some covered boxes stacked on a flatcar. Indy loses his balance but regains it, demonstrating his survival instincts. With Halfbreed and Rough Rider still running after him, Indy enters the trap door, a relic of old freight car designs, and finds himself crawling on a catwalk suspended from the car's ceiling. Several feet below are numerous vats containing all manner of reptiles: alligators, crocodiles, giant lizards, etc., reminiscent of the exotic animal collections often transported for circus shows in the early 20th century. Then, Halfbreed enters through the trap door, followed by Rough Rider. Halfbreed grabs hold of Indy's feet, but Indy kicks at him and he loses his grasp. Indy crawls away toward an opening on the opposite side. Halfbreed grabs at Indy's feet again; Indy rolls away and we see large bins of squirming snakes, echoing his long-standing phobia of serpents. The combined weight of the three people is more than the catwalk was intended for, and the bolts begin to rip from their aged holdings. Several bolts tear free, but it's Indy's end of the catwalk that drops down. He lands hard, with a splash into a vat of water where he finds himself eye-to-eye with an enormous anaconda, reminiscent of the legendary giant snakes of the Amazon. The head of this snake is so damn big, it looks more like a prehistoric creature, a Tyrannosaurus Rex. Roscoe, known for his agile movements, appears atop the reptile car and manages to grab Indy. Indy kicks at him. Roscoe grabs onto the side of the reptile car as Indy moves on to. Indy climbs over canvas-covered circus equipment, likely bound for a traveling show. Roscoe follows, grabbing a long stick with a hook on it, commonly used by animal handlers. He reaches forward and trips Indy, who falls onto the roof of the rhino boxcar.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

They chase him, but Indy enters a trap door and crawls on a catwalk over vats of reptiles. Halfbreed follows and grabs Indy, but Indy kicks him off and moves toward another exit, encountering snakes below. The catwalk collapses under their weight, dropping Indy into a vat with a massive anaconda. Roscoe grabs Indy from above, but Indy kicks him away and climbs over circus equipment. Roscoe uses a hooked stick to trip Indy, causing him to fall onto the roof of the rhino boxcar, disturbing a huge black rhinoceros."
