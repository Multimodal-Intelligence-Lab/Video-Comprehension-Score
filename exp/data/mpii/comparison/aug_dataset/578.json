He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security.

Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

          "description": "Joe, feeling comfortable, approaches refreshments while the Board members are surprised by his presence and Parrish's decision to bring an 'observer'. Drew arranges Joe's refreshments, but the Board is perplexed by Joe, who doesn't initially react. Susan, distracted by her duties, notices Joe in the reception and is momentarily startled. Nearby, Easter, in pain, recognizes Joe, becoming calm as he regards her with concern, eventually comforting her. Susan is puzzled by Joe's behavior, while Parrish is lost in memories. Drew enters, appearing surprised, as Allison and Susan gather by a piano with Parrish, Quince, and Joe. Quince approaches Drew, and after an awkward pause, everyone anticipates Parrish's next move. As Parrish shows concern over Joe and Susan's relationship, tension lingers in the room."
