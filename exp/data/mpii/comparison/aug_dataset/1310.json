David twists around and looks back at the barbell counting up the black metal circles then turns back to Joseph. David looks back at the weights as Joseph starts back to the barbell. Joseph is breathing hard again as he finishes with the weights and comes around to David. David lays back takes hold of the bar lifts it off the armrest and brings it down. A set of two unopened MAB satin finish paint cans dangle by their metal handles on each side of the weights and the four cans sway a little as the bar is heaved off David's chest with his arms shaking hard. David sits up and turns back to the weights his mouth moving as he calculates the discs and the cans until his lips stop moving. It takes a second for David to register the question as Elijah just keeps staring his head nodding the slightest bit up and down as the physician's words fade away and Elijah continues to gaze at an abstract point in the room. Meanwhile a coworker finds Audrey working with an elderly gentleman who is laboring on a stationary bike and takes Audrey's position by the elderly man. as Audrey crosses the physical therapy center walking up to him with a smile. Elijah's leg is immobilized by a metal brace and held straight."

          "description": "Mark turns back to his uncle and grabs his foot, while Michael glances up at his brother who waits impatiently. Michael spins around and glances back at the bookshelf, calculating the dusty paper rectangles, then turns back to Mark. Michael glances back at the books as Mark strolls back to the bookshelf. Mark is panting softly again as he concludes with the books and meanders over to Michael. Michael reclines, grasps the shelf, pushes it off the armchair, and pushes it down. His legs are straining gently again as he shoves it and lowers it three times, which takes a considerable push, and the books clatter down onto the armchair. Michael stands up, rotates completely, and glances at the bookshelf, tallying the dusty tomes on the wooden shelf. He just gazes at the dusty wooden rectangles on the shelf as they both observe the literature. Mark wanders back to the top of the ladder leading down to the basement and waits. After taking another shallow breath, Michael grunts, the book THUDS as it descends from the armchair, and he is fully exerting himself now as he drops and pushes it. His legs shudder as he shoves it for the third time, glancing at his brother whose eyes are narrow, watching the large number of dusty tomes on the shelf. Michael's legs clutch the wood, and he mutters to Mark, who stands in position at the top of the ladder without listening to him. Michael takes a final breath, and THUD! the books fall from the ledge, with his legs trembling slightly. His expression is fixed in a smirk as he drops the shelf to his waist and pushes it back up twice before setting it onto the armchair. A series of two unopened KFC plastic buckets hang by their human handles on each side of the books, and the six buckets sway a little as the shelf is pulled from Michael's waist, with his legs quivering slightly. Michael stands up and turns back to the books, his eyes darting as he computes the tomes and the buckets until his eyes stop moving. It takes a minute for Michael to understand the thought as Oliver just keeps watching, his head bobbing the tiniest bit side to side, as the mechanic's sentences fade away and Oliver continues to watch an invisible point in the sky. Meanwhile, a supervisor eyes Monica reading with a young woman who's resting on a stationary bench and grabs Monica's spot by the young woman as Monica strolls across the counseling center, marching up to her with a wink. Oliver's arm is supported by a fabric sling and held firm."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

          "description": "Joseph helps his father, David, as he prepares to lift a heavily weighted barbell, carefully counting the black metal discs. With considerable effort, David lifts and lowers the bar, his arms straining and trembling under the load. Joseph watches intently, positioned at the base of the stairs. After a deep breath, David lifts again, his determination evident in his grimacing expression, and manages two repetitions before dropping the barbell back onto the armrest. Two unopened MAB paint cans sway as David heaves the weights, calculating the total load with Joseph. Meanwhile, Elijah, with a leg immobilized by a brace, gazes vacantly as his physician's words fade, while Audrey, a physical therapist, moves to assist him, smiling as she leaves an elderly man exercising on a stationary bike."
