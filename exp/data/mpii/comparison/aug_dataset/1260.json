          "description": "Two safety guys stand patiently by, ensuring everything is secure, as Carl gathers his courage and forcefully dives off, entering a thrilling free-fall that sends him hurtling hundreds of feet toward the river below. In a sudden jolt, the heavy-duty elastic bungee cord attached to him stretches to its limit and then rebounds, whipping Carl back up toward the sky. He, momentarily suspended, waves his arms to regain balance and control as he begins to swing back and forth beneath the massive, elegantly curved bridge supports overhead. Amid this exhilarating moment, Carl manages to reach into his pocket, pull out his phone, and perhaps capture or share this incredible experience. In a completely different setting, Wes is situated on a serene golf course, and, deciding to temporarily disconnect, he hands his phone over to a waiting caddy, entrusting it to their care. Meanwhile, at Norm's lively Sparta-themed party, Norm embraces the theme, draping himself in a striking red cape, and brandishing a shield and spear, embodying the fierce spirit of a Spartan warrior. Later, the mood shifts as Norm finds himself sitting with tears in his eyes, with Carl sitting close beside him. Carl looks at Norm with a mix of concern and empathy, resting his hand gently on Norm's shoulder in a comforting gesture. Norm, still maintaining his thematic attire, is wearing a false beard and mustache, both of which begin to slip out of place. Observing this, Carl quickly reaches over to readjust and secure the faux facial hair, his demeanor shifting to one of humility as he then directs his gaze downwards. Returning to his own home, Carl takes a moment to check his answering machine, listening for any messages he might have missed. Over at the Bigfoot Lodge, an imposing sign depicting an ominous figure standing amidst a dense forest creates an air of mystery, and Carl stands outside the entrance, deep in thought as he contemplates going inside. Just then, Peter and Lucy arrive and join Carl, who leads them through the entrance into the lively atmosphere within, where Carl and Peter soon find themselves caught up in the spirit of celebration, dancing energetically. Meanwhile, Janet extends a slice of cake to Lee, offering a small gesture of hospitality, as Faranoush glances back again, possibly intrigued by the interaction. Norm leans against the bar, his demeanor somber and distant, when Carl taps him lightly on his left shoulder, then quickly leans around to his right side, catching Norm off guard and making him bow in reaction. A moment later, Norm is seen dancing around, one hand resting on Soo-Mi's shoulder for support as they walk off together, while Lucy mingles with a group of her friends nearby. Carl, catching her eye, flashes a warm, friendly smile and waves in her direction. Lucy, acknowledging Carl, energetically points around the room, signaling something of interest, and offers Carl an enthusiastic thumbs-up, to which he responds with a fond smile, sharing a moment of mutual understanding and approval. Later, Carl sits alone at a table, absorbed in thought as he makes a phone call, reaching out to connect with someone at that moment. At an art exhibition where Allison is displaying her photographs, she flips open her phone, checks something quickly, and then closes it, as a nearby woman studies an image of Carl sprawled out on the ground. Allison maintains a tight smile, subtly masking her true feelings, while the woman raises her eyebrows, perhaps in surprise or amusement at the photo. Then, Peter sits down next to Carl, a pleasant smile gracing his face, offering camaraderie and silent support. Meanwhile, Rooney stands alone at the bar, lost in contemplation until Tillie approaches and greets him with a wide, friendly smile. Rooney, taken by surprise, regards her warily but accepts her presence, takes a moment to down a drink, swiftly knocks back a shot for courage, then motions for her to follow as he cautiously leads her out of the bar, glancing back to ensure all is well. Carl eventually arrives back home, where he is greeted with a kiss; he responds warmly, engaging in the kiss for a brief moment before abruptly pulling away, a flash of pain crossing his features, revealing an inner turmoil. Entering an elevator, Carl presses a button to begin his descent, the elevator doors closing with a mechanical hum. As the elevator travels downwards, the lights flicker ominously, catching Carl's attention as he instinctively glances upwards. Suddenly, the elevator shudders to a halt, its doors sliding open to reveal that it is stranded just shy of the intended floor level. With caution, Carl maneuvers his way out of the elevator, stepping up and walking along the hall with an air of vigilance. Crossing the forecourt, a black cat darts past him, a shadow slipping through the night. Startled, Carl stumbles against the bonnet of a car, where he witnesses, with growing dread, a surreal vision of a man hooking his car to a tow truck—the man, unmistakably, is a version of himself. Panicked and confused by this hallucination, Carl bolts from the scene, only to find himself later with Terrence, who drives swiftly away from a hotel. Carl, having somehow emerged in the back of the car, prompts Terrence to hit the gas, speeding them away from whatever unspoken threat looms behind."

Norm wears a false beard and mustache, which starts slipping comically, and Carl sticks it back in place before looking down humbly. At home, Carl checks his answer phone, an older model that still uses tapes. At the Bigfoot Lodge, a rustic bar known for its quirky décor, the sign shows an ominous figure in a forest, an homage to the legendary creature, and Carl stands outside the entrance looking pensive. Peter and Lucy walk up, and Carl leads them inside where he and Peter dance to a lively folk tune. Janet offers a piece of cake to Lee, a regular at the lodge, and Faranoush looks again, intrigued by the scene.

Allison smiles tightly, aware of the emotional memories, and the woman raises her eyebrows in curiosity. Peter sits next to Carl and smiles, trying to lift his spirits. Meanwhile, Rooney stands at the bar alone, contemplating life, and Tillie walks up and smiles at him broadly, while he looks at her warily and then has a drink, knocks back a shot of whiskey, and ushers her out of the bar, looking back cautiously as he goes. Carl arrives home, greeted by the comforting scent of a familiar meal, she kisses him, and he responds, kisses her for a moment, then pulls away sharply, looking pained by a troubling memory. Carl gets into an elevator, presses a button for his floor, the doors close, and as the elevator descends, the light flickers ominously. Carl looks up, the elevator stalls, an unnerving occurrence in the old building, and the doors open to reveal it's stuck below the level of the floor. Carl clambers out carefully, walks off along the hall looking around cautiously as though expecting something amiss, and as he walks across the forecourt of the apartment complex, a black cat runs past behind him, an occurrence often seen as bad luck.

          "description": "Two bakery mice waddle by as Jim hops on and hovers dozens of inches towards a canyon, then gets flung back up by the flimsy helium balloon. Flapping his wings, Jim drifts side to side beneath the tiny, flat roof beams and pulls out his wrench. Meanwhile, Dane is on a soccer field and tosses his wrench to a gardener. At Ralph's, there's a disco-themed concert where Ralph wears a blue jacket, waves a wand and trumpet, and later lies giggling with Jim beside him, looking thrilled with his foot on Ralph's elbow. Ralph wears a rubber hat and glasses, which starts tumbling, and Jim nudges it back in place before gazing up shyly. At work, Jim checks his calendar. At the Unicorn Barn, the poster displays a cheerful puppy in a meadow, and Jim sits inside the exit looking delighted. Molly and Ralph skip up, and Jim guides them outside where he and Molly juggle. Sam hands a slice of cheese to Joe, and Claudia blinks again. Ralph leans against the wall, looking ecstatic, and Jim pats him on his right elbow and sneaks round to his left, at which Ralph twirls. Ralph juggles around with his foot on Beth's elbow as they dash off, and Molly is with a band of colleagues. Jim catches her glance, grins, and claps. Molly gestures around the garden and gives Jim a small head nod, and they share a warm grin. Standing alone in a cabin, Jim writes a letter while Sophia is at a showcase of her paintings, unfolds and then folds her letter as a gentleman glances at a drawing of Jim sitting on a chair. Sophia frowns slightly, and the gentleman shrugs his shoulders. Molly sits near Jim and frowns. Meanwhile, Danny waits at the table alone, and Tessa approaches and frowns at him broadly, while he stares at her eagerly and then eats a snack, sips a soda, and guides her out of the table, staring forward blissfully as he stays. Jim leaves work, she embraces him, and he laughs, embraces her for a while, then steps back quickly, looking delighted. Jim climbs onto an escalator, presses a switch, the steps shift, and as the escalator ascends, the ceiling glows. Jim peers down, the escalator jerks, and the steps shift to reveal it's elevated above the level of the ceiling. Jim slides down, skips off along the park glancing around excitedly, and as he skips over the carousel, a white rabbit hops past beside him. Jim tiptoes onto a tree trunk and notices a bird connecting its nest to a kite, realizing the bird is himself. Jim skips from his daydream as Fiona pedals away from a store with Jim waving in the front of the bike, and Fiona hits the brakes."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

At the Bigfoot Lodge, Carl contemplates outside before joining Peter and Lucy inside, where he shares smiles with Lucy. Carl makes a call at a table as Allison, at her photo exhibit, acknowledges a photo of Carl. Rooney, at the bar, interacts cautiously with Tillie before leaving. Returning home, Carl kisses someone but withdraws abruptly, appearing distressed. In an elevator, Carl experiences a flicker and gets stuck, forcing him to climb out. As he walks through the hall, a cat dashes by, and he witnesses a vision of himself hooking his car to a tow truck, prompting him to flee. Terrence then drives away, with Carl unexpectedly appearing in his car."
