Valjean seizes Thenardier and thrusts him down into the muck, then rises and hoists Marius onto his shoulder. With the insensible Marius over his shoulder, Valjean trudges up through the knee-deep sewage as faint light sifts through grilles above, washing over the arched brickwork. The sewage becomes deeper, and Valjean is up to his neck, holding Marius up beside him. He thrusts a gate open and pulls Marius through an outflow conduit into the dark night, where he looks up and observes Javert standing there anticipating him. Covered in sewage, Valjean holds Marius onto his shoulder and ascends steps out of the drain while Javert points a revolver at him. Valjean turns to Javert, who holds the revolver steady, deliberates, then turns and strides away. Wearing a troubled scowl, Javert gazes at the revolver for a moment, then lets it fall into the drain and begins to stride away. Javert stands at the brink of a steep plunge into a gigantic swirling sluice, steps at the brink, then leans ahead and plunges into the chasm, getting swept away into the spiraling froth. Marius awakens in a pristine bed beneath a ceiling adorned with cherubs and angels, with a youngster's rocking horse near, and his grandfather sitting adjacent. Outside, women cleanse gore from the skirmish off the hardships. Marius sits solitary in a chamber, marred by skirmish, with his left limb in a sling, gazing into void pensively as tears cascade from his eyes. He rises and surveys, his brow arched, and his face contorted with torment. Cosette sits observing him, reaches out to him, and he hobbles over to her and takes her hand. Cosette walks with Valjean and the hobbling Marius into his grandfather's mansion as his grandfather observes. Cosette and Marius kiss, and Marius takes a seat in the austere chamber with Valjean, who wrestles for expressions, hangs his head, bows, and then Marius, his arm no longer in a sling but still walking with a hobble, takes his departure. Valjean carries a large case out to a waiting coach and grimaces in agony. Marius is with Cosette, and on the voyage, he reclines in the coach. On Cosette's nuptial day, Thenardier and his spouse hitch a ride on the rear of a coach arriving at the mansion, slink around to the far side, climb inside, and exit through the opposite portal as if they'd arrived in the coach. Dressed finely, they socialize with the guests, pilfering as they proceed."

While down there, amidst the murky shadows, he comes upon Marius' gleaming gold signet ring and, with a sly grin, slips it onto his own finger. At that moment, Valjean, with a surge of strength and urgency, grabs hold of Thenardier. With forcefulness, Valjean shoves him down into the thick sludge, rendering him temporarily incapacitated. Without wasting another precious second, Valjean rises to his feet and hefts the unconscious form of Marius up onto his broad shoulder.\n\nWith Marius draped over his shoulder, still unconscious and vulnerable, Valjean bravely trudges forward, wading through the knee-deep, foul-smelling sewerage. As he moves onward, a dim light, filtering softly through the overhead gratings, casts an ethereal glow over the ancient curved brickwork of the tunnels. The treacherous sewerage continues to rise, submerging Valjean's body until he is almost neck-deep in the putrid water, yet he persists, holding Marius securely next to him. With a determined shove, he forces open a heavy gate and drags Marius along with him through an outflow pipe, emerging into the cold darkness of the night. As he looks up, he is confronted by the imposing figure of Javert, who stands waiting with unwavering patience.\n\nCovered head to toe in the muck and filth of the sewerage, Valjean nonetheless holds Marius firmly on his shoulder and begins the arduous climb up a set of steps leading out of the dank sewer. All the while, Javert aims a gleaming pistol at Valjean, maintaining a steady grip on the weapon. When Valjean turns to face Javert, a moment of tense consideration passes, but Javert makes a decisive choice. He lowers the pistol, turns away, and begins to walk off with a troubled expression etched onto his face. His mind weighed down by inner conflict, Javert pauses to stare contemplatively at the pistol before letting it fall into the filthy waters of the sewer below. \n\nJavert then walks to the edge of a steep precipice, marking the beginning of a massive, swirling sluice. He paces with increasing agitation, his mind racing, before finally leaning forward and allowing himself to drop into the abyss below. He is swiftly washed away by the churning, foamy waters, disappearing from view. Meanwhile, Marius regains consciousness in an unfamiliar, yet peaceful, setting: a clean bed beneath a ceiling adorned with painted cherubs and angels. Nearby, a child's vintage rocking horse stands as a silent sentinel, and his grandfather sits quietly by his side.\n\nOutside the serene room, women tirelessly scrub the remnants of battle from the cobblestones, erasing the visible traces of conflict.

Suddenly, Valjean grips Thenardier with purpose and forcefully shoves him downward into the foul sludge, ensuring he is momentarily submerged before releasing him. With determination, Valjean bends down, grips Marius with a firm hold, and hefts his unconscious form onto his shoulder. As he steadies himself under Marius' weight, Valjean begins the arduous task of wading through the knee-high sewerage, his feet feeling for stability amongst the slippery floor. Occasionally, dim beams of light filter through the gratings above, casting distorted patterns on the curved, dank brickwork, guiding Valjean's way as the level of sewerage gradually rises, eventually reaching up to his neck. In an effort to keep Marius safe, Valjean holds him aloft, the water lapping at his chin. Reaching a heavy gate, Valjean shoves it open with a shoulder and drags Marius through an outflow pipe, emerging into the stark darkness of night. He looks upwards, only to find Javert standing rigid with expectation, waiting for him. Unperturbed, Valjean, still covered head-to-toe in sewerage, hefts Marius onto his shoulder and begins the climb up the slippery steps leading out of the sewer as Javert silently aims a pistol at him. Valjean pauses, turns his gaze towards Javert, who meets his eyes with a steady grip on the pistol, then, after a moment of consideration, pivots on his heel and strides away into darkness. Lost in thought and wearing a troubled frown, Javert examines the pistol in his hand, a symbol of his relentless pursuit, before allowing it to slip from his grasp, clattering into the sewer below. Slowly, Javert walks away and finds himself standing at the precipice of a steep drop into a vast, swirling sluice. For a moment, he paces thoughtfully at the edge, then, with resolute intention, leans forward until gravity claims him, and he plunges into the churning foam. Meanwhile, Marius regains consciousness in a pristine bed draped beneath a ceiling adorned with cherubs and angels, a child's rocking horse stationed nearby for comfort, and his grandfather seated beside him in silent vigil. Outside, women meticulously scrub the remnants of battle from the cobblestones, trying to erase the physical evidence of conflict. Now alone in a sparsely furnished room, Marius, bearing the scars of battle, cradles his left arm in a sling while his eyes are lost in the void, tears silently tracing paths down his cheeks. Rising with a determined air, he scans the room, his forehead etched with pain and reflection, his heart heavy with the burden of his experiences. Cosette, seated nearby and watching him with concern, reaches out a comforting hand, prompting Marius to limp towards her, accepting her hand gratefully. Together, Cosette and Valjean guide the limping Marius into his grandfather's mansion, where his grandfather observes their approach with a mixture of relief and hope. As Marius and Cosette share a tender kiss, Marius settles hesitantly into a spartan room alongside Valjean, who struggles for words, his expression troubled as he bows his head in silence. Marius, with his arm now free of its sling but a noticeable limp still present in his gait, respectfully takes his leave. Valjean, bearing the weight of a large trunk, carries it out to a waiting carriage, wincing slightly with each step, an unsaid struggle visible in his grimace. As Marius and Cosette travel together, Marius leans back thoughtfully within the carriage, absorbing the serenity of the moment. On the day of Cosette's wedding, Thenardier and his wife seize the opportunity to hitch a ride on the back of a carriage approaching the grand mansion. Sneaking around to the far side, they stealthily climb inside and emerge through the opposite door, masquerading as legitimate guests arriving in the carriage. Dressed in their finest, they mingle smoothly with the crowd, their eyes sweeping the room for unsuspecting targets, deftly pilfering valuables amidst the celebrations, their opportunistic nature undeterred by the occasion."

He shoves a rusted gate open and drags Marius through an outflow pipe into the dark night, where he looks up and sees Javert, the relentless inspector dedicated to enforcing the law, standing there waiting for him. Covered in sewerage, Valjean holds Marius onto his shoulder and climbs up steps out of the ancient sewer while Javert aims a pistol at him. Valjean turns to Javert, who holds the pistol steady, considers his options, then turns and walks away in silent turmoil. Wearing a troubled frown that reflects his internal conflict, Javert stares at the pistol for a moment, then drops it into the sewer, letting go of his long-held pursuit, and starts to walk away. Javert stands at the edge of a steep drop into a massive swirling sluice, part of Paris's complex water system, paces at the edge, then leans forward and drops into the abyss, getting washed away into the swirling foam, overcome by his inability to reconcile his moral code. Marius wakes in a clean bed beneath a ceiling painted with cherubs and angels, highlighting the opulence of his grandfather's home, with a child's rocking horse nearby, and his grandfather, a staunch royalist, sitting beside him. Outside, women clean blood from the battle off the cobbled streets, remnants of a recent uprising. Marius sits alone in a room, scarred by battle, with his left arm in a sling, staring into space thoughtfully as tears fall from his eyes. He stands and looks around, his brow arched, and his face wracked with anguish. Cosette, Valjean's adopted daughter whom Marius loves deeply, sits watching him, reaches out to him, and he limps over to her and takes her hand. Cosette walks with Valjean and the limping Marius into his grandfather's mansion as his grandfather watches, reconciled to their relationship. Cosette and Marius kiss, sealing their love, and Marius takes a seat in the spartan room with Valjean, who struggles for words, hangs his head, bows, and then Marius, his arm no longer in a sling but still walking with a limp, takes his leave. Valjean carries a large trunk out to a waiting carriage and grimaces in pain, burdened by the weight of his past. Marius is with Cosette, and on the journey, he leans back in the carriage, contemplating his future and the life they will build together.

The sawdust grows thicker, and Reginald is up to his chin, balancing Penelope beside him. He kicks a door open and tugs Penelope through a narrow corridor into the bright day, where he glances up and spots Hector standing there waiting for him. Coated in sawdust, Reginald lifts Penelope onto his back and stumbles down stairs out of the attic while Hector points a crossbow at him. Reginald faces Hector, who steadies the crossbow, hesitates, then spins and marches away. Wearing an uneasy grin, Hector stares at the crossbow for an instant, then tosses it into the attic and begins to stride away. Hector stands at the brink of a narrow ravine into a vast roaring waterfall, paces at the brink, then bends forward and plunges into the chasm, getting swept away into the roaring spray.

She rises and scans around, her cheek lifted, and her expression crumpled with joy. Esmeralda lounges watching her, reaches out to her, and she totters over to Esmeralda and grasps her wrist. Esmeralda ambles with Reginald and the tottering Penelope into her uncle's cabin as her uncle listens. Esmeralda and Penelope embrace, and Penelope drapes herself in the austere nook with Reginald, who fumbles for phrases, lifts his chin, nods, and then Penelope, her leg no longer in a brace but still staggering with a tilt, bids farewell. Reginald drags a small cart out to a ready wagon and winces with effort. Penelope is with Esmeralda, and on the voyage, she tilts forward in the wagon.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
