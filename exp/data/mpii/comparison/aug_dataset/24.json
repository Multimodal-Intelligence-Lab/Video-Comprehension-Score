          "description": "Appalled with delight, the parrot stares at its trainer, who claps approval for it to flap away, prompting a final triumphant chirp from the parrot before it is delighted. The parrot sings softly, regaining composure and holding itself on the verge of chirping. Perched and chirped out, the parrot squawks one last, flamboyant shrill cry, prompting an echo before it returns the feather thoughtfully. It holds the feather and flies back to the feeding area, amused, bewildered, and frolicked upon, and drops the feather. After the parrot vanishes, the gardener peers down, alert, as his mind sends a humorous signal. The parrot enters the clearing, then retreats, as the baker gets ready to arrive and rolls ahead, satisfied, lounging. The baker shifts and exits as it presents him with the feather, and the parrot sees the gardener’s expression, pausing to gaze at him for a very peculiar, prolonged echo before fetching an ancient travel trunk from the bottom drawer of the cupboard. It peeks in another compartment, pausing as if solving one of the enigmas of the cosmos, murmurs to itself, and closes it. Meanwhile, the gardener is in his kitchen with everything neatly organized on the shelf, ready to be sorted, including a telescope. He inspects each pile of napkins, hats, etc., seven times and adds another tally, as the doorbell dings. The gardener whispers a tiny quip to himself as he paces, delighted by the chime as he has almost no recent practice with handling daytime visitors. As it answers the door, the gardener visibly tenses. The baker tries to enter, but the sculptor halts him, and they dance. As the baker strides off, the gardener notices the parrot and his attitude shifts. The parrot places its branch in the basket, and away they fly, with the sculptor and the parrot startled by the sky as they float onto Sixth. The telescope records the gardener going to a cabinet of oddly tagged postcards, while the parrot sings softly. The sculptor and the parrot have thus broadcast their success, and the parrot, whose journey has been bumpy yet adventurous, feels both peculiar and touched by the sculptor's intricate melody, which contrasts with its own simple seeds. It gazes out the window, flutters its wing, and grazes it on the sculptor’s wing in a gentle, understated token of harmony, visibly amusing the gardener. The parrot flits to the sculptor, places a wing on him, pecks him gently, and then faces the gardener before fluttering out the burrow, leaving the gardener euphoric. Ultimately, the parrot, wrapped in a flea market treasure, flits into the grand hall of the studio, hears the fan humming, and perches to rest."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

She asks a final question, receives a note back, and leaves, feeling embarrassed and confused. Melvin, disturbed, notices Carol's reaction to his mood. Carol retrieves an old suitcase and hesitates, pondering deeply before moving on. Meanwhile, Melvin prepares his packed belongings and reacts to a surprising nighttime call. Frank is about to leave, but Simon embraces him, prompting a change in Melvin's demeanor as he sees Carol. They drive off, with Simon and Carol stunned by the manners they encounter. Carol, moved by Simon's trauma compared to her own simpler struggles, shows a tender gesture of friendship, unsettling Melvin. After a warm moment with Simon, Carol turns to Melvin, leaving him unnerved. Finally, dressed in thrift shop attire, Carol enters the suite's main room, hears the shower, and waits."
