Among the unenergetic, exhausted assembly, Don maneuvers with intention and has canvas slippers on his feet. Around him, roughly thirty alcoholics are seated and meandering without purpose. The area is L-shaped and approximately fourteen feet broad. Don maneuvers around the curve of the ell towards a substantial wooden door with a grated spyhole beside which stands a uniformed sentinel. He attempts to open the door, but at that juncture, another male nurse opens it, bearing a stack of fresh sheets and pillowcases. Don endeavors to exploit the open door to flee, but the sentinel tugs him back by the arm, while the incoming nurse secures the door with his key. Don rotates, and at the curve of the hallway, he spots Bim holding a glass of medicine. Don slowly advances towards Bim, who eventually places him on his bed. It is illuminated by a faint blue glow, with light from the anteroom filtering through the glass doors. On his cot, Don reclines with his eyes wide open. He swivels towards a noise and perceives a man in the corner with a delicate visage and a fixation on beetles. The man is smacking wildly at his bed, groaning, then rises to strike the wall and shriek. Don observes through the dimness as two male nurses with flashlights dash to the DT sufferer's cot, leading to a frenzied skirmish as the patient defends himself. One nurse sprints back to the door to summon reinforcements. A third nurse arrives, flings a straitjacket to the first nurse, and hastens to another bed. Seen through the glass doors, a physician sprints down the anteroom, followed by another male nurse with a cart bearing hypodermic syringes. The physician enters the ward and proceeds towards the beetle patient, discarding his dark blue overcoat onto the vacant cot adjacent to Don as he hurries. Don gazes after the physician, who, along with the nurses, attends to the beetle patient, administering a hypo and securing him in a straitjacket. As the physician's eyes reach Don's pajama pants and canvas slippers, the tableau captures the frenetic and intense atmosphere in the ward."

Though most seem listless and burned-out, Don stands out, moving with a sense of purpose, his own canvas slippers padding softly on the floor. Surrounded by about thirty alcoholics who sit or mill about without aim, Don navigates the L-shaped room that spans about fourteen feet in width. He maneuvers around the bend of the ell-shaped space, his steps deliberate as he approaches a heavy wooden door equipped with a grated peephole, adjacent to which a uniformed guard stands vigilant. As Don reaches out to open the door, timing his movements precisely, another male nurse pushes the door open from the other side, his arms burdened with a pile of clean sheets and pillowcases. Sensing an opportunity for escape, Don swiftly moves to step through the opening, but the guard quickly intervenes, his grip firm as he pulls Don back by the arm, thwarting the escape attempt. The door is securely locked again by the entering nurse, using his key with practiced efficiency. Turning away from the door, Don's gaze travels to the bend of the corridor where he catches sight of Bim, who stands holding a tumbler filled with medicine. With measured steps, Don slowly approaches Bim, who gently guides him to his bed and seats him there. The bed is dimly illuminated by a faint blue light, complemented by the light that filters through the glass doors from the anteroom. Don lies on his cot, his eyes wide open, absorbing the muted surroundings. Suddenly, a sound captures his attention, causing him to pivot and observe a man situated in the corner, a man with a sensitive face and an unusual addiction to beetles. The man slaps frantically at his bed, a moan escaping him before he rises to slap the wall and scream in distress. Through the dim light, Don watches with a mix of intrigue and helplessness as two male nurses, armed with flashlights, rush to the cot of the man in distress, attempting to subdue him as he struggles wildly against them. In the midst of the commotion, one nurse dashes back to the door, calling out urgently for additional help. A third nurse swiftly enters the scene, tossing a straitjacket to the first nurse before hurrying off to attend to another bed. The glass doors offer a view of unfolding action in the anteroom, where a doctor is seen sprinting down the corridor, another male nurse at his heels, pushing a cart laden with hypodermic syringes. The doctor bursts into the ward, making a beeline for the beetle-obsessed patient, his urgency palpable as he sheds his dark blue overcoat, letting it fall onto the empty cot next to Don's as he rushes to intervene. Don's attention follows the doctor who, along with the assisting nurses, works swiftly to administer a hypo and secure the frenzied patient into a straitjacket, the scene a whirlwind of medical precision and necessity. As the doctorâ€™s gaze finally lands on Donâ€™s pajama trousers and canvas slippers, the full weight of the chaotic and tense environment within the ward becomes starkly evident, capturing the strained atmosphere and the human drama that unfolds within its walls."

Around him, about thirty alcoholics, individuals struggling with addiction and often facing societal stigma, are sitting and milling aimlessly. The space is L-shaped and about fourteen feet wide, a common design in institutional settings to maximize available room. Don moves around the bend of the ell towards a heavy wooden door with a grated peephole, reminiscent of controlled access points in secured environments, beside which stands a uniformed guard, ensuring safety and order. He tries to open the door, but at that moment, another male nurse opens it, carrying a pile of clean sheets and pillowcases, indicative of the routine and hygiene maintained in such facilities. Don attempts to take advantage of the open door to escape, but the guard pulls him back by the arm, demonstrating strict security measures, while the entering nurse locks the door with his key, ensuring no unauthorized exit. Don turns, and at the bend of the corridor, he sees Bim holding a tumbler of medicine, likely a prescribed sedative or medication to manage withdrawal symptoms. Don slowly approaches Bim, who eventually seats him on his bed, a metal-framed cot characteristic of institutional furniture.

He pivots towards a sound and observes a man in the corner with a sensitive face, displaying anguish from withdrawal, and an addiction to beetles, which reflects a delusional obsession. The man is slapping wildly at his bed, moaning, then rises to slap the wall and scream, a scene of distress known in delirium tremens cases.

One nurse races back to the door, illustrating the urgency for reinforcements, to call for assistance. A third nurse arrives, throws a straitjacket, a means of restraint for safety, to the first nurse, and hurries to another bed. Seen through the glass doors, a doctor runs down the anteroom, an area for waiting or transition, followed by another male nurse with a cart carrying hypodermic syringes, prepped for administering medication quickly.

Within the cheerful, energized crowd, Ellen drifts with wonder and has rubber boots on her flippers. Around her, about thirty bakers are dancing and singing aimlessly. The field is T-shaped and about fourteen yards long. Ellen drifts around the curve of the lane towards a heavy stone archway with a barred porthole below which sits a striped tiger. She tries to lift the archway, but at that instant, another ostrich swoops it open, balancing a mountain of crisp waffles and teacups. Ellen attempts to take advantage of the swooped archway to flee, but the tiger pushes her forward by the wing, while the swooping ostrich bolts the archway with a chainsaw. Ellen turns, and at the curve of the meadow, she spots Sam clutching a goblet of perfume. Ellen quickly ambles towards Sam, who ultimately lays her on his hammock. It is illuminated by a glowing red bulb, with shine from the greenhouse streaming through the silk curtains. On her mattress, Ellen stretches with her eyes tightly closed. She tumbles towards a smell and detects a ladybug in the nook with a grumpy grin and an obsession with marbles. The ladybug is whispering softly at her nest, humming, then leaps to hug the shelf and giggle. Ellen peers through the shadows as two ostriches with whistles sprint to the marble enthusiastâ€™s nest, leading to a mild handshake as the bug greets them warmly. One ostrich flies back to the archway to serenade for entertainment. A fourth ostrich appears, tosses a hammock to the original ostrich, and rushes to another nest. Glimpsed through the silk curtains, a chef skips across the greenhouse, trailed by another ostrich with a raft laden with chocolate pancakes. The chef bursts into the meadow and skips towards the marble ladybug, flinging her rainbow scarf onto the available nest beside Ellen as she dances. Ellen gazes after the chef, who, along with the ostriches, grooves around the marble enthusiast, juggling a pancake and wrapping her in a hammock. As the chef's gaze lands on Ellen's raincoat buttons and rubber boots, the sequence captures the lively and vibrant atmosphere in the field."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby cafÃ©, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
