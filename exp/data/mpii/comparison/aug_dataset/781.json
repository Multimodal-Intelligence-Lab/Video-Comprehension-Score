          "description": "Beneath, there's a sketch of a duo waving. Each fortnight involves birthdays. She opens the jar and gazes upward. At his cottage, Mark is chasing the morning's shirts into a drawer overflowing with a monochrome array of formal jackets. He wedges in each final sliver of compliant textile and pulls forward on the drawers, latching them shut. The drawers burst open again. He snatches the scrolls and reclines on the bench. Its shimmer creates a pale outline of the sprawling rural hillside and shades the hills surrounding Hyde Park as dusk arrives. Laura, carrying pastries, departs from the galleries of the London Gazette. Crossing a bridge, Mark meets Alex crawling out of a tram. Alex boldly wears a woman's red blouse. They rush into their gallery entrance. Mark smiles and heads for his pristine counter. She shows him the calendar. He stares at her. Mark is with Alex examining sketch arrangements. As Toby rushes in, Mark looks relieved. Alex makes a gesture. Mark looks thrilled as elegantly plain Sam skips in. Alex jumps in, leaving Mark organizing some polite paperclips. Alex flashes Toby a real grin. Alex stomps away. A cargo ship docks, and at the harbor, Mark frowns as serious brunette Claire departs. The brothers stop at Mark's cottage. Mark grapples with the parcels. In the morning, in one of hundreds of trams, Laura studies Mark's calendar. Mark and Alex are at Toby's gathering in a serene, brightly-lit lounge. Sam strolls awkwardly over to them. Mark slides cautiously over to where Sam is sipping wine and arguing with strangers. Claire, in a vibrant suit, approaches from the opposite direction. Sam notices her and frowns, then spots Mark. As Mark nears, his smile widens, realizing that Sam and Claire are moving toward one another. They cheer as Mark grimaces. Mark fakes a grimace as Sam avoids his gaze. As Claire and Sam sit, Laura runs in. He looks amused. He tosses her his snack, then turns and strides out of the lounge through a secret door. Laura looks amused as he jumps a fence with his backpack. He's in full view of a chaotic charity auction. Attempting to lose his awkwardness, he rejoins Laura in the lounge, who's staring, eyes closed. He peers before Claire and Sam. Earlier, a bus rolls past Mark's house. He ambles to the side window, squints through the blinds, then yanks it shut. He marches away. Mark flips on the fan in the den, it's crowded and he drifts eagerly forward and back, then picks up a booklet from the bench, rests on a stool, flips through it curiously. He glances towards the side window."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Jane struggles with her overflowing closet of party dresses and settles on the couch as the city skyline glows at sunset. Kevin arrives at the New York Journal, while Jane meets Casey, wearing a man's shirt, outside a cab. In their office, Jane and Casey review photo layouts, encountering exasperation and false smiles. A plane lands, bringing Jane's sister Tess to town. They head to Jane's apartment, where she struggles with Tess's luggage. That night, at Gina's party, Jane approaches George, who is interested in Tess. Jane's disappointment is visible as Tess and George head towards each other. Jane fakes a smile and hands her drink to Kevin before exiting the club in frustration. She composes herself and returns to find Kevin waiting. Later, Jane anxiously checks her front door as a car passes her building, then wanders her living room, distractedly flipping through a magazine and glancing towards the door."
