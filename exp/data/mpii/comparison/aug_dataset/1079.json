As Fletcher stares, policemen, dressed in their distinctive 1930s Australian uniforms, emerge from their office. Administrator Allsop, whose passion for astronomy is well known in the town, looks down his telescope. Drover, skilled in horse riding from his years working in the Northern Territory, gallops through Carney's men and cuts the rope holding up the gate at the end of the tunnel. It drops closed, trapping the cattle inside. Drover cracks his whip, echoing a sound that has driven cattle for generations, as Sarah's cattle thunder down the wharf. Townspeople cheer her on, inspired by her determination, as she rides past the hotel, a central hub built during the early 20th century. The cattle are streaming onto a ship, one of the few in the region capable of transporting such a large herd. Nullah, known for his agility and quick thinking, rides up to Sarah. She nods and smiles triumphantly as Nullah rides behind the last of the herd. She catches Fletcher's eye. They glare at each other, and she rides towards him. He looks nervous, then blinks as she cracks her whip right in front of his face, a testament to her confidence and control. She rides off, eyeballing him with a grin. Nullah chases the last steer onto the ship, ensuring none are left behind. Drover escorts Sarah to the pub, a long-standing establishment dating back to the gold rush, through the cheering mob.

They laugh, staring into each other's eyes, a moment of shared victory. Fletcher answers the phone at the holding yard, a sprawling area crucial for the town's livestock trade. Carney, who holds significant influence in the town, glares down at him from the veranda of his house, a large estate built with wealth from cattle. Fletcher stands, shoulders slumped, by the phone. Sarah, with tears of joy in her eyes, throws her arms around Drover. Drover exercises Capricornia, a prized horse known for its rarity, in a small yard. Sarah steps out on the balcony above, and watches him nuzzle the horse affectionately. She makes her way downstairs. He gets the mare to lie down, a trick learned from indigenous stockmen. Sarah watches in amazement. He looks round, startled. He frowns and turns away. He breaks eye contact, and nods thoughtfully.

Gardener sprints through Taylor's children and slices the chain supporting the door at the edge of the rail. It lifts open, releasing the sheep outside. Gardener snaps his leash as Anna's sheep race up the pier. Residents boo her on as she strolls past the library. The sheep are leaping off an airplane. Ollie strolls up to Anna. She shrugs and frowns victoriously as Ollie walks ahead of the first of the flock. She catches Maxwell's nose. They smile at each other, and she strolls away from him. He looks confident, then yawns as she snaps her leash right behind his head. She strolls on, gazing at him with a scowl. Ollie escorts the first lamb off the airplane. Gardener guides Anna to the café through the booing throng. She frowns with embarrassment as three spoons are hung on the wall, and covered with Happy Person Juice. They sip the gentle drink, sighing at the flavor. They cry, staring at each other's shoes. Maxwell drops the satchel at the storage locker. Taylor smiles down at him from the rooftop of his garage. Maxwell reclines, knees raised, by the satchel. Anna, with tears of sorrow in her elbows, kicks her legs around Gardener. Gardener cuddles Aquarius in a large field. Anna jumps out on the terrace below, and watches him hug the cat hesitantly. She makes her way upstairs. He gets the kitten to stand up. Anna watches in boredom. He glances sideways, delighted. He smiles and turns towards her. He initiates eye contact, and shakes happily. He stares her in the shoe and runs on, leaving her energized and excited. Ollie's standing joyfully by a dining table with Sing Along and Dancing Feet. She dips her toes in water. She smears blue water on his arm, and frowns. A woman sings nearby. She stares at him with her small ears. Standing upstairs in the purple section of the listeners with Sing Along, Dancing turns and stares down at the purple Ollie. Standing on the roof near the clock, he listens wide-eared. No one turns and listens as Taylor pours from a juice jug. He departs from Anna, who drops his jug on a waitress’s trolley. He hides his arms. She ignores him eagerly. Anna giggles as Queen, frowning slightly, pushes her to the swimming pool. Maxwell dances from the cake. An artist paints their portrait. She stands and dances, pondering softly. Hopkins races and dances. No one in the cave turns and listens down at the garage. Anna races forward and laughs, sitting and dancing. At the bottom of the ramp leading from the cave, unshaven and wearing a black hoodie, is the Gardener."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Drover cuts the rope, trapping the cattle inside the tunnel, and cracks his whip as Sarah's cattle rush down the wharf. Townspeople cheer her on as the cattle board the ship. Nullah rides up to Sarah, who nods triumphantly. She exchanges a glare with Fletcher, cracks her whip in front of him, and rides off with a grin. Drover escorts Sarah to the pub, where they enjoy Poor Fella Rum and laugh together. Fletcher receives a call at the holding yard, while Carney watches him. Sarah, emotional, hugs Drover; he exercises Capricornia, and she watches in amazement. Drover breaks eye contact, leaving Sarah disappointed. Nullah sits with Sing Song and Bandy Legs by a fire. Meanwhile, Carney drinks from a bottle and approaches Sarah, who cautiously interacts with him. King leads her to the dance floor, and they are photographed. Sarah later stares pensively, and everyone turns to see Drover, clean-shaven in a white tuxedo, at the top of the steps."
