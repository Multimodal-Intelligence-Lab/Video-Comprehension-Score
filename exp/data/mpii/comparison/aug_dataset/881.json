As they settle down, they sit comfortably on soft cushions positioned in front of a warm, roaring fire, nestled under a sheet that is creatively stretched out to resemble a safari tent. The three of them begin to share slices of pizza, the ambiance filled with camaraderie. With a playful spirit, Zoe pretends to be an elephant, waving her arms and making tromping noises, eliciting laughter from the group. The three then engage in a whimsical game of pick-up sticks, using bread sticks as their playing pieces.

When Zoe succumbs to sleep on a cushion, Nick tenderly crawls around to her, carefully lifting her from the floor. As he carries her out, his shadow elongates across the side of the makeshift sheet tent. In parallel, Kate retrieves a small tray carrying two espresso cups. She pauses in the hallway, casting a watchful eye down the corridor, observing Nick as he gently carries Zoe to her bedroom and places her into bed. She then turns back, her gaze momentarily distant as she stares ahead in thoughtful reflection. Later, as the two of them tidy up, Nick opens the fridge and extracts the Tupperware box that holds the tiramisu, previously discovered by Kate in his bag. They position themselves on the lounge floor, the tiramisu between them, as Kate's face lights up with delight upon tasting a spoonful. The room is bathed in the soft glow of candlelight and the flickering firelight, casting a romantic atmosphere. Nick shifts closer to Kate, reaching out to gently wipe a spot of cream from the right side of her mouth, and casually licks the cream from his finger while gazing at her intently. Kate turns her face towards Nick, meeting his gaze momentarily before looking away with a brief nod. Nick then reaches behind her, moving closer with their lips nearly touching, prompting Kate to lean back against his supportive arm. She shifts awkwardly as Nick rises, wrapping his scarf around his neck and picking up his jacket draped over the back of the sofa. He strides into the darkened kitchen to retrieve his pants. As he does so, Kate watches him leave, smiling serenely to herself. When Nick later finds himself at the therapist's office, he spins around in the leather chair, while Kate sits across from him, furrowing her brow in contemplation.

The situation grows tense as Zoe narrowly avoids a collision with a speeding Yellow Cab while crossing a busy road, leaving Kate to dodge the traffic frantically in pursuit. However, Kate eventually steps back, watching with a sense of helplessness as Zoe continues to run off. As the scene shifts, Zoe sits on her bed, gazing at a photo album. As she flips through the pages, she stumbles upon a peacock feather, reminiscent of one she played with shortly before the car crash. The discovery evokes a deep sigh as her eyes well up with tears. Meanwhile, Kate descends to Sean's apartment, where she and Nick find solace in each other's company within the dim and silent kitchen. They share a plate of food and drink red wine across the serving counter, their conversation light and filled with happiness. Ultimately, in a final scene set amidst pouring rain, Nick hastily exits his truck, dashing up to the entrance of Kate's apartment building."

Sitting on cushions in front of a roaring fire reminiscent of a cozy winter retreat, under a sheet stretched out like a safari tent that evokes distant adventures, the trio share the pizza baked by a renowned local pizzeria. Zoe pretends to be an elephant, inspired by her recent visit to the city zoo, and the three then play pick-up sticks with bread sticks, a game known for honing fine motor skills. By the light of several candles, Zoe acts out a charade as wax drips down tall candlesticks, heirlooms from Kate's grandmother, beside a half-empty cafetiere of coffee made from locally roasted beans. Zoe fast asleep on a cushion, Nick crawls round to her and lifts her from the floor. His shadow casts on the side of the sheet tent as he carries her out, while Kate takes out a small tray with two espresso cups on it, handcrafted in a nearby pottery studio. She pauses to look down the hallway and watch Nick gently carry Zoe to her bedroom, decorated with fairy lights and colorful posters, before turning back and staring ahead thoughtfully. Later, the pair are tidying up when Nick opens the fridge and takes out the Tupperware box Kate found in his bag, which contained ingredients from a famous delicatessen. They sit on the lounge floor with a tiramisu between them; Kate's face brightens as she tastes a spoonful of the dessert, a recipe passed down from an Italian ancestor. The candles and firelight illuminate the room, casting flickering shadows, as Nick moves across to sit beside Kate, reaching out to wipe a spot of cream from the right side of her mouth, and licks the cream from his finger, gazing intently at her. Kate's face is turned towards Nick, but she looks away briefly and nods, thinking about the conversation they'd had earlier. He reaches behind Kate and moves nearer, lips almost touching, she leans back against his arm, feeling the warmth of the moment. Kate shifts awkwardly as Nick puts on his scarf knitted by his mother and stands, picks up his jacket from the back of the sofa, and puts it on as he enters the darkened kitchen to retrieve his pants, left there in haste earlier. Kate smiles serenely to herself, savoring the evening's connection. At the therapist, he spins around in his leather chair, a habit signaling the start of deep discussion, and Kate furrows her brow, pondering his probing questions. Kate joins the headmistress in her spacious office, which boasts a large window overlooking the school gardens, then leaves with a decision weighing heavily on her mind. In the park, Zoe is walking on the benches, then runs off, her laughter echoing through the trees, leading Kate to chase after her. Zoe narrowly avoids being hit by a Yellow Cab, the iconic symbol of the bustling city, as she runs across a busy road, and Kate dodges the traffic to follow her, adrenaline surging, but ultimately steps back and watches helplessly as Zoe runs off, her mind racing with worry. Later, Zoe is on her bed looking at the photo album, and as she flicks through it, she finds a peacock feather like the one she was playing with shortly before the car crash, a poignant reminder of a happier time, and sighs, her eyes welling with tears. Kate goes down to Sean's apartment where, in the dark and deserted kitchen once lively with gatherings, she and Nick share a plate of food prepared from leftovers and drink red wine across the serving counter, talking happily together about shared memories and future dreams. Finally, in the pouring rain, Nick dashes out of his truck parked hastily outside Kate's apartment building, eager to see her once more, the storm mirroring the turmoil in his heart."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
