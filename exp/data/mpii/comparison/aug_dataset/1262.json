Hovering Dementors, with trailing, tattered black robes, encircle Hogwarts as Severus Snape, in a black tunic and gown, stands in an upper archway gazing out at the mountains shrouded in mist. Subdued students in regimented ranks stride across the courtyard, and Snape watches them with a somber expression.

He hands a curved wand to Ollivander, who examines it closely as Harry passes him a plain, straight wand. Ollivander raises the wand tip to his left ear, turns it in his fingers, and gives the wand back to Harry.

Dark Lord Voldemort bends down into the mausoleum, stares at the black Elder Wand in his grasp, and thrusts up his arm, causing a vast force of energy to burst from the tip of the wand, illuminating the shadowy sky. Floating Dementors, with trailing, tattered black garments, surround Hogwarts as Severus Snape, in a black tunic and robe, stands in an upper archway staring out at the mountains covered in mist. Subdued pupils in regimented rows stride across the courtyard, and Snape observes them with a grave expression. The inscription on the headstone reads while Harry Potter kneels at the foot of the grave, peering into a piece of shattered mirror, where he sees himself reflected, then a visage other than his own. The grave stands among sand dunes behind a small house, and Shell cottage faces a white shore with an ocean beyond. Inside, Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley sit in the parlor of the cottage, which is the home of Ron's sibling, Bill, and sister-in-law Fleur. Luna Lovegood strolls up to a set of hanging chimes while Bill is in the kitchen, glancing at Fleur as Luna gazes at the chimes. Harry strides in and faces Bill as Griphook, who has pointed ears and a long beaky nose, sits in an armchair with his hands clasped together and eyes closed. Bill shows Harry, Hermione, and Ron into the goblin's chamber, where Griphook, hands still clasped, gazes forward with his mouth firmly closed. Harry crosses to the window and looks out as the goblin grips the arms of the chair, his long filthy pointed nails visible before he clasps his hands again, staring at Harry. Harry looks at the sword of Gryffindor leaning against the wall while Griphook reclines in his chair, takes a deep breath, and again clasps his hands together as his eyes flick to the sword. He points at it, and Harry looks back at the sword. Downstairs in the kitchen, as Hermione, Ron, and Harry exit the goblin's chamber, they pause on the landing, and Fleur shows them into a room where the elderly wand maker sits by a window, looking up at Harry. He hands a curved wand to Ollivander, who examines it closely as Harry passes him a plain, straight wand. Ollivander raises the wand tip to his left ear, turns it in his fingers, and gives the wand back to Harry.

On the distant far side of the lake, a pristine white marble tomb rests on a tiny, secluded island. This tomb features a large, imposing marble block that slides back smoothly as two supports beneath it collapse and tumble away. The ominous Dark Lord Voldemort leans down into the tomb, his gaze fixed intently on the black Elder Wand he holds in his hand. With a swift, decisive motion, he thrusts his arm upward, causing a massive, powerful force of energy to shoot forth from the wand's tip, brilliantly illuminating the dark, foreboding sky above. Hovering Dementors, clad in trailing, tattered black robes, encircle the castle of Hogwarts ominously, while Severus Snape, dressed in a somber black tunic and gown, stands in an upper archway, gazing out at the mist-shrouded mountains in the distance.

These waters are embraced by the towering, dark mountains that create a dramatic and mysterious backdrop, enhancing the aura of the place. On the far, distant side of the lake, there is a tiny, secluded island which houses a pristine white marble tomb that stands out strikingly. This tomb has an impressive large marble block, imposing in its presence, which smoothly slides back with a fluid motion as the supports beneath it collapse and tumble away into nothingness. The ominous figure of Dark Lord Voldemort leans down into this tomb, his gaze unwavering and intently fixed on the mysterious black Elder Wand that he holds firmly in his hand. With a swift and decisive motion, he thrusts his arm upward, unleashing a massive and powerful surge of energy that erupts forcefully from the wand's tip, brilliantly illuminating the dark and foreboding sky above. The sky is filled with hovering Dementors, draped in trailing, tattered black robes, encircling the castle of Hogwarts ominously and intensifying the atmosphere. Meanwhile, Severus Snape, dressed in a somber black tunic and gown, stands in an upper archway, his eyes gazing out at the mist-shrouded and distant mountains. The subdued students, moving in regimented ranks, stride purposefully across the courtyard, as Snape watches them with a somber, contemplative expression etched on his face. At another location, the inscription on the gravestone becomes visible as Harry Potter kneels solemnly at the foot of the grave, peering deeply into a small piece of broken mirror. In the reflection, he sees not only his own face but also another face, different from his own. The grave is located among the sand dunes behind a small, quaint house, where Shell Cottage faces a pristine white beach with the vast sea stretching out into the horizon. Inside the cozy cottage, Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley sit comfortably together in the lounge, which belongs to Ron's brother, Bill, and his sister-in-law, Fleur. Luna Lovegood wanders up to a set of hanging chimes, her attention drawn by their gentle and soothing sound. Meanwhile, Bill is in the kitchen, casting a glance toward Fleur as Luna examines the chimes with curiosity. Harry strides into the room with purpose, facing Bill, while Griphook sits nearby in an armchair, his pointed ears and long, beaky nose distinctive features. He sits with his hands clasped together, his eyes closed in deep contemplation. Bill shows Harry, Hermione, and Ron into the goblin's room, where Griphook, with hands still clasped, stares ahead with his mouth firmly closed, maintaining a stoic and unmoved demeanor. Harry crosses to the window and gazes out thoughtfully, while the goblin grips the arms of the chair, his long and filthy pointed nails visible, before he clasps his hands together once more, staring intently at Harry. Harry's gaze shifts toward the sword of Gryffindor, which leans against the wall, and as Griphook sits back in his chair, he takes a deep, steadying breath. Again, he clasps his hands together and his eyes flick to the sword, pointing at it as Harry's attention returns to the sword. Downstairs in the kitchen, as Hermione, Ron, and Harry emerge from the goblin's room, they pause momentarily on the landing. Fleur then shows them into a room where the old wand maker is seated by a window, looking up at Harry with a discerning and knowing eye. He hands a curved wand to Ollivander, who examines it closely and carefully, while Harry passes him a plain, straight wand in exchange. Ollivander raises the wand tip to his left ear, turning it thoughtfully in his fingers, before he returns the wand back to Harry. The old man leans forward slightly, and Ollivander looks away, easing back a little as his eyes widen, staring solemnly at Harry. Rising to his feet, Harry leaves the room, followed by the others, as Hermione holds a long strand of curling, black hair gently in her hand."

On the far side of the lake, a white marble tomb rests on a tiny island, its surface gleaming under the dim light. As the large marble block atop the tomb begins to shift, it slides back smoothly, revealing the interior as two supports beneath it give way and tumble aside. Dark Lord Voldemort, with a menacing air, leans down into the now-open tomb, his eyes fixated on the black Elder Wand that he holds firmly in his hand. With a deliberate motion, he thrusts his arm upward, and a massive force of energy erupts from the tip of the wand, casting a brilliant light that pierces the dark sky. Meanwhile, hovering Dementors, their tattered black robes trailing behind them, encircle the castle of Hogwarts, creating an ominous atmosphere. Severus Snape, clad in a black tunic and gown, stands in an upper archway of the castle, his gaze fixed on the mist-shrouded mountains in the distance.

A large marble block slides back as two supports beneath it tumble away. Dark Lord Voldemort, who has recently regained a physical form after many years, leans down into the tomb, gazes at the black Elder Wand, a legendary wand with unparalleled power believed to make its wielder invincible, in his hand, and thrusts up his arm, causing a massive force of energy to shoot from the tip of the wand, illuminating the dark sky ominously. Hovering Dementors, dreaded creatures known for draining happiness and causing despair, with trailing, tattered black robes, encircle Hogwarts as Severus Snape, the headmaster of Hogwarts and a double agent serving both Voldemort and the Order of the Phoenix, in a black tunic and gown, stands in an upper archway gazing out at the mountains shrouded in mist. Subdued students in regimented ranks stride across the courtyard, and Snape watches them with a somber expression, aware of his precarious position. The inscription on the gravestone reads a final farewell to Dobby the house-elf, who gave his life to save Harry and his friends, while Harry Potter kneels at the foot of the grave, looking into a piece of broken mirror, once a part of the two-way mirror given to him by Sirius Black, where he sees himself reflected, then a face other than his own. The grave stands amongst sand dunes behind a small house, and Shell Cottage, a safe house for members of the Order of the Phoenix, faces a white beach with a sea beyond. Inside, Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley sit in the lounge of the cottage, which is the home of Ron's brother, Bill, who works for Gringotts Bank, and sister-in-law Fleur, a former Triwizard Tournament competitor. Luna Lovegood, known for her quirky personality and deep belief in mystical creatures, saunters up to a set of hanging chimes while Bill is in the kitchen, glancing at Fleur, a part-Veela known for her beauty and bravery, as Luna looks at the chimes. Harry strides in and faces Bill as Griphook, a goblin who once worked at Gringotts Bank and is familiar with the bank's formidable security measures, who has pointed ears and a long beaky nose, sits in an armchair with his hands clasped together and eyes closed. Bill shows Harry, Hermione, and Ron into the goblin's room, where Griphook, hands still clasped, stares ahead with his mouth firmly closed, contemplating his next move. Harry crosses to the window and looks out as the goblin grips the arms of the chair, his long filthy pointed nails, indicative of his stubborn nature and lengthy travels, visible before he clasps his hands again, staring at Harry intently. Harry looks at the sword of Gryffindor, a goblin-made sword that can destroy Horcruxes, leaning against the wall while Griphook sits back in his chair, takes a deep breath, and again clasps his hands together as his eyes flick to the sword, coveting its craftsmanship. He points at it, and Harry looks back at the sword, realizing its importance. Downstairs in the kitchen, as Hermione, Ron, and Harry come out of the goblin's room, they stop on the landing, and Fleur shows them into a room where the old wand maker, Garrick Ollivander, who once helped Harry find his first wand, sits by a window, looking up at Harry. He hands a curved wand to Ollivander, who examines it closely with the expertise of a master wandmaker as Harry passes him a plain, straight wand. Ollivander raises the wand tip to his left ear, turns it in his fingers, and gives the wand back to Harry, noting the wand's allegiance. The old man leans forward, Ollivander looks away, eases back a little, his eyes widening as he stares solemnly at Harry, aware of the dangerous path ahead. Harry gets up, and they leave as Hermione holds a long strand of curling, black hair, belonging to Bellatrix Lestrange, which will be significant for their plan."

Floating Banshees, with fluttering, tattered grey shawls, encircle Mirkwood as Professor Moriarty, in a grey robe and cape, perches in an upper alcove gazing out at the cliffs shrouded in fog. Listless visitors in precise rows march across the clearing, and Moriarty observes them with a pensive expression.

Legolas Greenleaf ambles up to a collection of suspended bells while Boromir is in the pantry, nodding at Arwen as Legolas examines the bells. Bilbo paces in and confronts Boromir as Gollum, who has bulbous eyes and a reedy voice, relaxes in an ottoman with his fingers intertwined and eyes shut. Boromir escorts Bilbo, Eowyn, and Aragorn into the creature's chamber, where Gollum, fingers still intertwined, gazes ahead with his mouth tightly shut.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

          "description": "The serene Hogwarts lake, encircled by dark mountains, holds a white marble tomb on an island. Lord Voldemort extracts the Elder Wand from it, releasing a powerful energy burst into the sky. Dementors hover ominously, while Severus Snape watches somberly from an archway. Harry Potter kneels at a grave and sees a face in a broken mirror piece. Nearby, Shell Cottage sits by the sea, home to Ron's brother Bill and his wife Fleur. Inside, Ron, Hermione, and Luna Lovegood are present. Harry enters and confronts Bill while Griphook, a goblin with pointed ears, sits quietly. Harry regards the sword of Gryffindor as Griphook signals toward it. In the kitchen, Hermione, Ron, and Harry exit the goblin's room and meet Ollivander, the old wandmaker, who scrutinizes two wands, returning one to Harry. As Harry stands to leave, Hermione holds a strand of black hair."
