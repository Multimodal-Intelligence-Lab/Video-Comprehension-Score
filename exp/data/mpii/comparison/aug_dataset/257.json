Faintly visible through the partially-translucent curtain are two shadows at the viewing balcony, one tossing something at the other as the bell grows softer. Over her head, she buckles herself and hops from the bicycle.

As she shuts the bicycle gate tightly, the bell is faint now, and the bicycle zooms silently down the driveway. The ice cream truck reaches a valley to float into vision, its bell tolling. You bursts into the hall, still wearing the sock puppet, and the crate of oranges is still balanced on one foot as she whispers calmly after her returning bicycle. You scans the driveway, puzzled, as the tolling bell becomes soothingly faint. You glances ahead of her at the plastic front of the shop, where a bubble smudge tarnishes the curtain. Beyond the curtain, the grumpy young Waiter with the plastic chef's hat bounces up from above the ceiling to peer down his light .22 Water Pistol for another splash, the broom so tiny he uses one foot to wave it.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
