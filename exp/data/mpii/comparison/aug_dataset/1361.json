Abby converses with Stuart Wardlow, KPHX's grouchy general director, and appears anxious but agrees in reply to him. She then tears out an additional two feet of string and holds up her clipboard, which has a guy's E-Harmony description and image. Abby ceases flossing and looks at Joy, and there's an uncomfortable silence between them before she pulls out another sheet of paper and hands it to him.

He holds up several volumes, reading the titles, then drops the volumes, picks up a can of petrol, and pours it on them. Mike shoves a charred marshmallow into his mouth, imitates swallowing, and then we pan off the television to the bed where Abby watches, horrified. Mike hangs up the phone, and Abby, now enraged, picks up the phone and begins dialing as we intercut between the platform and her flat, with Mike continuing his tirade. Annoyed, Abby begins to compulsively remake her bed while Mike doubles over chuckling.

A huge bite is taken by Javier, the new fat weatherman, and laughter is shared by all of them. Stuart Wardlow, KPHX's curmudgeonly general manager, is talked to by Abby, and worried looks are given by her, but she nods in response to him. Two extra feet of floss are ripped out by her, and her clipboard is held up by her, which has a guy's E-Harmony profile and photo. Joy is looked at by Abby, flossing is stopped by her, and an awkward silence occurs between them before another piece of paper is pulled out and handed to him by her. A noise from her bedroom is heard by her, and D'Artagnan's paw is seen by her in the fish bowl, trying to scoop up a goldfish. Several books are held up by him, the titles are read, then the books are dropped, a can of gasoline is picked up, and it is poured on them by him. A burnt marshmallow is shoved into his mouth by Mike, swallowing is mimed by him, and the television is panned off to the bed where Abby watches, appalled. The phone is hung up by Mike, and the phone is picked up by Abby, now infuriated, and dialing is begun by her as intercuts occur between the stage and her apartment, with Mike continuing his rant. Her bed is compulsively remade by Abby, irritated, while laughter bowls over Mike. The conference room is made their way into by Abby and Joy, where Dori and Josh are already present, and Mike's face appears on TV. Abby is looked at by Joy, who holds up a piece of paper for Stuart to read, and then she is spun to face him by her. Pacing is done by Abby on the verge of hysteria when the door is knocked on, and Mike appears. Mike is glared at by Abby, and a surprised stare is given back by him, as gagging is done by her and a push past him, walking out. The hall is strode down by Abby with Georgia and Larry, then a cocky wave is given by Mike and the proceedings are watched by Abby and the control room crew. Smirking is done by Abby in the control room, but looking like she's going to pass out is done by her as Cliff shrugs. Georgia is grabbed by Larry, and a hard kiss is given to her; after a moment of resistance, she melts into his arms and she is thrown over his back and hauled off the set by him.

As she proceeds, she inadvertently stumbles upon a heated, intense shouting match between two of her colleagues: Josh, an impassioned, left-leaning news writer, and Dori, his co-writer with a focus on entertainment. Meanwhile, Javier, who is the newly hired, somewhat overweight weatherman, takes an enormous bite of something, causing a burst of laughter among the group. Abby then engages in conversation with Stuart Wardlow, the curmudgeonly general manager of KPHX, and she appears visibly worried but nods in agreement with whatever he’s saying. Subsequently, she pulls out an extra two feet of floss and lifts her clipboard, revealing a guy's E-Harmony profile along with his photograph. Abby ceases flossing to glance at Joy, and an uncomfortable silence settles between them until she eventually retrieves another piece of paper and hands it to him.\n\nSoon after, Abby hears an unusual noise emanating from her bedroom. Upon investigating, she sees D'Artagnan, her feline charge, with his paw dipping into the fish bowl, mischievously attempting to catch a goldfish. Adjacent to this, someone holds up several books, reads their titles aloud, but then momentarily discards them, opting instead to pick up a can of gasoline and pours it over the pile, setting a potentially hazardous scene. Mike dramatically pushes a charred marshmallow into his mouth, mimics swallowing it with gusto, and we then transition the camera from the television screen to the bed. There, we see Abby watching, obviously aghast at what she’s witnessing. As Mike hangs up the phone, Abby, boiling with rage, snatches the phone and starts dialing furiously as we cut back and forth between the stage and her apartment, with Mike’s ranting unabated. Feeling exasperated, Abby begins compulsively tidying and remaking her bed as Mike continues to laugh uproariously.\n\nAbby, accompanied by Joy, makes her way toward the conference room where Dori and Josh are already assembled, and they observe Mike’s face prominently displayed on the television. Joy casts a glance at Abby, who raises a piece of paper for Stuart to read, then swiftly turns to face him directly. Abby, on the brink of hysterics, paces anxiously when a knock disrupts the air, revealing Mike standing there. Abby fixes him with a piercing glare, while Mike returns the look with surprise, as she chokes back emotion and pushes past him, storming out. With determination, Abby strides down the hallway alongside Georgia and Larry. Meanwhile, Mike, full of swagger, gives a self-assured wave as Abby and the crew in the control room observe the unfolding of events. Inside the control room, Abby allows herself a brief, smug smile, which vanishes quickly as she looks faint and Cliff merely shrugs it off.\n\nIn a passionate moment, Larry seizes Georgia and kisses her fervently; after a brief hesitation, she surrenders to his embrace, and he confidently hoists her over his shoulder, carrying her off the set dramatically. Abby, feeling overwhelmed, sits curled in a ball within her closet when Mike’s sister, Elizabeth, enters, donned in a nurse’s uniform and cradling a cake box. She presents him with the cake box, plants a kiss on his cheek, and he beams with delight. However, Elizabeth bristles with irritation, firmly inserting an earpiece into his ear as he makes his way to a table set with an elaborate dinner, surrounded by softly glowing candlelight and several books, while a man serenely plays the violin nearby."

The first, Josh, is a passionate and fervent news writer known for his left-leaning views, while the other, Dori, works alongside him with a particular focus on entertainment writing.

She navigates her way into a room only to stumble upon a heated argument taking place between Josh, who writes angry articles on leftist news, and Dori, who is more inclined towards entertainment writing. During this tense exchange, Javier, the newly appointed and noticeably rotund weatherman, decides to take a big, exaggerated bite of something, prompting a round of laughter among those present. Seeking a moment of normalcy, Abby turns her attention to Stuart Wardlow, the grumpy general manager of KPHX. She engages in a conversation with him, her face reflecting concern, yet she acknowledges his words by nodding in agreement. With determination, she pulls out an additional two feet of dental floss, then deftly holds up her clipboard, which prominently features a guy's E-Harmony profile complete with a photo. Abruptly, Abby ceases her flossing and directs her gaze towards Joy. An uncomfortable silence hangs heavy between them before Abby breaks it by producing another sheet of paper, handing it over to him. Her attention is suddenly drawn by an unusual noise emanating from her bedroom, where she observes D'Artagnan, her pet, with a paw dipped into the fishbowl, apparently attempting to catch a goldfish. He momentarily shifts focus, lifting several books and reading their titles before carelessly dropping them. Without hesitation, he retrieves a can of gasoline, pours it over the books, and further contributes to the chaos. Meanwhile, Mike opts to shove a marshmallow, charred to a crisp, into his mouth, performs an exaggerated mime of swallowing it, and shifts the attention from the television to the bed where Abby sits watching, visibly horrified. Mike finishes his phone conversation by hanging up, whereas Abby, now boiling with anger, grabs her phone and starts dialing numbers, creating a sequence that cuts back and forth between her living room and the stage where Mike continues his tirade. With growing irritation, Abby undertakes a compulsive bout of bed-making, all while Mike is beside himself with laughter. Later, Abby and Joy walk purposely into the conference room to find Dori and Josh already in attendance, while Mike's face dominates the television screen. Joy glances at Abby, who offers a piece of paper for Stuart's perusal before she quickly pivots to face him. As Abby's pacing quickens, edging on hysteria, there’s an unexpected knock on the door revealing Mike's presence. Abby casts a withering glare in his direction, an expression of surprise etched upon his face as she chokes back her emotions and determinedly pushes past him, exiting the scene. She cuts an assertive path down the corridor alongside Georgia and Larry, while Mike exudes nonchalant confidence with a brazen wave, all eyes from Abby and the control room crew keenly trained on unfolding events. In the frenetic atmosphere of the control room, Abby allows herself a brief, smug smile, only to be overcome by dizziness that suggests she might faint, as Cliff merely offers a noncommittal shrug. Meanwhile, Larry seizes Georgia in a passionate embrace, and despite initial reluctance, she eventually surrenders to the moment, allowing herself to be hoisted over Larry's shoulder and carried away from the set. Transitioning to a more subdued location, Abby finds solace curled up in a closet when Mike's sister, Elizabeth, enters the scene, dressed in a nurse's outfit and carrying a cake box. She extends the cake box to him, punctuates the gesture with a peck on his cheek, eliciting a broad grin from him. Annoyed, Elizabeth sharply adjusts the earpiece in his ear, while he heads purposefully to a table elegantly set for dinner, candles aglow, books stacked nearby, all serenaded by the soothing notes of a violinist playing in the background."

Javier, the new fat weatherman who is famously known for his love of food, takes a huge bite of his oversized sandwich, and they all laugh at his comedic timing. Abby talks to Stuart Wardlow, KPHX's notoriously curmudgeonly general manager who has been in the television industry for over 30 years, and looks worried but nods in response to him, aware of his reputation for strictness. She then rips out an extra two feet of floss and holds up her clipboard, which has a guy's E-Harmony profile and photo, indicating someone she was considering meeting for a date. Abby stops flossing and looks at Joy, her assistant known for his silent yet supportive demeanor, and there's an awkward silence between them before she pulls out another piece of paper and hands it to him, a note with urgent instructions.

Irritated, Abby begins to compulsively remake her bed, a habit she's developed to cope with stress, while Mike bowls over laughing at his own jokes. Abby and Joy make their way into the conference room where Dori and Josh are already present, and on TV, Mike's face appears as he gives a controversial monologue. Joy looks at Abby, who holds up a piece of paper for Stuart to read, and then she spins to face him to discuss an urgent matter. Abby is pacing on the verge of hysteria as she feels overwhelmed by the day's events when there is a knock on the door, and Mike, her exasperating colleague, appears. Abby glares at him, and he stares back, surprised by her intense reaction, as she gags slightly and pushes past him, walking out to clear her mind. Abby strides down the hall with Georgia, a fellow producer known for her quick wit, and Larry, then Mike gives a cocky wave, confident in his recent on-air antics, and Abby and the control room crew watch the proceedings on the monitor. In the control room, Abby smirks at the unfolding scene, but then looks like she's going to pass out from exhaustion as Cliff, a seasoned technician, shrugs, indicating his nonchalance. Larry grabs Georgia and kisses her hard, an unexpected but long-awaited moment of passion; after a moment of resistance, she melts into his arms, and he throws her over his back, playfully hauling her off the set amidst laughter from the crew. Abby is sitting in a ball in her closet, overwhelmed with emotions, when Mike's sister, Elizabeth, who works as a nurse at a nearby hospital and always tries to lighten the mood, walks in wearing a nurse's uniform and holding a cake box. She hands him the cake box, gives him a tender kiss on the cheek, a gesture of familial love, and he grins, appreciating her visit. Elizabeth fumes, jabbing the earpiece in his ear to get his attention as he crosses to a candle-lit table with a fancy dinner placed in the center, reminiscent of a romantic evening, and several books beside it, while a man plays violin nearby, setting a serene atmosphere in contrast to the earlier chaos."

          "description": "Clara stumbles forward, not desiring to contemplate Ned's hats any longer than required, and she barges into a silent duel between Liam, a conservative ecstatic chef, and Mona, the sports-focused partner. Diego, the fresh thin librarian, sips a small gulp and they all weep. Clara whispers to Roger O'Brien, ZXTV's cheerful art director, and feels elated but shakes her head in response to him. She then extracts an extra two pages of tape and waves around her notebook, which contains a cat's Tinder description and sketch. Clara halts taping and gazes at Max, and a humorous silence blossoms between them before she extracts another cloth of fabric and tosses it to him. She catches a scent emanating from her attic and spots Athos's whisker in the cookie jar, attempting to scoop up a cracker. He balances multiple hats, noting the colors, then places the hats, snatches a bottle of lemonade, and spills it on them. Luke wedges a caramel apple into his ear, mimes chewing, and then we zoom from the stereo to the sofa where Clara observes, entertained. Luke puts down the remote, and Clara, now ecstatic, grabs the remote and starts typing as we switch between the arcade and her balcony, with Luke continuing his soliloquy. Thrilled, Clara starts to repeatedly retie her shoes while Luke keels over giggling. Clara and Max stroll into the studio where Mona and Liam are already seated, and on the device, Luke's silhouette emerges. Max glances at Clara, who holds out a page for Roger to glimpse, and then she twirls to confront him. Clara is leaping on the brink of amusement when there is a ring at the window, and Luke enters. Clara cheers at him, and he blinks back, astonished, as she smiles and glides past him, skipping away. Clara marches through the garden with Stephanie and Ned, then Luke gives a humble salute and Clara and the kitchen staff marvel at the spectacle. In the kitchen, Clara beams, but then looks like she's going to dance as Frank shrugs. Ned hugs Stephanie and pats her gently; after a moment of confusion, she leans into his chest and he drags her across his feet, leading her off the platform. Clara is lying in a hammock in her pantry when Luke's cousin, Fiona, enters wearing a farmer's outfit and holding a gift basket. She awards him the gift basket, gives him a pat on the back, and he cheers. Fiona laughs, adjusting the hat on his head as he shuffles to a dimly-lit chair with a modest meal placed to the side and several paintings surrounding it, while a child plays piano nearby."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
