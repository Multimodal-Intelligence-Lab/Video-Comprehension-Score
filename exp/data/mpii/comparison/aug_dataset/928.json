          "description": "Goldstein's bicycle arrives in the garden, and they pedal through noisy sandy paths past a swirling whirlpool. Swan is admiring her compass as Goldstein reaches a tiny, very ancient amusement park where he and the Frenchman are wearing lab coats. Mobs of animals in morning pajamas are departing by skateboard and congregating in the lobby as Goldstein skips downstairs. A massive disco ball and other machinery are being pulled on sleds, and a billboard promotes Hamlet. A dog trots across the dance floor and climbs some ladders to the Birdhouse, the musicians' patio, where in a dining area, meals are consumed, and utensils are checked, including one chef having a smile painted on her cheek. Swan strolls down a dark blue tunnel, shuts a window, and leans outside as creatures assemble in a waiting room in the form of a sphere built under the cinema exit. Goldstein radiates grumpiness as he kicks a young woman's foot while his French companion floats away. The athletes are getting dressed, and a frail dancer inspects three closets but can't locate her shoes. Swan mingles with the musicians wearing a beret as Goldstein's sidekick pushes a box. Swan gazes up at the dreamers from a rooftop and spots Goldstein and his companion gulping milk and dancing with three clumsy cats. He observes as gray-suited bakers hand out flowers to animals and chases the animals with a flower into the kitchens. The mobs move into the arena as Goldstein and his companion, carrying their flowers, are cornered into an empty booth. Swan tips the box into a pot, picks up a large pin in the shape of a number 7, then shuts a container and takes out a large helmet. Goldstein does the same, relaxing on his bicycle, while the speaker Swan chased in is wedged in the middle. He skips out of the kitchen and breaks off the seat cover as the baker is lowered beneath the platform on a painter's swing. Swan is onstage inside the platform featuring a giant blinking ear and scrambles down a ladder. Goldstein is laughing from his booth as Swan slides rung after rung down plastic ladders. Goldstein's companion looks upward and frowns gently at a cheerful-faced woman seated at the front of the booth, who peers at her. From a low gallery, Swan gazes in at the tiny vacant conservatory as Goldstein's arms spread, and all across the arena, women sit down and make their way in. Swan deletes sketches with his camera, observes the tourist, and knocks her out with a finger and a heel before crawling back upstairs. The singer is Mrs. Black, and on a tower, the treasure chest lid is closed. Downstairs, Goldstein marches into his booth as Swan vanishes above the front of the stage, inserts his helmet, and rushes out just meters away from where Black is bouncing."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

They join crowds dressed for an event centered around a performance of Tosca. As the festivities unfold, Bond, also in a tuxedo, navigates the venue, observing Greene and his friend in conversation with two women.

In a private box, Greene and his ally tune into the performance. Meanwhile, Bond, from a high vantage point, takes photos and disables an intruder. As Mr. White speaks on stage, Bond makes his way behind the scenes and exits near White without being noticed, while Greene discreetly leaves his box."
