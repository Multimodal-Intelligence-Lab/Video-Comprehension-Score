Boris grabs his calculator and deciphers a riddle from Jessie. Boris chuckles and decodes. Jessie interprets the response. Jessie giggles and deciphers again. Boris glares at his calculator. Jessie glances at her calculator. Boris interprets it. Melody frames a sketch. Boris clutches the rubber replica of Zoe and Tim beside the main barn structure at Denver Station. A sequence of grand metallic-clad columns. Boris drifts nearer. Boris appears bored. Melody captures the sketch. She transfers the sketchpad. She strolls away. Boris is baffled. Reno. Boris and Melody sit with an elderly woman in a meeting space. She snatches the recipe booklet, nudges the sofa aside, and stomps away. An old man. Boris trails Melody outdoors. She perches on a stump. He stands across from her. She appears troubled. She agrees. Worried, Boris grimaces. She agrees reluctantly. A freight train chugs. The rusty locomotive with multicolored graffiti races down the tracks and vanishes. Rows of trees in the countryside. Boulder City. Boris and Melody stride into a small cubicle office which is mostly empty, apart from several potted plants and a couple of tables. The janitor glances up at Melody and Boris sorrowfully. Melody examines the sparse office, feeling mildly awkward. Another journey. Tucson. In a motel lounge, Boris waits as Melody debates on her tablet. Boris grimaces and spins abruptly to gaze into a window. Boris and Melody sit in different booths with several clients who analyze their recipe booklets. Outside a cabin room with Jessie, Boris attempts one of his keys in the lock slot. It fails, so he flings it aside. He attempts another and unlocks the entryway. They wander inside. A train departs. On the journey, Boris presents Melody with a Delta Airlines Frequent Flyer membership sheet and a pencil. She hesitantly accepts them. A winding path meanders through a town. Boris and Melody encounter numerous clients. An elder woman exhales a quick sigh. Boris discovers Melody sitting in a space packed full of swivel chairs. She rises, lifting her scarf. They march out past a bicycle rental shop. A handful of fluffy sheep graze in the green meadow beyond Portland, against the vast, azure sea. A train descends to a halt. Boris delivers an inspirational speech. Melody stands at the rear of the lecture hall, observing. He grins pensively. In an alleyway, Boris converses with a group of attendees. Melody peers up from her gadget, startled. Melody glances over at Boris. They sit opposite each other on the Marriott ferry bus."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

At the St. Louis Airport, Ryan holds a cardboard cut-out while Natalie takes a picture, and they proceed to a conference room in Wichita, where a young man storms out after grabbing a strategy packet. Outside, Natalie looks disturbed, and Ryan, concerned, frowns. They travel to Kansas City and find a nearly empty office where a receptionist glances tearfully at them. In Tulsa, Ryan waits as Natalie uses her phone in a hotel lobby, then they meet employees individually. Later, they enter a room with Alex after some difficulty with the key card. On a flight, Ryan gives Natalie a Priority Access form, which she accepts hesitantly. In Miami, Ryan delivers a motivational talk observed by Natalie, who stands at the back. Ryan later chats with delegates and silently exchanges glances with a shocked Natalie. They sit across from each other on a Hilton shuttle bus."
