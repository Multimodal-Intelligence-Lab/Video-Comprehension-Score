Helen stands looking after him for a moment, then turns angrily and proceeds toward the pawn shop where the pawn broker has put her coat on a hanger and is brushing it. Helen enters, very matter-of-fact. In another scene, Don is at the desk writing on the second page of a letter, with a revolver beside him, ending with, \"But amid all the grimness can we share one little joke, dear Wick: I did finish something, didn’t I? Goodbye.\" He puts down the pen, stands the letter conspicuously on the desk, picks up the revolver, gets the cartridges from the drawer, and loads the gun. Having been out in the rain, his hair is still a little damp, and he walks into the bathroom. Don stands and looks at himself in the mirror with the gun in his hand, notices the unbuttoned points of his collar, and with a rueful smile at the funny timing of his urge for tidiness, buttons one. As he is buttoning the second, he hears a sound from outside, becomes startled, and puts the gun into the empty wash bowl. The door is being opened and Helen, breathing hard from her race to get there, enters with rain on her hair and face, and a wet dress. Don comes from the bathroom as Helen stands staring at him, wiping the rain from her face, and maybe some tears too. She looks around desperately and sees the gun reflected in the shaving mirror. Before she can step toward it, Don returns with a scarf. Helen goes to the umbrella stand and takes out a bottle, puts down the raincoat and scarf, and goes to the kitchen for a glass. Don picks up the raincoat and scarf, bends down for a kiss, while Helen stands looking at him and holds out the glass. She turns, runs into the bathroom, and picks up the gun with Don following her. Helen holds the gun behind her while Don half pushes, half leads her into the entrance hall. Overcome by a wave of weakness, he sags against the door, then goes and opens it.",

He strides down the road about ten paces when Helen approaches him, but Don ignores her and attempts to proceed. Helen catches up with him and obstructs his path, but he continues onward. Helen stands gazing after him for a moment, then turns angrily and advances toward the pawn store where the pawnbroker has placed her coat on a hanger and is brushing it. Helen enters, very pragmatic. In another scene, Don is at the counter inscribing on the second sheet of a note, with a pistol beside him, concluding with, \"But amid all the severity can we share one little jest, dear Wick: I did complete something, didn’t I? Farewell.\" He sets down the quill, places the note prominently on the desk, picks up the pistol, retrieves the shells from the drawer, and loads the firearm. Having been in the drizzle, his hair is still slightly moist, and he walks into the lavatory. Don stands and gazes at himself in the looking glass with the firearm in his hand, notices the unfastened points of his collar, and with a rueful grin at the amusing timing of his urge for neatness, fastens one. As he is fastening the second, he hears a noise from outside, becomes startled, and places the firearm into the vacant wash basin. The door is being opened and Helen, panting from her sprint to get there, enters with moisture on her hair and visage, and a damp garment. Don comes from the lavatory as Helen stands staring at him, wiping the moisture from her visage, and maybe some sobs too. She glances around frantically and sees the firearm reflected in the shaving mirror. Before she can step toward it, Don returns with a muffler. Helen goes to the umbrella holder and takes out a flask, puts down the raincoat and muffler, and goes to the kitchen for a goblet. Don picks up the raincoat and muffler, bends down for a peck, while Helen stands gazing at him and holds out the goblet. She turns, dashes into the lavatory, and picks up the firearm with Don following her. Helen holds the firearm behind her while Don half pushes, half guides her into the entryway. Overcome by a surge of debility, he droops against the portal, then goes and opens it."

Don, however, remains indifferent to her presence, his mind set on moving forward. Undeterred, Helen speeds up to overtake him, strategically positioning herself to obstruct his path, but Don is resolute in his intent and continues on his way. Left in his wake, Helen pauses momentarily, watching his retreating figure with a mix of emotions clouding her face. Frustrated and angry, she pivots on her heel and makes her way toward the pawn shop. Upon her arrival, she observes the pawnbroker who has already placed her coat on a hanger and is now brushing it with brisk, methodical movements. Helen enters the shop with an air of dispassionate resolve. Meanwhile, in another scene, Don is settled at a desk, diligently writing on the second page of a letter while a revolver lies ominously beside him. He meticulously inscribes the words, \"But amid all the grimness can we share one little joke, dear Wick: I did finish something, didn’t I? Goodbye.\" Completing the letter, he deliberately places the pen down and positions the letter prominently on the desk before reaching for the revolver. Opening a nearby drawer, he retrieves the cartridges and methodically loads the gun. His hair, slightly damp from the rain outside, clings to his head as he moves into the bathroom. Standing before the mirror, Don scrutinizes his reflection, the gun still firmly in his grasp. He notices the casual disarray of his unbuttoned collar points and, with a wry smile at the odd timing of his sudden need for order, begins to button one. As he is about to button the second, an unexpected noise from outside startles him, causing him to hastily place the gun into the empty wash bowl. The door creaks open, and Helen bursts in, breathless from her hurried race to reach him, rain streaming down her hair and face, her dress thoroughly soaked. Don emerges from the bathroom just as Helen stands there, processing the scene, her face a mixture of rain and perhaps a few stray tears. She scans the room in desperation, her gaze finally landing on the gun's reflection in the shaving mirror. Before she can make a move towards it, Don re-enters the room, now holding a scarf. Helen decisively approaches the umbrella stand, retrieves a hidden bottle, sets down her raincoat and the scarf, and heads to the kitchen in search of a glass. Meanwhile, Don, picking up the discarded raincoat and scarf, bends down for a moment of affection, aiming to plant a kiss, while Helen stands before him, her expression inscrutable, extending the glass toward him. Abruptly, she spins around and dashes into the bathroom, seizing the gun just as Don trails closely behind her. Helen clutches the gun protectively behind her back while Don, in a state of emotional turmoil, both nudges and guides her toward the entrance hall with a mixture of insistence and gentleness. He suddenly finds himself overwhelmed by a wave of weariness, causing him to slump against the door momentarily before mustering the strength to go and open it."

He walks down the street about ten steps on the bustling downtown sidewalk when Helen comes up to him, but Don disregards her and tries to go on. Helen, who is wearing a look of determination, overtakes him and blocks his way, but he continues on, dodging past her with a practiced agility.

Goodbye.\" He puts down the pen, stands the letter conspicuously on the desk, picks up the revolver, gets the cartridges from the drawer, and loads the gun with a steady hand.

Don stands and looks at himself in the mirror with the gun in his hand, notices the unbuttoned points of his collar, and with a rueful smile at the funny timing of his urge for tidiness, buttons one. As he is buttoning the second, he hears a sound from outside, becomes startled, and puts the gun into the empty porcelain wash bowl. The door is being opened and Helen, breathing hard from her race to get there, enters with rain on her hair and face, and a wet dress clinging to her frame. Don comes from the bathroom as Helen stands staring at him, wiping the rain from her face, and maybe some tears too, the storm outside mirroring the turmoil within her. She looks around desperately and sees the gun reflected in the shaving mirror with its tarnished silver frame. Before she can step toward it, Don returns with a scarf, an old gift from Helen. Helen goes to the umbrella stand and takes out a bottle, the one she knows Don has hidden there in moments of despair, puts down the raincoat and scarf, and goes to the kitchen for a glass. Don picks up the raincoat and scarf, bends down for a kiss, while Helen stands looking at him and holds out the glass with an expression of both defiance and hope. She turns, runs into the bathroom, and picks up the gun with Don following her, a blend of fear and urgency in his steps. Helen holds the gun behind her while Don half pushes, half leads her into the entrance hall. Overcome by a wave of weakness, he sags against the door, then goes and opens it, letting in the scent of rain and the distant sounds of city life at night."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
