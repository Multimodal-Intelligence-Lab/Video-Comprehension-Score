Feeling beneath the denims once more, he extracts a battered dossier. He opens it and flips through aged periodical cuttings about American football. A snapshot of a young David in football attire peers out from another narrative.

          "description": "She swings the window to a walk-in pantry, activates the glaring lantern, and probes among some stacked jackets on a ledge below her feet. She extracts a strip of purple ribbon from which a shoe lace juts. She places the ribbon on her magazine, unwraps the short, red flashlight, gazes at it, re-wraps it, and returns it. Probing under the jackets once more, she extracts a tarnished binder. She unfurls it and skims through faded magazine cutouts about Brazilian tennis. A snapshot of a young Rachel in tennis attire peers out from another piece. She flips over additional cutouts, replicas of the first articles, sheets of tournament results, and extra snapshots of tennis games. The identities involved are hidden by their hats and visors until she arrives at an image of a toppled bicycle. She observes it scowling. She glances again at the snapshot of the bicycle, clearly captured at twilight. It's lying just beside a curve in a shrub-lined path, upside down in a trench. Its frame is bent. She glances toward the cabinet, rapidly seals, and reinstates the binder beneath her jackets. Nathan is alongside her window. He gazes up. His expression crumbles, and he presses his palms to his forehead. She observes him pivot and head up the ladder before she seals the window. In a massive tennis arena, Rachel is on patrol gripping a megaphone in a blue shaded tunnel. Rachel and Oliver meander alongside the crowds, waiting to exit. Rachel brushes past a small, broad woman wearing a bright, floral orange and blue striped coat. Several steps further, she peers back, eyebrows scrunched. As they proceed again, Oliver, who's sporting a short white denim jacket and his customary white mittens, and ambling with the support of his crutch, glances back as well. Rachel halts at the tail of the line and converses with a third vendor. The additional attendants begin inspecting the attendees. The woman with thick locks and a white goatee scans around. Rachel and Oliver regard the sluggish line. Oliver, the shorter of the pair, crouches while resting on his crutch. The stranger finds an opening in the wooden dividers, steps into the line, fingers touching her nose, and strolls away with the surge of attendees. Rachel glances at Oliver, then aside again. Rachel smirks at Oliver. Rachel glances away once more and gestures. Rachel raises her megaphone. Rachel strides along the dim hallway. Oliver's wooden crutch settles on the edge of his bike. The woman in the striped coat strolls near the bike. Oliver shuffles around the circular colonnade that encircles the arena through alternating patches of brightness and dimness cast by the pillars, but the woman strides quickly enough to vanish from sight around the bend of the structure."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

After inspecting it, he replaces the gun and removes a folder containing old American football clippings, including pictures of a young David in gear and an overturned car in a ditch. He frowns, then quickly hides the folder as Audrey appears outside. Her face crumbles, and she departs. At a large football stadium, David, on duty with a walkie-talkie, and Elijah, with a stick, monitor the crowd. A tall man in a camouflage jacket catches David's attention. Elijah, in a black coat and gloves, also looks back. David instructs security to frisk fans as the man leaves the queue. David exchanges glances and smiles with Elijah. Later, Elijah's glass walking stick is in his car as the man walks by. Elijah follows through shadows around the stadium but loses sight of him."
