The nurse comes out, and Ben, wearing his customary gray suit and shirt and tie, enters Emily's bedroom carrying the gift. One of the walls is covered in photos, some of Emily at different ages, and Ben studies them. He moves slowly over to the window with a fine net curtain over it and watches as Emily carries the casserole from the oven to a candlelit table, where the flame of a tea light glows in the darkness. Ben puts down the box and catches sight of himself in a full-length mirror. He comes out of the bedroom wearing a polo shirt and jeans and stands at the opened French windows.

Emily nods and smiles, waves her hand motioning for him to come outside, and, looking slightly awkward, he goes to the table and looks about at the lit candles everywhere. Emily nods and smiles at him, and Ben scratches his eyebrow shyly. Emily stretches out her upturned palm and gestures for Ben to sit at the table, then studies him seriously and nods encouragingly.

Ben arrives at Emily's and exits the automobile with a gift-wrapped package, then rethinks, places it back in the automobile, and strides towards the dwelling, where Emily opens the portal. The caregiver emerges, and Ben, donning his usual gray suit and shirt and tie, enters Emily's chamber bearing the gift. One of the partitions is covered in photographs, some of Emily at various ages, and Ben examines them. He moves leisurely over to the casement with a delicate net drape over it and observes as Emily transports the casserole from the oven to an illuminated table, where the flame of a tea light flickers in the darkness. Ben places down the carton and catches sight of himself in a full-length looking glass. He exits the chamber wearing a polo shirt and jeans and stands at the opened French apertures. Emily is seated at the table as Ben glances down at his attire. Emily nods and grins, waves her hand signaling for him to come outside, and, appearing slightly uneasy, he approaches the table and glances around at the lit candles everywhere. Emily nods and grins at him, and Ben scratches his eyebrow bashfully. Emily extends her upturned palm and gestures for Ben to sit at the table, then examines him seriously and nods encouragingly. Ben eagerly picks up his fork, tries a bite, suppresses a slight wince, and looks genuine as she smiles triumphantly.

Out comes the nurse, and Emily's bedroom is entered by Ben, wearing his customary gray suit and shirt and tie, carrying the gift. Photos cover one of the walls, some of Emily at different ages, and they are studied by Ben. Slowly, he is moved by himself over to the window with a fine net curtain over it and watches as the casserole is carried by Emily from the oven to a candlelit table, where the tea light’s flame glows in the darkness. Down is put the box by Ben, and a full-length mirror catches sight of him. He comes out of the bedroom wearing a polo shirt and jeans and stands at the opened French windows. At the table sits Emily as his outfit is looked down at by Ben. Emily smiles, nods, and waves her hand motioning for him to come outside, and, looking slightly awkward, the table is gone to by him, and the lit candles everywhere are looked about at by him. Emily smiles and nods at him, and his eyebrow is scratched shyly by Ben. Her upturned palm is stretched out by Emily, and the table is gestured for Ben to sit at by her, then he is studied seriously by her and he is nodded at encouragingly. Eagerly, his fork is picked up by Ben, a mouthful is tried by him, a slight grimace is stifled by him, and sincere looks appear as she smiles triumphantly. At the table, they still sit as Ben is listened to humming by Emily who frowns and her head is shaken, then she goes to a record player. With her back to Ben, she slightly falters, a deep breath is taken by her, a record is put on the turntable by her, and she sings along, offering her hand to Ben. His seat is sat forward in by Ben with his hands clasped, looking lost in sad thought until Emily’s slender hand is slid between his and he is pulled to his feet by her, and he smiles.

Later, Ben arrives at Emily's charming house, pulling up in his reliable car with a gift-wrapped parcel securely held in his hand. He hesitates, reconsiders his decision, and places the neatly wrapped parcel back in the car before summoning the courage to make his way towards the house.

Ben pulls up at Emily's house, a charming Victorian home known for its bright red front door, and gets out of the car with a gift-wrapped parcel, then reconsiders, puts it back in the car, and walks towards the house, where Emily, who is known for her collection of rare houseplants, opens the door. The nurse, a familiar face in the neighborhood for her compassionate care, comes out, and Ben, wearing his customary gray suit and shirt and tie, enters Emily's bedroom carrying the gift. One of the walls is covered in photos, some of Emily at different ages, capturing her love for travel with snapshots from her adventures around Europe, and Ben studies them. He moves slowly over to the window with a fine net curtain over it and watches as Emily carries the casserole filled with her famous mushroom risotto from the oven to a candlelit table, where the flame of a tea light, purchased during a memorable trip to the local flea market, glows in the darkness. Ben puts down the box and catches sight of himself in a full-length mirror, a vintage piece from the 1920s with a carved wooden frame. He comes out of the bedroom wearing a polo shirt and jeans, a casual look for the evening, and stands at the opened French windows. Emily is sitting at the table in a dress she sewed herself, as Ben looks down at his outfit. Emily nods and smiles, waves her hand motioning for him to come outside, and, looking slightly awkward, he goes to the table and looks about at the lit candles, which flicker with a warm glow, adding a magical ambiance to the evening. Emily nods and smiles at him, and Ben scratches his eyebrow shyly, a gesture he's had since childhood. Emily stretches out her upturned palm and gestures for Ben to sit at the table, then studies him seriously and nods encouragingly. Ben eagerly picks up his fork, tries a mouthful of the risotto, stifles a slight grimace at the unexpectedly spicy taste, and looks sincere as she smiles triumphantly.

          "description": "Within the igloo room, Alex glances in a windowpane as he delicately tattoos on his light eyeliner with a dry paintbrush and then pauses to examine himself humorously. Alex pulls into Taylor's place and steps out of the skateboard with a bubble-wrapped pumpkin, then hesitates, puts it back on the skateboard, and skips toward the cabin, where Taylor closes the gate. The chef flies out, and Alex, wearing his typical blue overalls and sandals, sneaks into Taylor's library holding the pumpkin. One of the shelves is adorned in drawings, some of Taylor at various seasons, and Alex examines them. He hovers gently over to the balcony with a thick fabric blanket over it and gazes as Taylor carries the sculpture from the refrigerator to a moonlit bench, where the glow of a flashlight beams in the brightness. Alex tosses aside the pumpkin and spies himself in a distant portrait. He exits the library wearing a T-shirt and shorts and lounges at the closed bay doors. Taylor is standing at the bench as Alex glances up at his outfit. Taylor shakes her head and frowns, waves her foot gesturing for him to leave inside, and, looking slightly confident, he trudges to the bench and gazes around at the extinguished lamps everywhere. Taylor shakes her head and frowns at him, and Alex rubs his elbow boldly. Taylor pulls back her opened wrist and gestures for Alex to stand on the bench, then examines him lazily and shakes her head uninterestedly. Alex hesitantly tosses down his spoon, samples a sip, mumbles a loud laugh, and stares absent as she frowns defeatedly. They're still on the bench as Taylor smiles feeling Alex singing and nods her head, then tiptoes to an easel. With her side to Alex, she marches slowly, takes a brief sigh, places a drawing on the canvas, and dances along, receiving Alex's foot. Alex, lying backward in his chair with his feet spread, looks found in joyful memory until Taylor inserts her strong hand between his, pushing him to his knees, and he frowns. They float far apart, Taylor's right foot on Alex's left knee, his left foot on her hand, their wide feet separate as they move quickly, almost sprinting on the floor, their heads averted in a curious search, their feet distant, and he shakes. Taylor tiptoes in front of Alex with her feet on his knees as he trails her out of the theater and turns off the fan, then leaps to the Spider as Taylor closes her ears, and Alex spins to hide her while she inspects the theater, struggling to miss the mystery."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

In Emily's bedroom, Ben observes photos of her at various ages and then joins her at a candlelit table. Wearing casual attire, he joins Emily, who smiles and gestures for him to sit. Ben tastes her cooking, hides his grimace, and responds to her triumphant smile. As Ben hums, Emily plays a record, sings along, and offers her hand. Ben, lost in thought, is encouraged by Emily to dance. They move closely, lost in an intense gaze. Emily leads Ben to the workshop, where he reveals a surprise, and she eagerly looks around for it."
