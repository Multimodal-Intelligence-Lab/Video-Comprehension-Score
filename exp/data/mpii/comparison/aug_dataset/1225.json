Ben pulls up at Emily's and gets out of the car with a gift-wrapped parcel, then reconsiders, puts it back in the car, and walks towards the house, where Emily opens the door. The nurse comes out, and Ben, wearing his customary gray suit and shirt and tie, enters Emily's bedroom carrying the gift. One of the walls is covered in photos, some of Emily at different ages, and Ben studies them. He moves slowly over to the window with a fine net curtain over it and watches as Emily carries the casserole from the oven to a candlelit table, where the flame of a tea light glows in the darkness. Ben puts down the box and catches sight of himself in a full-length mirror. He comes out of the bedroom wearing a polo shirt and jeans and stands at the opened French windows. Emily is sitting at the table as Ben looks down at his outfit. Emily nods and smiles, waves her hand motioning for him to come outside, and, looking slightly awkward, he goes to the table and looks about at the lit candles everywhere. Emily nods and smiles at him, and Ben scratches his eyebrow shyly. Emily stretches out her upturned palm and gestures for Ben to sit at the table, then studies him seriously and nods encouragingly. Ben eagerly picks up his fork, tries a mouthful, stifles a slight grimace, and looks sincere as she smiles triumphantly. They're still at the table as Emily frowns listening to Ben humming and shakes her head, then goes to a record player. With her back to Ben, she falters slightly, takes a deep breath, puts a record on the turntable, and sings along, offering Ben her hand. Ben, sitting forward in his seat with his hands clasped, looks lost in sad thought until Emily slides her slender hand between his, pulling him to his feet, and he smiles. They dance close together, Emily's left hand on Ben's right shoulder, his right hand on her back, their free hands clasped as they move slowly, almost dancing on the spot, their eyes locked in an intense gaze, their faces close, and he nods. Emily walks behind Ben with her hands on his shoulders as he leads her into the workshop and switches on the light, then goes to the Beast as Emily opens her eyes, and Ben turns to face her while she scans the workshop, trying to spot the surprise.",

Ben arrives at Emily's and exits the automobile with a gift-wrapped package, then rethinks, places it back in the automobile, and strides towards the dwelling, where Emily opens the portal. The caregiver emerges, and Ben, donning his usual gray suit and shirt and tie, enters Emily's chamber bearing the gift. One of the partitions is covered in photographs, some of Emily at various ages, and Ben examines them. He moves leisurely over to the casement with a delicate net drape over it and observes as Emily transports the casserole from the oven to an illuminated table, where the flame of a tea light flickers in the darkness. Ben places down the carton and catches sight of himself in a full-length looking glass. He exits the chamber wearing a polo shirt and jeans and stands at the opened French apertures. Emily is seated at the table as Ben glances down at his attire. Emily nods and grins, waves her hand signaling for him to come outside, and, appearing slightly uneasy, he approaches the table and glances around at the lit candles everywhere. Emily nods and grins at him, and Ben scratches his eyebrow bashfully. Emily extends her upturned palm and gestures for Ben to sit at the table, then examines him seriously and nods encouragingly. Ben eagerly picks up his fork, tries a bite, suppresses a slight wince, and looks genuine as she smiles triumphantly. They're still at the table as Emily frowns listening to Ben humming and shakes her head, then goes to a record player. With her back to Ben, she hesitates slightly, takes a deep breath, places a record on the turntable, and sings along, offering Ben her hand.

Out comes the nurse, and Emily's bedroom is entered by Ben, wearing his customary gray suit and shirt and tie, carrying the gift. Photos cover one of the walls, some of Emily at different ages, and they are studied by Ben. Slowly, he is moved by himself over to the window with a fine net curtain over it and watches as the casserole is carried by Emily from the oven to a candlelit table, where the tea light’s flame glows in the darkness. Down is put the box by Ben, and a full-length mirror catches sight of him. He comes out of the bedroom wearing a polo shirt and jeans and stands at the opened French windows. At the table sits Emily as his outfit is looked down at by Ben. Emily smiles, nods, and waves her hand motioning for him to come outside, and, looking slightly awkward, the table is gone to by him, and the lit candles everywhere are looked about at by him. Emily smiles and nods at him, and his eyebrow is scratched shyly by Ben. Her upturned palm is stretched out by Emily, and the table is gestured for Ben to sit at by her, then he is studied seriously by her and he is nodded at encouragingly. Eagerly, his fork is picked up by Ben, a mouthful is tried by him, a slight grimace is stifled by him, and sincere looks appear as she smiles triumphantly. At the table, they still sit as Ben is listened to humming by Emily who frowns and her head is shaken, then she goes to a record player. With her back to Ben, she slightly falters, a deep breath is taken by her, a record is put on the turntable by her, and she sings along, offering her hand to Ben. His seat is sat forward in by Ben with his hands clasped, looking lost in sad thought until Emily’s slender hand is slid between his and he is pulled to his feet by her, and he smiles.

Later, Ben arrives at Emily's charming house, pulling up in his reliable car with a gift-wrapped parcel securely held in his hand. He hesitates, reconsiders his decision, and places the neatly wrapped parcel back in the car before summoning the courage to make his way towards the house. As he approaches, Emily opens the door to warmly greet him. A nurse, clad in her uniform, exits the house, and Ben, dressed in his customary gray suit, complete with a well-chosen shirt and tie, makes his entrance into Emily's bedroom, once again carrying the gift. One of the walls in the room is adorned with an impressive array of photographs, capturing Emily at various memorable stages of her life, and Ben takes a moment to study them thoughtfully and appreciatively.

Ben places the box down and catches a glimpse of himself in a full-length mirror. Emerging from the bedroom, now dressed in a relaxed casual polo shirt and a pair of comfortable jeans, he stands at the open French windows.

Ben pulls up at Emily's house, a charming Victorian home known for its bright red front door, and gets out of the car with a gift-wrapped parcel, then reconsiders, puts it back in the car, and walks towards the house, where Emily, who is known for her collection of rare houseplants, opens the door. The nurse, a familiar face in the neighborhood for her compassionate care, comes out, and Ben, wearing his customary gray suit and shirt and tie, enters Emily's bedroom carrying the gift. One of the walls is covered in photos, some of Emily at different ages, capturing her love for travel with snapshots from her adventures around Europe, and Ben studies them. He moves slowly over to the window with a fine net curtain over it and watches as Emily carries the casserole filled with her famous mushroom risotto from the oven to a candlelit table, where the flame of a tea light, purchased during a memorable trip to the local flea market, glows in the darkness. Ben puts down the box and catches sight of himself in a full-length mirror, a vintage piece from the 1920s with a carved wooden frame. He comes out of the bedroom wearing a polo shirt and jeans, a casual look for the evening, and stands at the opened French windows. Emily is sitting at the table in a dress she sewed herself, as Ben looks down at his outfit. Emily nods and smiles, waves her hand motioning for him to come outside, and, looking slightly awkward, he goes to the table and looks about at the lit candles, which flicker with a warm glow, adding a magical ambiance to the evening. Emily nods and smiles at him, and Ben scratches his eyebrow shyly, a gesture he's had since childhood. Emily stretches out her upturned palm and gestures for Ben to sit at the table, then studies him seriously and nods encouragingly. Ben eagerly picks up his fork, tries a mouthful of the risotto, stifles a slight grimace at the unexpectedly spicy taste, and looks sincere as she smiles triumphantly. They're still at the table as Emily frowns listening to Ben humming a tune from his college days and shakes her head, then goes to a record player, a classic model she inherited from her grandparents. With her back to Ben, she falters slightly, takes a deep breath, puts a record on the turntable, and sings along, offering Ben her hand.

The firefighter emerges, and the screwdriver, wearing its standard red jacket and scarf and cap, enters the cucumber's attic carrying the sculpture. One of the ceilings is covered in sketches, some of the cucumber at different sizes, and the screwdriver examines them. It moves slowly over to the jar with a thin mesh blanket over it and observes as the cucumber transports the stew from the kiln to a lantern-lit countertop, where the flicker of a candle illuminates in the shadows. The screwdriver places down the painting and glimpses itself in a wide-angle watercolor. It emerges from the attic wearing a cardigan and slacks and stands at the ajar sliding doors. The cucumber is reclining at the countertop as the screwdriver looks down at its ensemble. The cucumber nods and grins, waves its finger motioning for it to step outside, and, appearing somewhat clumsy, it approaches the countertop and gazes around at the lit torches everywhere. The cucumber nods and grins at it, and the screwdriver rubs its chin bashfully. The cucumber stretches out its upturned tentacle and gestures for the screwdriver to perch at the countertop, then examines it earnestly and nods encouragingly. The screwdriver eagerly lifts its spoon, tastes a nibble, suppresses a slight grimace, and looks sincere as it grins triumphantly. They're still at the countertop as the cucumber scowls listening to the screwdriver whistling and shakes its head, then approaches a gramophone. With its back to the screwdriver, it stumbles slightly, inhales deeply, places a disc on the platter, and sings along, extending the screwdriver its limb. The screwdriver, leaning forward in its perch with its gadgets clasped, looks absorbed in somber reflection until the cucumber slides its slender limb between its, tugging it to its stance, and it grins.

The cucumber strides behind the screwdriver with its limbs on its shoulders as it guides it into the observatory and flicks on the glow, then approaches the Leviathan as the cucumber widens its eyes, and the screwdriver spins to meet it while it examines the observatory, attempting to discern the surprise."

A jester bursts forward, and the cat, adorned in its usual striped sweater and slippers, charges into the knight's chamber clutching the trinket. One of the walls is adorned with paintings, some of the castle in different seasons, and the cat inspects them. It glides slowly over to the balcony with a thick velvet curtain over it and observes as the knight transports the pie from the furnace to a shadowy table, where the flicker of a lantern dances in the dusk. The cat lays down the parcel and glimpses its reflection in a grand mirror. It emerges from the chamber dressed in overalls and boots and hovers at the open patio doors. The knight is reclining at the counter as the cat examines its attire. The knight gestures with a wink, sweeps an arm signaling for it to venture outside, and, appearing a bit clumsy, it approaches the counter and gazes around at the glowing lamps everywhere.

Alex pulls into Taylor's place and steps out of the skateboard with a bubble-wrapped pumpkin, then hesitates, puts it back on the skateboard, and skips toward the cabin, where Taylor closes the gate. The chef flies out, and Alex, wearing his typical blue overalls and sandals, sneaks into Taylor's library holding the pumpkin. One of the shelves is adorned in drawings, some of Taylor at various seasons, and Alex examines them. He hovers gently over to the balcony with a thick fabric blanket over it and gazes as Taylor carries the sculpture from the refrigerator to a moonlit bench, where the glow of a flashlight beams in the brightness. Alex tosses aside the pumpkin and spies himself in a distant portrait. He exits the library wearing a T-shirt and shorts and lounges at the closed bay doors. Taylor is standing at the bench as Alex glances up at his outfit. Taylor shakes her head and frowns, waves her foot gesturing for him to leave inside, and, looking slightly confident, he trudges to the bench and gazes around at the extinguished lamps everywhere. Taylor shakes her head and frowns at him, and Alex rubs his elbow boldly. Taylor pulls back her opened wrist and gestures for Alex to stand on the bench, then examines him lazily and shakes her head uninterestedly. Alex hesitantly tosses down his spoon, samples a sip, mumbles a loud laugh, and stares absent as she frowns defeatedly. They're still on the bench as Taylor smiles feeling Alex singing and nods her head, then tiptoes to an easel. With her side to Alex, she marches slowly, takes a brief sigh, places a drawing on the canvas, and dances along, receiving Alex's foot. Alex, lying backward in his chair with his feet spread, looks found in joyful memory until Taylor inserts her strong hand between his, pushing him to his knees, and he frowns. They float far apart, Taylor's right foot on Alex's left knee, his left foot on her hand, their wide feet separate as they move quickly, almost sprinting on the floor, their heads averted in a curious search, their feet distant, and he shakes. Taylor tiptoes in front of Alex with her feet on his knees as he trails her out of the theater and turns off the fan, then leaps to the Spider as Taylor closes her ears, and Alex spins to hide her while she inspects the theater, struggling to miss the mystery."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
