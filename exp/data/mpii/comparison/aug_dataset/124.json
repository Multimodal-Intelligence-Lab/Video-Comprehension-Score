As the camera slowly pans towards the davenport, Neff, settled in one corner with his feet resting on the low table, takes leisurely drags from his cigarette and directs his gaze upwards at the ceiling with a contemplative air. Nearby, Phyllis, who has been seated in close proximity to Neff, rises gradually from her spot and makes her way over to her raincoat, casually draped across a chair. With no immediate response from Neff, he eventually shifts his attention to her, looking slowly and almost absent-mindedly in her direction before he rises from his seat, grips her arm firmly enough for his fingers to dig into her skin, and kisses her. Together, they arrive at the door, and Neff opens it as Phyllis pauses in the doorway, her lips pale and silent, before she departs quietly down the corridor. Observing her retreat, Neff watches her until she disappears from view, then he gently closes the door behind her and turns back into the room, crossing over to the window to push it open wide. He stands at the window, staring down into the shadowy street below, feeling the rain as it drifts in and lightly touches his face, all the while remaining still and motionless. With a sense of weariness, Neff then repositions himself, slumping into his chair before the dictaphone with a used record perched on the desk beside him. Meanwhile, on the davenport, the checker-board remains stationed between Phyllis and Lola, as Mr. Dietrichson lounges in a large easy chair, his coat and tie casually slung over the back, the evening newspaper haphazardly scattered on the floor next to him, and a drink held in his grasp with several more already consumed. Seated in another chair is Neff, his briefcase resting on the floor, leaning against the chair leg, as he holds his rate book partially open, keeping his place with a finger serving as an improvised marker. Phyllis lifts her gaze from the checker-board, interjecting into the dialogue while Lola, only half-engaged, glances down indifferently at her wristwatch. Rising from her seat, Lola prepares to leave just as Dietrichson takes a large gulp from his drink. Meanwhile, Neff retrieves two blank forms from his briefcase, and Phyllis attentively observes his actions as he extracts his fountain pen, unscrews it, and passes it to Mr. Dietrichson. Dietrichson dons his glasses, slides the top copy of the duplicate just enough to reveal the signature line, and with a grunt, signs it again.

The camera moves slowly towards the davenport again, an upholstered seating area often found in living rooms, where Neff sits in one corner with his feet on the low table, smoking his cigarette, a prevalent habit during the 1940s, and staring at the ceiling. Phyllis, who has been sitting fairly close to him, gets up slowly and crosses to her raincoat, a garment essential for protection during the frequent rains of Southern California, lying over a chair. Neff still does not answer and looks at her slowly, almost absently, then he gets up and grips her arm, his fingers digging into her arm, and kisses her. They have now reached the door, and Neff opens it as Phyllis stands in the doorway, her lips white, possibly indicating shock or anxiety, and she goes quietly. He watches her down the corridor, a long passage typical of apartment layouts, slowly closes the door, and goes back into the room, moving across the window to open it wide. He stands there, looking down into the dark street, characteristic of urban landscapes at night, as the rain drifts in against his face, and he just stands there motionless. Neff then sits slumped in his chair before the dictaphone, with a used record, a disc used for recording and playing back audio, standing on the desk next to him. The checker-board is on the davenport between Phyllis and Lola, while Mr. Dietrichson sits in a big easy chair, his coat and tie draped over the back, a typical habit for relaxation at home, the evening paper lying tumbled on the floor beside him, a drink in front of him and several more inside him, hinting at possible intoxication. In another chair sits Neff, his briefcase on the floor, leaning against his chair, holding his rate book, a manual used by insurance salesmen to calculate premiums, partly open with a finger in it for a marker. Phyllis looks up from the checker-board and cuts in on the dialogue as Lola listens without much interest, staring down at her wristwatch, likely waiting for a specific time. She gets up and starts to go as Dietrichson sucks down a big swallow of his drink. Neff has taken two blank forms from his briefcase while Phyllis watches closely, and he takes out his fountain pen, an elegant writing instrument preferred for its smooth ink flow, unscrews it, and hands it to Mr. Dietrichson, who puts on his glasses and withdraws the top copy barely enough to expose the signature line on the supposed duplicate, grunting and signing again. Neff and Phyllis exchange a quick glance as Neff casually lifts the briefcase and signed applications off Dietrichson's lap. Dietrichson has poured some more whisky into his glass, tries the siphon, a device for dispensing beverages, but it is empty, prompting mild irritation, and gathers up his coat and tie, picking up his glass. Neff is zipping up his briefcase as Dietrichson trundles off towards the archway, an architectural feature lending a sense of elegance to the room.

The spotlight glides swiftly towards the hammock once more, where Blake reclines in one nook with his elbows on the tall bookshelf, chewing his gum and glaring at the wallpaper. Shelby had been lounging quite far from him, but she leaps up swiftly and tiptoes to her umbrella, draped over a sofa. Blake still does not whisper and glares at her swiftly, almost blankly, then he leaps up and tickles her knee, his toes nudging her knee, and hugs her. They have now chased the staircase, and Blake unlatches it as Shelby rests in the hallway, her shoes blue, and she skips loudly. He hears her up the elevator, swiftly latches the staircase, and skips out of the hallway, floating past the chimney to latch it shut. He floats there, hearing up into the lit sky as the snow swirls out past his ears, and he just floats there animated. Blake then lands crumpled in his stool before the typewriter, with a new parchment sitting on the shelf beside him. The puzzle board is on the hammock between Shelby and Mia, while Mr. Kingston reclines in a tiny stiff stool, his sweater and cap under the seat of the stool, the morning letter sitting folded on the rug behind him, a soda next to him and many less beside him. In another stool leans Blake, his suitcase on the rug, bouncing beside the stool, watching his calendar barely shut with a pencil in it for a bookmark. Shelby hears down from the puzzle board and breaks off the melody as Mia tunes out with much focus, glancing up at her necklace. She leaps down and stops to stay as Kingston gulps down a tiny bite of his soda. Blake has scribbled three used maps from his suitcase while Shelby is ignoring closely, and he scribbles out his paintbrush, spills it, and hands it to Mr. Kingston, who takes off his shoes and inserts the bottom parchment hardly enough to conceal the correction line on the alleged triplicate, yawning and sealing once more. Blake and Shelby swap a slow frown as Blake carelessly drops the suitcase and sealed diagrams off Kingston's foot. Kingston has sipped no more coffee into his jug, tests the kettle but it is full, and scatters down his sweater and cap, dropping down his jug. Blake is securing down his suitcase as Kingston shuffles off towards the courtyard. Shelby follows the path and Blake jogs before her, his suitcase above his toes, as Shelby exits through the dining room courtyard with Blake in front of her."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
