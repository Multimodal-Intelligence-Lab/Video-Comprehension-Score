Umbridge steps back nervously and wags a finger. They have bows and arrows, and she deflects an arrow. She points her wand, and a centaur falls, a strangling rope around its throat, as it writhes and thrashes. Hermione tries to release it, but Umbridge is lifted into the air by Gwarp.

Harry overtakes Hermione as the worn end of Gwarp's cord rests on the ground. Umbridge is filthy and unkempt when shadowy creatures emerge amongst the trees. Umbridge steps back anxiously and wags a finger. They have bows and arrows, and she deflects an arrow. She gestures her wand, and a centaur falls, a choking cord around its throat, as it writhes and thrashes. Hermione endeavors to release it, but Umbridge is elevated into the air by Gwarp. The centaurs charge, launching arrows, and pierced by arrows, Gwarp releases Umbridge. The centaurs seize her, and she is carried off. They sprint back through the forest towards Hogwarts, where Neville, Luna, Ginny, and Ron rush to meet them. Harry confronts his companions, and they, along with Hermione, Neville, Luna, Ginny, and Ron, ascend above the pine forest astride the leathery back of a thestral. Harry grips on firmly and glances around at his comrades, and flying close behind, Luna gives him a cheerful smile. The thestrals soar through the turbulent night buffeted by powerful winds, and finally, the familiar lights of Canary Wharf and the twisting River Thames emerge below them. They race through the vacant Ministry of Magic towards a long corridor lined with glossy black tiles. Harry advances cautiously, and the others follow him along the black corridor towards the blue door at the far end. Inside is a shadowy storeroom full of high, wooden racks, and they hold up their illuminated wands. Positioned on the numbered racks are thousands of cloudy glass orbs as the door behind them slides away. The rows of glass orbs fill the racks, which stand close together and extend upwards high above their heads. By the light of his wand, Harry examines the long, dark passages between the racks and halts to shine his wand down onto the vacant floor. He rotates to his companions, as Neville is reading a label on a rack beneath one of the orbs. As Harry strides towards it, the orb commences to glow, illuminating the swirling mist within it, and Harry extends out and lifts it down. Harry steps in front of his comrades, and they move closer together as a masked Death Eater approaches slowly along the passage. Lucius Malfoy unmasks, and Harry restrains Neville as dark figures approach down the passageways. The masked figures draw nearer, and the companions dash for it, but Lucius appears in front of them, so they turn back. Luna is knocked down, but she elevates her wand, and her attacker vanishes. Neville stuns a Death Eater, and Luna pulls him away as more Death Eaters appear to obstruct the passages. Pursued, Hermione flicks her wand, and glass orbs shatter down onto their pursuers."

Umbridge, now appearing dirty and disheveled, finds herself in a tense situation as shadowy creatures begin to emerge from the dense trees surrounding her. Feeling a surge of nervousness, she takes a step back and wags a finger in a futile attempt to assert control.

She then points her wand with intent, causing a centaur to fall to the ground, a strangling rope tightening around its throat as it writhes and thrashes in distress. Hermione, driven by a desire to help, attempts to release the centaur, but before she can succeed, Gwarp intervenes by lifting Umbridge into the air.

With determination, Umbridge, who recently became Hogwarts’ controversial Defense Against the Dark Arts professor, raises her wand in the Forbidden Forest, a dense and ancient woodland home to many magical creatures. Harry catches up with Hermione as the frayed end of Gwarp's rope lies on the ground, a giant roughly the height of a small building. Umbridge is dirty and disheveled when shadowy creatures, centaurs known for their wisdom and archery skills, appear amongst the trees. Umbridge steps back nervously and wags a finger. They have bows and arrows, typically crafted from the strong wood of the forest, and she deflects an arrow. She points her wand, and a centaur falls, a strangling rope, a magical construct intended for restraint, around its throat, as it writhes and thrashes. Hermione tries to release it, but Umbridge is lifted into the air by Gwarp, the giant with a gentle demeanor despite his size. The centaurs charge, firing arrows, and pierced by arrows, Gwarp drops Umbridge. The centaurs grab her, and she is carried off, likely to face their own brand of justice. They run back through the forest towards Hogwarts, the renowned school of witchcraft and wizardry, where Neville, Luna, Ginny, and Ron run to meet them. Harry faces his friends, and they, along with Hermione, Neville, Luna, Ginny, and Ron, soar above the pine forest astride the leathery back of a thestral, a winged horse that can only be seen by those who have witnessed death.

He turns to his friends, as Neville is reading a label, usually inscribed with the name of the prophecy's subject, on a shelf beneath one of the spheres. As Harry walks towards it, the sphere starts to glow, illuminating the swirling mist, a magical record of foresight, inside it, and Harry reaches out and lifts it down. Harry steps in front of his friends, and they move closer together as a masked Death Eater, followers of Lord Voldemort with a penchant for dark magic, approaches slowly along the passage. Lucius Malfoy, a member of a wealthy and influential pure-blood family known for their support of Voldemort, unmasks, and Harry holds Neville back as dark figures approach down the passageways. The masked figures draw closer, and the friends run for it, but Lucius appears in front of them, so they turn back. Luna is knocked down, but she raises her wand, and her attacker vanishes, probably disoriented by her spell.

          "description": "The cat pivots to leave, and the chef pivots back and lowers his monocle. With whimsy, the detective lowers her umbrella in the Forbidden City. John catches up with Alice as the tattered edge of the bear's scarf lays on the pavement. The detective is muddy and rumpled when luminous phantoms emerge amongst the skyscrapers. The detective steps forward boldly and swings a lantern. They have spears and swords, and she blocks a spear. She waves her umbrella, and a goblin tumbles, a sizzling chain around its ankle, as it flails and kicks. Alice tries to unshackle it, but the detective is hoisted into the sky by the bear. The goblins advance, throwing spears, and skewered by spears, the bear releases the detective. The goblins seize her, and she is spirited away. They sprint back through the jungle towards the theme park, where Sam, Chloe, Lily, and Paul dash to join them. John greets his allies, and they, along with Alice, Sam, Chloe, Lily, and Paul, sail above the bamboo canopy astride the velvety wings of a dragonfly. John grips tightly and glances at his comrades, and hovering close by, Chloe sends him a cheerful grin. The dragonflies sail through the sunny morning caressed by gentle breezes, and at last, the distant lights of the Eiffel Tower and the meandering River Seine come into view below them. They dash through the abandoned Palace of Wisdom towards a narrow hallway lined with glossy white tiles. John advances confidently, and the others trail him along the white hallway towards the red gate at the far end. Inside is a glowing cellar stacked with low, iron trunks, and they raise their blazing flashlights. Resting on the numbered trunks are dozens of clear crystal eggs as the gate behind them drifts away. The lines of crystal eggs cover the trunks, which rest close together and rise upwards far above their heads. By the glow of his flashlight, John explores the short, bright aisles between the trunks and pauses to shine his flashlight down onto the polished carpet. He turns to his allies, as Sam is inspecting a tag on a trunk beneath one of the eggs. As John drifts towards it, the egg begins to shimmer, illuminating the spinning fog inside it, and John reaches over and plucks it down. John stands in front of his allies, and they huddle closer as a cloaked ghost hovers slowly along the aisle. Arthur Weasley unveils, and John restrains Sam as pale shapes glide down the aisles. The cloaked shapes drift closer, and the allies dart for it, but Arthur materializes before them, so they retreat. Chloe is bowled over, but she lifts her flashlight, and her assailant dissolves. Sam freezes a ghost, and Chloe tugs him away as additional ghosts glide to seal the aisles. Pursued, Alice swishes her flashlight, and crystal eggs shatter onto their pursuers."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
