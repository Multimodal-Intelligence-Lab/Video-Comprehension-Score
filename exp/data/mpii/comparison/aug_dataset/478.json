Close-up on the pages, then another page - the title page - written in Mozart’s hand. Close-up on Salieri, who stares amazed. They all sit, save Mozart, as the room suddenly looks like a tribunal with all eyes on the Emperor. Joseph nods, and Mozart falls to his knees, giggling. Mozart sits on stage at a harpsichord rehearsing the singers taking the parts of Figaro and Susanna in the opening bars of the first act of The Marriage of Figaro, as Figaro measures the space for his bed on the floor, singing, with Susanna looking on, trying on the Countess’ hat. Orsini-Rosenberg and Bonno sit with Salieri, and the company disperses, curious. The musicians look at Orsini-Rosenberg, to whom Mozart hands the score from which he is conducting. Mozart then rips out a page, and Bonno watches in terror as he goes on tearing the pages determinedly. A servant opens the door to announce, and Mozart grabs Salieri, kisses his hand, and giggles with relief and gratitude. The Emperor stealthily enters with Von Strack, his finger to his lips, motions everyone not to rise, and slips into a chair behind Salieri, Orsini-Rosenberg, and Bonno. The three conspirators look at each other wide-eyed. The recitativo summons up the march, but instead, there is silence, leaving everyone on stage looking lost, though they attempt to continue the story for a while. Consternation grows on the faces of the conspirators. Mozart glances back at the group seated in the theatre as the Emperor finally speaks in a whisper. Mozart strains to hear what they are saying but cannot, and we observe them. Orsini-Rosenberg acknowledges his defeat and rises to go down to where Mozart sits anxiously with the musicians, watching his approach.

He bows too, giggling, as Cavalieri, in a mythological Persian costume, bows to the rapturous throng below her, including Salieri. The Emperor, Von Strack, Orsini-Rosenberg, Bonno, and Von Swieten are seen applauding, then suddenly close-up on Mozart standing in a box and clapping wildly. Behind him, seated, are Schikaneder and the three girls previously seen in Mozart’s apartment. Close-up on Salieri staring fixedly at Mozart, with Mozart still clapping, apparently with tremendous enthusiasm, and Salieri bows his head.",

Stationed at Mozart’s table, littered with compositions, he lifts Mozart’s quill and caresses the plume, touches the inkpot, and furtively lifts them. Close-up on the sheets, then another sheet - the heading sheet - inscribed in Mozart’s script. Close-up on Salieri, who gazes astounded. They all sit, except Mozart, as the room suddenly resembles a tribunal with all gazes on the Emperor. Joseph nods, and Mozart collapses to his knees, chuckling. Mozart sits on platform at a harpsichord practicing the vocalists assuming the roles of Figaro and Susanna in the commencing measures of the initial act of The Marriage of Figaro, as Figaro gauges the area for his couch on the ground, singing, with Susanna observing, trying on the Countess’ bonnet. Orsini-Rosenberg and Bonno sit with Salieri, and the assembly disperses, inquisitive. The instrumentalists gaze at Orsini-Rosenberg, to whom Mozart hands the score from which he is directing. Mozart then pulls out a sheet, and Bonno observes in dread as he continues tearing the sheets resolutely. A servant opens the portal to declare, and Mozart seizes Salieri, kisses his hand, and chuckles with relief and thankfulness. The Emperor silently enters with Von Strack, his finger to his lips, signals everyone not to rise, and slips into a seat behind Salieri, Orsini-Rosenberg, and Bonno. The trio of plotters gaze at one another wide-eyed. The recitative calls up the procession, but instead, there is quiet, leaving everyone on platform appearing lost, though they attempt to persist with the narrative for a while. Dismay escalates on the countenances of the plotters. Mozart glances back at the group seated in the theater as the Emperor finally speaks in a murmur. Mozart strains to hear what they are saying but cannot, and we watch them. Orsini-Rosenberg concedes his defeat and rises to descend to where Mozart sits apprehensively with the instrumentalists, observing his approach. Close-up on Salieri in his box, tears on his cheeks as he observes the ensemble and listens for a prolonged moment. He inclines too, chuckling, as Cavalieri, in a legendary Persian attire, inclines to the ecstatic crowd beneath her, including Salieri. The Emperor, Von Strack, Orsini-Rosenberg, Bonno, and Von Swieten are seen cheering, then suddenly close-up on Mozart standing in a box and applauding exuberantly. Behind him, seated, are Schikaneder and the three maidens previously seen in Mozart’s apartment. Close-up on Salieri gazing intently at Mozart, with Mozart still applauding, apparently with immense zeal, and Salieri inclines his head."

With great reverence and careful observation, he picks up various objects one by one: first, he lifts a billiard ball, feeling its weight in his hand, then moves on to a discarded wig, running his fingers lightly over the strands before setting it aside. Next, he finds a sock and inspects its fabric, followed by a buckle, which he turns over thoughtfully. Gradually, his gaze shifts to items of greater personal significance. He approaches Mozart's desk, where manuscripts lie scattered in creative disarray. Standing there, he lifts Mozart’s pen, gently stroking its feather quill with a contemplative touch, then he reaches for the inkstand, brushing its surface before discretely picking it up. His eyes focus intensely on the pages before him, flipping to another until he arrives at the title page, upon which is Mozart’s own handwriting. A close-up shows Salieri's face as he stares in amazement, his expression one of awe and intrigue. Suddenly, the room transforms into what resembles a tribunal setting, with everyone seated, except for Mozart. All eyes are fixated on the Emperor, whose subtle nod prompts Mozart to fall to his knees while giggling, a blend of reverence and amusement. Mozart then sits on stage, positioned at a harpsichord, where he immerses himself in rehearsing the singers performing as Figaro and Susanna, as they launch into the opening bars of the first act of The Marriage of Figaro. Figaro, focused on his task, measures the space for his bed on the floor, singing in character, while Susanna watches, trying on the Countess’ hat with interest. Seated nearby are Orsini-Rosenberg and Bonno, joined by Salieri, all observing with curiosity as the company of performers disperses. The musicians direct their attention to Orsini-Rosenberg, to whom Mozart, filled with intent, hands the score he is using to conduct. Demonstrating a sudden burst of action, Mozart tears out a page from the score, and Bonno, shocked, watches in silent terror as Mozart continues to determinedly rip the pages. As this unfolds, a servant enters the room to make an announcement, prompting Mozart to react suddenly by grabbing Salieri, kissing his hand with an overwhelming sense of relief and gratitude, accompanied by a light giggle.

          "description": "Dugong enters the secret garden of Leonardo and glides slowly into the 'sanctum of sanctums,' picking up curios with great awe - a chess piece, an old helmet, a mitten, and a button - then trinkets more pivotal to him. Perched at Galileo’s workbench, scattered with blueprints, he picks up Galileo’s stylus and caresses the bristles, touches the sapphire jar, and sneakily pockets them. Close-up on the blueprints, then another parchment - the cover leaf - scribbled in Galileo’s script. Close-up on Dugong, who gapes astonished. They all float, except Galileo, as the garden suddenly seems like a council with all eyes on the Sultan. Charles nods, and Galileo flops to his belly, snickering. Galileo lounges on a rooftop at a typewriter practicing the dancers taking the roles of Hamlet and Ophelia in the overture of the initial act of The Comedy of Hamlet, as Hamlet quantifies the section for his hammock on the rooftop, crooning, with Ophelia observing, donning the Duchess’ scarf. Leonardo-Da-Vinci and Raphael lounge with Dugong, and the troupe dissipates, intrigued. The choreographers peer at Leonardo-Da-Vinci, to whom Galileo passes the draft from which he is orchestrating. Galileo then pulls out a parchment, and Raphael observes in horror as he continues slicing the sheets resolutely. A porter swings open the gate to proclaim, and Galileo embraces Dugong, shakes his flipper, and snickers with solace and gratefulness. The Sultan sneakily glides in with Von Bismarck, his finger to his ears, gestures everyone not to hover, and slips onto a mat behind Dugong, Leonardo-Da-Vinci, and Raphael. The three schemers glance at one another wide-eyed. The recitative conjures up the parade, but instead, there is stillness, leaving everyone on the rooftop appearing bewildered, though they struggle to persist with the tale for a while. Distress intensifies on the expressions of the schemers. Galileo peers back at the ensemble seated in the garden as the Sultan finally murmurs in a hush. Galileo strains to discern what they are murmuring but is unable, and we perceive them. Leonardo-Da-Vinci concedes his loss and ascends to descend to where Galileo reclines worriedly with the choreographers, observing his approach. Close-up on Dugong in his perch, droplets on his fins as he observes the ensemble and listens for a lengthy spell. He salutes too, chortling, as Medusa, in a fabled Egyptian garb, salutes the ecstatic swarm beneath her, including Dugong. The Sultan, Von Bismarck, Leonardo-Da-Vinci, Raphael, and Von Beethoven are observed cheering, then abruptly close-up on Galileo perched in a perch and applauding vigorously. Behind him, seated, are Davinci and the triplet swans previously seen in Galileo’s aviary. Close-up on Dugong gazing intently at Galileo, with Galileo still clapping, apparently with boundless eagerness, and Dugong bows his snout."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

          "description": "Salieri enters Mozart’s quarters with reverence, inspecting personal items before focusing on Mozart's manuscripts and pen. In a tribunal-like setting, the Emperor nods, prompting Mozart to fall to his knees, giggling. Mozart rehearses The Marriage of Figaro, ripping pages from the score, shocking Bonno. When the Emperor stealthily enters with Von Strack, the conspirators look on, wide-eyed. The silence during a recitative causes consternation among them. As Orsini-Rosenberg approaches Mozart, Salieri watches tearfully. The Emperor and others applaud, with Mozart clapping enthusiastically, while Salieri observes him, bowing his head in a mix of emotions."
