The scene shifts to recount earlier sports highlights, showcasing football, baseball, and basketball events. In every one of these, Edward consistently surpasses Don, performing at a level so remarkable that it leaves Edward himself in a state of sheer astonishment at his unexpected triumphs. Gathering every ounce of strength within him, Edward turns away and carefully descends the steps at the front. Meanwhile, she lingers in the doorway, standing there for a few more moments, genuinely feeling a profound sense of regret and sorrow about the events that have unfolded. After those fleeting moments pass, she slowly retreats back indoors. Our focus shifts to Edward as he walks on, tears just beginning to well up in his eyes, eventually disappearing from the frame, leaving only the sorority house as the backdrop. Edward reappears in the frame, glancing back towards the sorority house, and as the camera encircles him, he lets out a shout. Inside, Sandra and her sorority sisters peer out through the curtains, while the tweedy economics professor continues delivering his lecture. However, Sandra‚Äôs mind is elsewhere, and she is not paying much attention to the lecture. The professor, obliviously switching on the overhead projector without even glancing at it, inadvertently provokes quiet laughter from the students. It isn‚Äôt until a classmate gently nudges Sandra, prompting her to look up, that the professor finally notices the writing projected there. Carrying her books, Sandra walks on, shaking her head in disbelief, and we shift our gaze upward to the vast, expansive blue sky where a giant heart, written in the sky, drifts serenely in the wind. At the urging of her sisters, a freshly awakened Sandra peers out from the second-story window and is taken aback to find the lawn adorned with Edward standing amidst a sea of vibrant flowers. Sandra steps out to meet him, her emotions a whirlwind of confusion, joy, and fear, and quite unexpectedly, a single tear trickles down her cheek. Meanwhile, from down the street, the adult Don Price makes his entrance, weighing in at a formidable 230 pounds of robust, football-playing, Skynyrd-loving, fraternity-proud muscle, and his anger is visibly palpable. Trailing behind him are a group of his fraternity brothers, and in a sudden burst of rage, Don Price punches Edward, knocking him to the ground. Yet, Edward immediately gets back up, not making any attempt to defend himself, and seeming completely unfazed; with each hit from Don, Edward simply shrugs it off, but Don continues to beat Edward mercilessly. As the brutal beating continues relentlessly, we see a parallel scene with Don Price sitting grimly on the toilet, engrossed in reading the latest issue of Playboy, straining intensely, trying to achieve the impossible. Without warning, he clutches his chest and collapses face-first onto the cold tile floor, and the identical haunting image of Don's lifeless face on the tile is mirrored in The Eye as the thrashing persists. Against all odds, Edward somehow manages to struggle back to his feet, preparing himself once more for another fall. Just as Don is about to strike Edward again, his attention is diverted by the sight of Sandra removing her engagement ring. The sound of an audible gasp, \"AHH!\" emanates from her sisters, while an \"OHH!\" escapes from Don's fraternity brothers, leaving Don standing there, utterly stunned, his mind spinning. Despite his eyes being almost swollen shut, Edward continues to brace himself for yet another punch as she reaches out to hand him the ring. Another moment hangs in the air, then Don storms off in a huff, and Sandra leans tenderly over Edward's battered and bruised body, his head resting gently among the daffodils. As the music swells and crescendos with intensity, Edward reaches for his glass of water, but Josephine is already by his side, holding it for him with care."

Summoning all his remaining strength, Edward turns away and begins to descend the front steps, each step deliberate and heavy with emotion, while she lingers in the doorway for a few moments, her heart weighed down by genuine remorse for the events that have transpired, before she eventually retreats back inside. We follow Edward as he continues his walk, his pace slow and burdened, tears beginning to well up in his eyes as he moves out of the frame, leaving the sorority house as the sole backdrop. Edward reappears in the frame, his gaze fixed on the sorority house, and as we circle around him, he raises his voice in a shout. Inside, Sandra and her sisters peek through the curtains, their curiosity piqued, while the tweedy economics professor carries on with his lecture, oblivious to Sandra's lack of attention. He absentmindedly switches on the overhead projector, eliciting a ripple of laughter from the students, which he fails to notice until a classmate nudges Sandra, prompting her to look up, and only then does the professor become aware of the writing on the projector. As Sandra walks with her books, she shakes her head in disbelief, and we shift our gaze to the expansive blue sky where a giant heart, crafted from skywriting, drifts gently in the wind. At the urging of her sisters, a groggy Sandra peers out from the second-story window to discover the lawn below, awash with flowers, and Edward standing amidst them. Sandra steps out to meet him, her emotions a complex mix of confusion, joy, and fear, and unexpectedly, a tear slips down her cheek. From down the street, the adult Don Price approaches, his imposing 230-pound frame, honed by football and fueled by a love for Skynyrd and fraternity pride, radiating anger. Accompanied by a group of his fraternity brothers, Don Price lands a punch on Edward, sending him to the ground. Edward rises immediately, making no attempt to defend himself, seemingly unfazed, as Don strikes him again, then nonchalantly continues to pummel Edward with relentless force. As the beating persists, we catch a glimpse of Don Price in a different setting, sitting on the toilet, engrossed in the latest issue of Playboy, straining with all his might to accomplish the impossible. Abruptly, he clutches his chest and collapses forward, his face meeting the cold tile floor, and this image of Don's lifeless face is mirrored in The Eye as the thrashing continues. Despite the odds, Edward manages to struggle back to his feet, bracing himself for another blow, and just as Don is about to strike again, he pauses as Sandra removes her engagement ring. The sound of her sisters' collective gasp and the surprised exclamations from Don's brothers fill the air, leaving Don momentarily paralyzed, his mind struggling to process the scene. Edward, his eyes nearly swollen shut, remains poised for the next punch, but instead, Sandra extends the ring to him. A moment of silence ensues before Don storms off in a fit of frustration, and Sandra bends over Edward's battered body, his head resting gently on the daffodils. As the music swells to a dramatic peak, Edward reaches out for his glass of water, but Josephine is already there, handing it to him with care."

Edward somehow fights his way back to his feet, ready to be knocked down again, and Don is about to slug Edward again when he turns as Sandra pulls off her engagement ring, a symbol of commitment now broken. There's an audible AHH! from her sisters and an OHH! from Don's brothers, all deeply entrenched in the drama, and Don stands stunned, his mind reeling from the spectacle and its implications. Edward, whose eyes are swollen almost shut, keeps waiting for the next punch as she hands him the ring, an act of defiance and newfound love. Another beat passes, then Don storms off, and Sandra leans over Edward's broken body, his head lying on the daffodils, a flower long associated with rebirth and new beginnings.

          "description": "The young chef Brian waves his lantern at Harold, and a flashback of past chess, swimming, and golf highlights shows Harold outsmarts Brian every round, leaving Harold bewildered. With all the courage he can summon, he pivots and skips down the garden path while she lingers in the porchway for a few moments, feeling genuinely terrible for what's occurred, but eventually, she retreats inside. We guide Harold as he skips away, droplets just beginning to emerge, and he leaves the scene, leaving only the mansion in the distance. Harold hops back into the scene, gazing at the mansion, as we rotate and he hollers. Linda and her roommates peek out through the blinds while the quirky history lecturer resumes his monologue, but Linda isn't focusing much. He flicks on the desk lamp without glancing at it, eliciting a giggle from the audience, but he remains oblivious until a peer elbows Linda, who glances up and the lecturer finally acknowledges what's projected there. Strolling with her satchel, Linda nods to herself, incredulous, and we gaze up to the sunny heavens where a massive balloon-like star drifts in the breeze. At her roommates' urging, a freshly-awakened Linda glances out the attic window to discover the lawn populated with Harold standing amidst the plethora of blooms. Linda strides out to him, beaming, perplexed, elated, and frightened, and unexpectedly, a drop trickles down Linda's face. From up the avenue, the grown Archibald Swift arrives, 230 pounds of rugby-playing, Zeppelin-adoring, club-proud brawn, and he's furious. A posse of his comrades trail behind him, and Archibald clobbers him, toppling him over. Harold springs right back up but makes no attempt to shield himself, undeterred; Archibald punches him again, shrugs okay, then proceeds to wallop Harold's backside all week long, and as the beatdown progresses, we see Archibald Swift lounging in the parlor, reading the latest magazine, straining hard, trying to relax the unrelaxable. Abruptly, he clutches his throat and tumbles face-first onto the carpet, and the same image of Archibald's lifeless visage on the carpet is mirrored in The Reflection as the pummeling carries on. Harold somehow battles his way upright, braced to be toppled once more, and Archibald is about to wallop Harold again when he pivots as Linda removes her necklace. There's an audible GASP! from her roommates and an AHH! from Archibald's comrades, and Archibald stands dazed, his mind spinning. Harold, whose vision is nearly obscured, continues bracing for the ensuing blow as she offers him the necklace. Another heartbeat passes, then Archibald storms away, and Linda bends over Harold's battered form, his head resting on the tulips. As the symphony reaches a peak, Harold reaches for his cup of tea, but Emily already holds it for him."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby caf√©, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
