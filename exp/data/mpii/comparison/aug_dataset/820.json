In the back garden, a glass of champagne is handed to her by Molly, and a Crazy Golf windmill is there. Cal is floored by Bernie, and Bernie is pulled off Cal by Jacob, but Jacob is punched by Bernie, the sails of the windmill are wrenched off by him, and they are dropped. All four guys wrestle and struggle, tangled together, then they are fallen. On a wall, they are sat on side by side, an icepack being on David's cheek, as police officers arrive, and then they head off. Jacob laughs, and David and Bernie are turned by him to look at Cal before the police officers leave. A big sigh is taken by Emily, and the ground is stared at by Hannah and Jessica. Bernie is gotten up by Jessica, who nervously runs her fingers through her ponytail as Robbie watches them go, and she scurries after him. He gets up and around the corner he jogs after them, but then he stops. The end of the driveway is reached by Bernie, limping slightly, and Robbie is glanced back at by Jessica, looking ashamed. Robbie turns away and, dejectedly, he shuffles back, while the other three men remain sitting on the wall. Cal stands, and bitterly Emily smiles while shaking her head, and a frown filled with hurt is given by Hannah. Cal is gawked at by Emily, and Jacob is given a small nod by Hannah before he gets up. She wanders away, and he follows, as Cal is glared at by Emily, and Molly is seen coming out. Hannah and Jacob leave, and forward Robbie lets his head drop. With his brow furrowed, the ground is looked down at by Cal, and angrily he is eyed by Emily with her jaw clenched. Cal heads off, and her arms are folded by Emily. Cal approaches Robbie, who is leaning against the wall of the house. A smile and nod are given by Cal, and then he leaves. Molly sits down on the garden steps, her head being put in her hand, as Cal is lumbered down the driveway. At school, Robbie is milled past by kids, who sit alone on the stairs with his head bowed, and Jessica's name is pressed on his phone's contact list by him. In her bedroom, her bed is lounged on by Jessica, staring into the distance. In Jacob's apartment, Hannah and Jacob are together, and the phone is held out to Hannah by Jacob. In her office, Emily is at her desk, writing, looking up and pouting sadly. At school, the building is poured out of by students, and outside by his car Cal stands, spotting Robbie, but Robbie is eyed balefully by him and another direction is walked off in.

A shot is sold to Cal by the bartender, who shrugs at Jacob. At the bar, both Cal and Jacob stare down, and away Jacob looks."

His hands are tightly gripping the steering wheel, indicating his heightened focus. At the same time, driving closely behind him is Jessica. She is following him with urgency and desperation, her hand continuously honking the horn, showing the intensity of her emotions, even daring to run a red light as she maintains her pursuit. Meanwhile, back in the garden, Molly nonchalantly hands a glass of champagne to her companion, and just nearby stands the whimsical and somewhat amusing Crazy Golf windmill, adding an air of quaint charm to the setting.\n\nSuddenly, in a fit of aggression, Bernie lets loose his temper, flooring Cal to the ground. Quick to react, Jacob intervenes with haste, pulling Bernie off Cal to defuse the situation. However, Bernie doesn't back down and retaliates with a punch aimed at Jacob. In his rage, he forcefully wrenches the sails right off the windmill and lets them fall to the ground with a dramatic flourish. The four men then become intertwined in a chaotic struggle, wrestling and grappling vehemently with one another until they all collapse together in a tangled heap. Eventually, in the aftermath of their scuffle, they find themselves seated side by side on a nearby wall, with David nursing his sore cheek by applying an icepack. During this moment, police officers arrive on the scene, assessing the situation briefly before deciding to leave. As they depart, Jacob suddenly bursts into laughter, a sound that catches David's and Bernie's attention, causing them to turn their eyes toward Cal.\n\nAs the officers disappear from view, Emily releases a deep and weary sigh, while both Hannah and Jessica lower their eyes to the ground, consumed by introspection. Rising to his feet, Bernie is followed quickly by Jessica, who seems nervous as she runs her fingers through her ponytail, hurrying after him. This entire exchange unfolds under the watchful eyes of Robbie. He, too, rises and begins to jog around the corner in pursuit, only to come to an abrupt stop. Bernie, with a slight limp, reaches the end of the driveway, and Jessica casts a backward glance at Robbie, her expression filled with a palpable sense of shame. Robbie, in response, turns away, shuffling back with a dejected demeanor, while the remaining three men continue to sit on the wall. Cal eventually stands, with Emily offering a bitter smile as she shakes her head, while Hannah frowns, the reflection of hurt evident in her eyes.\n\nEmily stares intensely at Cal, and Hannah gives Jacob a small nod before he also rises to his feet.

Eventually, Cal turns to leave, while Emily defiantly crosses her arms. As Cal approaches Robbie, who is leaning against the wall of the house, he offers a smile and a nod before making his exit.\n\nMolly takes a seat on the garden stairs, placing her head in her hand, a gesture of fatigue, as Cal lumbers down the driveway. At school, kids mill about, moving past Robbie, who sits alone on the stairs with his head bowed low. He taps Jessica's name on his phone's contact list, initiating a call. Meanwhile, in her bedroom, Jessica lounges on her bed, her eyes lost in thought as they stare into the distance. Over at Jacob's apartment, Hannah and Jacob are together, with Jacob holding his phone out towards Hannah, sharing a significant moment. Elsewhere, Emily sits at her desk in her office, her focus on writing, occasionally glancing up with a sad pout on her face. As school ends, students pour out of the building, with Cal standing outside by his car. He spots Robbie, but Robbie returns his gaze with a baleful look before choosing to walk off in another direction.\n\nLater, Cal finds himself sitting at the counter of a bar, his head resting heavily on his hands, his posture hunched over, burdened by his thoughts. Eventually, he raises his head just as Jacob appears beside him, scanning the surroundings of the bar. The bartender casually slides Cal a shot and gives a nonchalant shrug in response to Jacob.

In the back garden, known for its award-winning rose bushes, Molly hands her a glass of champagne, and there's a Crazy Golf windmill, painted brightly by neighborhood kids during a summer project. Bernie floors Cal during an argument that began over an old rivalry from high school, and Jacob pulls Bernie off Cal, but Bernie punches Jacob, wrenches the sails off the windmill, and drops them in frustration. All four guys wrestle and struggle, tangled together, then fall into the flower bed, crushing the hydrangeas. They sit on a garden wall side by side, David with an icepack on his cheek from the scuffle, as police officers arrive, having been called by concerned neighbors, and then head off after a brief chat. Jacob laughs, trying to lighten the mood, and David and Bernie turn to look at Cal before the police officers leave. Emily takes a big sigh, overwhelmed by the chaotic scene, and Hannah and Jessica stare at the ground, contemplating the aftermath. Bernie gets up, particularly aware of his twisted ankle, followed by Jessica who scurries after him, nervously running her fingers through her ponytail, as Robbie, hidden partially by the shade of a large oak, watches them go. He gets up and jogs around the corner after them, curious but uncertain, but then stops, feeling the weight of the day’s events. Bernie limps slightly as they reach the end of the driveway, where an old swing set rusts silently, and Jessica glances back at Robbie, looking ashamed over her earlier reckless driving. Robbie turns away and shuffles back dejectedly, while the other three men remain sitting on the wall, a silent testament to their shared history. Cal stands, Emily smiles bitterly while shaking her head, remembering happier times, and Hannah frowns, her eyes filled with hurt from recent revelations. Emily gawks at Cal, recalling an old grudge, and Hannah gives Jacob a small nod before he gets up, signaling an agreement to talk later. She wanders away, followed by Jacob, as Emily glares at Cal, and Molly comes out, curious about the commotion. Hannah and Jacob leave, and Robbie lets his head drop forward, feeling the burden of fractured friendships. With his brow furrowed, Cal looks down at the ground, and Emily eyes him angrily with her jaw clenched, considering the consequences of their actions. Cal heads off, while Emily folds her arms, determined to maintain her stance. Cal approaches Robbie, who leans against the wall of the house, its bricks aged and crumbling, showing their years. Cal smiles, nods in an attempt to mend bridges, and leaves. Molly sits down on the garden steps, putting her head in her hand, exasperated by the ongoing drama, as Cal lumbers down the driveway. At school, a sprawling campus known for its academic excellence, kids mill past Robbie, who sits alone on the stairs with his head bowed, feeling isolated, and he presses Jessica's name on his phone's contact list, seeking reconciliation. In her bedroom, decorated with band posters and fairy lights, Jessica lounges on her bed, staring into the distance, lost in thought. In Jacob's apartment, located near the downtown area, Hannah and Jacob are together, as Jacob holds out the phone to Hannah, sharing a picture that might bring them closer. Emily is at her desk in her office, cluttered with papers and a coffee mug half-full, writing, looking up and pouting sadly as she reflects on the day's events. At school, students pour out of the building, chattering about the upcoming weekend, and Cal stands outside by his car, a second-hand sedan with a dented fender, spotting Robbie, but Robbie eyes him balefully and walks off in another direction, still angry. Cal sits at the counter of a bar, the regular haunt of locals, his head resting on his hands, hunched with his head hung, pondering his next move. He raises his head as Jacob sits next to him and scans the bar, noting the familiar faces and the bartender who has seen many a story unfold. The bartender sells Cal a shot and shrugs at Jacob, acknowledging the night's tension. Cal and Jacob both stare down at the bar, and Jacob looks away, considering what lies ahead."

          "description": "Sam rolls forward onto the sidewalk and gallops down the alley, clutching the bicycle handlebars, while Lisa mirrors him, yanking the doorbell eagerly and hopping over the sidewalk crack. In the rooftop garden, Tina tosses her a bucket of cola, and there's a Ferris wheel carousel. Sam flattens Eli, and Max yanks Sam off Eli, but Sam kicks Max, rips the spokes from the carousel, and tosses them. All four cats scuffle and resist, twisted together, then tumble. They lean against a fence side by side, Mike with a bandage on his forehead, as firefighters appear and then fly away. Max chuckles, and Mike and Sam pivot to glance at Eli before the firefighters vanish. Vera draws a deep breath, and Cindy and Lisa fixate on the sky. Sam rises, shadowed by Lisa who dashes after him, anxiously twirling her bracelet, as Tony observes them depart. He rises and skips around the lamppost after them, but then halts. Sam inches slightly as they arrive at the edge of the sidewalk, and Lisa peeks back at Tony, appearing guilty. Tony pivots and trudges back forlornly, while the other three cats remain leaning against the fence. Eli ascends, Vera smirks sadly while shaking her head, and Cindy scowls, her eyes brimming with sorrow. Vera gawks at Eli, and Cindy offers Max a faint nod before he rises. She ambles away, followed by Max, as Vera leers at Eli, and Tina emerges. Cindy and Max exit, and Tony lets his head droop forward. With his brow knitted, Eli gazes down at the pavement, and Vera regards him coldly with her lips firm. Eli departs, while Vera crosses her arms. Eli approaches Tony, who slouches against the trunk of the tree. Eli grins, nods, and departs. Tina perches on the porch steps, resting her head in her hand, as Eli shambles down the sidewalk. At the market, kids wander past Tony, who sits alone on the bench with his head lowered, and he taps Lisa's name on his phone's directory. In her attic, Lisa reclines on her couch, gazing into the void. In Max's studio, Cindy and Max are together, as Max extends the phone to Cindy. Vera is at her workstation in her lab, scribbling, looking up and pouting sullenly. At the market, shoppers drift out of the stalls, and Eli lingers outside by his scooter, noticing Tony, but Tony regards him suspiciously and strides off in a different path. Eli rests at the table of a café, his head leaning on his elbows, slouched with his head downcast. He lifts his head as Max settles beside him and surveys the café. The server hands Eli a dessert and shrugs at Max. Eli and Max both scrutinize the table, and Max diverts his gaze."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Bernie fights Cal, with Jacob intervening, but Bernie punches Jacob and dismantles the windmill. The four men wrestle and fall; they later sit on a wall, as police arrive and leave. Jessica follows Bernie, fraught with nerves, while Robbie watches. Bernie limps at the driveway's end, Jessica ashamedly glances back at Robbie, who walks away dejectedly. The other men remain seated. Cal stands; Emily and Hannah show mixed emotions. Emily glares at Cal, who then approaches Robbie, nods, and leaves, as Molly sits on the steps. At school, isolated Robbie considers texting Jessica. Jessica is pensive in her bedroom, while Hannah and Jacob are together at his apartment. In her office, Emily writes sadly. As students leave school, Cal spots Robbie, but Robbie ignores him. Cal, dejected at a bar, sits with Jacob, both reflecting silently."
