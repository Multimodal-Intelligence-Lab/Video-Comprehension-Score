He primes the shotgun - WHOOSH - CLACK - and heads for the shop. Full-face portrayal of Hi once again in front of the mug-shot partition.

The wall behind him prominently displays hatch marks that seem to indicate height measurements. His photograph is promptly taken, and the camera is mounted securely on a tripod. Peering out thoughtfully from behind the camera is a pretty young woman dressed in a strict police uniform. Meanwhile, HI complies with the procedure but continues to glance at Ed out of the corner of his eye, offering a skewed side profile as he is guided away from the camera toward his cell. At the far end of the long corridor, a large convict moves slowly as he mops the floor. This Mopping Con snarls menacingly as Hi passes by. The camera pans around a group of men seated in folding chairs, facing each other. The pan begins focusing on Hi. Eventually, the camera angle shifts to reveal the COUNSELOR, an earnest young man with a beard, who sits astride a folding chair, arms folded over its back, as he speaks intently to one of the cons. A massive, muscular black man with a clean-shaven head looks on, his brow furrowed with consternation. Three PAROLE OFFICERS, comprising two men and a woman, sit across a table, facing Hi. A rather run-down Chevy drives into the desolate parking lot of an all-night store, and Hi steps out wearing his distinctive Hawaiian shirt while clutching a pump-action shotgun. He primes the weapon with a resonating WHOOSH - CLACK and heads purposefully toward the store. In front of the mug-shot wall, we once again see Hi's full-face exposure. Hi complies with the procedure but throws sympathetic glances toward Ed, who is visibly distressed, wiping away tears and sniffling behind the camera as Hi's profile is captured. Looking back at Ed, who meets his gaze through her tears, Hi is then led away by another police officer who begins to escort him out. Hi struggles to look back over his shoulder as he is firmly led out of the room, with the door slamming shut behind him as he is once again taken toward his cell. The Mopping Con is now positioned in the mid-background, having progressed about halfway up the corridor since we last saw him, and Hi passes by with a sheepish expression. Two convicts seated together, named GALE and EVELLE, appear to be close friends. Hi again finds himself facing the same three PAROLE OFFICERS at the same table.

A camera quickly captures his image, and this photograph is swiftly mounted onto a tripod, where a pretty young woman dressed in a stern police uniform peers out from behind it. HI, acknowledging his circumstances, obliges, though he continues to glance subtly at Ed from the corner of his eye, maintaining a partial profile, as he is guided away from the camera and towards his cell. At the distant end of the corridor, a large con, visibly lethargic, is laboriously mopping the floor, and this Mopping Con emits a threatening snarl as Hi walks by. The scene transitions to a group of men encircled, sitting in folding chairs and facing each other. The camera begins a slow pan, starting with Hi, gradually moving to reveal the COUNSELOR—an earnest, bearded young man straddling a folding chair with his arms confidently folded over the back, as he addresses one of the Cons. Nearby, a large, muscle-bound black man with a shaved head furrows his brow in displeasure. Three PAROLE OFFICERS, comprised of two men and a woman, fix their attention on Hi from the opposite side of a table. In a separate scene, a battered Chevy rolls into a deserted parking lot of an all-night store, and Hi steps out, still in his Hawaiian shirt, clutching a pump-action shotgun. With a practiced motion, he primes the shotgun, the sound resonating with a WHOOSH - CLACK, before heading purposefully towards the store. The narrative cuts back to Hi, once again positioned in front of the mug-shot wall. He complies with the procedural requirements but casts empathetic glances at Ed, who is visibly distraught, tears streaming and sniffling behind the camera. Hi turns to face Ed again, who looks up through her tears as yet another police officer begins to escort him away. Despite struggling to call back over his shoulder, Hi is firmly led out through the slamming door, returning him to his cell. The Mopping Con, now positioned slightly further up the corridor since their last interaction, works diligently in the middle-background, while Hi passes by with a sheepish expression. Nearby, two convicts, GALE and EVELLE, seated together, appear to share a camaraderie. Hi once again confronts the same three PAROLE OFFICERS across the same table. The scene shifts to a 7-Eleven parking lot, desolate at night except for Hi’s idling car, its engine emitting a steady rumble. Hi backpedals into view, clutching a shotgun and a bag of cash. He quickly spins around, reaching for the car-door handle, only to find it locked. Frantically, he tries the back door, but it too is locked. With the sound of an approaching siren filling the air, Hi makes a hasty retreat. Back against the mug-shot wall, we witness Ed deftly manipulating Hi's right hand with her own, meticulously rolling each of his inked fingers onto the designated spaces on an exemplar sheet."

          "description": "A disheveled young man in a gaily colored Hawaiian shirt, reminiscent of the vibrant styles popularized in the 1930s by Hawaiian apparel companies, is launched into frame by someone offscreen. The hatch marks on the wall behind him, much like those commonly found in police booking stations worldwide, are apparently height markers. His picture is taken with the efficiency typical of a police procedure, and it is mounted on a tripod. A pretty young woman in a severe police uniform peers out from behind it, her demeanor suggesting the serious nature of law enforcement work. Hi obliges but still looks at Ed out of the corner of his eye, on his eye-skewed profile, as Hi is escorted away from the camera toward his cell, a stark reminder of his current predicament. At the far end of the corridor, a huge con is sluggishly mopping the floor, reminiscent of scenes in correctional facilities where inmates often take on janitorial tasks, and the Mopping Con snarls as Hi passes. Panning a circle of men who sit facing each other in folding chairs, a setup often used in group therapy sessions, the pan starts on Hi. At this point, the pan has reached the COUNSELOR, an earnest, bearded young man who straddles a folding chair with his arms folded over its back; he is addressing one of the Cons, in what appears to be a session aimed at rehabilitation. The huge muscle-bound black man with a shaved head is knitting his brow in consternation, a common response in stressful environments like these. Three PAROLE OFFICERS - two men and a woman - face Hi across a table, their serious expressions underscoring the gravity of parole hearings. A beat-up Chevy, a classic model often seen in movies for its rugged, timeless appearance, pulls into the all-night store's empty parking lot, and Hi is getting out of the Chevy in a Hawaiian shirt, holding a pump-action shotgun, a weapon known for its power and reliability. He primes the shotgun - WHOOSH - CLACK - and heads for the store with a determined stride. Full-face exposure of Hi once again in front of the mug-shot wall, a familiar sight in crime dramas. Hi obliges but shoots sympathetic glances at Ed who is obviously upset, wiping away tears and snuffling behind the camera, on Hi's profile. He turns back to Ed, looking up through her tears as Hi is led away, as another police officer who appears seasoned in handling detainees starts to lead him away, struggling to call back over his shoulder as he is firmly led out the door. The door slams, as Hi is once again escorted toward his cell, echoing the heavy sound of metal doors common in correctional facilities. The Mopping Con is now in the middle-background, having worked his way about halfway up the corridor since last time we saw him as Hi passes, and Hi looks sheepish, perhaps reflecting on his circumstances. Two convicts sitting next to each other, GALE and EVELLE, appear to be friends, a common occurrence in the tightly-knit communities formed within prison walls. Hi faces the same three PAROLE OFFICERS across the same table, the tension in the room palpable. Of a 7-Eleven parking lot, a chain of convenience stores known for their ubiquitous presence and late hours, at night, deserted except for Hi's car which sits untended, its engine rumbling, Hi backpedals into frame with a shotgun and a bag of cash, a scene reminiscent of countless heist movies. He spins and grabs his car-door handle, locked. He tries the back door, locked. As we hear the wail of an approaching siren, signaling the arrival of law enforcement, Hi takes it on the heel and toe, a colloquial phrase denoting a quick exit. On Hi against the mug-shot wall, we see his right hand being efficiently manipulated by Ed's two hands, skilled in the routine of police fingerprinting: She is rolling each of his inked fingers into the appropriate space on an exemplar sheet, following standard police protocol."

          "description": "A bewildered old woman in a drab-colored Gothic cloak is catapulted into view by a dinosaur offscreen, as the crosshatch patterns on the ceiling above her are seemingly weight indicators. Her portrait is sketched, and it is secured on a ladder. A grumpy old man in a playful sailor outfit peeks out from beneath it. PI accommodates but still glares at Sam out of the corner of his nostril, on his nostril-tilted silhouette, as Pi is shepherded away from the easel toward his cage. At the near end of the tunnel, a tiny cat is nimbly dusting the ceiling, and the Dusting Cat growls as Pi approaches. Swiveling around a cluster of women who stand facing each other on spinning stools, the swivel initiates on Pi. Eventually, the swivel lands on the TRAINER, a jaded, clean-shaven senior who balances on a spinning stool with his legs crossed over its top; he is lecturing one of the Cats. The tiny, wiry brown bird with feathered feet is scratching its head in confusion. Three DRIVERS - two women and a man - gaze at Pi across a pond. An ancient Volvo glides into the half-day café's crowded garden, and Pi is jumping out of the Volvo in a Gothic cloak, clutching a water balloon. He squeezes the balloon - SPLASH - POP - and strolls toward the café. Side-profile view of Pi once again beside the portrait-wall. Pi accommodates but throws empathetic nods at Sam who is clearly indifferent, sneezing away dust and coughing beside the canvas, on Pi's silhouette. He turns back to Sam, peering down through his laughter as Pi is carried away, as another sailor starts to lead him away, endeavoring to whisper over his shoulder as he is softly nudged out the window. The window slams, as Pi is once again shepherded toward his cage. The Dusting Cat is now in the far-backdrop, having advanced about halfway down the tunnel since earlier when we noticed him as Pi approaches, and Pi appears embarrassed. Two owls resting next to each other, BERT and ERNIE, seem to be rivals. Pi confronts the same three DRIVERS across the same pond. Of a bustling McDonald's back garden, at dawn, teeming except for Pi's vehicle which rests unmoved, its exhaust roaring, Pi tiptoes into view with a water balloon and a suitcase of marbles. He twirls and clutches his vehicle's trunk handle, sealed. He attempts the passenger door, sealed. As we detect the siren of a retreating train, Pi stomps it on the pedal and sole. On Pi beside the portrait-wall, we observe his left foot being skillfully massaged by Sam's two feet: He is spinning each of his painted toes into the designated corner on an artwork sheet."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Back at the mug-shot wall, he exchanges sympathetic glances with Ed as she wipes away tears. Led away again, the door slams behind him, and the mopping convict has advanced down the corridor.
