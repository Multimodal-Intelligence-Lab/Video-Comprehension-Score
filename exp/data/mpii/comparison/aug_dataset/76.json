A wire birdcage hangs close to the shade, silhouetted with a canary on the perch. The CHILDREN enter, backs to us, and stop, looking with window light on their faces as the song ends. He vanishes beyond the trees, his singing growing more distant, and then wakes her. He vanishes again as children scuttle in hay and dogs quiet while his song dies. Hand in hand, they hurry out of the barn and, as we pan, along its side towards the river. JOHN steers through turbulent, moonlit water beneath a low moon. On blank, calm water, the skiff enters, passing full length below us with the children asleep in it, as blank water returns and the fox barks again. The skiff nears a sand-bar and the prow softly grates against the sand. Tilting upward, distant sounds include medium and near roosters crowing o.s. He looks to PEARL, who is picking daisies. Beyond the fence, a woman, RACHEL COOPER, appears carrying a berry-basket on her arm. JOHN scrambles up, grabs an oar, and holds it defensively while PEARL freezes. They hesitate and still hesitate as RACHEL breaks off a switch and comes for them, squishing through the mud. She surrounds them and drives them like geese up the bank as they move across the meadow like a nursery frieze with her tweaking with her switch. As she goes near PEARL's calves, JOHN turns to see three crouching figures picking tomatoes beyond a low white fence with Rachel's house in the background. RUBY, thirteen, pops her head up like a rifle-target, followed by Clary, eleven, and Mary, four. She has JOHN and PEARL by their napes while the three girls enter, their backs to us, carrying baskets of tomatoes. She holds JOHN and PEARL very firmly, inspecting baskets across the gate of the fence. She opens the gate, pushes the Harper children through, shuts the gate, and walks between them, her back to us. The children hesitate as she turns to them and stops, looking them up and down. If we saw her face, her lips would be pursed and working with anger. His eyes go down to her feet, and he, and we, start to examine her from foot to head, as this is our heroine at last from JOHN’S eye-level, tilting slowly up her height. She wears man's shoes, heavy with mud, a rough skirt, and a shapeless sweater hanging over her shoulders; she is in her middle sixties and wears a man's old hat. Her face says, for no reason at all, he feels he has come home. RACHEL mercilessly scrubs JOHN, who doesn't like it, while RUBY washes PEARL with a cloth, both hating the scrubbing. JOHN breaks away and dodges behind a bush with RACHEL in hot pursuit.",

A wire aviary hangs near to the shade, silhouetted with a finch on the roost. The YOUNGSTERS enter, backs to us, and halt, gazing with the window glow on their countenances as the melody ceases. He disappears beyond the woods, his singing becoming more remote, and then rouses her. He disappears again as youngsters scurry in straw and canines quiet while his tune fades. Hand in hand, they rush out of the shed and, as we pan, along its edge towards the stream. JOHN navigates through turbulent, moonlit liquid beneath a low orb. On blank, tranquil water, the skiff enters, passing full length below us with the youngsters asleep in it, as blank water returns and the fox yelps again. The skiff nears a sandbank and the prow softly scrapes against the sand. Tilting upward, faraway sounds include medium and near roosters calling o.s. He looks to PEARL, who is picking flowers. Beyond the barrier, a woman, RACHEL COOPER, appears carrying a berry-basket on her limb. JOHN scrambles up, grabs a paddle, and holds it protectively while PEARL freezes. They pause and still pause as RACHEL breaks off a rod and comes for them, squishing through the mire. She surrounds them and drives them like geese up the incline as they move across the field like a nursery frieze with her tweaking with her rod. As she goes near PEARL's calves, JOHN turns to see three crouching figures picking tomatoes beyond a low white barrier with Rachel's dwelling in the backdrop. RUBY, thirteen, pops her head up like a rifle-target, followed by Clary, eleven, and Mary, four. She has JOHN and PEARL by their necks while the three girls enter, their backs to us, carrying baskets of tomatoes. She holds JOHN and PEARL very firmly, inspecting baskets across the gate of the barrier. She opens the gate, pushes the Harper youngsters through, shuts the gate, and walks between them, her back to us. The youngsters pause as she turns to them and stops, looking them up and down. If we saw her face, her lips would be pursed and working with fury. His eyes go down to her feet, and he, and we, start to examine her from foot to head, as this is our heroine at last from JOHN’S eye-level, tilting slowly up her stature. She wears man's footwear, heavy with mire, a coarse skirt, and a shapeless jumper hanging over her shoulders; she is in her middle sixties and wears a man's old hat. Her face says, for no reason at all, he feels he has come home. RACHEL mercilessly scrubs JOHN, who doesn't like it, while RUBY washes PEARL with a cloth, both loathing the scrubbing. JOHN breaks away and dodges behind a shrub with RACHEL in hot pursuit."

Close to the shade, a wire birdcage is hung, silhouetted with a canary on the perch. The CHILDREN are entered by them, backs towards us, and are stopped, looking with window light on their faces as the song is ended. Beyond the trees, he vanishes, and his singing grows more distant before she is woken by him. Again, he vanishes as children are scuttled in hay and dogs are quieted while his song dies. Hand in hand, out of the barn they are hurried by them, and as we pan, its side is moved along towards the river. Through turbulent, moonlit water beneath a low moon, JOHN is steered. On blank, calm water, the skiff is entered, passing full length below us with the children asleep in it, as blank water is returned and the fox barks again. A sand-bar is neared by the skiff and the sand is grated against softly by the prow. Distant sounds are tilted upwards, including medium and near roosters crowing o.s. PEARL is looked at by him, who picks daisies. Beyond the fence, RACHEL COOPER, a woman, is appeared by, carrying a berry-basket on her arm. JOHN scrambles up, grabs an oar, and holds it defensively while PEARL is frozen. They hesitate and hesitate still as a switch is broken off by RACHEL and she comes for them, mud is squished through by her. They are surrounded by her and they are driven like geese up the bank as they are moved across the meadow like a nursery frieze with her tweaking her switch. Near PEARL's calves, she goes, and JOHN turns to see three crouching figures picking tomatoes beyond a low white fence with Rachel's house seen in the background. RUBY, thirteen, pops her head up like a rifle-target, followed by Clary, eleven, and Mary, four. JOHN and PEARL are taken by their napes by her while the three girls are entered by them, their backs toward us, carrying baskets of tomatoes. JOHN and PEARL are held very firmly by her, and she inspects baskets across the gate of the fence. The gate is opened by her, the Harper children are pushed through, the gate is shut, and between them she walks, her back to us. The children hesitate as she turns to them and they are stopped, looked up and down. If her face is seen by us, her lips would be pursed and working with anger. Her feet are looked down to by his eyes, and he, and we, start to examine her from foot to head, as this is our heroine at last from JOHN’S eye-level, her height being tilted slowly up. Man's shoes, heavy with mud, a rough skirt, and a shapeless sweater hanging over her shoulders are worn by her; she is in her middle sixties and an old man's hat is worn by her. For no reason at all, her face says that he feels he has come home. JOHN is mercilessly scrubbed by RACHEL, who is not liked by him, while PEARL is washed by RUBY with a cloth, both hating the scrubbing. JOHN breaks away and behind a bush, he dodges with RACHEL in hot pursuit."

As they pass by this picturesque scene, they notice in the distance a corner of a barn with a warmly lighted window that is softly glowing in the background. Nearby, there is a wire birdcage suspended close to the shade, and its silhouette reveals a canary perched serenely inside. The CHILDREN enter the scene with their backs turned to us, pausing as they gaze forward with wonder, their faces softly illuminated by the glow of the window light just as the song reaches its end. He disappears beyond the mysterious trees, his singing becoming ever more distant, and then, as if from a dream, he wakes her. Once more, he vanishes into the night as the children scuttle through the hay, and the dogs grow quiet while his gentle song fades away. Hand in hand, they quickly hurry out of the barn, and as we pan out, they move along its side towards the shimmering river. JOHN expertly steers through the slightly turbulent, moonlit water beneath a low-hanging moon, guiding their small vessel with skill. On the blank, calm water, the skiff glides gracefully in, passing full length below us with the children peacefully asleep in it, as the blank water returns and the fox barks once again in the distance. The skiff slowly approaches a sand-bar, and the prow gently grates against the welcoming sand. As it tilts upward, distant sounds include medium and near roosters crowing off-screen, adding to the serene atmosphere. He glances over to PEARL, who is leisurely picking daisies with an air of innocence. Beyond the fence, a woman named RACHEL COOPER appears, carrying a berry-basket snugly on her arm. JOHN quickly scrambles up from his position, grabs an oar, and holds it defensively while PEARL freezes in place, unsure of what to do next. They hesitate and continue to hesitate as RACHEL breaks off a switch and approaches them steadily, squishing through the mud with authority. She surrounds them and drives them like geese up the bank, moving across the meadow like figures in a nursery frieze, tweaking them with her switch for encouragement. As she nears PEARL's calves, JOHN turns to see three crouching figures picking tomatoes beyond a low white fence, with Rachel's house visible in the background, giving a sense of a bustling, homely environment. RUBY, who is thirteen, pops her head up like a rifle-target, followed closely by Clary, who is eleven, and Mary, who, being four, is the youngest. RACHEL firmly holds JOHN and PEARL by their napes while the three girls enter the scene, their backs to us, carrying baskets brimming with freshly picked tomatoes. She holds JOHN and PEARL very firmly, inspecting the baskets across the gate of the fence with a critical eye. She opens the gate, pushing the Harper children through with gentle yet firm determination, shuts the gate securely, and walks between them, her back now turned to us. The children hesitate, sensing a moment of reckoning as she turns to them and stops, scrutinizing them from head to toe. If we could see her face clearly, her lips would be pursed and working with indignation. His eyes drift downwards to her feet, and he, along with us, begins to examine her from foot to head, as this is our heroine revealed at last from JOHN’S eye-level, tilting slowly up her height. She wears sturdy man's shoes, heavy with caked mud, a rough skirt, and a shapeless sweater draped over her shoulders; she is in the middle of her sixties and wears a man's old hat with a certain air of character. Her face conveys an inexplicable sense of homecoming, for no apparent reason, he feels he has come home. In a relentless manner, RACHEL scrubs JOHN, who doesn't like this treatment, while RUBY washes PEARL with a cloth, both of them detesting the scrubbing process. JOHN breaks away and dodges behind a bush with RACHEL in hot pursuit, determined to complete the task she has set out to do."

          "description": "JOHN resets his oar, an essential tool for steering and propelling small boats, as they angle towards the shore and reach the top of the bank, passing a corner of a barn, a large farm building typically used for storing hay and housing livestock, with a lighted window in the background. A wire birdcage hangs close to the shade, silhouetted with a canary on the perch, a bird known for its vibrant song and often kept as a pet during the early 20th century. The CHILDREN enter, backs to us, and stop, looking with window light on their faces as the song ends. He vanishes beyond the trees, his singing growing more distant, much like a lullaby echoing through a quiet countryside, and then wakes her. He vanishes again as children scuttle in hay, the dried grass used for animal feed, and dogs quiet while his song dies. Hand in hand, they hurry out of the barn and, as we pan, along its side towards the river, a natural watercourse flowing towards an ocean or lake. JOHN steers through turbulent, moonlit water beneath a low moon, which casts an eerie glow over the scene. On blank, calm water, the skiff, a small flat-bottomed open boat, enters, passing full length below us with the children asleep in it, as blank water returns and the fox, a usually nocturnal animal known for its cunning, barks again. The skiff nears a sand-bar, a submerged or partly exposed ridge of sand or coarse sediment, and the prow softly grates against the sand. Tilting upward, distant sounds include medium and near roosters crowing o.s., signaling the break of dawn. He looks to PEARL, who is picking daisies, flowers symbolizing innocence and purity. Beyond the fence, a woman, RACHEL COOPER, appears carrying a berry-basket on her arm, perhaps having just returned from picking fresh seasonal produce. JOHN scrambles up, grabs an oar, and holds it defensively while PEARL freezes. They hesitate and still hesitate as RACHEL breaks off a switch, a small, flexible rod used for disciplinary measures, and comes for them, squishing through the mud, which is thick and cool underfoot. She surrounds them and drives them like geese up the bank as they move across the meadow, lush and green like a nursery frieze, a decorative band of picture or sculpture. As she goes near PEARL's calves, JOHN turns to see three crouching figures picking tomatoes, a staple fruit vegetable of summer gardens, beyond a low white fence with Rachel's house in the background. RUBY, thirteen, pops her head up like a rifle-target, followed by Clary, eleven, and Mary, four, each engrossed in their task. She has JOHN and PEARL by their napes while the three girls enter, their backs to us, carrying baskets of tomatoes. She holds JOHN and PEARL very firmly, inspecting baskets across the gate of the fence. She opens the gate, pushes the Harper children through, shuts the gate, and walks between them, her back to us. The children hesitate as she turns to them and stops, looking them up and down. If we saw her face, her lips would be pursed and working with anger. His eyes go down to her feet, and he, and we, start to examine her from foot to head, as this is our heroine at last from JOHN’S eye-level, tilting slowly up her height. She wears man's shoes, heavy with mud, a rough skirt, and a shapeless sweater hanging over her shoulders; she is in her middle sixties and wears a man's old hat, a practical attire for working outdoors on the land. Her face says, for no reason at all, he feels he has come home, evoking a sense of unexpected belonging. RACHEL mercilessly scrubs JOHN, who doesn't like it, while RUBY washes PEARL with a cloth, both hating the scrubbing, a common practice to ensure cleanliness and prevent illness. JOHN breaks away and dodges behind a bush with RACHEL in hot pursuit, pursuing him with determined vigor."

Hand in hand, they stroll out of the barn and, as we pan, along its side towards the river. JOHN drifts through gentle, moonlit water beneath a low moon. On blank, tranquil water, the skiff exits, passing full length below us with the children asleep in it, as blank water returns and the fox howls again.

She vanishes beyond the bushes, her humming growing more distant, and then wakes him. She vanishes again as penguins scurry in straw and wolves quiet while her melody fades. Wing in wing, they hurry out of the greenhouse and, as we pan, along its side towards the creek. MELISSA navigates through choppy, star-lit water beneath a high star. On still, quiet water, the raft enters, passing full length below us with the penguins asleep on it, as still water returns and the owl hoots again. The raft nears a pebble-bank, and the bow softly grates against the stones. Tilting upward, distant sounds include medium and near cows mooing o.s. She looks to GEM, who is picking tulips. Beyond the hedge, a man, DAVID KAPLAN, appears carrying a fruit-basket on his shoulder. MELISSA crawls up, grabs a telescope, and holds it defensively while GEM freezes. They waver and still waver as DAVID breaks off a stick and comes for them, sloshing through the puddle. He encircles them and drives them like ducks up the hill as they move across the field like a school mural with him flicking with his stick. As he goes near GEM's ankles, MELISSA turns to see three jumping shadows picking eggplants beyond a low brown hedge with David's barn in the background. EMMA, fifteen, pops her head up like a flag, followed by Tilly, seven, and Lucy, nine. He has MELISSA and GEM by their collars while the three boys enter, their backs to us, carrying baskets of eggplants. He holds MELISSA and GEM very tightly, inspecting baskets across the arch of the hedge. He opens the arch, pushes the Keller penguins through, shuts the arch, and walks between them, his back to us. The penguins waver as he turns to them and stops, looking them up and down. If we saw his face, his lips would be tight and twitching with curiosity. Her eyes go down to his toes, and she, and we, start to examine him from toe to head, as he is our protagonist at last from MELISSA’S eye-level, tilting slowly up his height. He wears woman's boots, caked with clay, a coarse shirt, and a formless jacket draping over his arms; he is in his late seventies and wears a woman's old bonnet. His face says, for no reason at all, she feels she has arrived. DAVID mercilessly scrubs MELISSA, who doesn't like it, while EMMA washes GEM with a sponge, both loathing the scrubbing.

A string lantern sways close to the curtain, silhouetted with a sparrow on the ledge. The GUESTS arrive, faces away from us, and pause, gazing with window glow on their features as the melody concludes. He disappears beyond the hedges, his humming becoming more distant, and then rouses her. He vanishes again as guests scamper in straw and cats hush while his melody fades. Side by side, they sprint out of the stable and, as we track, along its edge toward the lake. MICHAEL navigates through choppy, starlit water beneath a low star. On serene, placid water, the canoe emerges, passing in full view below us with the guests asleep in it, as calm water remains and the owl hoots again. The canoe approaches a gravel bar and the bow gently nudges against the gravel. Rising upward, distant noises include soft and close frogs croaking o.s. He glances at LUCY, who is gathering blossoms. Beyond the railing, a lady, SARAH TAYLOR, emerges carrying a herb-basket on her hip. MICHAEL clambers up, seizes a paddle, and wields it cautiously while LUCY stiffens. They falter and still falter as SARAH snaps off a twig and heads toward them, trudging through the mire. She encircles them and herds them like ducks up the incline as they move across the pasture like a kindergarten mural with her tapping with her twig. As she approaches LUCY's ankles, MICHAEL turns to notice three crouching silhouettes gathering peppers beyond a high picket fence with Sarah's house in the scenery. EMILY, twelve, pops her head up like a weather vane, followed by Clara, ten, and Lisa, five. She has MICHAEL and LUCY by their necklines while the three kids enter, backs toward us, carrying baskets of peppers. She grips MICHAEL and LUCY very securely, scrutinizing baskets across the entrance of the railing. She unlatches the entrance, nudges the Wilson kids through, bolts the entrance, and walks between them, her back toward us. The kids falter as she pivots to them and halts, observing them top to bottom. If we observed her visage, her lips would be pursed and twitching with displeasure. His gaze drops to her heels, and he, and we, commence to survey her from heel to crown, as this is our protagonist finally from MICHAEL’S perspective, tilting gradually up her stature. She dons men's boots, encrusted with clay, a coarse dress, and an ill-fitting jacket draping over her frame; she is in her early seventies and sports a man's timeworn cap. Her expression conveys, for no reason at all, he senses he has arrived home. SARAH relentlessly polishes MICHAEL, who resents it, while EMILY cleans LUCY with a towel, both despising the washing. MICHAEL slips away and darts behind a shrub with SARAH in quick chase."

A metal chandelier dangles close to the curtain, silhouetted with a parrot on the branch. The CHILDREN enter, faces to us, and pause, staring with lamplight on their cheeks as the poem begins. He disappears beneath the clouds, his humming growing fainter, and then dreams of her. He fades again as children burrow through straw and cats purr while his melody fades. Hand in hand, they tiptoe out of the greenhouse and, as we tilt, along its edge towards the meadow. JOHN navigates through still, starlit grass beneath a bright sun. On still, rough land, the wagon arrives, passing fully above us with the children dreaming in it, as rough land reappears and the owl hoots again. The wagon approaches a gravel-road and the wheel gently scrapes against the stone. Leaning downward, nearby noises include distant and close cows mooing o.s. He turns to PEARL, who is plucking tulips. Past the hedge, a woman, RACHEL COOPER, appears holding a peach-box on her shoulder. JOHN climbs down, grips a broom, and waves it defensively while PEARL freezes. They pause and still pause as RACHEL snaps off a twig and comes for them, wading through the puddles. She encircles them and nudges them like ducks up the slope as they drift across the field like a children’s mural with her flicking her twig.

RUBY, thirteen, raises her head like a scarecrow, followed by Clary, eleven, and Mary, four. She has JOHN and PEARL by their collars while the three girls enter, their faces to us, carrying boxes of carrots. She grips JOHN and PEARL very tightly, inspecting boxes near the gate of the hedge. She unlatches the gate, nudges the Harper children through, bolts the gate, and strides between them, her face to us. The children pause as she turns to them and halts, glancing them up and down. If we saw her face, her lips would be set and moving with rage. His eyes lower to her hands, and he, and we, begin to study her from hand to head, as this is our heroine at last from JOHN’S eye-level, tilting slowly up her stature. She wears woman's boots, coated with sand, a soft dress, and a fitted jacket draping over her arms; she is in her late sixties and wears a woman's new bonnet. Her expression says, for no reason at all, he feels he has arrived. RACHEL vigorously polishes JOHN, who dislikes it, while RUBY brushes PEARL with a towel, both disliking the polishing. JOHN slips away and darts behind a tree with RACHEL in eager pursuit."

          "description": "MATTHEW adjusts his telescope as they drift towards the dock and climb to the top of the hill, passing a side of a factory with a glowing lantern in the background. A copper wind chime dangles close to the curtain, silhouetted with a parrot on the swing. The PUPPETS enter, faces to us, and pause, staring with sunbeams on their cheeks as the melody begins. He disappears into the clouds, his whistling growing more faint, and then alerts her. He disappears once more as birds flutter in straw and cats hush while his tune fades. Arm in arm, they dash out of the factory and, as we glide, along its edge towards the ocean. MATTHEW navigates through choppy, starlit waves beneath a high sun. On blank, serene water, the raft glides, floating full length above us with the puppets napping in it, as blank water settles and the wolf howls again. The raft approaches a reef and the bow softly bumps against the rocks. Leaning upward, distant echoes include medium and near donkeys braying o.s. He glances to FIONA, who is plucking tulips. Beyond the barrier, a man, MARTIN FISHER, emerges carrying a pail on his shoulder. MATTHEW climbs up, snatches a telescope, and wields it protectively while FIONA stiffens. They pause and continue to pause as MARTIN snaps off a branch and charges towards them, trudging through the dirt. He encircles them and herds them like sheep up the slope as they trek across the plain like a mural border with his nudging with his branch. As he nears FIONA’s shoes, MATTHEW turns to see three standing shapes gathering broccoli beyond a high red barrier with Martin's cabin in the horizon. RICKY, seventeen, pops his head up like a basketball hoop, followed by Larry, fifteen, and Sarah, six. He has MATTHEW and FIONA by their collars while the three boys enter, their faces to us, carrying pails of broccoli. He grips MATTHEW and FIONA very securely, examining pails across the gate of the barrier. He unlatches the gate, nudges the Smith puppets through, latches the gate, and strides between them, his face to us. The puppets linger as he faces them and halts, inspecting them up and down. If we saw his expression, his eyebrows would be furrowed and twitching with annoyance. His gaze drops to his knees, and he, and we, begin to study him from knee to face, as this is our champion at last from MATTHEW’S perspective, tilting slowly down his stature. He wears women's slippers, soaked with water, a fine coat, and a tailored jacket draped over his arms; he is in his early thirties and dons a woman's new scarf. His expression declares, for no reason at all, she feels she has traveled far. MARTIN relentlessly brushes MATTHEW, who ignores it, while RICKY rinses FIONA with a sponge, both resisting the washing. MATTHEW bolts away and hides behind a hedge with MARTIN in close chase."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

          "description": "JOHN resets his oar as they steer towards the shore, passing a barn with a lit window and a birdcage silhouetted with a canary. The CHILDREN enter, stopping as a song fades. They hurry out of the barn hand in hand towards the river, with JOHN steering through moonlit waters. The skiff softly grates against a sand-bar. JOHN looks at PEARL picking daisies as RACHEL COOPER appears carrying a berry basket. JOHN grabs an oar defensively while PEARL freezes. RACHEL uses a switch to drive them up the bank like geese. JOHN and PEARL are led across a meadow where they see RACHEL’s house and three children picking tomatoes. RACHEL firmly holds JOHN and PEARL, inspecting baskets at the gate, then pushes them through. She examines them closely, and JOHN feels a sense of home. RACHEL is in her sixties, wearing men's shoes, a rough skirt, a sweater, and a hat. Her stern demeanor hides warmth as she scrubs JOHN, who dislikes it, while RUBY washes PEARL. JOHN escapes behind a bush with RACHEL chasing after him."
