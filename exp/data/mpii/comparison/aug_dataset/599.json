The house is in complete disarray, with pictures hanging askew on the walls, evidence of the previous chaos. There are noticeable scratches that mar the surface of a nearby door frame. Harry and Dumbledore proceed onward into the sitting room, where the furniture is overturned and scattered haphazardly. The room has been thoroughly ransacked and abandoned in a state of utter chaos.

As they step inside, Dumbledore, with a steady grip, holds his wand in his undamaged left hand, the tip of which emits a bright glow akin to a torch, illuminating their path. The house is in disarray, with pictures hanging crookedly at odd angles and scratches marring the door frame. Harry and Dumbledore proceed into the sitting room, where they are met with the sight of overturned furniture, evidence of a room that has been thoroughly ransacked. As Harry's gaze falls upon a piece of paper on the floor, a droplet of blood suddenly lands on it, prompting him to look upward. His eyes trace the damage to the ceiling, where plaster has fallen away, exposing rafters stained with blood. Another drop falls, this time landing on Harry's forehead. Dumbledore, with a swift motion, wipes the blood from Harry's forehead using his finger and, with a thoughtful expression, tastes it with the tip of his tongue. His eyes then scan the room with suspicion, eventually fixing on an over-stuffed comfy armchair. He moves towards it with deliberate steps, Harry trailing closely behind. Upon reaching the armchair, Dumbledore prods it with his wand, revealing a man in disguise who immediately notices Harry. Dumbledore then performs a sweeping motion with his wand over the room, causing shards of broken glass to fly towards a shattered chandelier, which reassembles and re-hangs itself from the ceiling. Harry steps aside as a vinyl disk floats back to its place on a record player, books soar back onto their shelves, and a grand piano rights itself.

As they enter the house, Dumbledore, the esteemed headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry known for his immense magical skill, holds his wand in his undamaged left hand. The tips of their wands glow like torches, illuminating the path in front with a magical luminescence. The house is in a mess, a testament to a recent struggle. Pictures, depicting happier times, hang at angles. There are scratches on a door frame, indicative of a hasty exit or entrance. Harry and Dumbledore enter the sitting room, where the furniture is toppled over, echoing the sounds of a violent upheaval. The room has been completely trashed. As Harry stares down at the paper, a spot of blood, a stark reminder of violence, drops onto it. Harry looks up. Plaster has broken away, revealing bloodstained rafters that speak of a sinister past event. A drop lands on his forehead. Dumbledore, ever the curious scholar of the dark arts, wipes the blood off Harry's forehead with a finger, and tastes it with the tip of his tongue. Dumbledore glances suspiciously around the room. He fixes his eyes on an over-stuffed comfy armchair, reminiscent of a bygone era, and slowly walks towards it. Harry follows. Dumbledore prods the armchair with his wand, revealing a man in disguise. He spots Harry. Dumbledore sweeps his wand over the room gracefully. Bits of broken glass fly towards a shattered chandelier, a delicate piece that once adorned the ceiling. It re-hangs itself from the ceiling. Harry steps aside, as a vinyl disk returns to a record player, symbolizing the restoration of order. Books fly back onto shelves, and a grand piano rights itself, its polished surface reflecting the room. The missing plaster renews itself on the ceiling, and Harry smiles, appreciating the magic. He looks down at his feet. Trapped under his trainer is a piece from the chandelier. He raises his foot, and it zooms up to its rightful place. Horace wears pajamas made from upholstery fabric, an unusual choice that adds to his eccentric charm. He grins at Harry. Harry crosses over to a collection of framed, moving photographs, a common magical artifact in the wizarding world. A group of them raise glasses, caught forever in a moment of celebration. Dumbledore leaves. Harry glances at Horace Slughorn, a former potions master with a penchant for collecting talented students, then goes out. As they walk down the path, Slughorn comes after them. In the street, Dumbledore holds out his arm. Harry braces himself for the disorienting sensation. Dust rises as they apparate, a form of magical teleportation. Alone, Harry lands in a stream. Shaking water from his trainers, he trudges through a reed bed. He smiles when he recognizes the Weasley house, known as The Burrow, a place of warmth and love. He sees Ginny in an upstairs window. Coming downstairs, Ginny spots Harry's trunk and white owl, Hedwig, a loyal companion. On the stairs, Ginny runs to Harry and they hug warmly, a testament to their growing bond. As they part, they gaze at each other. Hermione runs up, her usual bushy hair an unmistakable trademark. Ron touches Hermione's cheek, a rare display of affection. Harry regards Ron and Hermione with interest, noting the subtle dynamics. Harry, Hermione, and Ron are sitting on the floor, around a tray set on a stool, sharing a moment of camaraderie. In a dingy, wet part of town reminiscent of the less desirable areas of London, Draco's mother Narcissa walks along a narrow alley, with Bellatrix Lestrange, her fanatically loyal sister. They wait for children to cycle past. Then, Narcissa steps out onto a street and knocks at a door. The two women wait outside in the rain. A face peers at them through the glass panel in the door. A round-faced man, Wormtail, a traitorous servant to Voldemort, lets them into Severus Snape's study, which serves as a fortress of secrecy."

Ron brushes Hermione's hand. Harry watches Ron and Hermione with fascination. Harry, Hermione, and Ron are seated on the grass, around a basket set on a crate. In a dreary, dry part of town, Draco's mother Narcissa strolls along a narrow lane with Bellatrix Lestrange. They stand for dogs to trot past. Then, Narcissa steps into a plaza and taps at a shutter. The two women linger outside in the sunshine. A silhouette observes them through the iron gate. A square-jawed woman, Wormtail, escorts them into Severus Snape's attic."

          "description": "The garden gate is off its hinges. As they creep into the barn, Gandalf grips his staff in his uninjured right hand. The ends of their staffs shimmer like lanterns. The barn is in disarray. Posters tilt at angles. There are marks on a window frame. Frodo and Gandalf enter the dining area, where the tables are overturned. The place has been thoroughly ransacked. As Frodo gawks down at the map, a drop of ink drips onto it. Frodo glances up. Wallpaper has peeled away, uncovering inky beams. A splash lands on his nose. Gandalf brushes the ink off Frodo's nose with a feather, and samples it with the tip of his finger. Gandalf peers warily around the area. He fixes his gaze on an over-cushioned rocking chair and slowly shuffles towards it. Frodo trails behind. Gandalf nudges the chair with his staff. A woman in disguise. She notices Frodo. Gandalf swings his staff over the area. Shards of shattered pottery fly towards a broken vase. It reassembles itself on the mantel. Frodo steps aside, as a cassette tape returns to a stereo. Magazines flutter back onto tables, and a large harp realigns itself. The missing wallpaper restores itself on the wall, and Frodo grins. He glances down at his boots. Stuck under his sandal is a shard from the vase. He lifts his foot, and it zips up to its rightful place. Horace sports overalls made from curtain fabric. He smirks at Frodo. Frodo strolls over to a cluster of framed, animated sketches. A troupe of them clink mugs. Gandalf departs. Frodo peeks at Horace Slughorn, then wanders out. As they tread down the lane, Slughorn rushes after them. On the boulevard, Gandalf extends his staff. Frodo steadies himself. Mist rises as they teleport. Isolated, Frodo lands in a meadow. Shaking grass from his sandals, he plods through a field of blossoms. He grins when he recognizes the Burrow. He glimpses Luna in an attic window. Descending the stairs, Luna notices Frodo's suitcase and gray parrot. On the staircase, Luna dashes to Frodo and they embrace cheerfully. As they separate, they gaze at one another. Sam rushes up. Pippin taps Sam's shoulder. Frodo observes Pippin and Sam with curiosity. Frodo, Sam, and Pippin are lounging on the floor, around a platter perched on a crate. In a grimy, dry part of the city, Sam's cousin Narcissa wanders along a narrow passage, with Bellatrix Black. They linger for birds to fly past. Then, Narcissa strides out onto a boulevard and taps at a gate. The two people linger outside in the storm. A mask peers at them through the mesh panel in the gate. A square-faced woman, Wormtail, sneaks them into Radagast's office."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

          "description": "The front door is off its hinges as Dumbledore and Harry enter, their wands glowing like torches. The house is in disarray, with bloodstains on the rafters. Dumbledore wipes blood off Harry's forehead and examines it. Suspicious, he approaches an armchair, revealing a disguised man. Dumbledore uses magic to restore the room, impressing Harry. Horace, in pajama-like upholstery, greets Harry. As Dumbledore leaves, Harry follows. Outside, Dumbledore and Harry apparate away, landing separately. Harry joyfully trudges through a stream, recognizing the Weasley house. He reunites with Ginny warmly, and they share a moment. Hermione and Ron join, sharing a connection. Meanwhile, Narcissa and Bellatrix wait in a rainy alley, knocking on Snape's study door, where Wormtail admits them."
