Merrill remains motionless, but then turns his gaze from the creature to Graham and looks behind him to the bat. The alien watches him, its small eyes glowing green in their sunken sockets.

Graham recalls his dialogue with Merrill, and his eyes, glazed with tears, focus on the extraterrestrial as it sways back and forth, bending over its captive hanging limply over its arm. Graham rotates slowly from the creature to face Merrill, noticing the baseball bat in its rack mounted on the wall by his sibling. He rotates back around to stare with stern resolve at the extraterrestrial. Merrill remains immobile, but then shifts his gaze from the creature to Graham and looks behind him to the bat. The extraterrestrial observes him, its small eyes illuminating green in their recessed sockets. Merrill takes the bat down as the extraterrestrial lowers its hand over Morgan's face, injecting a gray gash shooting from the spike into Morgan's nose. The extraterrestrial swivels, and Merrill propels himself at the creature, hitting it in the back, causing the extraterrestrial to drop Morgan and turn to face its assailant. Graham dashes over to pick up Morgan and the dropped syringe while Merrill hits the creature in its midsection. It collapses into a side table, overturning a glass of water, and as the water spills onto its shoulder, an angry red laceration erupts in its green-gray skin.

Slow is his turn from the creature to face Merrill, who spots the baseball bat in its rack mounted on the wall by his brother. He turns back around, his stern determination staring at the alien. Motionless remains Merrill, but then his gaze is turned from the creature to Graham, and the bat is looked at behind him. The alien watches him, its small eyes glowing green in their sunken sockets.

Graham's eyes begin to brim with tears, emotions overwhelming him as he reaches out to tenderly take her hand in his own. His tear-filled eyes remain locked on hers, his expression puzzled, as her head gradually lowers in response. As this poignant moment unfolds, Graham's mind drifts back to his earlier conversation with Merrill. His own eyes, now glazed with unshed tears, shift their focus to the alien before him, its body swaying back and forth menacingly. The creature ominously leans over its captive, who hangs limply over its arm like a ragdoll. With deliberate slowness, Graham turns his attention away from this unsettling sight, directing his gaze towards Merrill. He spots the baseball bat securely nestled in its rack, which is mounted on the wall by his brother’s handiwork. Steeling himself, he turns back around, his eyes filled with stern determination as they fixate on the alien once more. \n\nMerrill, who has remained motionless thus far, finally shifts his gaze from the creature towards Graham. His eyes follow Graham’s earlier glance to the bat hanging behind him. Meanwhile, the alien keeps a watchful eye on them both, its small, eerie eyes glowing an unsettling green, deep within their sunken sockets. Merrill decisively takes the bat down from its resting place just as the alien begins to lower a sinister hand over Morgan’s face, a gray gash shooting forth from a spike into the boy’s nose in a disconcerting motion. Reacting swiftly, Merrill launches his body towards the creature, striking it in the back with the bat. This blow causes the alien to drop Morgan instantly and turn its attention to face its assailant. Seizing the moment, Graham rushes over to gather Morgan and the fallen syringe, while Merrill continues his assault, landing another strike to the creature's abdomen. \n\nThe alien stumbles back into a side table, toppling it over, which results in a glass of water splashing onto its shoulder. To their astonishment, an angry red wound violently erupts in the alien’s green-gray skin where the water lands. Shocked yet resolute, Merrill and Graham dart their eyes around the room, noting the collection of discarded glasses of water. Graham, his face a mask of astonishment, turns to Bo before hastily heading outside with Morgan held securely in his arms, Bo trailing closely behind. \n\nOn the veranda, Bo momentarily pauses to glance back into what is now a chaotic living room through the broken window. Meanwhile, Graham makes his way out onto the lawn, each step urgent. Inside, Merrill grips the bat with renewed determination, swinging it at glasses on the coffee table. The alien recoils in visible agony as its skin is splattered with more liquid. \n\nPositioned on the lawn, Graham carefully cradles his son, who rests across his thighs. He adjusts the syringe with a steady hand before thrusting it into Morgan’s leg, willing him to revive. Merrill, relentless in his defense, prepares for yet another strike. This one causes the alien to topple backwards, crashing onto its back and knocking against a small sideboard in the process. As it lands, the impact causes glasses perched precariously on the edge to tip over, releasing a cascade of water onto the crib. The broken head of the bat comes to rest on the floor, surrounded by glimmering shards of broken glass, while the alien lies wheezing, its chest struggling to rise and fall. Merrill, his heart pounding, rushes out into the garden, crouching down beside Graham and the motionless Morgan.

Merrill, sensing something, spins around as Bo watches in awe.

As Graham's eyes brim with tears, he tenderly reaches out, enveloping her hand in his own, maintaining a steady gaze upon her, though his vision blurs with emotion. His brows furrow in a mix of confusion and sorrow as her head gently bows. In a moment of reflection, Graham recalls his earlier conversation with Merrill, causing his tear-glazed eyes to shift their focus onto the alien, which rocks back and forth while leaning over a captive draped languidly over its arm. Graham steadily shifts his attention away from the alien to face Merrill, his eyes catching sight of the baseball bat resting in its rack, mounted on the wall by his brother. Resolutely, he turns back to confront the alien, his expression one of firm determination. Meanwhile, Merrill remains rooted to the spot, his gaze locked onto the alien until he finally shifts his focus to Graham, before glancing behind him at the bat. The alien, with its small, glowing green eyes nestled in sunken sockets, observes their exchange. In one fluid motion, Merrill retrieves the bat as the alien lowers its hand over Morgan's face, a gray gash slicing from its spike into Morgan's nose. As the alien swivels, Merrill springs forward, swinging the bat with force, impacting the creature's back and causing it to drop Morgan, then turning in reaction to its attacker. Seizing the moment, Graham dashes to scoop up Morgan and the syringe that has fallen, as Merrill continues to batter the creature in its abdomen. The alien stumbles into a side table, tipping over a glass of water, and as the water spills onto its shoulder, its green-gray skin erupts in a furious red wound. Both Merrill and Graham scan the room, noting the scattered glasses of water, and Graham turns to Bo with astonishment before swiftly heading outside with Morgan cradled in his arms, Bo trailing closely behind. Out on the veranda, Bo glances back into the living room through a shattered window as Graham steps onto the lawn. Inside, Merrill swings the bat again, targeting glasses on the coffee table, and the alien recoils as liquid splashes onto its skin. Crouching on the lawn, Graham carefully positions his son across his thighs, adjusting the syringe and firmly injecting it into Morgan's leg. Merrill, gearing up for another attack, drives the bat into the alien, sending it sprawling onto its back, colliding with a small sideboard, triggering glasses to topple over, water cascading down onto the crib. The bat's broken head lies amidst shards of glass on the floor, while the alien gasps for breath, its chest struggling to rise and fall. Merrill, in urgent strides, joins Graham and Morgan on the lawn, crouching beside them. Eyes squeezed shut, Graham cradles his son's limp form as Merrill checks Morgan's neck and, recoiling, turns away in dismay. Bo's face crumples as she begins to sob, but then Graham opens his tear-filled eyes, his face trembling with anticipation. Merrill swiftly turns around as Bo watches in awe, and Graham, with bated breath, scarcely dares to look as Morgan slowly lifts his head."

Graham remembers his conversation with Merrill, his brother and former minor league baseball player who always kept his bat nearby for sentimental reasons, and his eyes, glazed with tears, focus on the alien as it rocks back and forth, leaning over its captive hanging limply over its arm. The extraterrestrial, a menacing figure with features reminiscent of popular depictions in science fiction, stands in stark contrast to the warm familiarity of the living room setting. Graham turns slowly from the creature to face Merrill, spotting the baseball bat in its rack mounted on the wall by his brother. He turns back around to stare with stern determination at the alien. Merrill remains motionless, but then turns his gaze from the creature to Graham and looks behind him to the bat. The alien watches him, its small eyes glowing green in their sunken sockets, the eerie color adding to the tension in the dimly lit room.

Graham rushes over to pick up Morgan and the dropped syringe, a device filled with an unknown, potentially dangerous substance, while Merrill strikes the creature in its abdomen. It falls into a side table, knocking over a glass of water, and as the water spills onto its shoulder, an angry red wound erupts in its green-gray skin, revealing water's corrosive effect on the alien biology. Merrill and Graham stare around the room at the collection of discarded glasses of water, remnants of Bo's habit of leaving them around the house out of fear of dehydration, and Graham turns to Bo in astonishment before hurrying outside with Morgan in his arms, Bo following him. On the veranda, the wooden structure that served as a family gathering place during peaceful evenings, Bo looks back into the living room through a broken window as Graham heads out onto the lawn. Merrill swings the bat at glasses on the coffee table, and the alien recoils as its skin is splashed with liquid. Crouched on the lawn, Graham, holding his son across his thighs, adjusts the syringe and thrusts it into Morgan's leg, hoping that it contains an antidote against the alien's toxin. Merrill prepares for another strike, slamming the bat into the alien, causing the creature to topple over, landing on its back and knocking against a small sideboard, causing glasses on the sideboard to tip over, with water cascading down onto the crib, an item once belonging to Graham's now-deceased wife, evoking poignant memories. The broken head of the bat lies on the floor, surrounded by shards of glass, while the alien takes deep, difficult breaths, its chest sinking and failing to rise.

Merrill takes the racket down as the squirrel raises its feather over Morgan's toes, injecting a black ripple shooting from the brush into Morgan's ear.

Sandra shifts her posture slowly from the panda to face Patrick, noticing the umbrella in its stand positioned by his sister. She swivels back to look with fierce intent at the panda. Patrick remains motionless, then changes his focus from the panda to Sandra and glances past her to the umbrella. The panda observes her, its tiny ears flashing red in their furry heads. Patrick picks the umbrella up as the panda lowers its paw over Lila's forehead, tracing a bright line tracing from the claw into Lila's cheek. The panda swivels, and Patrick propels himself at the beast, hitting it on the spine, making the panda release Lila and turn to confront its attacker.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
