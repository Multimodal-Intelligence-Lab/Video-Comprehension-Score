Jeff retorts, sharply, while Lisa glances down at Jeff, not grasping. Meanwhile, Doyle is cleaning his coat lapels with a hankie. Neither Jeff nor Lisa exhibit even the slightest cordiality; their visages are frigid and fixed. Doyle regards them agreeably, starts away toward the entrance, as Lisa, still seething, then speaks frostily. Doyle lifts his hat, unperturbed, and balances on the step, clicking his fingers. He starts up the steps to the entrance, dons his hat, grins, and utters something before quietly shutting the entrance behind him. Jeff rotates his seat around and gazes out to the vicinity, with Lisa standing sullenly behind him.

During this, she has been staring out at Thorwald's dwelling, but Lisa is not gazing in the identical direction as Jeff. She murmurs to Jeff, and now her eyes are peering at the dwelling beneath. Jeff swivels his eyes in the identical direction as hers, witnessing the astonishment of observing her return with a paramour attached, who is much younger than she and more attuned to the promise of an escapade still fresh to him. A light has illuminated in Miss Lonely Hearts' dwelling, and they observe. Her actions are coquettish and overly-feminine, and as she sips her drink peering at him over the rim of the glass, he tosses his off with anxious speed. He advances toward her more warily this instance, culminating in an embrace and a prolonged kiss. He commences kissing her cheek, ear, and neck, but suddenly and fiercely she shoves him away, striking him across the visage. He recoils with shock as she loudly and emphatically commands him out. He flushes with rage and humiliation, his mouth contorting into unpleasant forms as he hurls degrading words back at her, telling her what she is, and she shrieks at him to depart. He exits, slamming the entrance behind him, as she returns dumbly to the spilled beverage, making an ineffective effort to tidy it up before collapsing onto the carpet, sobbing hard enough to convulse her whole physique. Meanwhile, Lisa turns away from Jeff's seat to grab a cigarette from the table."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
