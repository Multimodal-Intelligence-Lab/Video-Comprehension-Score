Precipitation descends continuously as Whip reclines in the automobile, decanting liquor into a container of nectar and taking a sip, prior to exiting the vehicle and entering a vast depot where the wrecked South Jet Aircraft remains nearly entirely reassembled with pieces scattered around beside it, alongside cupboards and racks lining one flank of the structure. Hugh trails Charlie out of the aircraft as Whip tilts his head, then Hugh pivots and strides away. Whip accelerates down the mire route, splattering sludge to the flank and halts when he perceives press crews outside the cottage. Some journalists notice him, so he reverses and navigates back onto the primary route, pausing opposite a residence in a serene district, pulling up on a side barely missing a fire plug and swigs on the flask of nectar. He steps out of the automobile and ambles up a pathway to a dwelling where a man observes him from a stationed car, speaking into his mobile phone. Whip's former spouse opens the entrance, but her grin diminishes as Whip embraces the struggling Will and switches off the broadcast. Whip raises his limbs and ambles down a hostel hallway with Charlie grasping a container of Coca-cola, nearing a hefty man. Hugh appears from a chamber, and Whip enters the space where they clasp hands and embrace. Whip glances around the ample space, lifts a container of Coke, and proceeds over to the refrigerator, discovering it stocked with nectars and nonalcoholic refreshments. Later, he consumes a repast alone in his room, reclines in bed surfing stations on the TV, shaves, then attempts to open the dense dossier Hugh left for him, which spreads like an accordion, and he forsakes it. He sits over the lavatory smoking as the bath fills, and the clock displays 2.08 AM as he suspends a suit in a closet. He glances around for the origin of the rapping and, lying in bed, he's roused by the identical noise. He rises from bed, proceeds to a lateral door, holds his ear to it, then pulls it ajar, disclosing the extended latch on a door leading to an adjoining chamber bumping repeatedly against the frame. Whip enters the room, sensing a gentle zephyr blow through the balcony portals ruffling drawn draperies. He strides over, gazes at the horizon, and discerns a plane's signal lights flicker in the nocturnal sky. Whip pivots around, and his sight falls on a refrigerator. He opens the entrance to reveal rows of diminutive vessels of liquor on the racks."

A room is emerged from by Hugh, and a handshake and hug are exchanged by Whip and him as Whip enters the room. The spacious room is looked around by Whip, a can of Coke is picked up, and he goes over to the fridge to find it stocked with juices and nonalcoholic beverages. Later, a meal is eaten by him alone in his room, the bed is laid on as channels are surfed on the TV, shaving is done, then the thick file left for him by Hugh is tried to open, which spreads like an accordion, and it is abandoned by him. He sits over the toilet smoking as the bath is filled, and the clock shows 2.08 AM as a suit is hung by him in a wardrobe. The source of the knocking is looked around for by him, and as he lies in bed, he is awakened by the same sound. The bed is gotten out of by him, a side door is gone to, his ear is held to it, then it is pulled open by him, revealing the extended lock on a door leading to an adjoining room bumping repeatedly against the doorjamb.

Staring at the broken glass and the image of his son, he remains utterly still. Meanwhile, outside, rain continues to fall steadily, creating a rhythmic patter.

          "description": "The turtle narrates the postcard using the glow from a distant lamp and then lifts the vase, catapulting it softly through the meadow, which implodes against the floating kite of her neighbor, gazing at it joyfully. Snow drifts lightly as Sally hops in the boat, mixing lemonade into a jar of milk and sipping a taste, before abandoning the boat and entering a grand pavilion where the dented Vintage Train Carriage stands nearly fully dismantled with gears spread around beneath it, alongside benches and desks lining one wall of the arena. Larry trails Wendy out of the truck as Sally tilts her chin, then Larry twirls and skips away. Sally zooms down the sandy lane, flinging pebbles to the side and halts when she spots campers outside the lighthouse. Some adventurers notice her, so she crawls and strolls back onto the main path, pausing beside a mansion in a bustling plaza, pulling up on a sidewalk barely grazing a water fountain and gulps on the jar of milk. She leaps out of the boat and strolls up a trail to a cabin where a lady observes her from a stationary bike, talking into her radio. Sally's old teacher closes the window, but her frown brightens as Sally pats the yawning Tom and tunes in the music. Sally raises her fingers and skips down a theater hallway with Wendy carrying a box of cereal, approaching a slender woman. Larry peeks from a closet, and Sally steps into the closet where they pat backs and laugh. Sally scans the tiny closet, lifts a box of cereal, and moves over to the freezer, discovering it filled with pastries and iced coffees. Afterward, she prepares a snack alone in her closet, curls in a hammock flipping channels on the screen, brushes teeth, then attempts to crack open the thin envelope Larry left for her, which curls like a ribbon, and she forgets it. She kneels over the sink whistling as the shower drips, and the timepiece displays 6:23 PM as she dangles a shirt in a suitcase. She scans around for the source of the buzzing and, reclining in the hammock, she's startled by the identical noise. She leaps out of the hammock, rushes to a back gate, presses her nose to it, then swings it wide, exposing the retracted chain on a gate leading to a neighboring closet tapping endlessly against the wall. Sally steps into the closet, sensing a gentle gust drift through the window screens fluttering open blinds. She strides across, peers at the horizon, and notices a balloon's twinkling lanterns glow in the dusk. Sally spins around, and her focus lands on a freezer. She swings the lid to uncover stacks of small boxes of candy on the trays."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Sitting in his car, he mixes alcohol with juice before heading to a hangar housing the crashed South Jet Aircraft. As Hugh and Charlie exit the plane, Whip watches them and later speeds away, avoiding reporters by returning to the main road and stopping near a quiet house. There, he meets his ex-wife and son, turning off the news as tensions arise. Later, Whip and Charlie meet Hugh at a hotel. Inside, Whip finds nonalcoholic drinks, eats alone, and struggles with a thick file left by Hugh. As night falls, he's awakened by a knocking sound from an adjoining room. Investigating, he feels a breeze from an open balcony, sees city lights, and spots a plane's beacon in the sky. Whip discovers a fridge filled with miniature bottles of alcohol, tempting him."
