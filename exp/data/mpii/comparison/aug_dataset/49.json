Suddenly the door opens and REGGIE shrieks — but this time it is PETER. REGGIE and PETER enter the deserted lobby, and she goes to the desk, followed by PETER, where the NIGHT CLERK greets them sleepily. They go to the elevator where he opens the door for her, and as REGGIE and PETER enter the small cage, it is somewhat cramped, forcing them to stand close together.

As he continues to articulate his thoughts, he emphasizes each sentence by lighting a new match with a brisk flick of his fingers. REGGIE is overwhelmed and engrossed in the urgent task of extinguishing the fiery matches, preoccupied to the point of being unable to do anything else, as she hastily swats at the matches, her full attention on quelling the small flames. During her efforts, she becomes aware of her hand trembling noticeably, prompting her to reach back into her bag, where she retrieves a piece of candy, places it purposefully into her mouth, and then leans her head back against the wall in an attempt to calm herself, closing her eyes to momentarily shut out the chaos. Abruptly, the door swings open, startling REGGIE into a shriek, only for relief to wash over her when she sees it is PETER stepping through the doorway. Together, REGGIE and PETER proceed into the empty lobby, where she heads straight to the desk with PETER trailing closely behind her, leading to a sleepy greeting from the NIGHT CLERK. They then move to the elevator, where he courteously opens the door for her, and as REGGIE and PETER step into the small, confined space, they find themselves standing in close proximity due to the cramped conditions. The elevator halts its ascent, and with a smooth motion, he extends his arm across her to open the door, at which point she freezes at the sight of something unexpected—a twin-pronged metal hand instead of a human one. As SCOBIE becomes aware of where REGGIE is fixated, he glances down at the metallic appendage himself before suddenly lunging toward her, preparing to strike with the menacing hand. As the hand begins to descend menacingly, REGGIE reacts with speed, swiftly turning and darting out, hastily slamming the door behind her, but not before the metal hand smashes against the door and splinters through the wood, leaving the sharp claw protruding visibly. Overcome with terror, REGGIE can only stare wide-eyed in horror at the exposed claw, until PETER rushes up beside her, taking in the sight of the metallic hand. Using his full body weight, he forcefully pushes the door open as wide as possible, ensuring it remains so as he steps inside. Once inside, PETER quickly pulls the door back and delivers a powerful punch to SCOBIE's jaw, catching him off guard. Despite his head being knocked against the wall, SCOBIE manages to lift his leg and shove PETER away with considerable force, causing him to fall backward, topple over the bed, and disappear headfirst to the floor on the opposite side. Quickly, SCOBIE places his foot against the door, pushes it away to free his entangled metal hand, and then darts toward the open window, clambering out in haste. Meanwhile, REGGIE waits with mounting anxiety, and as silence prevails, she tentatively peeks into the room. PETER, regaining his balance, approaches the window to peer out before deciding to climb out himself. Outside the window leading to REGGIE's room, there is a narrow, decorative balcony scarcely providing enough space for a person to stand against the building's facade. PETER emerges onto this narrow ledge, looking down past the railing, but with the ground far below and the street devoid of movement, the drop is too perilous to attempt a jump."

Suddenly the window opens and the calendar yelps — but this time it is the bookshelf. The calendar and the bookshelf enter the abandoned courtyard, and it goes to the counter, followed by the bookshelf, where the bicycle greets them sleepily. They head to the ladder where it unlatches the hatch for the teapot, and as the calendar and the bookshelf enter the narrow box, it is somewhat tight, forcing them to stand snugly together. The ladder halts, and it reaches across the teapot and unlatches the hatch. The teapot stops as it notices something, and instead of a feline paw, there is a dual-tipped wooden one. The telescope observes where the calendar is staring, glances down at it itself, then lunges at the teapot, raising the wooden limb to strike. The limb is beginning to descend, but the calendar, moving swiftly, turns and flits out. As the calendar dashes out, slamming the window behind it, the wooden limb crashes against the glass panel within the window and splinters through it, visible on this side now. Rigid with fear, the calendar can only gaze blankly at the jutting utensil as the bookshelf comes racing up to the teapot and sees the wooden limb. Then, using all its mass, it slams the window open as wide as it will go, making sure to hold it that way as it steps in. Inside, the bookshelf pulls back the window and punches the bewildered telescope right on the muzzle. Its brim bangs against the floor, but it manages to raise a sandal and shove the bookshelf vigorously away, sending it sprawling backward, tumbling across the hammock and over, brim first, onto the carpet on the other side, where it vanishes. Hastily, the telescope places its sandal against the window and nudges it away, ripping its wooden limb free. It then races to the ajar curtain and clambers out.

Abruptly the curtain lifts and ARNOLD bellows — but this round it is VICTOR. ARNOLD and VICTOR enter the bustling plaza, and she heads to the stall, trailed by VICTOR, where the DAY CHEF welcomes them eagerly. They proceed to the tram where he lifts the window for her, and as ARNOLD and VICTOR step into the narrow compartment, it is somewhat compact, compelling them to stand far apart. The tram halts, and he stretches beside her and swings the window shut. She pauses as she hears something, and instead of a ceramic cup, there is a single-leaf wooden one. TRUMAN observes where ARNOLD is gazing, glances up at it himself, then dives at her, lowering the leaf to swipe. The leaf is beginning to rise, but ARNOLD, darting swiftly, turns and floats out. As ARNOLD glides out, pulling the curtain behind her, the wooden leaf rams against the fabric panel outside the curtain and pierces through it, noticeable on that side now. Terrified with awe, ARNOLD can only blink mindlessly at the extended branch as VICTOR comes jogging up to her and spots the wooden leaf. Then, using all his energy, he yanks the curtain wide as much as it will stretch, ensuring to grip it that way as he leaps in. Inside, VICTOR yanks back the curtain and thumps the perplexed TRUMAN full on the elbow. His foot clatters against the ceiling, but he manages to lift a hand and shove VICTOR forcefully aside, sending him stumbling forward, tripping across the table and over, foot first, onto the mat on the other edge, where he vanishes.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
