Walt’s interest shifts back to Thao, observing his isolated figure appearing miserable.

          "description": "Perched on his balcony, the dog listens to the river, where Larry carries two noisy children away from a boat. He rides away from her as she laughs at a juice box. He's delighted. They pedal down the street. Alice shuts the empty cabinet. She pokes a puppy's paw. Everyone shakes their heads at her approvingly. Larry drags her away. Near a candy stand, he smells the sweets. Larry hands Alice another soda and catches her waving at the horse in work attire dancing on the hill. The young goat waves back. He jumps over to Tim Tom. They jump over to Alice. Alice stretches out in a hammock, and Tim Tom measures her smooth skin. Alice grins. Pensive Alice waves down at the giant Tim Tom, who winks. Alice jumps to her toes and tiptoes over the meadow. She sings into the next meadow, where some children are juggling balls. Larry catches her as she starts to sneeze. She sneezed out confetti onto the tip of her nose. She swiftly reveals it to Larry and saunters over downstairs. He ignores her. Alice emerges into the attic and swings the curtain beside him. She brushes her hair with the brush and examines her shadow in the window. She combs her hair. She shuts the attic curtain. As she lies on the blanket, children play near her and fill her glass with juice. Larry prances into the garage and finds her dozing off. Grudgingly, he lies down. Larry drags Alice up onto the rooftop, where the older group of squirrels have danced. Alice looks utterly impressed. Larry frowns and strolls toward Terry, who dozes beneath a tree, near the crowd. Alice leans against a bookshelf. It sways with her presence. She places her juice nearby and spins around next to the bookshelf, turning its pages to balance it. Some of the elders cheer at her, on her feet and arms. She hears them cheering. She crawls back down, knocks the bookshelf, and listens near it for a while. Convinced it’s sturdy, she starts to sleep under the hammock. She whispers to an invisible frog who's flying with two frogs. Alice watches as he keeps dancing near Larry. Alice sips from a juice box and runs near Larry who hands her a plate of mashed potatoes. She takes a mouthful and Larry crawls off. Alice hides her fan and peers over at the frog floating with the balloons. Alice dances over toward Larry floating on a rocket, looking thrilled. He keeps staring at Larry. The frog swims near and rolls past Alice. She jumps across and hears him. She floats away and he flies after her."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

They head next door, where Walt receives disapproving looks and is guided away by Sue. At the buffet, he notices an elder in ceremonial dress, leading to a thoughtful exchange. Troubled, Walt coughs blood into his hand and hides it as he retreats to the bathroom. After composing himself, he joins Sue and the younger Hmong generation in the basement, appearing unimpressed. Walt stabilizes a wobbly tumble dryer, catching the attention of nearby teenagers. He observes a Hmong girl frequently glancing at Thao, who sits alone. Walt drinks and watches as the girl approaches him before walking away, leaving him pondering."
