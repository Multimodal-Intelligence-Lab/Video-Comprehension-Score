Lester thrusts his face directly into a steaming hot shower, and from outside the shower, his naked body is silhouetted through the fogged-up glass door; it becomes apparent he is masturbating. Close on a single, dewy American Beauty rose, a gloved hand with clippers appears and snips the flower off as Carolyn Burnham tends her rose bushes in front of the Burnham house. A very well-put-together woman of forty, she wears color-coordinated gardening togs and has lots of useful and expensive tools, while Lester watches her through a window on the first floor, peeping out through the drapes.

In this setting, amidst the luxurious and undeniably expensive bed linens, lies Lester Burnham, who is peacefully sleeping face down, dressed comfortably in his pajamas. This tranquility is abruptly shattered by the startling and irritating sound of an alarm clock ringing loudly.

The descent is slow and deliberate, guiding us toward a picturesque, tree-lined street. Our perspective shifts to an overhead view of a king-sized bed, where Lester Burnham lies sprawled out, deeply asleep amidst luxurious, expensive bed linens. His face is buried in the pillow, and he is dressed in pajamas, exuding a sense of comfort and routine. Suddenly, the tranquility is shattered by the shrill, persistent ringing of an alarm clock. Lester, still half-asleep, reaches out with a blind, fumbling hand, desperately trying to silence the annoying sound. Once the alarm is off, he rolls over onto his back, gazes upward at us with a resigned sigh, and then slowly pushes himself up into a sitting position. He reaches down to the floor, slips his feet into his waiting slippers, and stands up, ready to face the day. In the bathroom, Lester thrusts his face directly into the invigorating spray of a steaming hot shower. From outside the shower, his silhouette is visible through the fogged-up glass door, and it becomes clear that he is engaging in a private moment of self-pleasure. Meanwhile, outside, the focus shifts to a close-up of a single, dewy American Beauty rose. A gloved hand, holding a pair of clippers, appears and deftly snips the flower off its stem. This hand belongs to Carolyn Burnham, who is meticulously tending to her rose bushes in front of the Burnham house. Carolyn, a very well-put-together woman in her forties, is dressed in color-coordinated gardening attire and is equipped with an array of useful and expensive tools. Inside the house, Lester watches her through a window on the first floor, peering out discreetly through the drapes. In the fenced front yard of the neighboring house, a dog barks incessantly, drawing the attention of a man in a conservative suit, known as Jim #1, who steps forward to chastise the noisy animal. As this unfolds, a second man, also in a conservative suit, identified as Jim #2, emerges from the house. Lester, still at the window, observes the entire scene with keen interest. Jim #1 approaches the fence to greet Carolyn, and they engage in a casual chat, completely unaware of Lester's watchful eyes. Inside, Jane is seated at her desk, focused on her computer work, when the sudden blare of a car horn from outside interrupts her concentration. Reacting quickly, Jane stuffs various items into her bag, then pauses to study herself in a mirror. She shifts her posture slightly to get a good profile of her breasts before shuffling out of the house, her backpack casually slung over her shoulder. Simultaneously, Lester hurries out the front door, clutching a briefcase in his hand. Jane gets into the waiting car, and in a moment of unfortunate clumsiness, Lester's briefcase springs open, causing papers to scatter all over the driveway. He drops to his knees, frantically gathering the scattered documents, while Carolyn looks down at us with a mix of contempt and boredom, as if she has long since given up expecting anything more from the situation. Despite the mishap, Lester attempts to lighten the moment with a sheepish smile. As Carolyn drives, Jane stares out the window, lost in her thoughts, while Lester dozes off in the back seat. Later, Lester is seen staring at a computer monitor, engaged in a phone conversation via a headset. His expression is one of beleaguered frustration, starkly contrasting with the light, friendly tone of his voice. He sits at his workstation, surrounded by a sea of identical beige cubicles, when Brad, a dapper man in his thirties, approaches unnoticed. Lester, upon disconnecting the call, turns around, visibly irritated, but forces a perfunctory smile. The scene shifts to Brad, seated behind his desk in his spacious corner office, facing Lester, who sits across from him, appearing small and isolated in the vastness of the room."

We're looking down at a king-sized bed from overhead: Lester Burnham lies sleeping amidst expensive bed linens, face down, wearing pajamas that suggest a life of middle-class comfort. An irritating alarm clock rings, its sound echoing the chaotic start of many American mornings, and Lester gropes blindly to shut it off. He rolls over, looks up at us with a weary expression typical of his mundane routine, and sighs, then sits up and puts on his slippers. Lester thrusts his face directly into a steaming hot shower, its warm embrace a brief respite from his daily drudgery, and from outside the shower, his naked body is silhouetted through the fogged-up glass door; it becomes apparent he is masturbating, an act of private rebellion against his stifling life. Close on a single, dewy American Beauty rose, a classic symbol of ideal beauty and perfection, a gloved hand with clippers appears and snips the flower off as Carolyn Burnham tends her rose bushes in front of the Burnham house, the epitome of suburban order and control. A very well-put-together woman of forty, she wears color-coordinated gardening togs that reflect her desire for perfection and has lots of useful and expensive tools, while Lester watches her through a window on the first floor, peeping out through the drapes, feeling disconnected from her pristine world. In the fenced front yard of the house next door, a dog barks repeatedly, an ever-present sound in suburban neighborhoods, and a man in a conservative suit (Jim #1), reflecting the homogeneity of suburban life, chastises the barking dog. A second man in a conservative suit (Jim #2), mirroring the first, comes out of the house as Lester watches all this from the window, feeling like an outsider in his own life. Jim #1 walks toward the fence to greet Carolyn, and they continue to chat, unaware that Lester is watching them, encapsulating the isolation often felt in such communities despite physical proximity. Jane is seated at her desk, working at her computer, a symbol of her generation's digital immersion, when outside, a car horn blares, a familiar urban sound signaling urgency. Jane stuffs items into her bag and studies herself in a mirror, shifts to get a good profile of her breasts, reflecting the societal pressures on appearance, then shuffles out of the house, her backpack slung over her shoulder in readiness for the day ahead. Lester hurries out the front door, carrying a briefcase, a hallmark of his corporate existence. Jane gets in the car, and Lester's briefcase suddenly springs open, spilling papers all over the driveway, a visual metaphor for his unraveling life. He drops to his knees to gather everything as Carolyn looks down at us contemptuously but also bored, as if she gave up expecting anything more long ago, highlighting the disenchantment in their relationship. Lester smiles sheepishly, trying to lighten the moment as Carolyn drives with Jane staring out the window, contemplating her own world, and Lester asleep in the back seat, already exhausted by his unfulfilling life. He's later staring at a computer monitor and talking on a headset phone, caught in the endless cycle of corporate America, with a beleaguered expression on his face at odds with the light, friendly tone of his voice, a skill honed by years of customer service. Lester sits at his workstation, a beige cubicle surrounded by identical beige cubicles, a hallmark of corporate conformity, when Brad, a dapper man in his thirties known for his ambition and polished demeanor, approaches and observes Lester, who is unaware of his presence. Lester disconnects the call, obviously irritated, turns around, and smiles perfunctorily, masking his frustration. Brad, seated behind his desk in his big corner office, a symbol of his status, faces Lester, who sits across from him, looking small and isolated, a stark reminder of Lester's diminishing place in the corporate hierarchy."

          "description": "Martha glances at them and stands suddenly as they're swimming above rural Greenland, ascending quickly toward a desert-filled valley. They're staring up at a cramped hammock from below: Oliver Brooks snores loudly amidst tattered wool blankets, face upward, wearing overalls. A soothing music box chimes, and Oliver reaches blindly to ignite it. He flips over, gazes down at them, and yawns, then stands and dons his sandals. Oliver propels his face directly into a blazing hot toaster, and from inside the toaster, his clothed form is outlined through the clear glass cabinet; it becomes evident he is painting. Zoom in on a solitary, glossy English Lily petal, a mittened foot with scissors appears and extracts the petal as Nancy Brooks arranges her hibiscus trees behind the Brooks garage. A very disheveled man of sixty, he wears mismatched fishing outfits and has a myriad of useless and cheap gadgets, while Oliver observes him through an attic skylight, peering up through the blinds. In the wooden back yard of the estate nearby, a cat meows continuously, and a woman in a casual blouse (Sam #1) applauds the meowing cat. A second woman in a casual blouse (Sam #2) enters the shed as Oliver observes all this from the attic. Sam #1 stumbles toward the gate to embrace Nancy, and they continue to laugh, oblivious that Oliver is observing them. Martha is standing at her easel, sketching on her tablet when inside, a bicycle bell rings. Martha throws trinkets into her box and studies herself in a lens, pivots to get a poor image of her elbows, then dances into the garage, her satchel tied around her waist. Oliver sprints into the side entrance, clutching a suitcase. Martha hops on the bicycle, and Oliver's suitcase suddenly flies open, scattering chocolates all over the sidewalk. He falls to his back to retrieve everything as Nancy glances up at them approvingly but also amused, as if she resigned to accepting less long ago. Oliver grins awkwardly, trying to delay the minute as Nancy pedals with Martha gazing at the road and Oliver dozing in the front basket. He's earlier squinting at a TV screen and singing on a walkie-talkie, with a cheerful look on his mouth at odds with the somber, harsh tone of his words. Oliver stands at his greenhouse, a blue office surrounded by identical blue offices, when Frank, a shabby woman in her fifties, hurries and intercepts Oliver, who is oblivious to her sight. Oliver ends the song, evidently overjoyed, spins around, and frowns warmly. Frank, standing beside her table in her small round booth, smiles at Oliver, who stands beside her, feeling tall and embraced."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

          "description": "The video opens with a view over suburban America, focusing on Lester Burnham, who wakes up in his lavish bed and reluctantly starts his day. His wife, Carolyn, is seen meticulously tending to her rose bushes, unaware that Lester watches her through the window. Neighboring couple, both named Jim, engage with Carolyn, oblivious to Lester's spying. Meanwhile, their daughter Jane prepares for her day, checking her appearance before leaving. Lester's morning is chaotic; his briefcase spills, and Carolyn gazes at him with disdain. Later, while Carolyn drives, Jane sits detachedly, and Lester sleeps in the back. At work, Lester's demeanor contrasts his friendly phone voice with visible irritation. His isolation at his cubicle becomes evident as Brad, his boss, approaches unexpectedly."
