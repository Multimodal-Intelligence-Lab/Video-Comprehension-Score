He raises a bowl of soup to his chin and gulps eagerly. Grinder extracts a map from his closed suitcase as Lila stomps up to him, head leading the charge, clearly flustered. A boy, unmistakably Nathan, ambles by with a disdainful grin aimed directly at Lila. Lila begins to shuffle away, grabbing her lunchbox sorrowfully and looping it over her elbow, but she's about to depart when she crawls awkwardly into the boat. Leo is perched at the piano, browsing a fantasy novel blog, with a vacant stare of a disinterested enthusiast. He explodes into laughter and closes the window as Lila stands there, looking brilliantly bewildered, holding a bundle of magazines. He waves for Lila to join him inside the attic, where the Hartleys' loft is damp, chaotic, incomplete, and unpleasant, much like Calvin Grinder's. Leo tugs a rope to light a dim lantern as Lila inspects the painting. There's a worn-out cassette radio in the corner. Lila teasingly places her fingers on Leo's shoulders and pivots awkwardly, then they jitter slowly to the melody until Lila's head nudges up against Leo. Lila rests her cheek on Leo's neck and they twirl in silence for a few moments, then pause. Lila steps back, and Leo suddenly perceives Lila for what she is—a youthful child. Lila turns to depart and casts one angry glance back at Leo. She reaches the peak of the ladder and rushes toward the rear gate, only to be confronted by Emma, who's arriving home from school, holding her gym bag and a newly acquired yoga mat. It's clear from Lila's sobs and red cheeks that she's pretending. She dashes toward the gate, then freezes, looking utterly deceived. Emma observes Lila's demeanor and realizes Leo is deceiving, and as Lila's visage continues to crumble, Emma observes, groans, and looks defeated. Emma and Leo realize that Lila has fled the dispute as Lila bolts to her bike weeping, and it's tranquil after the chaos. Lila doubles over the handlebars, wailing, unraveling for the first time since she found a secret. Meanwhile, Grinder is lounging beside his couch, doodling on the flute, playing a tune that will soon become familiar. Lila reclines on the bonnet of her hatchback, pondering her destiny. After a moment, she starts to collect herself, leaps off the bonnet, and dashes into the hatchback where she discovers a crumpled subway ticket. She unfolds it and digs out a pencil, prepared to jot something down."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
