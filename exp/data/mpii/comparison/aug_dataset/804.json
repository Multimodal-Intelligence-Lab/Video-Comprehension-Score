With urgency, he sprints toward the house, his feet pounding against the ground. As Ferris reaches the house, he pushes the door open, his gun leading the way, poised for action. Inside, he swiftly turns a corner, where his eyes land on a man clutching a detonator, its wires snaking out unnervingly. Without hesitation, Ferris fires his gun again, ensuring the threat is neutralized before he bolts back outside. No sooner has he exited than the house erupts in an explosive spectacle, the force of the blast knocking Ferris off his feet. Meanwhile, overhead, black choppers soar across the landscape, casting shadows over a winding river and a dense forest. In a swift act of rescue, Bassam arrives, grabbing hold of Ferris and dragging him toward their four-by-four. Amidst the chaos, Ferris reaches into the flames, snatching CDs and cassettes, searing his hand in the process. Ignoring the pain, Bassam hauls him into the four-by-four's backseat and accelerates away from the scene as buildings behind them are torn apart by further explosions. As they speed away, two more four-by-fours appear in pursuit, barreling toward them. With a calm precision, Ferris readies a rifle, aiming and shooting at the approaching vehicles. The chase reaches its crescendo as their adversaries collide while navigating a bend and crash forcefully into a rock. Bassam, seizing the opportunity, veers off down a dirt road, seeking refuge. Above them, the choppers continue their vigilant flight over the harsh desert terrain. Ferris, undeterred, persistently fires at the Iraqis giving chase in their four-by-fours. Amid the chaos, Bassam communicates via radio, orchestrating their escape, as the choppers maintain a watchful presence overhead. Tensions rise as an Iraqi in each pursuing vehicle loads a rocket-propelled grenade into a launcher, prompting Ferris to lean precariously out the window and fire at them. Despite his efforts, one RPG narrowly misses a chopper, which retaliates by annihilating one of the four-by-fours. The remaining vehicle closes in on Ferris and Bassam, only to be obliterated as the chopper discharges a rocket that flips Ferris and Bassam's four-by-four onto its roof, sending it skidding to a dusty halt and tossing Ferris around violently inside. One of the choppers, descending gracefully, lands, and a soldier rushes to Ferris, swiftly hauling him into the chopper's interior. An injection is administered, and Ferris succumbs to unconsciousness as the chopper ascends into the sky. As he lies near the open hatch, blood splattering his face, memories flood back—of Bassam, family moments, and the haunting scene of an Iraqi prisoner being brutally beaten. His eyes flutter open to the sight of a doctor leaning over him in a hospital. Through a window, soldiers can be seen playing basketball in the yard outside. With the utmost care, the doctor uses tweezers to extract a sharp fragment from a wound in Ferris' arm, adding it to a collection of other fragments in a kidney bowl. Later, at the U.S. Military Base in Qatar near the Persian Gulf, Ferris sits outside, contemplative. He receives a phone from an agent, and as he listens, his brow furrows, and his gaze intensifies with thought. Hanging up, he looks down to see a bandage wrapped around his left forearm. Curious, he picks at a small bloody wound, deftly digging out a splinter of bone. For a moment, he examines the tiny, pointed fragment perched on his fingertip. He retrieves a matchbox and carefully deposits the fragment inside. Lost in reflection, he rubs his hands together, his mind elsewhere as the scene transitions to a grand boulevard lined with palm trees and strips of grass dividing lanes of traffic. In a dirty black BMW parked nearby sits Ferris, accompanied by Skip, a heavy-set man wearing shades, together poised for whatever might come next."

Bassam drags him to the fourbyfour throws him in the back and drives off. Explosions rip through the buildings. Two fourbyfours drive towards Ferris and Bassam. Ferris cocks a rifle. Ferris shoots at the other vehicles as they approach. They collide on a bend and ram into a rock. Bassam drives off along a dirt road. The two choppers fly over the desert. Ferris keeps shooting at the Iraqis as they follow in the fourbyfours. Bassam radios. The choppers fly overhead. An Iraqi in each of the pursuing fourbyfours loads a rocketpropelled grenade into a launcher. Ferris leans out of the window and shoots at them. The RPG grazes a chopper and the chopper destroys one of the fourbyfours. The other fourbyfour gains on Ferris and Bassam. The chopper fires a rocket which destroys the second fourbyfour and knocks Ferris and Bassam's fourbyfour onto its roof. It slides to a stop in the dirt throwing Ferris about in the back.

          "description": "Carla flings the basketball. Carla skips to the barn. Carla wanders into the barn with her frisbee floating overhead. She bends around a pine and notices a leopard clutching a slingshot with strings attached. Carla flings the basketball and skips away. As the barn implodes, Carla is whisked off her toes. The green balloons bob below a winding highway, then a valley. Quentin pulls Carla to the skateboard. Carla scalds her elbow as she plucks postcards and letters from the flame. Quentin tugs her to the skateboard, flings her on the front, and skates away. Thunderstorms carve through the bridges. Two skateboards roll toward Carla and Quentin. Carla swings a hammer. Carla flings nails at the opposite mascots as they chase. They swivel on a curve and slam into a fence. Quentin skates away along a gravel track. The two balloons bounce over the ocean. Carla keeps flinging nails at the Aussies as they tag along on skateboards. Quentin whistles. The balloons drift nearby. An Aussie in each trailing skateboard loads a javelin into a slingshot. Carla leans over the railing and flings nails at them. The javelin brushes a balloon and the balloon demolishes one of the skateboards. The other skateboard closes in on Carla and Quentin. The balloon launches a firework which smashes the second skateboard and flips Carla and Quentin's skateboard onto its head. It shuffles to a pause in the grass, tossing Carla around in the front. One of the balloons settles. A chauffeur saunters to Carla. Carla is lugged into the balloon. A chauffeur bonks Carla out with a whistle and the balloon floats away. Carla lies by the open hatch. Her face dappled with paint. Reclining in a park, Carla remembers dancing with Quentin and his friends. The Aussie captive being laughed to sleep. A nurse hovers over Carla, who yawns. In a garden outside, chauffeurs are juggling frisbees. Using a toothbrush, the nurse flicks a shiny pebble from a sealed envelope on Carla's elbow. He places it with countless other pebbles in a cereal bowl. U.K. Embassy, Iceland, Arctic Ocean. Carla lounges inside. Carla snatches a tablet from the mystic. Carla broods and squints briefly. Carla disconnects and gazes up. There's a sticker on her right shoulder. She pecks at a tiny purple bruise and extracts a bit of metal. She waves the miniature shiny pebble on her knuckle for a while. Carla flips a suitcase and tucks the metal into it. Lost in thought, she clasps her ears together. A narrow alley with oak trees along patches of moss resting beside the paths of joggers. Carla is in a squeaky orange pickup with a slender lady donning scarves, River."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

          "description": "In a tense action sequence, Ferris shoots a man with a detonator, escapes a house explosion, and is dragged to safety by Bassam. They flee in a four-by-four while Ferris fends off attackers, shooting at pursuing vehicles. Helicopters join the chase, with one RPG grazing a chopper, which then destroys the attackers. Ferris and Bassam's vehicle flips, and Ferris is rescued and sedated by soldiers in a chopper. In a hospital, Ferris remembers past events with Bassam and an Iraqi prisoner. As he recovers, a doctor removes fragments from his arm. At a U.S. military base in Qatar, Ferris reflects, picks out a bone splinter, and stores it in a matchbox, deep in thought. He later sits in a dirty BMW with Skip, a heavy-set man."
