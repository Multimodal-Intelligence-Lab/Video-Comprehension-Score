Umbridge's chair is upholstered in pink, and Harry notices two passive pink shoes placed neatly on the floor. He crosses to the desk, where there's a silver teapot and a China cup and saucer on lace doilies, and searches drawers. He finds files with photos attached, one of Mad-Eye Moody with a red cross through the photo and another of Professor Dumbledore crossed through in red. The Supervisor turns, and Harry emerges from Umbridge's office grim-faced, turns, and walks away, sopping wet. Harry and Ron leave the lift at courtroom level, where a man is hauled away by two guards. Harry tugs Ron's lapel, and they walk towards the courtroom where, from a high bench, Umbridge addresses a woman sitting below while wearing the locket around her neck. Mary sees Ron, and Harry pushes Ron forward into the courtroom, staying back himself, while Yaxley sits watching the proceedings.

          "description": "Harry sneaks within Umbridge's chamber, where the partitions are adorned with China dishes displaying images of felines, and lifts his rod. Umbridge's seat is cushioned in pink, and Harry observes two inactive pink footwear positioned tidily on the ground. He traverses to the bureau, where there's a silver kettle and a China mug and plate on lace coasters, and examines drawers. He discovers folders with pictures affixed, one of Mad-Eye Moody with a scarlet mark through the snapshot and another of Professor Dumbledore marked through in red. The Supervisor rotates, and Harry exits Umbridge's chamber somber-faced, turns, and strides away, drenched wet. Harry and Ron depart the elevator at tribunal level, where a man is dragged away by two security. Harry pulls Ron's collar, and they proceed towards the tribunal where, from a lofty seat, Umbridge addresses a lady seated beneath while wearing the trinket around her neck. Mary witnesses Ron, and Harry nudges Ron forward into the tribunal, remaining back himself, while Yaxley sits observing the process. Ron stands beside Mary, Harry nods, and she holds it up as Dementors linger above. Harry's eyes are fixed on Umbridge as he notices the trinket around her neck, and his rod falls into his grasp. Umbridge perceives it, Hermione quivers, and his visage contorts as Ron zaps Yaxley. Hermione snatches the trinket from Umbridge and flings it to Harry, now reverted to himself, as Yaxley sees them dart away. The lingering Dementors pursue the group into the elevator, but they're halted by the shutting gate as their limbs and elongated fingers extend through the metal lattice, attempting to drain the spirits out of the four in the elevator. Harry lifts his rod, compelling the Dementors back with a charm, and the elevator speeds upward. The atrium is bustling, with individuals upon walkways and at ground level, as an elevator arrives and the group glances around before stepping out into it. Hermione and Harry are both reverted to themselves, but Ron still resembles Reginald, and Mary grasps him, taking his visage in her palms and kissing him on the mouth. During the kiss, Ron diminishes and changes back to himself, and Mary steps back as the true Reginald appears in his undershirt and shorts, seeing Ron, who turns. Uniformed security pursue Harry as Yaxley arrives in the elevator, and Hermione and Ron chase after Harry. Yaxley forces past individuals, launching bursts of energy at the trio, barely missing them as Harry twirls his rod at a heap of notices, causing the bounty notices for Harry Undesirable Number One to whirl around the atrium, nearly swallowing Yaxley, who brushes them aside. The trio reaches the passageway as Yaxley directs another burst, but the charm disarms Yaxley. Ron winces as he sprints, glances back, and sees Yaxley advancing on him."

He moves deliberately towards the imposing desk, where a gleaming silver teapot and a delicate China cup and saucer rest atop intricate lace doilies, and begins to rummage through the drawers carefully.

Mary glances towards Ron, at which point Harry gives Ron a push forward into the courtroom while he holds back, remaining outside the proceedings.

          "description": "Harry, moving with quiet determination, slips inside Umbridge's office, a room adorned with walls covered in China plates displaying images of cats, creating an almost whimsical yet unsettling atmosphere. He carefully raises his wand, scanning the space intently. The chair, upholstered in a distinct shade of pink, catches his eye, along with a pair of passive pink shoes placed with meticulous neatness on the floor. With purposeful steps, he approaches the desk where a silver teapot and a China cup and saucer rest on delicate lace doilies, suggesting a feigned sense of elegance. He methodically opens and searches through the drawers, rifling through their contents until he discovers files adorned with photographs, each marked with a red cross, notably one of Mad-Eye Moody and another of Professor Dumbledore, each photo exuding a sense of foreboding. As the Supervisor turns, Harry emerges from Umbridge's office, his demeanor grim and resolute, his clothes soaked, indicating a prior unseen struggle, before turning away and making his exit. He and Ron step out of the lift on the courtroom level, their attention briefly caught by a man being forcefully escorted away by two guards. Harry, with urgency, tugs on Ron's lapel, signaling him to follow as they proceed towards the courtroom entrance. From a high bench within the courtroom, Umbridge presides over the proceedings, her voice authoritative and grating, while wearing a locket around her neck that captures Harry's focus. Mary, seated below, catches Ron's eye, prompting Harry to push Ron forward into the courtroom while he tactically hangs back. Yaxley, ever watchful, observes the proceedings. As Ron positions himself beside Mary, a silent understanding passes as Harry nods, prompting Mary to hold up the locket. Overhead, Dementors hover ominously, their presence casting a chilling effect. Harry's gaze remains locked on Umbridge, the locket around her neck drawing his concentration as his wand slides purposefully into his hand. The confrontation heightens as Umbridge becomes aware, her eyes widening, while Hermione quivers with anticipation. Ron's face contorts in concentration as he manages to zap Yaxley with a spell. In a moment of decisive action, Hermione seizes the locket from around Umbridge's neck and swiftly tosses it to Harry, a transformation complete as he regains his composure. Yaxley, witnessing their bold move, watches as they make a hasty retreat. The group, pursued by the hovering Dementors, rushes into the lift, their escape almost thwarted by the Dementors' skeletal arms and elongated fingers reaching through the metal grill, attempting to drain the very essence from the four confined within. Harry, with quick reflexes, raises his wand, the tip glowing with energy as he performs a spell that forces the Dementors to recoil, allowing the lift to shoot upwards. As the lift halts, the atrium buzzes with activity, people bustling on walkways and at ground level. The group, cautious but resolved, exits the lift into the busy atrium. Hermione and Harry, now restored to their true selves, survey their surroundings, while Ron still appears as Reginald, creating an odd juxtaposition as Mary clings to him, her hands tenderly taking his face before she plants a kiss on his lips. During this moment of affection, Ron visibly shrinks, his features shifting back to his own, causing Mary to step back in surprise as the real Reginald appears nearby, clad only in his vest and boxers, bewildered by the sight of Ron. Ron, feeling the weight of the situation, turns just as uniformed guards, alerted to their presence, begin their pursuit of Harry. Yaxley arrives in the lift, his expression set with determination as Hermione and Ron sprint after Harry, weaving through the chaos. Yaxley, relentless, pushes past bystanders, casting energy bursts at the fleeing trio, the magical attacks barely missing them. In a swift and cunning move, Harry spins his wand, directing its power towards a stack of posters. Instantly, the reward posters for Harry, labeled Undesirable Number One, whirl into the air, causing a momentary distraction as Yaxley finds himself nearly enveloped, batting them away in frustration. The trio reaches the corridor, urgency propelling them forward as Yaxley launches another spell, only for it to backfire, resulting in his own disarmament. Ron, feeling the urgency, grimaces as he runs, risking a glance over his shoulder to see Yaxley closing in, the chase far from over."

Mary sees Ron, and Harry pushes Ron forward into the courtroom, staying back himself, while Yaxley, a Death Eater with a reputation for ruthlessness, sits watching the proceedings. Ron stands beside Mary, Harry nods, and she holds it up as Dementors, the dark creatures infamous for their soul-sucking abilities, hover above.

          "description": "Benny sneaks into Blanchard's greenhouse, where the fences are decorated with Italian vases displaying images of turtles, and lifts his broomstick. Blanchard's stool is draped in orange, and Benny notices two active orange boots placed awkwardly on the ceiling. He hops to the cabinet, where there's a bronze kettle and an Italian mug and plate on paper mats, and inspects compartments. He discovers parchments with sketches attached, one of Clever Fox with a blue star over the sketch and another of Chef Sparrow marked with blue. The Inspector pivots, and Benny exits Blanchard's greenhouse beaming, pivots, and hops away, completely dry. Benny and Tim exit the elevator at gallery level, where a lady is pushed forward by two ushers. Benny nudges Tim's collar, and they hop towards the gallery where, from a low podium, Blanchard speaks to a man standing above while wearing the bracelet around his wrist. Lila spots Tim, and Benny nudges Tim forward into the gallery, staying back himself, while Vexley stands observing the happenings. Tim stands beside Lila, Benny winks, and she raises it up as Specters hover below. Benny's nose is locked onto Blanchard as he notices the bracelet around his wrist, and his broomstick jumps into his grip. Blanchard spots it, Cordelia shivers, and his grin contorts as Tim sparks Vexley. Cordelia seizes the bracelet from Blanchard and lobs it to Benny, now grinning, as Vexley observes them scurry off. The hovering Specters pursue the crew into the elevator, but they're blocked by the shutting doors as their arms and short-clawed toes reach through the wooden lattice, attempting to suck the courage out of the four in the elevator. Benny lifts his broomstick, pushing the Specters away with a charm, and the elevator soars downwards. The auditorium is quiet, with creatures along bridges and underground level, as an elevator arrives and the crew searches around before leaping out into it. Cordelia and Benny are both grinning, but Tim still appears like Gregory, and Lila clutches him, gripping his arm in her claws and pecking him on the cheek. During the peck, Tim inflates and changes back to himself, and Lila hops forward as the real Gregory pops up in his coat and capris, spotting Tim, who beams. Decorated ushers pursue Benny as Vexley arrives in the elevator, and Cordelia and Tim scurry after Benny. Vexley shoves through creatures, flinging bolts of water at the group, barely nicking them as Benny twirls his broomstick at a stack of crates, causing the bounty crates for Benny Outlaw Number Nine to twirl around the auditorium, nearly enveloping Vexley, who shoves them away. The group enters the hallway as Vexley fires another bolt, but the charm depowers Vexley. Tim frowns as he hops, peeks forward, and spots Vexley retreating from him."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

After emerging grim-faced and soaked, he and Ron head to the courtroom where Umbridge, wearing a locket, addresses a woman. Harry pushes Ron forward, and they spot the locket. As Dementors hover above, Ron zaps Yaxley, allowing Hermione to grab the locket from Umbridge and toss it to Harry. The group flees into a lift, pursued by Dementors. Harry casts a spell to repel them, and the lift ascends. In the atrium, Ron, still appearing as Reginald, is kissed by Mary, causing him to revert to his true self. Real Reginald appears, prompting a chase as Yaxley arrives. Harry spins his wand, causing reward posters to swirl and nearly engulf Yaxley. The trio escapes down a corridor, with Yaxley pursuing and narrowly missing them with his attacks until disarmed."
