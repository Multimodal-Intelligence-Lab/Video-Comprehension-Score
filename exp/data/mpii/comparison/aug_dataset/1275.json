  "ground_truth": "The snake locks begin to move, and the heavy, circular, stone door of the Chamber of Secrets swings open. Meanwhile, the protective shield and the burning wooden ground stones at the Quidditch Pitch illuminate the dark hillside, as illusions continue to pound against the shield. Neville stands on a covered wooden bridge, looking out across the landscape, and he sees an army of Snatchers, led by Scabior, racing towards the school. Neville recoils as two Snatchers run ahead, hit the shield, and disintegrate, while Scabior steadies his men and stares at Neville, who is guarding the entrance up ahead. In the Chamber of Secrets, Ron approaches the skeleton of the Basilisk and wrenches a fang from its jaw. Hermione takes the two-handled gold cup from her bottomless bag, and Ron hands her the fang. He kneels down and places the golden cup on the ground between them. Hermione sinks to her knees, hesitating as she stares at the cup. Harry budges his way through students, as Ron raises his eyes to Hermione. She draws back her arm and plunges the fang into the cup. Voldemort roars as the cup spins across the floor, and Harry gasps and reels back as water bursts into the chamber, prompting Hermione and Ron to run from it. Immediately, the Dark Lord appears in the swelling torrent and breathes deeply, while gasping, Harry leans back against a pillar. Ron and Hermione, with the receding waters behind them, turn to each other and kiss hungrily, standing as if on a bridge with the waters on either side, before they break apart. On the outcrop, Voldemort, with Nagini coiled beside him, unleashes a powerful blast of light toward the shield from the Elder Wand. Professor McGonagall and Ginny stare upwards as parts of the shield start to burn. Remus reaches out to Nymphadora, and their fingers almost touch. Holding the Elder Wand, Voldemort suddenly recoils and looks down as energy crackles through the nut-nutted wand. He gazes at the smoldering shield, which now resembles a burning dome of flame. Harry seems to regain his strength and moves with determination through the fleeing students as the disintegrating shield fills the skies with burning debris. Scabior catches one of the flaming embers on the tip of his wand, open-mouthed, and scowls at Neville, who remains on guard on the wooden bridge. Scabior takes a very slow and tentative step forward, grins, and Neville backs away while the Snatchers race behind Scabior and make for the bridge. They haul fireballs at Neville, who dodges them, and a spell from Neville's wand ignites charges in the joints of the bridge supports, causing them to start to explode. As Scabior runs faster, the bridge collapses behind him while Ginny and the others watch as Neville sprints towards them, and a huge explosion rips the bridge apart.",

          "description": "The serpent fastenings commence to shift, and the weighty, round, rock portal of the Hall of Mysteries swings ajar. Meanwhile, the defensive barrier and the blazing timbered ground pebbles at the Quidditch Field illuminate the darkened slope, as deceptions persist to strike against the shield. Neville stands on a sheltered wooden passage, gazing out across the scenery, and he perceives a battalion of Captors, led by Scabior, speeding towards the academy. Neville flinches as two Captors dash forward, strike the barrier, and disintegrate, while Scabior steadies his followers and gazes at Neville, who is safeguarding the entryway up ahead. In the Hall of Mysteries, Ron advances to the frame of the Basilisk and wrenches a tooth from its maw. Hermione extracts the dual-handled aureate chalice from her infinite purse, and Ron hands her the tooth. He kneels down and places the gilded cup on the terrain betwixt them. Hermione lowers herself to her knees, hesitating as she gazes at the goblet. Harry pushes his way through pupils, as Ron elevates his gaze to Hermione. She retracts her arm and thrusts the tooth into the chalice. Voldemort bellows as the goblet twirls across the floor, and Harry gasps and staggers back as water erupts into the chamber, prompting Hermione and Ron to flee from it. Forthwith, the Dark Lord materializes in the surging deluge and inhales deeply, while panting, Harry leans back against a column. Ron and Hermione, with the ebbing waters behind them, turn to one another and kiss hungrily, standing as though on a passage with the waters on either side, before they separate. On the ledge, Voldemort, with Nagini spiraled beside him, releases a mighty burst of radiance toward the barrier from the Elder Wand. Professor McGonagall and Ginny gape upwards as segments of the barrier begin to combust. Remus extends a hand to Nymphadora, and their fingers nearly meet. Grasping the Elder Wand, Voldemort abruptly flinches and glances down as energy crackles through the nut-nutted wand. He stares at the smoldering barrier, which now mirrors a blazing dome of flame. Harry seems to recover his vigor and moves with resolve through the evacuating pupils as the disintegrating barrier fills the skies with burning fragments. Scabior catches one of the flaming cinders on the tip of his wand, gaping, and scowls at Neville, who remains on watch on the wooden passage. Scabior takes a very slow and hesitant step forward, grins, and Neville retreats while the Captors charge behind Scabior and head for the bridge. They hurl fireballs at Neville, who evades them, and a spell from Neville's wand ignites charges in the joints of the bridge braces, causing them to commence to detonate. As Scabior sprints faster, the passage collapses behind him while Ginny and the others observe as Neville dashes towards them, and a colossal detonation tears the bridge asunder."

Meanwhile, the dark hillside is illuminated by the protective shield and the burning wooden ground stones at the Quidditch Pitch, as the shield is pounded against by illusions. On a covered wooden bridge, Neville stands, looking out across the landscape, and an army of Snatchers, led by Scabior, is seen racing towards the school by him. As the shield is hit by two Snatchers running ahead, they disintegrate, and Neville recoils while his men are steadied by Scabior, who stares at Neville, guarding the entrance up ahead. In the Chamber of Secrets, the skeleton of the Basilisk is approached by Ron, and a fang is wrenched from its jaw by him. From her bottomless bag, the two-handled gold cup is taken by Hermione, and the fang is handed to her by Ron. The golden cup is placed on the ground between them by him as he kneels down. To her knees, Hermione sinks, hesitating as the cup is stared at by her. Students are budged through by Harry, as Hermione is looked up to by Ron. Her arm is drawn back by her, and the fang is plunged into the cup. The roar of Voldemort is heard as the cup is spun across the floor, and the gasp and reel back of Harry are prompted by the water bursting into the chamber, causing Hermione and Ron to run from it. Immediately, in the swelling torrent, the Dark Lord appears and breathes deeply, while back against a pillar, Harry leans gasping. With the receding waters behind them, a kiss is turned to by Ron and Hermione, standing as if on a bridge with the waters on either side, before apart they break. On the outcrop, a powerful blast of light is unleashed by Voldemort, with Nagini coiled beside him, toward the shield from the Elder Wand. Upwards, Professor McGonagall and Ginny stare as the burning of parts of the shield begins. The reaching out to Nymphadora is done by Remus, and the almost touching of their fingers occurs. Suddenly, holding the Elder Wand, Voldemort recoils and energy crackles through the nut-nutted wand as it is looked down upon by him. At the smoldering shield, which now resembles a burning dome of flame, he gazes. Harryâ€™s strength seems to be regained, and through the fleeing students, he moves with determination as the skies are filled with burning debris by the disintegrating shield. One of the flaming embers is caught on the tip of his wand by Scabior, open-mouthed, and at Neville, who remains on guard on the wooden bridge, he scowls. A very slow and tentative step forward is taken by Scabior, a grin is given, and while Neville backs away, the Snatchers race behind Scabior and make for the bridge. At Neville, fireballs are hauled by them, who dodges them, and charges in the joints of the bridge supports are ignited by a spell from Neville's wand, causing the start of explosions. As Scabior runs faster, the collapse of the bridge occurs behind him while the watch by Ginny and the others happens as Neville sprints towards them, and the huge explosion that rips the bridge apart occurs."

          "description": "The dolphins unlock begin to sway, and the lightweight, rectangular, wooden gate of the Chamber of Missteps glides closed. Meanwhile, the defensive net and the freezing stone ground tiles at the Quidditch Lounge dim the bright valley, as echoes continue to whisper against the net. Luna lounges on a painted stone dock, gazing over the ocean, and she notices a fleet of Hoppers, led by Fidget, hovering towards the park. Luna recoils as two Hoppers swim ahead, graze the net, and evaporate, while Fidget calms his crew and glares at Luna, who is blocking the exit up above. In the Chamber of Missteps, Draco approaches the fur of the Hippogriff and pries a scale from its coat. Pansy retrieves the two-wheeled silver wagon from her shallow sack, and Draco passes her the scale. He sprawls out and sets the silver wagon on the pavement beside them. Pansy kneels to her feet, wavering as she gazes at the wagon. Ginny tiptoes her way through teachers, as Draco lowers his chin to Pansy. She pulls in her leg and hurls the scale into the wagon. Grindelwald sneers as the wagon skids along the ceiling, and Ginny gasps and stumbles forward as air floods into the corridor, urging Pansy and Draco to jump from it. Directly, the Light Prince arrives in the rumbling breeze and blinks slowly, while groaning, Ginny leans forward against a beam. Draco and Pansy, with the receding air around them, glance at one another and hug gently, standing as if on a dock with the air all around, before they drift apart. On the hillside, Grindelwald, with Aragog wrapped near him, releases a gentle puff of smoke toward the net from the Maple Staff. Madam Pomfrey and Percy gaze downward as parts of the net begin to dissolve. Sirius reaches out to Remus, and their hands almost join. Gripping the Maple Staff, Grindelwald suddenly lunges and glances up as sparks crackle through the apple-carved staff. He glances at the dissolving net, which now appears to be a misty globe of mist. Ginny appears to lose her courage and tiptoes with hesitation among the approaching teachers as the melting net fills the fields with icy shards. Fidget catches one of the frosty shards on the edge of his staff, eyes wide, and grins at Luna, who remains blocking the way on the stone dock. Fidget takes a very swift and daring leap backward, chuckles, and Luna strides forward while the Hoppers dart behind Fidget and dash for the dock. They toss snowflakes at Luna, who catches them, and a glare from Luna's eyes ignites flares in the seams of the dock pillars, causing them to start to implode. As Fidget swims quicker, the dock shatters beneath him while Percy and the others smile as Luna leaps toward them, and a massive implosion splinters the dock into pieces."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby cafÃ©, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
