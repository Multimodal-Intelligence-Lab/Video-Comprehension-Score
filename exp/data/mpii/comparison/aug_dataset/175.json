A smile is given by him over his shoulder to the guy. Each other is glanced at by the agents without giving any kind of sign. He straightens up as the stairwell is exited by Chili and he walks up to him. He is looked at by Chili, the guy's either dumb or making conversation. Staring is kept by The Bear, but he doesn't say anything. At him, The Bear looks. The Bear nods, closing and opening his eyes. Harry's hair, messed from sleeping on it, is looked up at the door by him as it is opened to reveal Ray Bones standing there. He jerks upright. Harry quickly awakens, nearly wetting himself as the office is casually stepped into by Bones. Scrambling now to play it the way Chili taught him, the red leather chair across the desk is quickly gestured to by Harry. As the chair is sat down in by Ray Bones, Harry moves to the blinds and opens them. The problem is highlighted by the sun's setting, so no glare is present at all. The nice red sunset is indicated by Ray. Smiling, Harry just sits down at the desk, things already not going too well, about to get worse. A big wooden desk is where Bo Catlett sits, on the phone. The three dark-shaded gentlemen are seen stepping out of the car by The Bear, sort of half-doubled over. The outer office is looked into by Bo Catlett as the garage is pulled into by a car. The phone is hung up by Bo Catlett, and he gets to his feet as the office is looked into now by the men. It can now be seen that one of the Latinos is older, while the other two, younger, act as his bodyguards. The office is stepped into by Mr. Escobar, the older, meaner one. The two back doors of a limo slam shut, and the back seat is occupied by Bo Catlett, wedged in between the two bodyguards, neither of whom has removed his shades. The opposite seat is where Escobar faces him. Escobar takes a moment to study him. A stiff posture is taken by Bo Catlett. A shrug is given by Bo Catlett. The bodyguards are barely glanced at by Bo Catlett, who smiles the gleamy smile at the Latin guy in front of him. As traffic is zigzagged in and out by Ronnie, giving people 'the look' as they are passed, he talks on the carphone. The phone is used by Bo Catlett. A forward lean is taken by Bones; Ray's heard that one before. A shake of his head is given by Bones, who stands up and begins kicking the living shit out of Harry Zimm.

Meanwhile, from a different gate altogether, we observe two large, imposing men wearing dark sunglasses. They flank a smaller, older gentleman who possesses an air of significance. This older man, displaying a friendly demeanor, glances over his shoulder, offering a warm and amiable smile to the guy. The agents exchange significant glances with one another, yet they refrain from giving any overt sign or signal, maintaining their composure. The older man straightens up just as Chili emerges from the stairwell and approaches him with purpose. Chili looks at the man, who seems either intentionally oblivious or simply attempting to make conversation without really engaging. The Bear continues to fixate intently but remains silent and impassive.

Startled, Harry jerks upright with a sudden motion. Harry quickly awakens, nearly wetting himself in surprise as Bones nonchalantly steps into the office, as if he owns it. In a hurried attempt to handle the situation just as Chili had instructed him, Harry gestures quickly and somewhat nervously to the red leather chair positioned across the desk. As Ray Bones takes his seat with a sense of authority, Harry moves to the blinds and opens them with urgency. Unfortunately for him, the sun is setting, so there is no blinding glare to contend with. Ray gestures toward the pleasant, picturesque red sunset in the distance.

Simultaneously, Bo Catlett is also engaged in a phone conversation. Bones leans forward, having heard that particular line before, causing him to react. Bones shakes his head, stands up abruptly, and begins to violently assault Harry Zimm in a sudden, unexpected outburst. Ray Bones retrieves a pair of sleek black leather gloves from his pocket and steps around the desk with intent. He grabs Harry by the hair with force, lifts him up as if he weighs nothing, and hurls him across the room into a wall adorned with pictures.

We see coming out a different gate, two big guys in sunglasses flanking one smaller, older guy, a testament to their role as personal security detail possibly for a high-level crime boss. He looks over his shoulder to give the guy a smile, a customary gesture to assure his entourage. The agents, trained in covert operations, glance at each other without giving any kind of sign, a technique to avoid detection. He straightens up as Chili, a former small-time Miami loan shark now trying to break into the movie business, exits the stairwell and walks up to him. Chili looks at him, the guy's either dumb or making conversation, a common tactic in negotiations. The Bear, a well-known Hollywood stuntman turned enforcer, keeps staring but doesn't say anything, a gesture often used to convey dominance. The Bear looks at him. The Bear nods, closing and opening his eyes, a non-verbal cue used in agreements. Harry, a struggling film producer known for his chaotic lifestyle, his hair a mess from sleeping on it, looks up at the door as it opens to reveal Ray Bones standing there. He jerks upright. Harry wakes up quick, nearly wets himself as Bones then casually steps into the office, a scene reminiscent of many Hollywood portrayals of intimidation. Scrambling now to play it the way Chili taught him, Harry quickly gestures to the red leather chair across the desk, a chair known to belong to a famous actor who frequented the office. As Ray Bones sits down, Harry moves to the blinds and opens them. Problem is, the sun's setting over the Los Angeles skyline, so there's no glare at all. Ray indicates the nice red sunset, an atmospheric detail that often symbolizes impending danger in cinema. Harry just smiles, sits down at the desk, things already not going too well, about to get worse. Bo Catlett, a smooth-talking film financier with shady connections, is behind a big wooden desk on the phone. The Bear, sort of half doubled over, sees three dark-shaded gentlemen step out of the car, likely members of a rival faction. Bo Catlett looks into the outer office as a car pulls into the garage, signaling an arrival that could shift the power dynamics. Bo Catlett hangs up, gets to his feet as the men all look into the office now, creating tension. We can now see that one of the Latinos is older, the other two, younger, are his bodyguards, indicating a hierarchy within their organization. Mr. Escobar, the older, meaner one, steps into the office, his reputation preceding him as a feared cartel leader. As the two back doors of a limo slam shut, Bo Catlett sits in the back, wedged in between the two bodyguards, neither of whom has removed his shades, a move that maintains their anonymity and intimidation. He faces Escobar on the opposite seat. Escobar studies him a moment, a strategic pause often used to unsettle. Bo Catlett stiffens. Bo Catlett shrugs, a nonchalant response to mask his unease. Bo Catlett barely glances at the bodyguards, smiles the gleamy smile to the Latin guy in front of him, aware that any sign of disrespect could be lethal. As Ronnie zigzags in and out of Los Angeles traffic, giving people 'the look' as he passes, he is on the carphone, a high-risk activity blending business with the thrill of adrenaline. Bo Catlett is on the phone. Bones leans forward; Ray's heard that one before, his skepticism rooted in years of dealing with deceptive adversaries. Bones shakes his head, stands up, and begins kicking the living shit out of Harry Zimm, an act of violence to send a message. Ray Bones pulls a pair of black leather gloves from his pocket and steps around the desk, gloves often used to avoid leaving fingerprints. Bones grabs him by the hair, picks him up, and throws him across the room into the wall of pictures, many of them autographed snapshots of Hollywood stars, coming off their hooks and falling on top of Harry."

He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Chili exits the stairwell and encounters the Bear, who remains silent but acknowledges him. Harry, disheveled from sleep, reacts with alarm when Ray Bones enters his office, scrambling to play it cool as Bones sits in a red chair, noting the sunset. Meanwhile, Bo Catlett is on the phone behind a desk as three men arrive, including Mr. Escobar and his bodyguards. Bo Catlett, now in a limo with Escobar, tries to remain calm. Ronnie navigates traffic while on the carphone, and Bones aggressively confronts Harry Zimm, throwing him into a wall of pictures, causing them to collapse onto him."
