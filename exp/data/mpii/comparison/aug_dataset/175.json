He straightens up as the stairwell is exited by Chili and he walks up to him. He is looked at by Chili, the guy's either dumb or making conversation. Staring is kept by The Bear, but he doesn't say anything. At him, The Bear looks. The Bear nods, closing and opening his eyes. Harry's hair, messed from sleeping on it, is looked up at the door by him as it is opened to reveal Ray Bones standing there. He jerks upright. Harry quickly awakens, nearly wetting himself as the office is casually stepped into by Bones. Scrambling now to play it the way Chili taught him, the red leather chair across the desk is quickly gestured to by Harry. As the chair is sat down in by Ray Bones, Harry moves to the blinds and opens them. The problem is highlighted by the sun's setting, so no glare is present at all. The nice red sunset is indicated by Ray. Smiling, Harry just sits down at the desk, things already not going too well, about to get worse. A big wooden desk is where Bo Catlett sits, on the phone. The three dark-shaded gentlemen are seen stepping out of the car by The Bear, sort of half-doubled over. The outer office is looked into by Bo Catlett as the garage is pulled into by a car. The phone is hung up by Bo Catlett, and he gets to his feet as the office is looked into now by the men. It can now be seen that one of the Latinos is older, while the other two, younger, act as his bodyguards. The office is stepped into by Mr. Escobar, the older, meaner one. The two back doors of a limo slam shut, and the back seat is occupied by Bo Catlett, wedged in between the two bodyguards, neither of whom has removed his shades.

This older man, displaying a friendly demeanor, glances over his shoulder, offering a warm and amiable smile to the guy. The agents exchange significant glances with one another, yet they refrain from giving any overt sign or signal, maintaining their composure.

Startled, Harry jerks upright with a sudden motion. Harry quickly awakens, nearly wetting himself in surprise as Bones nonchalantly steps into the office, as if he owns it. In a hurried attempt to handle the situation just as Chili had instructed him, Harry gestures quickly and somewhat nervously to the red leather chair positioned across the desk.

We see coming out a different gate, two big guys in sunglasses flanking one smaller, older guy, a testament to their role as personal security detail possibly for a high-level crime boss. He looks over his shoulder to give the guy a smile, a customary gesture to assure his entourage. The agents, trained in covert operations, glance at each other without giving any kind of sign, a technique to avoid detection. He straightens up as Chili, a former small-time Miami loan shark now trying to break into the movie business, exits the stairwell and walks up to him. Chili looks at him, the guy's either dumb or making conversation, a common tactic in negotiations. The Bear, a well-known Hollywood stuntman turned enforcer, keeps staring but doesn't say anything, a gesture often used to convey dominance. The Bear looks at him. The Bear nods, closing and opening his eyes, a non-verbal cue used in agreements.

Scrambling now to play it the way Chili taught him, Harry quickly gestures to the red leather chair across the desk, a chair known to belong to a famous actor who frequented the office.

Bo Catlett hangs up, gets to his feet as the men all look into the office now, creating tension.

Bo Catlett barely glances at the bodyguards, smiles the gleamy smile to the Latin guy in front of him, aware that any sign of disrespect could be lethal.

          "description": "The Blue Cat has its travel brochure closed as Sam Stones then skips away, and we notice arriving from another tunnel, two small birds in hats flying beside one larger, younger bird. It glances over its wing to give the bird a frown. The lions blink at one another without displaying any kind of gesture. It hunches down as Pepper enters the elevator and skips over to it. Pepper glances at it, the bird's either wise or ignoring the radio. The Owl keeps glaring but doesn't hear anything. The Owl blinks at it. The Owl shakes its head, opening and closing its beak. Barry, his shirt a mess from lounging on it, glances at the window as it slides to reveal Sam Stones relaxing there. It jumps sideways. Barry drifts up slow, nearly drops himself as Stones then gracefully floats into the kitchen. Climbing now to play it the way Pepper showed it, Barry slowly signals to the blue velvet table beyond the counter. As Sam Stones reclines, Barry floats to the curtains and closes them. Problem is, the moon's rising, so there's tons of shine everywhere. Sam notes the beautiful blue sunrise. Barry merely frowns, reclines on the counter, things already going too smoothly, about to get better. Bo Fish is behind a small stone counter on the intercom. The Owl, kind of fully straightened up, notices four bright-feathered parrots fly out of the nest. Bo Fish frowns into the inner kitchen as a bird lands on the roof. Bo Fish picks up, drops to its knees as the birds all peek into the kitchen now. We can now notice that one of the robins is younger, the other two, older, are its relatives. Mr. Lark, the younger, kinder one, floats into the kitchen. As the two back windows of a taxi click open, Bo Fish stands on the roof, nestled in between the two relatives, neither of whom has put on a hat. It faces Lark on the close seat. Lark ignores it a while. Bo Fish slouches. Bo Fish stretches. Bo Fish fully stares at the relatives, frowns the dim frown to the Spanish bird beside it. As Ricky hops in and out of spaces, frowning at trees as it skips, it is on the walkie-talkie. Bo Fish is on the intercom. Stones slumps backward; Sam's seen that act again. Stones nods its wing, sits down, and begins tickling the running clock out of Barry Yimm. Sam Stones pushes a pair of orange silk socks from its hat and skips around the counter. Stones pats it on the back, props it down, and spins it across the roof into the ceiling of paintings, many of them slipping off their nails and floating beneath Barry."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Chili exits the stairwell and encounters the Bear, who remains silent but acknowledges him. Harry, disheveled from sleep, reacts with alarm when Ray Bones enters his office, scrambling to play it cool as Bones sits in a red chair, noting the sunset. Meanwhile, Bo Catlett is on the phone behind a desk as three men arrive, including Mr. Escobar and his bodyguards. Bo Catlett, now in a limo with Escobar, tries to remain calm. Ronnie navigates traffic while on the carphone, and Bones aggressively confronts Harry Zimm, throwing him into a wall of pictures, causing them to collapse onto him."
