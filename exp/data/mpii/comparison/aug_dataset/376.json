Catching his breath, Edward arrives at the front entry. The doorknob is ancient brass with two projections that appear like horns. Yet Edward extends his hand, reaching nearer and nearer before he finally, impossibly fast, the entry opens, revealing an elderly woman with a patch over her left eye. She appears like she's been deceased for years, but too obstinate to lie down. Zacky and Don Price await Edward, each instant more convinced he's already deceased, but unexpectedly, he's back at the gate. The elderly woman steps out of the shadows behind Edward, flipping up her eye patch. When their flashlight beam hits her left eye, it gleams with an infernal glow. We rush in on Zacky, who is paralyzed by what he perceives. An elderly man -- Zacky -- stands on a shaky stepladder, replacing a bulb. Suddenly, the ladder yields way and he descends, deceased. We rush in on Don Price as twenty-year-old Don Price falls face-forward on the tile, face mushed in the grout, very much deceased. Don and Zacky both shiver with terror, the latter has tears in his eyes. The siblings suddenly bolt, still standing next to the elderly woman, Edward grins. Edward assists her back inside. He could depart now, but inquisitiveness gets the better of him. The elderly woman turns to him slightly, still not facing him.

Meanwhile, Edward takes a cautious yet determined path, curving gracefully around the tall, imposing bushes that expertly conceal the front door from view, and steps confidently onto the creaky old porch. As he treads, the wooden boards beneath him emit a series of squeals and creaks, yet undeterred, he presses onward. Suddenly, a cat yowls, its cry piercing the air from its resting place on a broken, timeworn wicker rocker. As Edward steadies his breath, he finally reaches the ominous front door.

The focus then shifts to Don Price as a young Don Price of twenty years falls forward onto the cold tile floor, his face embedded in the grout and unmistakably dead. Both Don and Zacky tremble with overwhelming fear, tears welling up in Zacky's eyes. With sudden urgency, the brothers bolt away. Meanwhile, remaining beside the old woman, Edward allows a smile to cross his face. He assists her back inside the house, aware he could easily leave now, yet driven by curiosity, he lingers.

Together, and without a moment's hesitation or second thought, they decide that their best course of action is to make a hasty exit from the scene. Zacky, too, would most likely find himself compelled to follow their lead and dash away, but Don's firm and resolute grip on his collar prevents any such movement, keeping him firmly anchored in place. Meanwhile, Edward opts for a cautious, yet determined route, skillfully maneuvering in a sweeping, graceful curve around the tall, imposing bushes that serve as an expert concealment for the front door, hidden from direct view. He steps with confidence onto the creaky, weathered porch. As he walks, the wooden boards beneath his feet emit a series of persistent squeals and creaks, creating an audible protest, yet Edward remains undeterred and presses onward with resolve. Suddenly, the sharp, piercing cry of a cat yowling splits the air, emanating from its resting place on a broken, timeworn wicker rocking chair. As Edward steadies his breathing, he finally arrives at the ominous front door. The doorknob, made from ancient, well-worn brass, intriguingly features two distinct projections that bear a striking resemblance to horns. Nevertheless, Edward, with a bold heart, extends his hand and reaches confidently closer, until, in a flash, as if moved by an unseen force, the door swings open with impossible speed. Standing before him is an old woman, her left eye obscured by a patch, giving an eerie appearance.

Suddenly, to their immense relief, Edward reappears at the gate, miraculously unscathed. The old woman, stepping out from the shadows behind Edward, flips up her eye patch. When the beam of their flashlight lands upon her previously covered left eye, it blazes with an unnatural, otherworldly glow, casting a hellish light. We zoom in on Zacky, who stands utterly motionless, frozen by the terrifying sight before him. An old man—Zacky himself in his later years—is precariously balanced atop a wobbly stepladder, attempting to change a lightbulb. In an instant, the ladder gives way beneath him, and he plummets to the ground, meeting his end. The focus then shifts to Don Price as a young Don Price, at the tender age of twenty years, suddenly falls forward onto the cold, unforgiving tile floor, his face settling into the grout, unmistakably lifeless. Both Don and Zacky are overwhelmed with paralyzing fear, tears starting to well up in Zacky's eyes. With sudden urgency and a burst of adrenaline, the brothers take off, fleeing in haste. Meanwhile, standing beside the enigmatic old woman, Edward allows a smile to play upon his lips. Despite having the opportunity to leave, he chooses to assist her back inside the house, driven by an insatiable curiosity, he lingers in her presence. The old woman, with an almost imperceptible tilt of her head towards him, still not fully turning, gives a slight smile, a crooked grin revealing broken teeth, before leaning in close to Edward's face.

This time, there is no cut to another scene, no narrative break; instead, we linger on Edward, who stands in complete rapt attention, witnessing a vision of his own demise.

Edward curves around the tall bushes that hide the front door, remnants from an old garden planted by the previous owners, and steps onto the porch. The boards, weathered by decades of harsh winters, squeal and creak, but he continues on undeterred by the decay. A cat, perhaps a descendant of the many strays that roamed this neighborhood, screams out from a broken wicker rocker that long ago adorned someone’s sunlit porch. Catching his breath, Edward reaches the front door. The doorknob, an ancient brass relic from the late 1800s with two projections that look like horns, seems to call to him. Yet Edward extends his hand, a sense of foreboding mixed with curiosity, reaching closer and closer before he finally, impossibly fast, the door opens, revealing an old woman with a patch over her left eye.

Don and Zacky both tremble with fear, the latter has tears in his eyes as the weight of their visions bed down in their minds. The brothers suddenly bolt, still standing next to the old woman, Edward smiles, strangely at home in her macabre domain. Edward helps her back inside, feeling an unexplainable kinship. He could leave now, but curiosity gets the better of him, an insatiable desire to understand the otherworldly connection they share. The old woman turns to him slightly, still not facing him. She smiles a little, a crooked grin of broken teeth filled with stories of the past, then turns leaning her face right in front of his. On a silent count of one, two, three, Edward looks into the eye. This time we don't cut, instead we hold on Edward as he witnesses his death, foreseen in the glow of her enchanted eye. He stares transfixed, perplexed and amused by the inevitability of it all. The old woman nods, heading back to the house, content with the passing of another soul through her haunted care. Dr. Julius Bennett, the town’s oldest living resident at 85, enters from the foyer, still winded from coming down the stairs that have been in his family for generations. He judges her belly—a traditional gesture of the region meant to predict fortune—and leans close to her, whispering in her ear. She smiles, surprised but not doubting, the comfort of old friendships evident. Coming out from the kitchen, Will slowly climbs the stairs, aware they creak with every step like the echoes of history. The wall is filled with family photos of happier times, mostly pictures of Will starting when he was an infant and ending at his wedding, a testament to a family lineage tied to this house for nearly a century. As he climbs the stairs, we can see him growing up with every step, each photo capturing another chapter of life.

          "description": "Harold glances at Mabel, and they're in complete confusion as they fling themselves away from there. Benny would leap as well, but Tim grips him by the hat. Gerald zigzags around the short hedges that reveal the back gate and hops onto the deck. The beams groan and shift, but he presses on. A dog howls out from a shattered wicker basket. Gasping, Gerald arrives at the back gate. The handle is rusty copper with three attachments that resemble antlers. However, Gerald stretches his arm, inching closer and closer before he finally, unbelievably swift, the gate swings open, unveiling a young man with a patch over his right eye. He appears like he's been lost for decades, but too brave to fade away. Benny and Tim Harris wait for Gerald, each second more assured he's already vanished, but unexpectedly, he's back at the hedge. The young man leaps out of the mist behind Gerald, flipping down his handkerchief. When their candlelight illuminates his right eye, it glows with a devilish gleam. We close in on Benny, who is frozen by the spectacle. A young woman -- Benny -- stands on a shaky footstool, painting a mural. Unexpectedly, the stool collapses and she tumbles, breathless. We close in on Tim Harris as sixty-year-old Tim Harris slips backward on the carpet, head crumpled in the fabric, very much breathless. Tim and Benny both shiver with fright, the former has laughter in his eyes. The sisters suddenly sprint, still standing next to the young man, Gerald grins. Gerald aids him back outside. He could escape now, but intrigue wins over him. The young man turns to him slightly, still not acknowledging him. He smirks a bit, a skewed grin of jagged teeth, then swivels leaning his cheek right beside his. On a muffled note of one, two, three, Gerald gazes into the eye. This instant we don't shift, instead we focus on Gerald as he encounters his fate. He gawks transfixed, bewildered and entertained. The young man nods, retreating back to the yard. Professor Douglas Turner (64) enters from the basement, still flustered from ascending the ladder. He assesses her hand and leans close to her, murmuring in her hair. She laughs, startled but not questioning. Arriving from the office, Sam quickly crosses the fence. They moan with every motion. The ceiling is covered with pet portraits of older days, mainly sketches of Sam starting when she was a teenager and ending at her graduation. As she crosses the fence, we can see her aging with each motion. A beam of moonlight slips around the partly closed window at the corner of the garden."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Edward approaches a creaky porch, reaching for the ancient brass doorknob, and encounters an old woman with a patch over her eye. Despite her ghostly appearance, she opens the door swiftly. Zacky and Don watch anxiously as Edward returns to the gate. The old woman reveals a glowing eye beneath her patch, causing Zacky to freeze in terror as he envisions his own death from a fall. Similarly, Don imagines his demise on a tiled floor. Terrified, the brothers flee. Edward remains intrigued, stays with the woman, and dares to look into her eye, witnessing his death. An old Dr. Julius Bennett whispers something to her that makes her smile. Meanwhile, Will ascends creaking stairs lined with family photos of his life, leading to a sunlit door at the hallway's end."
