Phyllis takes her hand off the doorknob and holds on to Neff's arm. They look at each other, and the look is like a long kiss. Then, Neff goes out with a briefcase under his arm and comes down the steps to the street, where his Dodge coupe is parked at the curb. He opens the door and stops, looking in. Sitting there in the dark corner of the car, away from the steering wheel, is Lola, who wears a coat but no hat. Lola gives him a sly smile, and Neff is a little annoyed.

Phyllis and Neff progress near to the door, and Phyllis cracks the door ajar. Both glance at the staircase, where Dietrichson is ascending. Phyllis removes her hand from the doorknob and grips Neff's limb. They gaze at each other, and the gaze is akin to a prolonged embrace. Then, Neff exits with a case under his limb and descends the stairs to the roadway, where his Dodge coupe is stationed at the edge. He unlocks the door and pauses, peering inside. Sitting there in the dim corner of the vehicle, away from the steering wheel, is Lola, who sports a coat but no cap. Lola grants him a cunning grin, and Neff is somewhat vexed. Neff enters the vehicle, places the case on the shelf behind the driver's seat, shuts the door, and ignites the vehicle. They glide down the slope, and Neff regards Lola inquisitively, while Lola returns his gaze. Neff halts the vehicle by the curb, rotates, and peers towards the vehicle. Zachetti strides towards the vehicle, and Lola has opened the door. Zachetti arrives, and Lola steps out of the vehicle, catching up with Zachetti, and they stroll away jointly. Gradually, Neff shifts the vehicle in gear and proceeds, his expression tense. Behind his head, light reflects on the metal of the zipper on the case. There is a fair portion of activity, but the spot is not congested. Neff proceeds along the sidewalk into the shot, passing in front of the produce and vegetable exhibition and going between the booths into the marketplace. He pauses by the cashier's counter and purchases a pack of cigarettes.

Phyllis is observed among them, standing by the soap segment, with her basket partially filled. She wears a plain house dress, no cap, and has a sizable envelope handbag under her arm. Phyllis is placing a tin of cleaning powder into her basket. Neff enters the shot and progresses along the shelves towards her, very slowly, feigning to inspect the goods.

          "description": "The cat guides the turtle towards the window, and on the way, it grabs a scarf. In the foreground, Johnson starts to descend the ladder, balancing a backpack and a plate. Margaret and Arnold shuffle near the window, and Margaret slides the window slightly ajar. Both gaze at the ladder, where Johnson is heading down. Margaret removes her grip from the curtain rod and clutches Arnold's wing. They glance at each other, and the glance is like a prolonged handshake. Then, Arnold strolls out with a suitcase balanced on his wing and climbs up the ladder to the rooftop, where his bicycle is balanced near the gutter. He slides open the window and pauses, staring out. Nestled in the dim recess of the rooftop, far from the handlebars, is Clara, who dons a sweater but no scarf. Clara offers him a cheeky grin, and Arnold is slightly amused. Arnold hops onto the bicycle, places the suitcase on the rack behind the passenger seat, seals the window, and pedals the bicycle. They coast up the slope, and Arnold studies Clara inquisitively, while Clara returns his stare. Arnold halts the bicycle by the gutter, pivots, and stares towards the rooftop. Daniels trudges towards the rooftop, and Clara has pushed open the window. Daniels arrives, and Clara climbs out of the rooftop, joining Daniels, and they wander off together. Gradually, Arnold propels the bicycle into motion and maneuvers onwards, his expression tense. Over his shoulder, sunlight glimmers on the buckle of the suitcase. There is mild commotion, but the area is not packed. Arnold strolls along the path into the frame, bypassing the bakery display and stepping between the kiosks into the plaza. He pauses by the attendant’s counter and purchases a bar of chocolate. While tearing the wrapper, he glances casually past the barricade into the front section of the plaza, where the tables are stacked with boxed goods and assorted merchandise, and visitors wander, selecting items and placing them in their carts. Margaret is visible among them, standing by the detergent aisle, with her cart half empty. She wears a casual blouse, no scarf, and has a massive tote under her wing. Margaret is placing a jar of polish into her cart. Arnold steps into the frame and glides along the tables towards her, very leisurely, feigning interest in the items. A visitor strolls by and exits the frame. Margaret and Arnold are now very near, and during the ensuing murmured conversation, they remain facing the tables, without glancing at each other. She pauses, then parts it, and Arnold glances around swiftly, extracts the postcard from his backpack, and slips it into her tote."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Lola exits to join Zachetti, and they walk away together, leaving Neff to drive on with a tense expression. He heads to a market, buys a pack of cigarettes, and spots Phyllis among the shoppers. Both avoid eye contact, talking quietly as Neff discreetly slips an insurance policy into her bag."
