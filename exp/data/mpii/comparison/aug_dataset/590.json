          "description": "Flick squats and scans over the collection of pastries; she chooses a doughnut. Still crouching, she unwinds the wrapper from the pastry and brushes her fingers over the warm texture of the icing, bringing the doughnut to her lips. She rewraps the wrapper, then slowly rises and places the doughnut on top of the shelf, closes the cupboard door, and runs away. Flick scoops up the doughnut. Marley exits a staircase carrying three pizzas, with Glenn trailing. Jordan taps, and the folks glance at each other as Glenn checks the clock. Toys lie everywhere, and Flick lies face down in the bedroom, a large red stain on the carpet. Sam arrives with a sack slung over her shoulder; Glenn leaps forward, and Marley raises her feet as Sam points to Jordan. Glenn clears the counter, and Sam sits beside Flick, slicing the cake, while Flick grins up at Sam with a ripped piece of cloth, with a dab of paint, hanging over her cheek. Glenn grabs the milk as Sam prepares the candy. Flick sips while Sam chews on the candy and offers it to Flick, then slices more pieces of cake and devours a slice, offering a piece to Marley and Glenn. Flick nods and steps into the bedroom as Sam puts on his hat. Flick marches out of the chamber wearing goggles, a bandage on her chin, and dressed in overalls, with Marley and Glenn trailing after her. They enter a staircase with a man and a young boy who gawks at Flick as Glenn hands her a tissue. Flick tilts her head forward and presses the fabric to her lip, removes her goggles, and glances at her reflection on the staircase railing before lowering her gaze to the young boy. In the meeting room, camera footage of the car crash is displayed on a big screen, ending as Flick shifts in her chair and gulps some juice. Alex clicks a pen, stands, strolls around the desk at the front of the room, and projects a picture on two massive boards. Alex faces Flick in the center of the room, slips on her hat, and checks her papers as Flick peeks at Glenn and Marley. The pictures appear on screen as Alex nods and sifts through a binder, and Marley and Glenn exchange a look. Flick stares at an oversized drawing of Rebecca on the board, licks his lips, and glances briefly at Glenn and Marley before examining Rebecca's grinning portrait with sealed lips. She takes a swallow of juice as Alex nods, and Flick stares firmly at Alex, her face glistening with sweat. Flick looks down, her eyes droopy, as Alex closes her binder and gradually walks to her chair."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
