The silhouette dashes towards illumination, and its limbs extend, transforming into appendages as it ascends and, as a fowl, settles. Al-Saleem, a whiskered gentleman clad in a loose garment and a light cream cap, emerges in a dwelling where three youthful Middle Eastern males heed him on a television. Meanwhile, on a cordoned-off avenue, a lawman taps the top of a milk vehicle that then moves away. Armed special division agents in dark sprint across wasteland as additional agents cluster on a street intersection while the milk vehicle maneuvers around. Agents make their way upstairs at the rear of a barricaded house and target their automatic arms on the facade of the lined house. The Sikh dairyman halts to collect some quarts of milk, and a sharpshooter on the rooftop takes aim. Sunlight floods through panes into the dim abode as the dairyman approaches the main entryway, placing two quarts of milk on the threshold. One of the armed agents opens the rear portal and enters, alerting the three males inside. Explosive equipment is spread out on a table, and one of the males presses a button on a cell phone, triggering a golden explosion that tears through the structure. Law enforcement and civilians dive for shelter as fragments rain down, thick gray fumes fill the atmosphere, and plumes of smoke ascend. Characters materialize from brief flashes of grainy observation footage of densely packed edifices intersected by roadways. A casually attired young gentleman with a beard, Ferris, reclines on a bed, deep in disturbed reflection with a furrowed brow as he recalls sitting in a chamber observing a captive gagged and bludgeoned to death with a cricket club. In a large abode, a rugged-faced gentleman in his 40s, Edward Hoffman, dictates into a laptop while on TV. Ferris cocks a handgun in a conference chamber. An automobile is blown up, and a trooper is shot as Hoffman talks to authorities. Ferris, wearing jeans, a shirt, a casual top, and a baseball cap, sits at an Iraqi street caf√© sipping coffee when a four-by-four pulls up. The operator, Bassam, with lengthy black hair in a ponytail, yells to Ferris, who retrieves his satchel and coffee and enters the four-by-four. Ferris sips his coffee as Bassam navigates to a checkpoint on a dirt path where they're observed. Ferris examines a stone dwelling through field glasses, with goats swarming around in front. Bassam calls on his cell while they're observed on a screen in a CIA observation room."

The figure is seen hastening towards a source of light, and as it does so, the arms of the figure spread wide, transforming into wings that allow it to take flight. This figure, now a bird, comes to a gentle rest. Al-Saleem, a man with a distinct beard, dressed in a loose-fitting robe accompanied by a pale cream cap, makes his appearance inside a house. Within this house, three young Middle Eastern men are observed intently listening to him through the television. Meanwhile, on a nearby street that has been cordoned off, a policeman gives a reassuring pat on the roof of a milk float, which then begins to drive away. Armed officers from the special branch, all dressed in black, are seen running across a barren wasteland. Simultaneously, additional officers are huddled together on a street corner as the milk float continues its path. A group of officers cautiously proceed upstairs at the rear of a boarded-up house, training their automatic weapons on the front of the terraced house. The Sikh milkman, methodically making his rounds, pauses to pick up a few pints of milk, and elsewhere, a marksman takes precise aim from atop a roof. Daylight washes into the dim house through windows as the milkman approaches the front door, carefully placing two pints of milk on the doorstep. An armed officer then quietly opens the back door and steps inside, alerting the three men present. Spread out on a table before them is bomb-making equipment, and one of the men presses a key on a mobile phone, setting off a resplendent golden fireball that tears through the structure. Police and civilians alike instinctively dive for cover as debris begins to rain down, while thick gray smoke rapidly engulfs the air, with plumes of it rising into the atmosphere. Letters gradually emerge from brief, flickering frames of grainy surveillance footage depicting tightly packed buildings, divided by intersecting streets. We then see Ferris, a young man dressed in casual attire, with a beard, lying on a bed, deeply immersed in troubled thoughts, his brow furrowed as he vividly recalls the harrowing moment of watching a prisoner being gagged and brutally beaten to death with a cricket bat in a room. In the spacious confines of a large house, a man in his 40s with a rugged face, Edward Hoffman, is seen dictating into a laptop while also appearing on TV. Ferris, in a meeting room, cocks a pistol with determination. A car erupts in an explosion, and a soldier is fatally shot as Hoffman continues his discussions with officials. Ferris, comfortably dressed in jeans, a shirt, a casual top, and topped with a baseball cap, sits at a street cafe in Iraq, leisurely sipping coffee when a four-by-four vehicle pulls up nearby. The driver, named Bassam, sporting long black hair tied neatly into a ponytail, calls out to Ferris, who promptly gathers his bag and coffee before getting into the four-by-four. As Bassam drives toward a checkpoint situated on a dirt road, Ferris continues sipping his coffee while they are being watched. Through binoculars, Ferris fixes his gaze on a stone house, observing the goats that swarm around in front of it.

          "description": "Stretching across the landscape are rows upon rows of timeworn film studio buildings, their aged facades reflecting onto a lustrous, golden surface, creating an almost otherworldly tableau. Immediately following this, we are introduced to a somewhat shaky but intriguing animation that portrays a mysterious figure. This enigmatic figure, draped in a long coat and topped with a hat, is seen making a hurried approach towards a bright source of light. As the figure strides forward, its arms dramatically spread wide, transforming in a magical metamorphosis into wings, allowing it to soar into the sky. The figure, now elegantly transformed into a bird, comes to a gentle rest. In another scene, Al-Saleem, a man distinguished by his unique beard and attire‚Äîa loose-fitting robe paired with a pale cream cap‚Äîmakes his entrance within the confines of a house. Inside this residence, three young Middle Eastern men are portrayed as paying close attention to him through their television set. \n\nMeanwhile, on a nearby street that has been securely cordoned off, a policeman is seen giving a reassuring pat on the roof of a milk float, which subsequently begins to make its way down the road. At the same time, armed officers from the special branch, all dressed in their uniform black attire, are observed sprinting across a barren and desolate wasteland. Simultaneously, additional officers gather together in a huddle on a street corner as the milk float continues along its path. A group of officers, moving cautiously, ascend the stairs at the rear of a boarded-up house, carefully training their automatic weapons on the front of the terraced house. A Sikh milkman, methodically making his usual rounds, pauses momentarily to pick up a few pints of milk, while elsewhere, a marksman takes precise aim from his vantage point on a rooftop. As daylight washes into the dimly lit house through its windows, the milkman approaches the front door, meticulously placing two pints of milk on the doorstep. An armed officer then discreetly opens the back door and steps inside, taking care to alert the three men present. Spread out before them on a table is an arrangement of bomb-making equipment, and one of the men presses a key on a mobile phone, detonating a magnificent golden fireball that rips through the structure. Both police and civilians instinctively dive for cover as debris rains down from above, while thick gray smoke quickly fills the air, its plumes rising ominously into the atmosphere.\n\nIn subsequent frames of grainy surveillance footage that depict tightly packed buildings intersected by streets, letters gradually begin to emerge from the brief, flickering images. We then transition to Ferris, a young man with a beard, dressed in casual attire, lying on a bed. He is deeply immersed in troubled thoughts, his brow furrowed as he vividly recalls the harrowing and brutal moment of witnessing a prisoner being gagged and savagely beaten to death with a cricket bat in a room. In the spacious interior of a large house, a rugged-faced man in his 40s, identified as Edward Hoffman, is seen dictating into a laptop while also appearing on TV. In a meeting room, Ferris energetically cocks a pistol, his determination evident. A car bursts into a fiery explosion, and a soldier is tragically shot as Hoffman continues his discussions with officials. Ferris, comfortably dressed in jeans, a shirt, and a casual top, with a baseball cap completing his look, sits at a street cafe in Iraq. He leisurely sips coffee when a four-by-four vehicle pulls up nearby. The driver, Bassam, characterized by his long black hair neatly tied into a ponytail, calls out to Ferris, who quickly gathers his bag and coffee before getting into the vehicle. As Bassam drives towards a checkpoint situated on a dusty dirt road, Ferris continues sipping his coffee, aware that they are being closely monitored. Through binoculars, Ferris fixes his gaze on a stone house, keenly observing the goats that swarm around its front. Bassam uses his mobile phone to make a call while they remain under the vigilant watch of a CIA surveillance room, where their every move is scrutinized on a screen."

Following this serene reflection, a sudden, shaky animation emerges, depicting a figure clad in a long coat and a hat. This figure begins to move with increasing speed, dashing toward a distant source of light. As it propels forward, its arms extend outward, transforming into wings that grant it the power of flight. This animated being, now a bird, glides gracefully through the air before gently coming to rest. Meanwhile, Al-Saleem, a man with a thick beard, enveloped in a loose-fitting robe and topped with a pale cream cap, unexpectedly appears inside a house. In this house, three young Middle Eastern men are intently focused on his presence as they watch him on the screen of a television. Concurrently, outside on a street sectioned off from the public, a policeman gives a reassuring pat on the roof of a milk float, which then starts to drive away. At the same time, armed officers clad in black, members of the special branch, sprint across an expanse of wasteland. More officers can be seen converging at a street corner, huddling together as the milk float continues its circuitous journey. The officers stealthily approach a boarded-up house, making their way up the stairs at the back of the building. From this vantage point, they aim their automatic weapons towards the front of a terraced house, standing poised for action. The Sikh milkman, making his daily rounds, pauses briefly to collect some pints of milk, while high above, a marksman positions himself on the roof, carefully taking aim. As daylight pours relentlessly through the windows of the dim house, the milkman approaches the front door, setting down two pints of milk on the doorstep. One of the armed officers quietly opens the back door, slipping inside and creating a stir among the three men inside. The table before them is cluttered with bomb-making equipment, and in a tense moment, one of the men presses a key on a mobile phone. This act triggers an explosive golden fireball that viciously tears through the building. Outside, police and civilians alike scramble for cover as debris rains down upon them, thick gray smoke rapidly filling the air, creating spiraling plumes that ascend ominously. In the midst of this chaos, letters materialize, emerging briefly from grainy flashes of surveillance footage depicting densely packed buildings divided by narrow streets. In a separate scene, a young man with a beard, Ferris, lies sprawled on a bed, his expression deeply troubled. His brow furrows as he recalls a haunting memory: sitting in a room where a prisoner was gagged and beaten to death with a cricket bat. Elsewhere, in a grand house, Edward Hoffman, a man in his 40s with a rugged face, diligently dictates into a laptop while a television murmurs on in the background. In a meeting room, Ferris methodically cocks a pistol, preparing for the next step. Outside, a car is violently blown up, and a soldier is shot, events unfolding as Hoffman consults with officials. Ferris, now dressed in jeans, a shirt, a casual top, and concealed under a baseball cap, sits at an Iraqi street caf√©, leisurely sipping coffee. Suddenly, a four-by-four vehicle pulls up beside him. The driver, Bassam, his long black hair tied back in a ponytail, shouts out to Ferris. Without hesitation, Ferris gathers his belongings, encompassing his bag and coffee, and climbs into the four-by-four. As they drive, Ferris continues sipping his coffee while Bassam steers them toward a checkpoint situated on a dusty road. Here, they are keenly observed. Ferris raises a pair of binoculars to his eyes, peering through them to scrutinize a stone house that stands in the distance, surrounded by goats that swarm the front of it. Meanwhile, Bassam places a call on his mobile phone, fully aware that they are being watched on a screen within the confines of a CIA surveillance room."

The figure runs towards light, and its arms spread out, becoming wings as it takes flight and, as a bird, comes to rest, an allusion to mythological stories of transformation. Al-Saleem, a bearded man wearing a loose-fitting robe and a pale cream cap, appears in a house where three young Middle Eastern men listen to him on a television, tuned to a channel known for broadcasting extremist rhetoric. Meanwhile, on a cordoned-off street, a policeman pats the roof of a milk float, a type of vehicle commonly used in the UK for delivering milk, that then drives off. Armed special branch officers, part of a counter-terrorism unit, in black run across wasteland as more officers huddle on a street corner while the milk float drives around, disguised as part of the operation. Officers make their way upstairs at the back of a boarded-up house, a common hideout for illicit activities, and train their automatic weapons on the front of the terraced house. The Sikh milkman, representing the diverse communities within the UK, stops to pick up some pints of milk, and a marksman on the roof takes aim. Daylight floods through windows into the gloomy house as the milkman walks up to the front door, placing two pints of milk on the doorstep, a routine symbolic of normalcy amidst chaos. One of the armed officers opens the back door and enters, alerting the three men inside.

In a large house, a craggy-faced man in his 40s, Edward Hoffman, dictates into a laptop while on TV, possibly coordinating intelligence operations. Ferris cocks a pistol in a meeting room, preparing for an uncertain mission. A car is blown up, and a soldier is shot as Hoffman talks to officials, illustrating the volatile environment in conflict areas.

The driver, Bassam, with long black hair in a ponytail, yells to Ferris, who picks up his bag and coffee and gets in the four-by-four, ready for their next covert operation. Ferris sips his coffee as Bassam drives to a checkpoint on a dirt road where they're watched, a common security measure in conflict zones. Ferris looks at a stone house through binoculars, with goats swarming around in front, illustrating a typical rural Middle Eastern setting.

          "description": "Lines of ancient amusement park attractions shimmer off a silver, ceramic sculpture, succeeded by a smooth cartoon of a creature sporting a short scarf and a helmet. The creature dances toward shadow, and its hands fold in, turning into paws as it leaps and, as a feline, settles down. Al-Rashid, a clean-shaven woman wearing a tight-fitting jacket and a bright orange beret, appears in a cabin where three young South American women watch her on a radio. Meanwhile, in a busy tunnel, a cyclist taps the frame of a skateboard that then rolls away. Unarmed postal workers in green stroll across farmland as more workers gather in a bus station while the skateboard rolls nearby. Workers ascend a ladder at the front of a broken-down barn and point their walkie-talkies at the rear of the detached bungalow. The Tibetan gardener stops to gather some cartons of juice, and a painter on the balcony takes notice. Moonlight filters through curtains into the bright barn as the gardener approaches the back gate, placing two cartons of juice on the patio. One of the pedestrian workers unlocks the front gate and wanders in, surprising the three women inside. Kite-making gadgets are piled up on a bookshelf, and one of the women taps a button on a wristwatch, initiating a scarlet water fountain that erupts from the room. Firefighters and tourists dance for shelter as water splashes up, dark blue mist fills the area, and clouds of mist descend. Numbers emerge from long glimpses of grainy nature footage of dense forests crisscrossed by pathways. A formally dressed elderly woman with spectacles, Lisa, reclines on a couch, light in joyful meditation with a relaxed grin as she remembers standing in a field observing a performer painted and applauded to success with a microphone. In a small apartment, a youthful-looking woman in her 70s, Carla Rogers, sings into a smartphone while on a computer. Lisa twists a compass in a dining space. A bicycle is repaired, and a teacher is applauded as Rogers communicates with artisans. Lisa, sporting overalls, a jumper, an elegant scarf, and a sun hat, relaxes at a Russian beach shack sipping lemonade when a motorbike pulls up. The passenger, Ahmed, with short blond hair in a bun, whispers to Lisa, who grabs her purse and lemonade and hops on the motorbike. Lisa sips her lemonade as Ahmed rides to a toll on a paved road where they're observed. Lisa peers at a wooden shack through a telescope, with chickens pecking around on the lawn. Ahmed speaks on his laptop while they're monitored on a display in a UN observation station."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby caf√©, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
