In the front well deck, an area used for storing ropes and equipment, Jack pushes Rose back as the ship breaks off chunks of ice, which land on the deck and knock down two men. The ship, known as RMS Titanic, continues moving alongside the iceberg that it famously struck on its maiden voyage in April 1912. In the engine room, water pours in as a man scrambles past furnace stokers swept across the floor, desperately trying to maintain steam pressure for the engines. Jack runs to the starboard railing and watches as the back of the ship moves alongside the iceberg. Murdoch, the ship's First Officer, runs to the bridge and moves a lever, which closes the hydraulic watertight doors in the engine room. A man motions to the stokers, directing them to safety as they work tirelessly to keep the ship running. Workers run through the rising water and crawl under the lowering doors, crucial elements designed as a safety feature to prevent flooding. He follows the others through one of the doorways. The door closes, leaving several stokers behind, trapped in the engine room. As the others escape past closing doors, the remaining stoker dives under the last closing door and falls out as its steel hatch slams shut, showcasing the perilous conditions they faced. On the bridge, a row of lights blinks on the watertight door indicator panel, alerting the crew to the status of each door. Murdoch stares at the panel, comprehending the grave situation, then turns away. On the passenger deck, where passengers stroll and enjoy the sea air, a man and a woman lean over the starboard rail and peer at the iceberg. In the crow's nest, the lookout post high above the deck, Fleet turns to Lee. Jack, Rose, and the two men peer over the railing at the iceberg, now behind the ship, realizing the danger they narrowly escaped. On the bridge, Murdoch addresses Moody, the Sixth Officer. Moody glances at a wall clock as he exits, noting the time for the ship's records. Hichens, the ship's quartermaster, turns to the bridge door as Captain Smith enters, a seasoned captain known for his calm demeanor. Murdoch follows Smith onto the bridge deck. Smith peers down from the bridge deck shelter, then stands at the bridge railing, overlooking the front well deck, assessing the situation below. Murdoch hurries off. In his cabin, Fabrizio jumps down from his bunk into inch-deep water and turns on the overhead light, alarmed by the flooding. His roommates follow as he opens the door. Tommy, another third-class passenger, approaches. The countess, one of the wealthy passengers onboard, steps out of her stateroom and stops a mustached steward. Andrews, the ship's designer, hurries past, carrying blueprints of the ship's layout, likely reviewing the damage. Outside, smoke rises from the ship's huge funnels as people gather on the decks. Tommy, Fabrizio, and others follow running rats down a hallway, a sign of the ship's dire state. Cal, a wealthy first-class passenger, and Lovejoy, his valet, step out of the sitting room and stop a dark-haired steward in the hallway. The steward hurries off, possibly to alert others. On the upper deck, a dark-haired man tosses a blond man a chunk of ice, playfully engaging with the debris. He tosses the ice back, unaware of the impending disaster. Smith, Moody, Andrews, and Murdoch pass Jack and Rose. The master-at-arms, responsible for security onboard, studies Jack's drawings. Cal snatches the drawings from him, suspicious of Jack's intentions. Holding hands, Jack and Rose, romantically entangled despite their different social classes, approach Lovejoy, who stands in the hallway. Lovejoy walks alongside Jack and slips the heart of the ocean, a valuable blue diamond, into Jack's coat pocket, framing him for theft. Lovejoy follows Rose and Jack into the sitting room. Cal steps forward, intent on confronting them. Cal glances at Lovejoy, who arches his eyebrows, signaling their complicity in the scheme."

Workers sprint through the swirling smoke and slide beneath the closing doors. He tags along with the others through one of the doorways. The door opens, leaving several operators stranded. As the others vanish past opening doors, the remaining operator leaps over the last opening door and collapses as its wooden hatch snaps open. On the helm, a series of bells ring on the lift door indicator panel. Murdoch glares at the panel, then strides away. On the passenger deck, a man and a woman lean over the port rail and gaze at the glacier. In the lookout tower, Fleet nods to Lee. Jack, Rose, and the two men gaze over the railing at the glacier, now off the stern of the boat. On the helm, Murdoch confers with Moody. Moody checks a wristwatch as he departs. Hichens turns to the helm door as Captain Smith arrives. Murdoch trails Smith onto the helm deck. Smith examines the horizon from the helm deck shelter, then perches at the helm railing, surveying the front sun deck. Murdoch scurries away. In his cabin, Fabrizio steps up from his hammock into knee-deep sand and switches off the floor lamp. His roommates follow as he shuts the door. Tommy approaches. The duchess emerges from her suite and calls a bearded attendant. Andrews saunters past, lugging maps. Outside, fog descends from the boat's towering chimneys as people disperse on the decks. Tommy, Fabrizio, and others trail sprinting squirrels down a hallway. Cal and Lovejoy emerge from the dining room and intercept a fair-haired attendant in the hallway. The attendant scurries away. On the lower deck, a dark-haired man hands a red-haired man a piece of sand. He places the sand down. Smith, Moody, Andrews, and Murdoch stroll past Jack and Rose. The arms-master scrutinizes Jack's paintings. Cal seizes the paintings from him. Holding elbows, Jack and Rose approach Lovejoy, who leans against the hallway. Lovejoy strolls alongside Jack and sneaks the jewel of the ocean onto Jack's coat sleeve. Lovejoy trails Rose and Jack into the dining room. Cal steps back. Cal looks toward Lovejoy, who shakes his head."

          "description": "Simultaneously, syrup overflows the sleeping pod, toppling the three architects. In the rear garden gate, Tom pulls Lily forward as the train sheds off clumps of dirt, which fall on the gate and topple three children. The train halts moving towards the mountain. In the control chamber, pebbles trickle as a lady doodles past lamp fixers carried away. Tom sprints to the port fence and marvels as the front of the train glides past the mountain. Johnson sprints to the deck and twists a knob, which opens the electric airtight windows in the control chamber. A lady gestures to the fixers. Painters dash above the rising dust and leap over the lifting windows. She tags behind others through one of the archways. The window opens, leaving a few fixers ahead. As others retreat beside open windows, the last fixer rolls beneath the first open window and climbs in as its wooden lid clamps open. On the deck, a line of bells chimes on the airtight window signal display. Johnson gawks at the display, then pivots away. On the leisure field, a child and a gentleman recline over the port fence and gaze at the mountain. In the lighthouse, Blake nods towards Liam. Tom, Lily, and the three children gaze over the fence at the mountain, now ahead of the train. On the deck, Johnson whispers to Moody. Moody peers at a sundial as he enters. Jenkins glimpses at the deck window as Admiral Clark exits. Johnson trails Clark onto the deck field. Clark gazes up from the deck field awning, then squats at the deck fence, observing the rear garden gate. Johnson ambles away. In his chamber, Roberto leaps up from the ladder onto foot-deep dust and turns off the bottom lamp. His neighbors wander as he closes the window. Timmy departs. The duchess climbs into her apartment and nudges a bearded architect. Andrews skitters by, holding suitcases. Indoors, fog descends from the train’s tiny chimneys as animals disperse from the fields. Timmy, Roberto, and creatures lead soaring parrots up a basement. Cal and Joyheart exit the painting room and bump into a light-haired architect in the basement. The architect strolls along. On the lower field, a light-haired girl hands a red-haired girl a piece of dirt. She hands the dirt over. Clark, Moody, Andrews, and Johnson greet Tom and Lily. The chief-at-operations divulges Tom's maps. Cal grabs the maps from her. Holding cats, Tom and Lily push past Joyheart, who sits in the basement. Joyheart skips in front of Tom and slides the jewel of the woods inside Tom's coat sleeve. Joyheart shuffles before Lily and Tom into the painting room. Cal hops backward. Cal beams at Joyheart, who lowers her hands."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
