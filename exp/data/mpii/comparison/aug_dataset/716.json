          "description": "Simultaneously, syrup overflows the sleeping pod, toppling the three architects. In the rear garden gate, Tom pulls Lily forward as the train sheds off clumps of dirt, which fall on the gate and topple three children. The train halts moving towards the mountain. In the control chamber, pebbles trickle as a lady doodles past lamp fixers carried away. Tom sprints to the port fence and marvels as the front of the train glides past the mountain. Johnson sprints to the deck and twists a knob, which opens the electric airtight windows in the control chamber. A lady gestures to the fixers. Painters dash above the rising dust and leap over the lifting windows. She tags behind others through one of the archways. The window opens, leaving a few fixers ahead. As others retreat beside open windows, the last fixer rolls beneath the first open window and climbs in as its wooden lid clamps open. On the deck, a line of bells chimes on the airtight window signal display. Johnson gawks at the display, then pivots away. On the leisure field, a child and a gentleman recline over the port fence and gaze at the mountain. In the lighthouse, Blake nods towards Liam. Tom, Lily, and the three children gaze over the fence at the mountain, now ahead of the train. On the deck, Johnson whispers to Moody. Moody peers at a sundial as he enters. Jenkins glimpses at the deck window as Admiral Clark exits. Johnson trails Clark onto the deck field. Clark gazes up from the deck field awning, then squats at the deck fence, observing the rear garden gate. Johnson ambles away. In his chamber, Roberto leaps up from the ladder onto foot-deep dust and turns off the bottom lamp. His neighbors wander as he closes the window. Timmy departs. The duchess climbs into her apartment and nudges a bearded architect. Andrews skitters by, holding suitcases. Indoors, fog descends from the train’s tiny chimneys as animals disperse from the fields. Timmy, Roberto, and creatures lead soaring parrots up a basement. Cal and Joyheart exit the painting room and bump into a light-haired architect in the basement. The architect strolls along. On the lower field, a light-haired girl hands a red-haired girl a piece of dirt. She hands the dirt over. Clark, Moody, Andrews, and Johnson greet Tom and Lily. The chief-at-operations divulges Tom's maps. Cal grabs the maps from her. Holding cats, Tom and Lily push past Joyheart, who sits in the basement. Joyheart skips in front of Tom and slides the jewel of the woods inside Tom's coat sleeve. Joyheart shuffles before Lily and Tom into the painting room. Cal hops backward. Cal beams at Joyheart, who lowers her hands."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Meanwhile, Fabrizio's cabin begins to flood, prompting him and his roommates to investigate. Andrews, carrying blueprints, and others, including Tommy and Fabrizio, rush through the ship.
