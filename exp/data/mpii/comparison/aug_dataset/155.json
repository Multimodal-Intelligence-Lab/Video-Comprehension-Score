Her lips curve into a warm smile directed at Gandhi, who responds by breaking into a grin and casting a glance down at his simple dhoti, subtly indicating with humor that he does not wear elaborate clothing. Observing this, Bourke-White reveals a look of genuine appreciation, having quickly taken in and become impressed by Gandhi's humble demeanor. As Gandhi begins to walk, Bourke-White matches his pace, staying by his side, her focus attuned to listening while her eyes actively search for the perfect moment to immortalize in a photograph. She skillfully frames Gandhi as the focal point of her shot, ensuring that a soldier positioned on a wall above and behind Gandhi is visible in the background, adding layers to the composition. Despite Gandhi's initial shrug, he maintains his composure, handling the moment with poise. Through Bourke-White's strategic perspective, Gandhi continues his steady walking, with the soldier maintaining his pace in the background, allowing her to seize the opportunity and capture the photograph. Nearby, a spinning wheel whirs rapidly, its motion quick and rhythmic, as Gandhi, with a friendly smile aimed at Bourke-White, operates one of the wheels while she, with less ease, attempts to mimic his actions on another wheel. They find themselves situated in a garden that, though slightly overgrown, is beautifully touched by latticed fretwork that casts intricate patterns of sunlight on the grass and shrubs, maintaining its aesthetic appeal. As Bourke-White grins at her own fumbling efforts and perseveres with determination, it becomes apparent that she is earnestly committed to the task. Gandhi's smile broadens, and a shared laughter erupts between them, drawing the curious observation of a guard from a distance on the wall. Gandhi then moves closer to Bourke-White and, with a demonstration, guides her through the process by taking her hands, offering his expertise. While she studies both him and the spinning wheel, Gandhi flashes a smile that suggests understanding, though not completely masking his impatience. In a moment of surprise, she lifts her gaze to meet his, and he responds with a tolerant sigh, which she accepts without challenge as she pivots her focus to another line of questioning. Ba takes a moment to pause, offering a smile once more, then gives a shrug, implying that the subject at hand is something settled in the past. They exchange serious glances for a moment before sharing a sudden, spontaneous burst of laughter that echoes with the carefree spirit of schoolgirls. Meanwhile, military personnel execute their duties with quiet urgency around the main entrance, their movements conveying the gravity of the situation as two military ambulances remain stationed nearby. A British major makes a rapid descent down the steps, where he encounters a British army doctor ascending, and he gestures discreetly for the doctor to step aside for a private exchange. As the major receives the updates, his expression shifts to one of defeat and depression, burdened by the news. Ba is reclined on a mat, her head resting on a pillow, her eyes shut, and her breathing labored, while Mirabehn sits beside her, softly rubbing Ba's arm with comforting gestures. Not far from them, Gandhi stands, eyes fixated on the floor in a state of distracted contemplation, with Pyarelal maintaining a quiet presence behind him.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
