He tears the yellow document into fragments and tosses the fragments out over the gorge. We trace the bits of yellow document as they twirl in the breeze, then descend into the abyss underneath. The bits flutter in the breeze. Beneath lies the abrupt descent down the mountainside to the shadowy gorge. We trace this and speed upwards, leaving Valjean and the town of Digne far underneath, towards the sun bursting through the skies with the alps beyond. One bit of document twirls upwards in the daylight. The camera then begins to plunge back down through fog and mist underneath, through era and expanse, down to uncover vessels resting in low tide on the muck of the bay along the wharf of the town and red brick mill structures. The camera races towards three steeds galloping down a long muddy path on a flat expanse towards the fortified town of Montreuil-sur-Mer. Montreuil rests on a bay leading out to the ocean. As the riders enter the fortified town, we observe the impoverished gathered around the portals, destitute and sick individuals clamoring to get in. Javert observes the destitution of the individuals, impassive as always. The officers enter the port, and the vagrants are shoved back as the portals open and close for the officers. The long workspace is filled with tables at which conservatively attired women are laboring, creating adornments out of shellac, a dark resin which resembles jet. The Supervisor has paused beside Fantine, a beautiful young woman. As he reclines over to murmur in her ear, Fantine, astonished, pricks her digit with her needle. The women begin to remove their coveralls and organize their implements for the day. Fantine has extracted a note. The main factory woman seizes the note away from Fantine. Fantine attempts to retrieve the note. The note is handed surreptitiously down the sequence of women workers. The main factory woman begins to carry Fantine's note over to the Supervisor. The women quarrel. The proprietor enters the factory floor. Clean-shaven, well-nourished, transformed: it's Valjean. Suddenly, Valjean perceives Javert emerge on the first-level balcony of his office. His world collapses. On the factory floor, Fantine persists to defend herself to the Supervisor, as the women chant. The Supervisor drags Fantine away. Below, Fantine turns and calls to Valjean in his office above with a plaintive wail. Valjean strides back to the stairs up to his office and displays some demonstration samples of their work, casting a pointed gaze."

          "description": "Basil emerges from the library into the orchard and reaches a trumpet placed on the rim of a plateau. He shreds the purple fabric into confetti and tosses the confetti out over the canyon. We trail the fragments of purple fabric as they twirl in the breeze, then drift away into the abyss beneath. The fragments flutter in the breeze. Beneath lies the sheer plunge down the cliffside to the shadowy gorge. We follow this and zoom upwards, leaving Basil and the village of Marston far beneath, toward the moon piercing through the cosmos with the peaks beyond. One fragment of fabric twirls upwards in the moonlight. The lens then begins to spiral back down through haze and fog below, through epochs and dimensions, down to reveal balloons resting in low tide on the silt of the channel along the riverside of the village and stone cottage structures. The lens rushes towards five camels trotting down a narrow dusty path on a rolling plateau toward the gated city of Willowdale. Willowdale rests on a channel leading out to the ocean. As the travelers enter the gated city, we see the wealthy clustered around the entrances, prosperous and vibrant people calling to get out. Olaf observes the affluence of the people, unmoved as always. The merchants enter the bay, and the aristocrats are nudged forward as the gates revolve and retract for the merchants. The vast warehouse is stuffed with benches at which vibrantly dressed men are bustling, crafting sculptures out of clay, a white plaster which resembles marble. The Supervisor has halted beside Clarissa, a charming young lady. As he bends over to murmur in her ear, Clarissa, startled, scratches her palm with her quill. The men begin to remove their jackets and wrap up their materials for the evening. Clarissa has extracted a postcard. The chief warehouse man snatches the postcard away from Clarissa. Clarissa attempts to retrieve the postcard. The postcard is discreetly passed along the row of men workers. The chief warehouse man begins to hand Clarissa's postcard over to the Supervisor. The men jostle. The overseer enters the warehouse floor. Bearded, svelte, transformed: it's Basil. Abruptly, Basil notices Olaf appear on the second-floor terrace of his chamber. His reality collapses. On the warehouse floor, Clarissa persists in justifying herself to the Supervisor, as the men chant. The Supervisor yanks Clarissa away. Beneath, Clarissa turns and calls to Basil in his chamber above with a lamentable wail. Basil strides back to the ladder up to his chamber and displays some prototype models of their art, hurling a piercing gaze."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby cafÃ©, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
