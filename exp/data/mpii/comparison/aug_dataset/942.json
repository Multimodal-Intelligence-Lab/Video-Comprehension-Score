The curtains are parted by Holmes, and nosegays are seen lying on a table. With her back to him, a woman is stood, and coins are put by him in a shell-shaped bowl. The high cheekboned brunette turns around, and Holmes is sat. A match is lit from a candle by Madam Sim, who picks up a pack of tarot cards. With intense focus, the pack is stared at by Holmes, who places a finger on his forehead, takes the pack from her, and flicks through them. The Devil card is laid down on the table by him, and a letter is taken out from inside his jacket and dropped on the table. Sim, looking amazed, picks it up, finds inside a sketch of a man with a goatee beard, and says, \"That is the price I must pay to change the course of history.\" She looks up from the letter as a look is given to her by him, and he gets up.

She is a brunette with distinctively high cheekbones, and upon turning, Holmes swiftly takes a seat. Madam Sim then lights a match using a flickering candle, retrieving a pack of tarot cards. Holmes fixes his gaze intently on the pack, pressing a thoughtful finger against his forehead, before taking the cards from her and skillfully flicking through them.

          "description": "Mycroft winces visibly, his expression contorting slightly as he observes Watson indulging himself enthusiastically at the gaming tables, with chips clinking and cards shuffling. Meanwhile, Mycroft engages in casual conversation with some other men, their voices blending with the ambient sounds of the busy room. Holmes, however, quietly disengages from the scene downstairs and ascends the staircase, his footsteps barely audible as he makes his way to the upper level, driven by the memory of a bearded man, whom he had earlier witnessed emerging from behind the heavy curtains while carrying a fragrant nosegay. With measured steps, he approaches the curtains, his fingers finding the fabric’s edge and gently pulling it aside to reveal a small table, upon which several nosegays are laid out precisely. A short distance away, a woman stands with her back turned to him, her silhouette outlined by the ambient light. Without hesitation, Holmes places several coins into a shell-shaped bowl that sits atop the table. As the coins settle with a clink, the woman, a high-cheekboned brunette, pivots gracefully to face him, prompting Holmes to lower himself into a seated position. Madam Sim, as she is known, deftly lights a match against the flickering candle flame, her movements deliberate and practiced, before picking up a pack of tarot cards that rests nearby. Holmes fixes his gaze on the pack with intense scrutiny, raising a finger to his forehead in a gesture of contemplation. He then reaches out, taking the pack from her hand, and, with deft fingers, flicks through the cards until he isolates the Devil card, placing it purposefully on the table before her. With a swift motion, he reaches inside his jacket, extracting a letter, which he nonchalantly drops onto the table beside the card. Sim, her expression shifting to one of amazement, retrieves the letter and examines its contents, discovering within a sketch of a man with a goatee beard. She declares with a solemn tone, \"That is the price I must pay to change the course of history.\" Her eyes lift from the letter, meeting Holmes’s gaze as he offers her a knowing look and rises from his seat. Sim responds by reaching for a gun, her intent clear, while Holmes picks up an umbrella, already formulating a plan of attack against the Corsac in his mind. With a calculated swing, he employs the umbrella with precision, causing the Corsac to drop to the floor. Holmes then deftly disarms him, knocking a knife from his grasp. In a fluid sequence of movements, he executes a slow-motion karate chop to the Corsac's face, follows it with a debilitating kick to the groin, and finally bludgeons the man with the umbrella. The Corsac retaliates by lunging with his knife, but Holmes anticipates the move, dodging adeptly and maneuvering the umbrella handle skillfully around the man's throat. In a display of strength and agility, Holmes throws the Corsac over his shoulder, administering a decisive whack to his face. Transitioning from the imagined scenario into reality, Holmes, with a determined yank, pulls the Corsac down from the rafters using the umbrella, effectively disarming him. In a swift, unexpected motion, Sim secures the victory by hurling a knife that embeds itself into the Corsac’s chest, ending the confrontation. As Holmes and Sim prepare to make their exit, a man accompanied by two couples enters the scene, oblivious to the recent events. However, the Corsac, not yet defeated, regains consciousness, launching himself to his feet, and shedding his cumbersome coat, which reveals Sim's embedded knife. Brandishing another blade, he resumes his pursuit of Holmes and Sim. The Corsac runs with agility along the edge of a balcony within the spacious building, executing a daring somersault off it to descend to a lower level, intent on intercepting Holmes and Sim. Holmes, in response, hurls the Corsac, who rebounds with a back-flip off a nearby wall, persistently advancing towards him once more. Meanwhile, down on the bustling ground floor, Watson remains immersed in his card game, focused and seemingly enjoying a winning streak. Sim takes the opportunity to strike the Corsac over the head with a bottle, creating a momentary advantage. Seizing the opportunity, Holmes twists the Corsac’s arm, leveraging his body weight to throw him onto a nearby sofa. A struggle ensues, during which the Corsac's blade makes contact with Holmes' cheek, leaving a shallow scrape. Holmes recoils momentarily from the sting, but his attention is quickly refocused as the Corsac turns his aggression towards Sim. Driven by resolve, Holmes urgently gives chase, tackling the Corsac to the floor with force, yet the Corsac exhibits resilience, springing back to his feet and seizing Sim by the hair, prompting a continuation of their fierce confrontation."

          "description": "Mycroft winces as Watson, who has a penchant for roulette, enjoys himself at the gaming tables, and Mycroft chats to some other men about current political intrigues. Holmes goes upstairs in the grand Victorian building to investigate where he earlier saw a bearded man carrying a nosegay, a small bouquet often used to combat foul smells, appear from behind the heavy velvet curtains. Holmes parts the curtains and sees nosegays lying on a table typically used for séances. A woman stands with her back to him, and he discreetly puts coins in a shell-shaped bowl, a customary payment for her services. The high cheekboned brunette turns around, revealing herself to be Madam Sim, a renowned fortune-teller, and Holmes sits. Madam Sim lights a match from a candle, a practice said to enhance mystical powers, and picks up a pack of tarot cards. Holmes stares intently at the pack, known for its symbolism, places a finger on his forehead as if deep in thought, takes the pack from her, and flicks through them. He lays the Devil card down on the table, a card often associated with chaos and temptation, reaches inside his jacket for an old envelope, takes out the letter, and drops it on the table. Sim looks amazed and picks it up, finding inside a sketch of a man with a goatee beard, and says, \"That is the price I must pay to change the course of history,\" implying a significant decision demands great sacrifice. She looks up from the letter as he gives her a look and gets up. She reaches for a gun, a small pistol often hidden in a woman's bodice, while he picks up an umbrella, an unusual but effective weapon, and plans his attack on the Corsac, a notorious adversary, in his mind. He swings the brolly, and the Corsac drops down. He knocks a knife from the man's hand, and, in slow motion, karate-chops the Corsac about the face, a technique taught in Eastern martial arts, followed by a kick in the groin and bludgeoning the man with the brolly. The Corsac lunges with a knife, but Holmes dodges the attack using the agility developed from years of training and hooks the umbrella handle around the man's throat, throws the man over his shoulder with a jujutsu move, and whacks him in the face. Now, for real, Holmes pulls the Corsac down from the rafters with the umbrella and disarms him. Sim kills the Corsac by throwing a knife, which she expertly wields, into his chest. Holmes goes over to her, and as they leave, a man known for his informant ties and two couples come in. The Corsac comes round, leaps to his feet, takes off his heavy coat, often used to conceal weapons, in which Sim's knife is embedded, and brandishing another blade, goes after Holmes and Sim. He runs along the edge of a balcony within the building, somersaults off it down to a lower level with the grace of an acrobat, and heads off Holmes and Sim. Holmes throws the Corsac, who back-flips off a wall in a display of agility and comes at him again. Meanwhile, on the ground floor, Watson is still playing cards, surrounded by stacks of chips; at least he's winning. Sim whacks the Corsac over the head with a bottle, reminiscent of barroom brawls. Holmes twists his arm using a practiced hold and throws him onto a plush Victorian sofa. They struggle, and the Corsac's blade scrapes Holmes' cheek, drawing a thin line of blood. Holmes recoils as the Corsac goes after Sim. Holmes gives chase and tackles him to the floor, but the Corsac springs up and grabs Sim by the hair, pulling her towards him."

Miss Plum strikes a match from a lantern and lifts a deck of playing cards. Hudson gazes thoughtfully at the deck and taps a chin with his elbow, takes the deck from him, and scans through them. He places the Emperor card on the sofa, reaches inside her sweater, pulls out the map, and throws it on the sofa.

The round-eared blonde pivots around, and Magellan tumbles. Madam Quirk ignites a torch from a lantern and scoops up a pile of postage stamps. Magellan glares earnestly at the pile and taps a wheel on his ankle, snatches the pile from her, and flits past them. He drops the Joker stamp onto the bicycle, unzips a backpack, extracts a blueprint, and flings it on the bicycle. Quirk appears astonished and grabs it, discovering within a doodle of a frog with a monocle, and states, \"That is the fortune I must offer to reroute the path of destiny.\" She peers above the blueprint as he offers a wink and takes off. She grabs for a candlestick, while he grabs a violin and formulates his parade on the Cactus in his mind. He twirls the violin, and the Cactus flutters down. He plucks a spoon from the frog's paw and, in fast motion, polka-dances the Cactus about the toes, followed by a tickle in the elbow and stroking the frog with the violin. The Cactus swoops with a spoon, but Magellan sidesteps the parade and lassos the violin string around the frog's ankle, flings the frog under his elbow, and pokes him in the whiskers.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

          "description": "Mycroft watches uncomfortably as Watson enjoys gaming tables while Holmes investigates upstairs. Holmes discovers nosegays and meets Madam Sim, who, using tarot cards, reveals a sketch of a bearded man. Holmes hands her a letter, startling her. An altercation with the Corsac ensues, which Holmes plans mentally. He disarms the Corsac, but Sim kills him with a knife to the chest. As they try to leave, the Corsac revives, sheds his coat with Sim's knife, and chases them. He performs acrobatics to intercept Holmes and Sim. Meanwhile, Watson continues to win at cards. Sim strikes the Corsac with a bottle, and Holmes throws him onto a sofa. After a struggle, Holmes dodges the Corsac's blade, and as the Corsac attacks Sim, Holmes intervenes, tackling him to the floor before the Corsac grabs Sim by the hair."
