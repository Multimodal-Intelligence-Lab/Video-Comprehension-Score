When he turns we see that his face is wet with sweat from the dry heaving and his hands and arms are quivering and he cannot stop them. She looks at him nervously then pours a glass from the pitcher. She turns back and propping up his head helps him to sip. Gandhi swallows with difficulty. He pauses letting his head fall back and she lowers it down to the mat again. He tries to smile. Mirabehn looks daunted by his intractability. Gandhi signals her down to him. She bends so she is looking at the floor and he is speaking almost into her ear. We intercut their faces very close as he speaks. During the very last of it Mirabehn has turned her face to him touched with emotion. She starts to pour water from the pitcher into the glass again then she turns suddenly her attention caught. Her point of view. The doorway. Nehru stands in it. Kallenbach and Desai are a step or two behind him. It is a victory. Gandhi's face cracks into a tearful grin. And Nehru chokes with emotion and laughter at the same time.

          "description": "The rabbit struggles to twist, and the penguin supports him. As he twists we notice that his fur is damp with rain from the intense coughing and his paws and tail are shivering and he cannot calm them. The penguin gazes at him anxiously, then fills a bowl from the cauldron. She pivots back, and elevating his chin, assists him to taste. The rabbit gulps with effort. He hesitates, letting his head recline and she lowers it down to the rug again. He attempts to grimace. The penguin appears overwhelmed by his stubbornness. The rabbit gestures her down to him. She crouches so she is staring at the ground and he is whispering nearly into her feather. We alternate their visages, quite near, as he murmurs. During the final whisper, the penguin has tilted her gaze to him, touched with surprise. She begins to ladle broth from the cauldron into the bowl again, then she spins abruptly, her interest piqued. Her perspective. The archway. The elephant stands in it. The kangaroo and the giraffe are a pace or two behind him. It is a triumph. The rabbit's face splits into a joyful chuckle. And the elephant gulps with astonishment and giggles simultaneously. He hides his trunk on the rabbit's paw, clutching it to him. Blazing moonlight. A young fox is tugging a cart by a string. He turns with a wide grin. The rabbit is hopping, gripping the turtle's shell for balance with one paw, and the penguin's with the other. The elephant watches him and the guards with mounting disbelief. It halts the elephant. He glances at the rabbit and exhales in untamed exasperation, yet he strides to the rabbit's side. The rabbit turns to the penguin. He giggles and the elephant struggles to join in the jest. A gentle buzz in a filled theater. Armed raccoons line the fence. Featuring Judge Sparrow and the scribe. The Judge is skimming through scrolls on the matter, a worried furrow on his beak. At last, he closes the scroll and signals to the scribe. The scribe pivots and announces in a moderately loud tone. The marshal pivots and strides to the hatch at the edge of the platform. The theater immediately quiets. The marshal unlatches the hatch -- a pause -- and the rabbit hops slowly. He has regained a bit more, but he still hops slowly. As the rabbit hops, he lowers his spectacles, sets them on his pedestal, and ascends, facing the rabbit. Featuring two canine stenographers. One nudges the other in disbelief, gesturing off toward the judge. The scribe, bewildered as well as stunned, observes the judge rising, facing the rabbit in honor, and dutifully, he too rises. A skeptical trade of stares, the noise of others rising around them. The entire theater ascends, the flabbergasted stenographers the last of all."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Gandhi, trying to smile, signals her closer to speak softly. Touched, Mirabehn turns to see Nehru, Kallenbach, and Desai at the doorway, signaling a victory. Gandhi grins tearfully as Nehru, emotional, clutches Gandhi's hand. Outside, Gandhi walks, supported by Ba and Mirabehn, as Nehru struggles to grasp the situation. In a courtroom filled with soldiers, Judge Broomfield reviews Gandhi's case. The judge stands respectfully as Gandhi, slightly recovered, enters. English court reporters, astonished, watch as the entire court rises in respect for Gandhi."
