The screen becomes completely dominated by the eyes, nose, and mouth of a woman who is moving closer and closer to the CAMERA, intending to give Jeff a kiss. Her face remains mostly cast in shadow, though a faint glimmer of light from the window illuminates her profile slightly. She kisses Jeff firmly, with an assertive touch, but it lacks the intensity of deep passion. Then, her head retreats just an inch or two, and she begins to speak.

As Jeff begins to stir from his sleep, his eyes slowly, almost languidly, open, and he directs his gaze upward. The screen then becomes overwhelmingly dominated by the eyes, nose, and mouth of a woman who is, in her approach, moving closer and more intimately toward the CAMERA, clearly intending to give Jeff a kiss.

He remains in peaceful slumber until a shadow, cast by another person, subtly creeps across his face. As the shadow plays upon his features, his eyelids slowly flutter open, awareness dawning in his gaze. He turns his eyes upwards, just in time to see the screen dominated by the approaching eyes, nose, and mouth of a woman who steadily moves closer to the CAMERA, intending to kiss Jeff. The womanâ€™s face, mostly enveloped in shadow except for a faint glow from the window tracing her profile, descends as she places a firm yet unpassionate kiss upon Jeff's lips. Her head then retreats slightly, just an inch or two, and she begins to speak. The CAMERA captures this moment, with their profiles enlarging to fill the frame before it lowers, leading the audience to focus exclusively on the expression in their eyes, while their lips exit the bottom of the screen. Without missing a beat, the CAMERA trails her as she swiftly advances towards another lamp, distancing herself slightly so her form is visible down to the waist. Upon reaching the lamp, she turns it on, the illumination deftly revealing that her allure extends beyond her facial beauty. The CAMERA follows her graceful motion to yet another lamp, which she also lights, now displaying her full figure. She stands impeccably dressed in high-style, dramatic evening wear, her entire appearance beautifully groomed and flawless. Jeff's gaze crosses from his current position to take in her elegant form. In response, she executes a professional model's turn, elegantly showcasing the dress's features. Jeff responds to this display, prompting her to laugh softly. Her eyes wander down to a long mahogany table beside her, cluttered with his personal belongings, including her own handbag. As she speaks, her eyes flit across the tabletop, as if searching for something specific. Her search ends as she picks up an old and cracked cigarette box, examining it thoughtfully while continuing her conversation. She turns to face him again, moving towards him with a purposeful stride, bearing the cigarette box. Facing Jeff, she makes a quick decision, pivoting towards the door with urgency, and as she rushes past, she deftly drops the cigarette box back onto the table, THE CAMERA closely following her movements. Ascending the two steps leading to the door, she halts and turns back towards Jeff, extending her arm to grasp the doorknob, which she turns with a swift motion. The door swings open revealing a middle-aged waiter, framed perfectly in the doorway. He wears a pristine white linen pea jacket, accented by a red collar, exuding an aura of tender amusement. A smile plays across his lips as he acknowledges them with a nod and steps inside. In one hand, he balances a substantial portable warming oven, while the other grips an ice bucket, its contentsâ€”a bottle of wine discreetly shrouded with a napkin. Descending the stairs, she trails behind him, seamlessly taking the wine bucket he extends to her, which she then places with care upon the table. THE CAMERA seamlessly accompanies them, capturing their synchronized choreography as he advances towards the kitchen, while she diverts towards a small bar set within the wall cabinet."

          "description": "The CAMERA DRIFTS FORWARD into Harry's greenhouse until his hand fills the frame. He is alert. A shadow of some other creature slithers over his feet. His toes start to wiggle. He glances down. The screen is filled with the wings, beak, and talons of an eagle diving closer and closer to the CAMERA to peck Harry. The beak is more or less in sunlight, with a bright beam flashing onto the silhouette from the lantern. The bird pecks Harry softly, but not gently. Then its wings flap back a foot or two. It screeches. The two giant silhouettes fill the frame. It drifts up until the feathers move out of the top of the screen, leaving just the talons filling it. The CAMERA FOLLOWS IT slowly to another branch. It perches a little farther away from us so that we now see it down to its tail. It turns on the third branch, and the shadow reveals to us that its majesty is not only in its beak. The CAMERA PANS IT over to a fourth branch which it lands on. It is now full bird, dramatically poised and fearless. Its plumage is top-grade flair and bold wilderness attire. Harry stares across the greenhouse at it. It does a victorious predator's flap with its wings, showcasing its prowess. Harry groans. It caws triumphantly. It glances up at the tall oak wardrobe beside it, which is cluttered with a myriad of his garden tools. Its own perch is also on the wardrobe. As it screeches, its talons scrape the wardrobe as if it's searching for something peculiar. Max discovers what he has been seeking, snatches up an ancient and battered toolbox, and inspects it as he squawks. He turns to glance at it and swoops toward it, gripping the toolbox. Max confronts Harry on the bench. He spins around swiftly and bolts to the tunnel, dropping the toolbox on the wardrobe as he passes, THE CAMERA GLIDING with him. He flutters up the four branches, halts, and crumbles back to Harry. He reaches for the trapdoor and nudges it. He flings open the hatch and perches to one direction. Framed in the hatchway is a young gardener dressed in a blue cotton apron with a green hem. Her expression is one of gentle curiosity. She giggles, winks, and exits. She's holding in one claw a small portable cooling fan, and in the other claw a basket containing a stack of seeds wrapped with a leaf. She flutters down the trunk as he chases. She hands him the seed basket, and he places it on the wardrobe. THE CAMERA FOLLOWS with both of them as she heads toward the conservatory and he maneuvers to a large shelf set in the corner alcove."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby cafÃ©, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
