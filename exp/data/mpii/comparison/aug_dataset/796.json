The gentleman hands Willie some documents. As Grandma dozes off in front of the TV, Willie is outside amusing the barmaid in the hot tub, still wearing his merry red cap, vigorously thrusting Sue, the barmaid, up against the side of the hot tub amid vapors and foam.

Willie struggles with all his might to contain his growing irritation. The boy then swiftly moves one of his own pieces, capturing three of Willie's pieces in one masterful stroke, all while reaching the far end of the board at the same time. Frustrated, Willie gives the boy a glare and, in a moment of irritation, throws the board up into the air, causing the pieces to scatter, while the boy continues to gaze at him calmly and unperturbed by this outburst. \n\nShortly thereafter, Willie goes to the door, which he opens to reveal a man with a receding hairline standing outside. He extends his hand in greeting, glancing over briefly at the kid. The balding man then hands Willie a stack of paperwork. Meanwhile, inside the house, Grandma is dozing off comfortably in front of the flickering television screen. Outside, Willie is busy entertaining the barmaid in the hot tub, still wearing his bright and cheerful red cap. He energetically engages with Sue, the barmaid, as they are pressed up against the side of the hot tub, surrounded by swirling smoke and foamy water.\n\nLater on, back in the living room, Willie pours himself a glass of straight vodka while preparing a vodka and orange juice for her. Taking their seats together on the sofa, he hands her the mixed drink and they both take generous gulps from their respective glasses.

He picks up the calendar, placing the vodka bottle down on the table briefly, before proceeding to tear open the remaining doors on the calendar, scarfing down the chocolate inside with little regard. With the calendar now ruined and all the chocolate devoured, he picks the vodka bottle back up and makes his way towards the lounge. Pausing in the doorway, he drains the remaining quarter of the bottle’s contents, lets out a loud belch, and then collapses backwards, lying in an unconscious heap on the hall carpet.\n\nThe next morning arrives, and Willie is woken up by a kid who is clearly distressed. Willie remains unfazed as grandma continues to slumber. Holding a hand covered in blood, the kid leads Willie to the kitchen, where Willie places the hand under running water from the tap, pouring vodka over the wound to disinfect it.

Willie struggles internally to suppress a rising tide of irritation as the kid, with rapid and decisive movement, strategically shifts one of his pieces, successfully capturing three of Willie's in one swift maneuver while simultaneously advancing to the board's far end. Overcome with frustration, Willie’s eyes narrow into an intense glare before he impulsively launches the board into the air, pieces scattering in all directions, while the kid remains unfazed, meeting Willie's gaze with a calm and steady stare. Time passes, and soon Willie opens the front door to be greeted by a man with a receding hairline. Extending his hand in a gesture of introduction or acknowledgment, Willie steals a quick glance towards the kid, while the man hands over some paperwork, which Willie accepts. Meanwhile, Grandma, nestled in front of the TV, succumbs to a gentle slumber, oblivious to the world around her. Outside, in the warmth of the hot tub, Willie, adorned in a festive red cap, is energetically engaged with Sue, the barmaid, their activity creating a frothy commotion amidst clouds of smoke and foam. Later, transitioning to the living room, Willie busies himself with pouring a neat vodka for himself and a vodka with orange for Sue. Settling down on the sofa together, he hands her the glass, and they both take a hearty swig from their respective glasses. Sue reclines into the cushions, wearing a serene smile that transforms into a quiet chuckle, while Willie, succumbing to the day's exertions, nods off beside her, leaving her looking slightly let down. Eventually, it is time for Sue to leave, and Willie accompanies her to the front door. As she departs, she leans in to place a farewell kiss on his cheek and, in a moment of awkwardness, stumbles on the front step before casting a final glance back at him and disappearing into the night. Willie closes the door behind her and, with the vodka bottle in hand, makes his way to the hall table where the kid's advent calendar lies. He retrieves the calendar, placing the bottle down as he does so, and, in a frenzied indulgence, tears open the remaining doors, consuming the chocolate within until the calendar stands empty and ruined. Satisfied and with the bottle reclaimed, he staggers toward the lounge, pausing at the doorway to tip the bottle's remnants into his mouth, releasing a loud belch before succumbing to gravity, collapsing onto the hall carpet in a heap of unconsciousness. The following morning, Willie is jolted into awareness by a distressed kid, unfazed despite Grandma's oblivious state. With the kid's hand visibly marked by blood, Willie trails him into the kitchen, where he rinses the injury under the tap, dousing it with vodka to sanitize the cut. Turning off the tap, Willie indulges in a sloppy mouthful of vodka for himself before sauntering back into the hall. As he passes the hall table, his gaze fixes on the advent calendar's shredded remains. Later, once morning has fully taken hold, Willie maneuvers the BMW into a barren car park, where Marcus awaits by the side of a green van. Together, they open the van's back, and Marcus, with a hint of irritation, hands Willie an empty Santa sack. In response, Willie shakes his head, places a drill inside a gift-wrapped box, and with the equipment for safe-breaking now tucked into the sack, Willie and Marcus stride determinedly toward the mall, ready to proceed with their plan."

Willie struggles to contain his irritation. The kid quickly moves one of his pieces, executing a move known as a triple jump, taking three of Willie's, and reaching the far end of the board at the same time. Willie glares and throws the board in the air, while the kid stares placidly at him, unruffled. Willie opens the door to a balding man dressed in a suit, often associated with finance or legal professions, and proffers his hand, glancing at the kid.

As Grandma nods off in front of the TV, which is tuned to a classic rerun channel, Willie is outside entertaining the barmaid in the hot tub, a luxury item popular in suburban homes, still wearing his festive red cap reminiscent of Santa Claus, energetically humping Sue, the barmaid, up against the side of the hot tub amid smokes and foam from the hot water jets. Afterwards, in the living room, he pours himself a straight vodka, a common spirit of choice for its quick intoxicating effects, and her one with orange, possibly a screwdriver cocktail.

          "description": "The cat inserts its paw, then, before Whiskers can slither, reconsiders and places the marble back where it wasn't. Whiskers grapples to hide its amusement. The cat lazily slides one of its toys, catching three of Whiskers', and touching the near side of the table at the same time. Whiskers huffs and flings the table to the ceiling, while the cat gazes calmly at it, unfazed. Whiskers unlocks the window to a furry pigeon and stretches its wing, winking at the cat. The pigeon tosses Whiskers some feathers. As Grandpa dozes off in front of the fireplace, Whiskers is inside amusing the chef in the hammock, still wearing its striped yellow scarf, silently gnawing on Bert, the chef, up against the ropes of the hammock amid whispers and laughter. Afterwards, in the study, it brews itself a piping hot mocha and her one with lemon. They lie on the rug together, and it points her her cup; they each sip a gulp of their respective brews. She curls up and giggles, mumbles to herself, and it dozes off. She appears a little bit amused. Later, Whiskers guides her to the attic window and watches her out. She gives it a nuzzle and stumbles over the window sill before fluttering off into the dawn. Whiskers closes the window and, teacup in paw, stretches over to the bookcase where the cat's journal is resting. It picks up the journal and places the teacup down on the case, then continues to rip apart the remaining pages in the journal and gulp the stories inside. Journal shredded and tales consumed, it picks up the teacup and strides towards the attic. It pauses in the corridor and empties the teacup of its last drops, about a quarter, hiccups, collapses forwards, and rests unconscious on the attic rug. The next dusk, it is stirred by a giggling cat and is unfazed as its grandpa. The cat's paw is smudged in ink, and Whiskers trails it to the pantry where it dips the paw in the pitcher and sprinkles tea on the stain. Whiskers turns the pitcher off, takes a sip of tea, and strolls back into the corridor, looking slightly nonplussed, then notices the crumpled remnants of the journal resting on the bookcase. Later that dusk, Whiskers cycles the scooter into the crowded fairground where Buddy is lounging beside a crimson wagon waiting for it. They unlock the side of the wagon, and Buddy cheerfully hands Whiskers a full magician's hat. Whiskers nods its head, places a wrench in the gift-wrapped basket, and with the gift-wrapped laundry-folding tools stacked into the hat, Whiskers and Buddy stroll for the circus."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
