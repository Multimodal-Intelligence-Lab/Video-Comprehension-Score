          "description": "Donovan paces across the chamber toward Indy, emanating assurance and might while attired in a tuxedo, and clasps hands with Indy. Donovan proceeds to a table where an artifact is enshrouded in fabric, throws back the fabric exposing a smooth stone slab about two feet square, inscribed with letters and emblems, and puts on his spectacles to make a closer scrutiny. Donovan fills champagne into several fluted chalices as Indy peruses. Suddenly, Indy halts and gazes up at Donovan with a surprised expression, then rubs his chin with a skeptical expression as he takes the glass of champagne Donovan now gives him. Indy tenses slightly at the mention of his father and nods. The portal opens and Mrs. Donovan, a stately woman in a pricey evening gown, steps into the space. Donovan bends over and kisses her cheek, and she sighs to herself and returns to the gathering. Indy, meanwhile, has shifted his focus back to the Grail Slab, clearly fascinated by its archaeological potential. He wets his finger with champagne and rubs it over the Slab, as Donovan steps alongside him. Indy has to shake his head at Donovan’s apparent lack of discernment. Donovan produces an ancient leather-bound tome with very brittle sheets, and Indy examines the manuscript with significant interest. A Ford coupe races down the tree-lined lane and stops in front of the residence. Indy exits from the automobile and rushes up the pathway, with Brody a step behind. They ascend the porch, notice that the entryway is ajar, and exchange a swift look of unease as they enter. Indy approaches the half-open entryway, pushes open the door, and enters the residence, calling out. Indy opens one half of the drapes separating the corridor from the sitting chamber to reveal the place has been plundered. Brody observes Indy's face and opens the other half, and they stroll into the chamber. Brody picks up some correspondence from Henry's messy desk, and Indy turns to see the heap of torn documents and envelopes. He immediately empties his pockets of his own correspondence taken earlier in the day from his university office and finds the envelope with the Venice postmark. Indy discovers a small volume that resembles a diary or journal and flips through it, finding page after page of handwritten annotations and illustrations. Brody glances at it with great curiosity. As Indy poses the inquiry, he turns to a canvas on the wall depicting Christ on the Cross, his blood being collected in a golden cup, and a second canvas showing Eleventh Century Crusaders plummeting to their ends over a high precipice, with one Crusader floating safely in midair because he holds the Grail in his grasp."

They climb the porch notice that the front door is ajar and exchange a quick look of concern as they enter. Indy approaches the halfopen front door pushes open the door and enters the house calling out. Indy opens one half of the curtains dividing the hall from the sitting room to reveal the place has been ransacked. Brody sees Indy's face and opens the other half and they walk into the room. Brody picks up some mail from Henry's cluttered desk and Indy turns to see the pile of torn papers and envelopes. He immediately empties his pockets of his own mail taken earlier in the day from his college office and finds the envelope with the Venice postmark. Indy uncovers a small book that looks like a journal or diary and flips through it finding page after page of handwritten notes and drawings. Brody glances at it with great curiosity. As Indy asks the question he turns to a painting on the wall depicting Christ on the Cross his blood being captured in a golden chalice and a second painting showing Eleventh. Century Crusaders plummeting to their deaths over a high cliff with one Crusader floating safely in midair because he holds the Grail in his hands."

Donovan goes to a table where an object is wrapped in cloth throws back the cloth revealing a flat stone tablet about two feet square inscribed with letters and symbols and puts on his glasses to make a closer examination. Donovan pours champagne into several fluted glasses as Indy reads. Suddenly Indy stops and looks up at Donovan with a startled expression then rubs his chin with a dubious expression as he takes the glass of champagne Donovan now offers him. Indy stiffens slightly at the mention of his father and nods. The door opens and Mrs Donovan a matronly woman in an expensive evening gown steps into the room.

          "description": "Baxter hops across the garden toward Luna, radiating curiosity and joy while dressed in a spacesuit, and pats Luna on the shoulder. Baxter moves to a pedestal where an item is wrapped in paper, peels back the paper revealing a round marble block about three feet across, etched with numbers and patterns, and dons his monocle to make a detailed inspection. Baxter brews coffee into several mugged cups as Luna sketches. Suddenly, Luna pauses and gazes up at Baxter with a bemused expression, then taps his forehead with a thoughtful look as he accepts the cup of coffee Baxter now hands him. Luna flinches slightly at the mention of her uncle and winks. The window opens and Mr. Baxter, a grandfatherly man in a simple farmer's outfit, slips into the space. Baxter bends down and pats his shoulder, and he grumbles to himself and exits to the meadow. Luna, meanwhile, has turned his gaze back to the Ancient Puzzle, clearly drawn by its mystical allure. He dampens his thumb with coffee and dabs it over the Puzzle, as Baxter wanders over beside him. Luna has to shrug at Baxter’s evident sense of humor. Baxter retrieves a vintage velvet-bound scrapbook with remarkably fragile pages, and Luna regards the scrapbook with significant intrigue. A bicycle zooms down the sunflower-lined path and halts beside the barn. Luna climbs off the bicycle and rushes up the path, with Jasper a pace behind. They mount the steps, notice that the side window is ajar, and share a swift glance of unease as they step inside. Luna approaches the slightly ajar side window, nudges open the window, and steps into the barn, shouting out. Luna pushes aside one part of the curtain partitioning the barn from the storage shed to disclose the site has been rummaged. Jasper sees Luna's expression and pushes aside the other part, and they stroll into the shed. Jasper picks up some leaves from Harold's messy workbench, and Luna turns to notice the heap of shredded material and wrappers. He immediately empties his backpack of his own leaves gathered earlier in the day from his university greenhouse and locates the parcel with the Paris stamp. Luna discovers a small notepad that resembles a sketchbook or booklet and thumbs through it, uncovering sheet after sheet of scribbled doodles and paintings. Jasper peers at it with intense fascination. As Luna poses the inquiry, he turns to a sculpture in the corner depicting Apollo on a Chariot, his light being captured in a silver goblet, and a second sculpture showing Twelfth Century Knights tumbling to their demise over a steep gorge, with one Knight hovering safely in midair because he clutches the Goblet in his grasp."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
