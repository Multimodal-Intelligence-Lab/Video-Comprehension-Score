In a dazed state, he stands at the center of this open space, and Merrill, Bo, and Morgan trail behind him. Meanwhile, two German Shepherds dart back and forth, displaying clear signs of agitation. Graham, absorbed in thought, switches off the phone and observes his children seated on the kitchen floor alongside one of their two German Shepherds, noticing a large puddle spreading across the kitchen tiles. He regards the majestic but trembling dog with concern as Morgan and Bo, wearing worried expressions, usher the dog away. At the threshold, separated by the screen door, a police officer, Edgar Paski, stands nodding in understanding while Graham holds a steady gaze on him. In another scene, Morgan skillfully uses a barbecue fork to flip two meat patties on the grill and then places slices of cheese atop the sizzling hamburgers before heading towards Houdini. Bo, preparing to pour water into the dog bowl, approaches Houdini, who rests in the shade of a nearby picnic table, and first takes a cautious sip from the glass. She pauses, then offers the glass to Morgan, who takes a drink. Both children then settle into the grass with the dog as Bo gives a resigned shrug and pours the remaining water into the bowl. Houdini, however, simply stares at them, eerily motionless, as Bo nudges the bowl closer. Suddenly, Houdini begins to growl, causing the children to pale with alarm, and prompting Bo to jump to her feet as Houdini crouches, trembling, his body taut with impending action. Concurrently, Officer Paski stands and turns back, directing his attention towards the house.

They find Morgan standing with his hands in the pockets of his pajama bottoms, reminiscent of the quiet rural community where the Hesses live. Merill puts Bo on the ground and moves right in front of Morgan, who looks deep in thought, a common sight for a boy curious about the world around him.

Morgan pokes the barbecue fork into two meat patties on the grill, a simple family activity that brings a moment of normalcy, places two pieces of cheese on the hamburgers, and walks over to Houdini, their loyal dog. Bo is about to pour a glass of water into the dog bowl, moves to Houdini, who sits in the shade by the picnic table, and takes a tiny sip of the water first, a habit she picked up from a friend as a way to ensure the water isn't too hot. She stops, holds the glass out to Morgan, who drinks, and the two children sit down in the grass with the dog as Bo shrugs and pours the water into the bowl.\n\nHoudini just sits staring at them, not shivering, but unnaturally still, as Bo pushes the bowl closer, sensing the dog's hesitation is out of character. Houdini begins to growl, an ominous warning that makes the children turn white, and Bo stands up as Houdini crouches down, trembling, his body tightening as he's about to leap in a display of protective instinct. Officer Paski stands up, turns back, and stares in the direction of the house, aware that something unsettling is unfolding. Morgan's attention moves as the crops part and his father and Officer Paski enter the backyard, stopping cold when they look in his direction, seeing their worried expressions mirrored in his own.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
