He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

          "description": "As Benjamin walks past his room, an old man calls to him. He appears thoughtful as he approaches his door. In the dark, Benjamin visits Thomas's house, where a servant directs him to Thomas's room. Benjamin gently wakes a sleeping Thomas. At dawn, Thomas's car arrives at a country house. Benjamin and a chauffeur help Thomas from the car. The sky turns orange as Benjamin wheels Thomas to a lake. There, Benjamin carries and sets Thomas on a wooden seat by the water. As Thomas gazes at the horizon, he closes his eyes, sighs, and Benjamin sits quietly behind him. Thomas is later shown deceased, with an undertaker placing buttons on him. Benjamin and an elderly Queenie visit Thomas in an ornate chapel. Later, Benjamin arrives at a Broadway theater with flowers. Inside, he watches Daisy, now a dancer, perform. Benjamin is captivated as Daisy is elegantly lifted and sways across the stage, reminding him of a ship's figurehead in a stormy sea backdrop."
