In a team session, his colleagues observe on stoic-faced. He nudges Alison's limb. Clayton stands from his spot at the head of the table and exits. Alison elevates a hand to Sidney. Clayton consumes edamame legumes and sushi at the counter in his workspace. He attempts to disregard Sidney, who's drumming a journal with a stylus. He acknowledges. Bill's eyes narrow and his visage stiffens as a bashful-looking Sidney sits across a resentful Clayton. Sidney's optimistic grin dims. Clayton glares at Sidney, who knits his brow and gestures at the entrance. Clayton acknowledges and Sidney departs. Alison peruses as mannequins select garments from a stand. Sidney plops himself down beside her and exhales. Alison gazes at him, derides, stands up, and struts off with her nose elevated. Sidney makes eye contact with Lawrence and salutes. Sidney's nose is taped up like a pig's snout. As Eleanor and Sophie approach, he rips the adhesive from his visage and conceals under his desk, then surfaces from beneath the table with adhesive tape affixed to his left ear. Sidney scowls and obediently ambles off. He fills a plastic receptacle from a water cooler and gazes at Sophie, who's cuddling Cuba, puckering his visage slightly. Offended, Eleanor gives him a penetrating glance and stomps off. His eyebrows quiver as he glances around, and Lawrence and Sophie trail Eleanor from the workspace. Sidney gingerly opens the door of an office and peers in to see Cuba gazing back at him. He throws the small crimson sphere, which rebounds out through an open casement, and Cuba dashes after it. Sidney lunges for the casement and closes it, then grins and glances up to see a large stone ornament. Sidney's eyes widen at the heavy, glossy stone and, appalled, he bites his fist. He summons an elevator, and as she indicates, they wrestle for it. A white paw protrudes as Sophie, Eleanor, and Lawrence are in reception. Sidney dashes off and Alison trails to find Sidney leaning out of a casement. He turns without the satchel. She turns to glance at Sidney, who shrugs with limbs crossed. The search party proceeds off, leaving a relieved Sidney slumped against a partition by the casement, as Cuba's nose protrudes of the leather purse floating up behind him on the window cleaner's ascending platform. Sidney stands in the threshold of Clayton's workspace, sips whiskey, flings the azure shirts onto a counter, and peers down his nose at them, signaling with a lifted hand.

Sidney furrows his brow in frustration and points towards the door, a clear indication for Sidney to leave. Clayton nods in agreement, and Sidney exits the room.

In response, Alison stares at him disapprovingly, scoffs at his presence, stands up with determination, and flounces off with an air of superiority, her nose held high. Sidney then makes eye contact with Lawrence and offers a wave, albeit half-heartedly. Meanwhile, Sidney's nose is humorously taped up to resemble a pig's snout.

Eleanor, feeling slighted by his demeanor, shoots him a piercing look and stomps off in a huff. Sidney's eyebrows twitch with uncertainty as he glances around the room, noticing Lawrence and Sophie following Eleanor out of the office. Cautiously, Sidney opens the door to another office and peers in, only to find Cuba gazing back at him with curiosity. In an effort to engage Cuba, he tosses a little red ball, which bounces playfully out through an open window, prompting Cuba to scamper after it. Sidney dives towards the window with urgency, closing it swiftly behind Cuba's exit, then looks upwards with a smile of satisfaction, only to notice a large, polished stone ornament. Sidney's eyes widen in horror at the sight of the weighted object and, in a moment of panic, he bites his fist. He rushes to call an elevator, engaging in a brief but tense struggle as she points and they grapple to access it. As the elevator door closes, a white paw protrudes, capturing the attention of Sophie, Eleanor, and Lawrence, who are all gathered in reception. Seizing the opportunity, Sidney dashes off, with Alison quick to follow, only to find Sidney leaning precariously out of a window. He turns, now minus a bag, leaving Alison to turn and look at him quizzically. Sidney meets her gaze with a nonchalant shrug, arms folded in feigned indifference. As the search party moves on, Sidney remains behind, leaning against a wall by the window, visibly relieved. Unbeknownst to him, Cuba's nose protrudes from a leather handbag that is drifting upward on a window cleaner's rising platform alongside him. Sidney eventually finds himself standing in the doorway of Clayton's office, casually sipping whiskey. He flings a couple of blue shirts onto a desk with a dramatic flair and peers down his nose at them, punctuating the action with a raised hand gesture. Smiling, Clayton approaches Sidney unhurriedly, and after a brief exchange, Sidney makes his exit, only to pause and step back into the room briefly."

Alison, who is known for her straightforward communication style, gives him the A-OK and he walks on. In a staff meeting held in a sleek, modern office with glass walls, his coworkers look on stony-faced, likely due to the tension of a pending project deadline. He prods Alison's arm, hoping for some reassurance. Clayton, the stern but fair team leader, rises from his seat at the head of the table and walks out, his departure a signal of disapproval. Alison raises a palm to Sidney as a gesture to pause. Clayton eats edamame beans and sushi at the desk in his office, a nod to his penchant for healthy living and Japanese cuisine. He tries to ignore Sidney, who's anxiously tapping a notebook, an inherited pen from his late grandfather, with a pen. He nods, indicating he understands the unspoken office dynamics. Bill’s eyes narrow and his expression hardens as a sheepish-looking Sidney, known for his timid demeanor, sits opposite an indignant Clayton. Sidney's hopeful smile wanes, a common occurrence when he's under pressure. Clayton stares at Sidney, who furrows his brow and points at the door, suggesting he needs to step out for a breather. Clayton nods and Sidney leaves, feeling the weight of expectations. Alison reads a fashion magazine, her favorite pastime, as models pick outfits from a rack for an upcoming show. Sidney plunks himself down beside her and sighs, exhausted from his earlier confrontation. Alison stares at him, scoffs, stands up, and flounces off with her nose in the air, a dramatic exit she's perfected from years in the theater. Sidney makes eye contact with Lawrence, the new intern trying to find his place, and waves. Sidney’s nose is taped up like a pig's snout, a prank from a previous office party. As Eleanor and Sophie, colleagues who often share lunch together, approach, he tears the tape from his face and hides under his desk, a favorite hiding spot during office pranks, then emerges from beneath the table with Sellotape stuck to his left ear. Sidney frowns and obediently toddles off, eager to avoid further embarrassment. He fills a plastic container from a water cooler and stares at Sophie, who’s cradling Cuba, a fluffy office dog beloved by all, screwing up his face slightly. Slighted, Eleanor gives him a piercing look and stomps off, her patience worn thin. His eyebrows twitch as he looks around, and Lawrence and Sophie follow Eleanor from the office, leaving him alone in his thoughts. Sidney cautiously opens the door of an office and peers in to see Cuba staring back at him, ready for another game. He tosses the little red ball, a favored toy of Cuba’s, which bounces out through an open window, and Cuba scampers after it. Sidney dives for the window and closes it, then smiles and looks up to see a large stone ornament, an ancient relic from a colleague’s travels. Sidney's eyes widen at the weighted, polished stone and, horrified at the potential disaster, he bites his fist. He calls an elevator, a sleek new installation with mirrored walls, and as she points, they grapple for it. A white paw sticks out as Sophie, Eleanor, and Lawrence are in reception, watching the commotion. Sidney runs off and Alison follows to find Sidney leaning out of a window, a familiar place for him during breaks. He turns minus the bag, realizing a misstep. She turns to look at Sidney, who shrugs with arms folded, a gesture of resignation. The search party heads off, leaving a relieved Sidney slumped against a wall by the window, comforted by the sight of Cuba’s nose sticking out of the leather handbag drifting up behind him on the window cleaner’s rising platform. Sidney stands in the doorway of Clayton’s office, sips whiskey, a rare indulgence for him, flings the blue shirts onto a desk, and peers down his nose at them, gesturing with a raised hand in a mock aristocratic manner.

          "description": "A bewildered parrot gazes up at Marianne, then raises its beak, blinks its feathers, and hops over her. Geraldine shows it a thumbs-up and it struts away. In a garden gathering, its comrades gaze on with curiosity. It nudges Geraldine’s wing. Marvin pops up from his perch at the edge of the pond and flutters away. Geraldine lifts a claw to Percy. Marvin munches on sunflower seeds and carrots in the corner of his aviary. He attempts to forget Percy, who's drumming on a clipboard with a twig. He bows. Oscar's ears twitch and his gaze sharpens as a bashful-looking Percy roosts opposite an irate Marvin. Percy's eager grin fades. Marvin glares at Percy, who creases his forehead and gestures toward the gate. Marvin bows and Percy flits away. Geraldine examines as mannequins select accessories from a shelf. Percy plops himself down next to her and huffs. Geraldine glances at him, sneers, hops up, and prances off with her beak in the wind. Percy locks eyes with Norris and beckons. Percy's beak is wrapped up like a pig’s tail. As Dahlia and Fiona draw near, he rips the wrap from his beak and ducks under his perch, then surfaces with string stuck to his tail feather. Percy scowls and obediently waddles away. He fills a ceramic bowl from a bird bath and gawks at Fiona, who's cuddling Brazil, scrunching up her beak slightly. Offended, Dahlia shoots him a glare and stamps away. His tail twitches as he scans the area, and Norris and Fiona trail Dahlia from the grove. Percy gingerly pushes open the gate of a pen and peeks in to see Brazil gazing back at him. He hurls the tiny green pebble, which rolls out through an open fence, and Brazil scuttles after it. Percy plunges for the fence and seals it, then beams and glances up to see a large wooden sculpture. Percy's feathers stand on end at the hefty, carved wood, and, terrified, he nibbles his claw. He summons a ladder, and as she signals, they tussle for it. A spotted fin protrudes as Fiona, Dahlia, and Norris are in the meadow. Percy darts away and Geraldine pursues to find Percy dangling from a branch. He turns minus the sack. She glances at Percy, who shrugs with wings folded. The exploration band moves away, leaving a content Percy nestled against a log by the branch, as Brazil’s beak pokes out of the woven basket floating up behind him on the farmer’s climbing vine. Percy perches in the archway of Marvin’s grove, sips nectar, tosses the scarlet ties onto a trunk, and peers down his beak at them, gesturing with a lifted wing. Grinning, Marvin saunters toward him. Percy flits out, then flutters back in."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Sidney interacts awkwardly with coworkers, including Lawrence, Eleanor, and Sophie, and clumsily uses tape on his face. He fills a plastic container while eyeing Sophie and Eleanor, who storms off. Sidney tosses a ball for Cuba, who chases it out the window. Alarmed, Sidney dives to close the window, then sees a large stone ornament and reacts in horror. In a scramble with Alison, they fight for the elevator as Sophie's white paw emerges. Sidney runs off, followed by Alison, ending in a search for the missing bag. Relieved, Sidney leans against a wall as Cuba’s nose peeks from a leather handbag on a rising platform. Sidney, sipping whiskey, flings shirts onto a desk, and Clayton approaches, smiling. Sidney exits, then re-enters."
