Toward him, Rose steps across the deck, and he turns and faces her; a smile is given by Jack, and Rose walks toward him and reaches out. Their hands are held, and she is gently pulled toward himself by Jack. Her eyes are closed by Rose, and onto the bow rail platform, Rose is helped by Jack while grasping her hand. Onto the lowest rung of the railing, both step, and then her arms are held out like wings by her as the wind blows her shawl back on her outstretched arms. Around her waist, his hands are placed by him as her eyes are opened. From the ship's funnels, black smoke is trailed as Jack and Rose stand at the rail high above the water. Outward, Jack reaches and grasps Rose's hands and his face is leaned close to hers. Around her waist, Rose's arms are folded by Jack, and his face is turned to him by her, and a kiss is shared by them. On the back of Jack's neck, her hand is placed by Rose.

After sharing this moment, she steps outside, and Jack watches as she leaves through the wavy glass of the window, then lowers his gaze thoughtfully, lost in his own reflections. \n\nIn a later scene, within the elegant and refined first-class lounge, Ruth, Rose, the Countess, and another woman are comfortably seated, enjoying their tea in an atmosphere of sophistication.

Jack places his hand on Rose's cheek, and Rose places her gloved hand over his, the soft leather a testament to the elegant fashion of their era. She steps outside, and Jack watches her leave through a wavy window glass, reminiscent of the old shipbuilding techniques of the early 1900s, then gazes downward. Later, in the first-class lounge, lavishly adorned with plush furnishings typical of luxury ocean liners of the time, Ruth, Rose, the Countess of Rothes, a well-known socialite from the Titanic's passenger list, and another woman drink tea. Rose gazes toward another table where a woman pulls a slouching young girl upright, a reminder of the strict etiquette lessons of the day, and Rose watches the girl place a napkin on her lap with her small gloved hands. Jack leans on a railing for balance and stares into the sea, a vast expanse that stretches for miles, as wind ruffles his hair. Rose steps across the deck toward him, and he turns and faces her; Jack smiles, a smile reminiscent of youthful optimism, and Rose walks toward him and reaches out. They hold hands, and Jack gently pulls her toward himself, feeling the chill of the ocean air. Rose closes her eyes, and grasping her hand, Jack helps Rose onto the bow, rail platform, known as the 'prow' by sailors. They both step onto the lowest rung of the railing, and then she holds her arms out like wings as the wind blows her shawl back on her outstretched arms, capturing the exhilarating sense of freedom. He places his hands around her waist as she opens her eyes. Black smoke trails from the ship's funnels, evidence of the coal-powered engines, as Jack and Rose stand at the rail high above the water.

Rose places her hand on the back of Jack's neck. The sunken Titanic, resting in the icy depths of the North Atlantic since its tragic journey in 1912, sits on the bottom of the ocean as the elderly Rose turns from a monitor and addresses the crew of the salvage vessel. Rose gazes back at the monitor, which shows the underwater image of the fireplace in her former suite, rich with the opulence of that era. The room transforms into its former state as young Rose and Jack step inside. Jack rushes toward a painting, perhaps by one of the masters like Monet or Degas, and Rose opens the safe. Rose hands the Heart of the Ocean, a necklace rumored to be inspired by the Hope Diamond, to Jack, who shakes his head as he examines the faceted blue diamond, and then Jack turns to Rose. Later, Rose removes the butterfly comb from her hair and shakes out her hair, which falls to her shoulders in a cascade, reminiscent of the carefree styles of the time. Jack drags a settee, an elegant piece of furniture, to the center of the room and places one pillow atop another. Sitting in a chair near the settee, Jack opens a canvas bag, removes a knife and a thin stick of charcoal which he sharpens with precision, and looks up as Rose steps into the room. Holding a kimono close with one hand, a nod to the exotic influences in Western fashion, Rose lifts a sash and twirls it. Jack smiles as Rose steps toward him, and he sits back as she tosses a dime to him, a coin that was part of their playful exchanges. Rose steps backward, then slips the kimono from her shoulders, and the kimono slides to the floor.

          "description": "They drift through a curtain to a greenhouse. The monkey places its paw on Lily's elbow, and Lily places her scarfed paw over its. She floats inside, and the monkey watches her depart through a twisted mirror frame, then peers upward. Later, in the second-class pantry, Edith, Lily, the Duchess, and another lady sip coffee. Lily peers toward another chair where a boy pushes a lounging old man upright, and Lily watches the man place a book on his seat with his large scarfed paws. The monkey leans on a bookshelf for support and stares into the forest as rain tousles its fur. Lily skips across the lawn toward it, and it turns and regards her; the monkey grins, and Lily strolls toward it and holds out her paw. They link arms, and the monkey softly tugs her toward itself. Lily opens her eyes, and gripping her arm, the monkey lifts Lily onto the stern, handrail stage. They both leap onto the highest step of the bookshelf, and then she swings her arms up like sails as the breeze pulls her hat forward on her retracted arms. It places its paws around her neck as she closes her eyes. White steam puffs from the house's chimneys as the monkey and Lily sit on the handrail deep below the ground. The monkey reaches out and clasps Lily's arm and leans its face away from hers. The monkey wraps Lily's elbows around her stomach, and she turns its ear to her, and they hug. Lily places her paw on the side of the monkey's head. The floating Zephyr hovers on the top of the mountain as the ancient Lily turns from a telescope and addresses the crew of the research plane. Lily peeks back at the telescope, which displays the underground vision of the table in her previous attic. The attic shifts into its original form as young Lily and the monkey sprint outside. The monkey speeds toward a statue, and Lily locks the cabinet. Lily hands the Jewel of the Desert bracelet to the monkey, who chuckles as it inspects the glowing red ruby, and then the monkey nods to Lily. Later, Lily pulls the dragonfly pin from her hat and shakes out her scarf, which falls to her elbows. The monkey pushes a sofa to the edge of the attic and stacks one blanket beside another. Reclining on a blanket near the sofa, the monkey closes a wooden box, extracts a spoon and a thick chunk of chalk which it slices, and looks down as Lily glides into the attic. Holding a robe wide with one arm, Lily grabs a ribbon and swings it. The monkey grins as Lily approaches it, and it lies back as she flips a penny to it. Lily steps forward, then drops the robe from her elbows, and the robe tumbles to the ground. Draped, Lily runs her palms over her own shoulder."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
