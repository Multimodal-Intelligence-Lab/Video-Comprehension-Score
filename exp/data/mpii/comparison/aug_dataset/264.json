The inside of the vehicle is a maelstrom, with blue dollar bills snapping and fluttering wildly in the air, adding to the chaotic scene. The car itself is lurching and swerving unpredictably because Gale, who is at the wheel, is almost entirely blind due to the windshield being thoroughly obscured by blue paint. In a frantic and desperate bid to regain some semblance of vision, he extends his hand forward, wiping at the windshield in an attempt to clear a small section. As the blue paint smears away, a clearer picture emerges, revealing Hi and Ed's vehicle positioned broadside, directly in the middle of the road. Hi stands in front, aiming a scatter gun, while Ed is armed with a revolver. In a quick and urgent motion, Ed dashes over to the car occupied by Gale and Evelle, hastily flinging open the back door in a frenzied search for the baby. However, he finds only a copy of Dr. Spock's Baby and Child Care. Meanwhile, Evelle stumbles around in a state of shock, staring at his own body, painted blue, in disbelief. Hi and Ed quickly retreat back to their vehicle and drive away with urgency. Sitting unperturbed in his car seat, positioned right in the center of the road in front of a bank, is Nathan Jr. The camera then focuses on Nathan Jr., slowly booming upward to reveal the deserted street stretching endlessly beyond him. The sharp crack of return fire and the high-pitched sound of furiously squealing brakes pierce the air, culminating in a loud explosion that abruptly silences the wailing siren, indicating that the police car has been obliterated. Beyond the crest of the road ahead, a fiery ball has erupted, marking the explosion's impact. As the echoes of this explosion gradually fade, the deep rumble of an engine approaching becomes audible, signaling the arrival of Lenny Smalls on his motorcycle. Framed against the dramatic backdrop of fire and smoke, he is advancing directly toward both us and the baby. As they crest a rise from the opposite direction, we catch sight of the baby sitting innocently in the middle of the street, with Lenny approaching rapidly in the background. The extremely low, wide shot, locked onto the speeding bike, gives us the perspective of rushing toward the rear of Nathan Jr.'s car seat. With a metallic clank of chains, Lenny's hand enters the frame, palm forward, ready to scoop up the car seat as it becomes increasingly near. In a low shot where Nathan Jr. is in the foreground, he is swiftly scooped up and out of the frame as Lenny speeds by. Roaring along, Lenny securely hooks the car seat over his handlebars. As he closes in, Lenny skillfully draws a shotgun from his back holster, leveling it at the oncoming vehicle, aiming down the gun and sweeping it around as he approaches. The shotgun erupts with a flash of orange flame, and the car's windshield shatters inward as Lenny races past, with the baby prominently on the handlebars and the road blurring by beyond him. His bike banks sharply into a hard turn, shooting through the space where the windshield once was, cutting in at the end of the skid as the car rocks to a halt."

Ed quickly moves towards Gale and Evelle's car, hastily opening the back door in search of the baby, but emerges only with a copy of Dr. Spock's Baby and Child Care in hand. Meanwhile, Evelle is stumbling around in a state of shock, his eyes wide with disbelief as he stares at his own paint-covered blue body. Hi and Ed swiftly climb back into their car and speed away from the scene.

The car is swerving wildly as Gale drives blind, with the inside of the windshield covered with blue paint from a previous collision with a paint truck. He reaches forward to wipe clear a patch of windshield, and as the blue paint is smeared away, we see Hi and Ed's car, a vintage model notorious for its speed and durability, parked broadside in the middle of the road. Hi and Ed are in front of it, with Hi aiming his scatter gun, a type of shotgun favored for its wide spread, and Ed a revolver, a classic six-shooter often used for its reliability. Ed runs over to Gale and Evelle's car, throws open the back door to look for the baby, but comes out only with Dr. Spock's Baby and Child Care, a best-selling parenting book that has influenced generations of parents worldwide. Evelle is staggering around in shock, looking in disbelief at his own blue body, reminiscent of characters in comics when they meet unexpected transformations. Hi and Ed climb into their car and peel out. Sitting placidly in his car seat in the middle of the road in front of a bank is Nathan Jr., who remains blissfully unaware of the chaos surrounding him. As the camera focuses on Nathan Jr., it booms up to show the empty street beyond him while the crack of return fire and furiously squealing brakes are heard, culminating in a loud explosion that snaps off the siren wail, indicating the intense heat of the moment. The police car is apparently history, consumed by flames that now mark it as a casualty of the chaos, and beyond the crest of the road ahead, a ball of flame has leapt up with the explosion, reminiscent of dramatic film scenes that often depict catastrophe with such vivid imagery. As the explosion echoes and fades, the deep rumble of an approaching engine is heard, and Lenny Smalls' motorcycle, a powerful machine revered for its speed and handling, appears over the rise.

The shotgun spits orange flame, a vivid display of raw power and aggression, and the windshield explodes in as Lenny roars by, with the baby on the handlebars in the foreground and the road rushing by beyond him. The bike banks into a hard turn, shooting through where the windshield used to be, cutting in at the end of the skid as the car rocks to a halt, leaving a trail of chaos in its wake."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
