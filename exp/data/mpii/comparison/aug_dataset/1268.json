Amidst the swirling chaos and debris, Harry manages to steady himself with remarkable composure, clutching a formidable Basilisk fang tightly and securely in his hand. Voldemort, ever vigilant and watchful, spots Harry in the tumultuous scene and, without hesitation, immediately fires a spell in Harry's direction. This causes Harry to stumble and fall onto a lower staircase, inadvertently dropping the precious fang in the process. Seizing the advantageous opportunity, Voldemort swiftly destroys the fang with a precise motion. In the ensuing whirlwind of confusion, Harry skillfully manages to disappear from Voldemort's sight just as the Dark Lord ominously dis-apparates from view. Meanwhile, Nagini, the menacing and dangerous serpent, slithers menacingly across a landing but is abruptly struck by a falling stone. She turns her head to peer carefully over the edge of the stairs, where Hermione stands alone, courageously and bravely throwing another stone as Nagini begins her descent. Nearby, the unconscious Neville suddenly regains consciousness, sitting up in a daze, completely and utterly oblivious to the surrounding chaos of battle even as a burning body eerily floats past him. As he turns his head with growing awareness, he notices the illustrious Sword of Gryffindor lying on the ground behind him. At that critical moment, Voldemort lands with a menacing presence and takes decisive aim, causing the entire walkway to collapse beneath him and Harry to plummet down to the floor below. As Harry desperately scrambles to escape amidst the ruin, strips of Voldemort's dark, flowing cloak twist around his wrists and neck, forcefully restraining him, and Voldemort pulls him in with relentless force. Nagini advances menacingly on Hermione, who retreats cautiously with a basilisk fang firmly in hand, while Ron, also armed with a dangerous fang, stealthily creeps up the stairs towards the fearsome snake. However, the snake turns on him with deadly intent, forcing him to retreat rapidly and drop the fang. The snake ominously rears up, positioned menacingly between Ron and Hermione. In another part of the besieged school, a fierce and intense duel unfolds between the formidable Bellatrix and the defiant Ginny until Molly courageously steps in to take Ginny's place in the battle. On a narrow platform, they exchange powerful energy blasts furiously, with Bellatrix seemingly having the upper hand in the confrontation. Yet, Molly advances with wild determination, striking Bellatrix several times with precision. The stunned and overwhelmed Death Eater raises her hands in surrender, and Molly, with a triumphant final flourish of her wand, causes Bellatrix to explode into tiny black fragments, after which Molly grins with unconcealed triumph. On the precarious walkway, Voldemort uses his physical strength against Harry, slapping and kicking him as Harry scuttles backward defensively. High on the towering ramparts, Harry boldly flings his arms around Voldemort's neck with resolve and leaps off the edge with him. They plummet from the dizzying heights, locked in a fierce struggle for supremacy, clawing at each other aggressively as they soar above the school grounds. In a dramatic and shocking moment, Harry seems to split Voldemort's head in two, revealing nothing but swirling black smoke. As they land heavily in the courtyard, they roll away from each other across the cobblestones, lying on the cold ground some distance apart. Exhausted and weary, each crawls determinedly towards his wand, with Voldemort reaching the legendary Elder Wand just before Harry reaches his own. On their knees, they fire spells at each other with unwavering intensity, with a burst of green energy from the Elder Wand meeting a burst of red from Harry's wand in a brilliant explosion, resulting in a mesmerizing white ball of light. Inside the castle, Nagini relentlessly and viciously chases Hermione and Ron down the seemingly endless stairs, and as they fall in fear, Nagini raises her head with her mouth open, ready to deliver a deadly strike."

In a swift, tense moment, Voldemort's gaze locks onto Harry, and with a flick of his wand, he fires a spell that sends Harry tumbling onto a lower staircase. The impact causes Harry to lose his grip on the fang, which clatters away, only to be obliterated by Voldemort's magic. In the ensuing confusion, Harry manages to slip out of Voldemort's line of sight just as the Dark Lord dis-apparates, vanishing from the spot. Meanwhile, Nagini, the serpentine creature, slithers across a landing, her scales gliding over the stone surface until a falling stone strikes her. She pauses, turning her head to peer over the edge of the stairs, where Hermione stands alone, her eyes fierce as she hurls another stone at the descending snake. Nearby, Neville, who had been knocked unconscious, slowly regains consciousness. He sits up, his head spinning, and remains oblivious to the surrounding battle's chaos, even as a burning body eerily floats past him. As he turns his head, his eyes catch sight of the Sword of Gryffindor lying on the ground behind him. In another part of the battlefield, Voldemort lands with a menacing presence and takes aim, but the collapsing walkway beneath him causes Harry to drop to the floor below. Desperately, Harry scrabbles away, but strips of Voldemort's black cloak snake around his wrists and neck, tightening their grip and pulling him back towards the Dark Lord. As Voldemort reins him in, Nagini advances menacingly on Hermione, who retreats, clutching a basilisk fang for protection. Ron, also armed with a fang, stealthily creeps up the stairs towards the snake, but as Nagini turns on him, he is forced to retreat, dropping the fang in his haste. The snake rears up, positioning itself threateningly between Ron and Hermione. Elsewhere in the school, a fierce duel unfolds between Bellatrix and Ginny until Molly steps in to take her daughter's place.

However, Molly advances with wild determination, striking Bellatrix several times with her wand. The stunned Death Eater raises her hands in a futile gesture of defense, and with a final, decisive spell, Molly causes Bellatrix to explode into tiny black fragments, a triumphant grin spreading across her face.

On their knees, they face each other and fire their spells, a burst of green energy from the Elder Wand colliding with a burst of red from Harry's wand, resulting in a brilliant white ball of light. Inside the castle, Nagini relentlessly chases Hermione and Ron down the stairs, and as they stumble and fall, Nagini raises her head, her mouth open wide, ready to strike."

          "description": "A gust rebounds off the wall, pulling wooden panels up onto the ladder as Gregory balances himself with a dragon’s tail in grip. The Goblin notices Gregory and bellows, prompting him to stumble onto an upper ladder and lose the tail, which the Goblin smashes. Gregory then fades from the Goblin’s vision as the Shadow King vanishes. A salamander slides along a corridor, is struck by a branch, and swivels to peer over the rail where Margaret stands alone and hurls another branch as the salamander descends. The drowsy Oliver wakes, sits up groggily, and remains unaware of the chaos of the skirmish around him, even as a glowing parcel drifts by. He swivels his head and spots the Trident of Neptune on the floor behind him. The Goblin descends and lines up a shot as the bridge crumbles, making Gregory drop to the ground below. As Gregory wriggles away, strands of the Goblin’s emerald robe coil around his ankles and waist, binding him, and the Goblin draws him in. The salamander moves toward Margaret, who backs away with a dragon’s tail in hand, while Robert also clutching a tail sneaks up the ladder towards the beast, which spins around on him, prompting him to retreat but leave the tail behind. The beast looms tall between Robert and Margaret. In a different wing of the castle, Matilda and Ginny are sparring until Sally occupies Ginny's spot. On a tight ledge, they swap power beams with Matilda seemingly holding the advantage, but Sally charges recklessly and strikes Matilda multiple times. The astonished Rogue hoists her fingers in the air, and Sally brandishes her staff again, making Matilda shatter into tiny blue bits, after which Sally smirks. On the bridge, the Goblin uses brute force against Gregory, shoving and knocking him as Gregory scurries backward. Atop the battlements, Gregory throws his hands around the Goblin's waist and leaps off the side with him. They dive from the peaks, grappling for dominance, scratching at one another and gliding above the castle. Gregory seems to rip the Goblin's chest open, revealing only dark vapor, and as they hit the courtyard, they roll away from one another over the stones, resting on the earth some distance apart. Exhausted, each crawls towards his scepter, with the Goblin grabbing the Elder Scepter just before Gregory grabs his. On their knees, they fire at each other, with a flash of violet energy from the Elder Scepter meeting a flash of amber from Gregory, resulting in a dazzling yellow orb. Inside, the salamander pursues Margaret and Robert downstairs, and as they plummet, the salamander lifts its head with its jaws wide."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Harry vanishes, and Nagini turns her attention to Hermione, who stands alone on the stairs. Meanwhile, Neville regains consciousness amidst the chaos and spots the Sword of Gryffindor. As Harry is restrained by Voldemort's cloak, Nagini advances on Hermione and Ron, who both have basilisk fangs. Ron drops his fang as the snake rears up between them. Elsewhere, Molly takes over from Ginny in a duel with Bellatrix, ultimately defeating her with a dramatic spell. Back on the walkway, Voldemort physically assaults Harry, who then pulls Voldemort off a high ledge. They fall and fight in mid-air, with Harry seemingly splitting Voldemort's head into black smoke. In the courtyard, both crawl toward their wands and fire spells at each other, resulting in a powerful clash of magic. Inside, Nagini continues to pursue Hermione and Ron."
