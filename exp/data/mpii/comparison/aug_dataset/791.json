In the store's vault, Santa employs a weighty drill to pierce through the portal of a secured safe. Out on the shop floor of the store, the elf ambles along hauling a diminutive hand cart, while Santa extracts the drill from the safe portal. On the shop floor, his little assistant assists himself to an extravagant handbag from a showcase cabinet, then some women's fashionable footwear, all of which are outlined on a list. He reviews his list while scrutinizing a strand of pearls in a cabinet, and uses a bead rack to fracture it open. Later, he joins Santa in the vault and finds Santa gazing through the aperture he drilled. Santa utilizes a chisel, opens the safe, and bundles of notes spill out onto the floor. An Asian woman perches at the wheel of a van as Santa and his little assistant clamber in the rear with their haul. She turns to the elf, places her foot on the accelerator, and the van accelerates off, flinging Santa and the elf rearwards. Later, Santa, who in less seasonal times goes by the appellation of Willie, cavorts with Marcus, the elf, in a bar. Willie positions Marcus on a bar stool by the counter and reclines beside him. He calls over to the barmaid, who serves them. Willie and Marcus elevate their glasses, drain their beverages, and place the glasses back down on the counter. Marcus grants Willie a suspicious glance and gazes expectantly at him, who deliberates and then turns to the barmaid. He turns back to Marcus with a partial smile and glances down skeptically at his vacant glass. A multitude of stunning bikini-clad women decorate the sand as Willie, now in a Hawaiian shirt, stands behind the counter of a beachfront bar, slicing up some lemons and limes. He places them under the counter and pours a liberal measure of vodka into a tumbler. As he does so, a furious man gripping a tray of glasses joins him behind the counter. Willie sips at the beverage, and the barman punches him in the stomach and hurls him over the counter. Willie flings a vodka bottle at the barman and misses it. The barman vaults over the counter, and Willie dashes for it. Willie does as advised. Sometime later, he's sitting alone having a good gaze at some more bikini-clad beauties playing volleyball. He moistens his lips as he admires their well-toned rears and sips from a bottle of beer. The next morning, Willie is asleep on his bed in a not-so-terrible, not-so-wonderful apartment. He reaches over to the clock radio, which is surrounded by last night's empties, and fumbles for the off button; unable to locate it, he rips it out of its socket."

On the shop floor, an expensive handbag is helped himself to from a display cabinet by his little helper, then some women's designer shoes, all of which are noted on a list. A string of pearls is eyed in a cabinet by him, he checks his list, and a bead rack is used to smash it open. Later, Santa is joined by him in the vault and Santa is found peering through the hole he drilled. A chisel is used by Santa to open the safe, and notes spill out onto the floor. An oriental woman, who sits at the wheel of a van, turns to the elf as their booty is climbed in the back by Santa and his little helper. Her foot is put on the accelerator, and off speeds the van, throwing Santa and the elf backwards. Later, a bar is danced in by Willie, who Santa goes by in less seasonal times, with Marcus, the elf. Marcus is put down by Willie on a bar stool by the counter and sits down beside him. The barmaid is called over by him, who serves them. Their glasses are raised, drinks are downed, and the glasses are set back down on the counter by Willie and Marcus. A dubious look is given by Marcus to Willie and, with expectation, looks at him, who considers and then the barmaid is turned to by him. Marcus is turned back to with a half-smile and his empty glass is looked at doubtfully by him. The sand is adorned by a plethora of beautiful bikini-clad women as Willie, now in a Hawaiian shirt, is stood behind the counter of a beachfront bar, chopping up some lemons and limes. They are put under the counter by him and a generous measure of vodka is poured into a tumbler. As this is being done, behind the counter joins him an irate man clutching a tray of glasses. The drink is slurped at by Willie, and the barman punches him in the guts and tosses him over the counter. A vodka bottle is thrown by Willie at the barman and it is missed. Over the counter leaps the barman, and for it Willie runs. As suggested, the action is done by Willie. Sometime later, a good leech is being had by him, sitting alone, at some more bikini-clad lovelies playing volleyball. His lips are licked by him as their well-toned backsides are admired and a sip is taken from a bottle of beer. The next morning, in a not-so-awful, not-so-great apartment, his bed is occupied by a sleeping Willie. He reaches over to the clock radio, which last night's empties surround, and the off button is fumbled for; the socket is ripped out by him, unable to find it."

Meanwhile, out on the shop floor, the elf ambles along, pulling a small hand cart behind him, while Santa, having completed his task, extracts the drill from the now-perforated safe door. On the shop floor, the elf, with a keen eye for luxury, helps himself to an expensive handbag from a display cabinet, followed by a selection of women's designer shoes, each item meticulously checked off against a detailed list he holds. As he scrutinizes the list, his gaze falls upon a string of pearls nestled within a cabinet, prompting him to seize a bead rack and smash the cabinet open with a swift, decisive motion. Later, he makes his way back to the vault, joining Santa, who is intently peering through the hole he drilled. Santa, with a chisel in hand, expertly opens the safe, causing a cascade of banknotes to spill out onto the floor. Outside, an oriental woman sits poised at the wheel of a van, waiting as Santa and his little helper clamber into the back, their arms laden with their ill-gotten gains. She turns to the elf, her foot pressing down on the accelerator, causing the van to lurch forward with a burst of speed, sending Santa and the elf tumbling backward.

          "description": "The elf, a diminutive figure with a decades-long history of working behind the scenes in this peculiar operation, shakes his head sadly as Santa, known to be less than jolly outside his seasonal duties, mooches inside past his less than impressed elf. In the store's vault, reminiscent of high-security bank vaults designed to safeguard treasures, Santa uses a heavy drill, a tool favored by burglars for its ability to penetrate metal, to bore through the door of a locked safe. Out on the shop floor of the luxury boutique store, the elf walks along towing a small hand cart, a piece of equipment often used in logistics to easily move merchandise, while Santa pulls out the drill from the safe door. On the shop floor, his little helper, who often finds the finer things in life enticing, helps himself to an expensive handbag from a display cabinet, then some women's designer shoes, all of which are detailed on a list that resembles a meticulously planned heist list. He checks his list while eyeing a string of pearls, a classic symbol of elegance and wealth, in a cabinet, and uses a bead rack to expertly smash it open. Later, he joins Santa in the vault and finds Santa peering through the hole he drilled, much like a prospector eager to strike gold. Santa uses a chisel, opens the safe, and wards of notes spill out onto the floor, reminiscent of a jackpot hitting in a casino. An oriental woman, a skilled getaway driver possibly with a history in stunt driving, sits at the wheel of a van as Santa and his little helper climb in the back with their booty. She turns to the elf with a knowing glance, puts her foot on the accelerator, and the van speeds off, a maneuver common in heist movies, throwing Santa and the elf backwards. Later, Santa, who in less seasonal times goes by the name of Willie, dances with Marcus, the elf who has been his partner in crime for years, in a bar. Willie puts down Marcus on a bar stool by the counter and sits down beside him. He calls over to the barmaid, a familiar presence who often turns a blind eye to their antics, who serves them. Willie and Marcus raise their glasses, down their drinks as if celebrating a successful score, and set the glasses back down on the counter. Marcus gives Willie a dubious look and looks expectantly at him, who considers and then turns to the barmaid with a grin. He turns back to Marcus with a half smile and looks down doubtfully at his empty glass. A plethora of beautiful bikini-clad women, reminiscent of a postcard from a paradise island, adorn the sand as Willie, now in a Hawaiian shirt that screams tourist, stands behind the counter of a beachfront bar, chopping up some lemons and limes. He puts them under the counter and pours a generous measure of vodka, a staple for those seeking liquid courage or escape, into a tumbler. As he does so, an irate man with an air of authority, clutching a tray of glasses like a bartender ready for action, joins him behind the counter. Willie slurps at the drink as if savoring a newfound treasure, and the barman punches him in the guts and tosses him over the counter, displaying a brawny strength often seen in barroom brawls. Willie throws a vodka bottle at the barman and misses it, a move that seems almost intentionally reckless. The barman leaps over the counter, and Willie runs for it, exhibiting a fleetness of foot that might suggest a past life of evading pursuers. Willie does as suggested, perhaps following instincts honed over years of escapades. Sometime later, he's sitting alone having a good leech at some more bikini-clad lovelies playing volleyball, a sport that epitomizes beach culture. He licks his lips as he admires their well-toned backsides and sips from a bottle of beer, perhaps reminiscing about past conquests or dreaming of new ones. The next morning, Willie is asleep on his bed in a not-so-awful, not-so-great apartment, a far cry from the luxurious settings he often finds himself coveting. He reaches over to the clock radio, a classic model known for its reliability despite its age, which is surrounded by last night's empties, and fumbles for the off button; unable to find it, he rips it out of its socket, displaying a frustration that suggests this is far from the first time."

          "description": "The dragon nods his head cheerfully as the wizard lounges outside past his more than amazed goblin. In the castle's attic, the wizard uses a light hammer to tap on the window of a locked chest. Out on the garden path of the castle, the dragon flies along dragging a large wheelbarrow, while the wizard pushes in the hammer from the chest window. In the garden path, his tiny sprite treats himself to a cheap helmet from an open crate, then some men's rubber boots, all of which are scribbled on a receipt. He checks his receipt while eyeing a string of cherries in a basket, and uses a cheese grater to yank it open. Later, he joins the wizard in the attic and finds the wizard staring through the crack he made. The wizard uses a spoon, pries the chest, and flakes of gold tumble out onto the ground. A European knight stands at the helm of a spaceship as the wizard and his tiny sprite jump in the front with their loot. He turns to the dragon, puts his hand on the joystick, and the spaceship glides off, lifting the wizard and the dragon upwards. Later, the wizard, who in more festive days goes by the name of Bob, whispers with Larry, the dragon, in a zoo. Bob puts up Larry on a hammock by the waterfall and lies down beside him. He calls over to the zookeeper, who greets them. Bob and Larry lift their forks, finish their meals, and set the forks back down on the tray. Larry gives Bob a suspicious glance and gazes hopefully at him, who thinks and then turns to the zookeeper. He turns back to Larry with a full grin and looks up confidently at his filled plate. A flock of playful seagull-flocked men decorate the waves as Bob, now in a garden hat, sits beneath the shade of a seaside stall, chopping up some apples and grapes. He tosses them over the stall and pours a tiny measure of lemonade into a cup. As he does so, a cheerful woman holding a basket of fruits joins him beneath the stall. Bob gulps at the juice, and the waitress hugs him in the arms and drops him over the stall. Bob hurls a lemonade pitcher at the waitress and hits it. The waitress skips over the stall, and Bob hides from it. Bob does the opposite. Sometime later, he's dining alone having a great nap at some more seagull-flocked beauties playing croquet. He bites his nails as he praises their poorly-groomed foreheads and chews on a slice of pizza. The day before, Bob is awake on his couch in a very perfect, very horrible cabin. He leans over to the alarm clock, which is surrounded by yesterday's dishes, and searches for the snooze button; unable to spot it, he tears it out of its cradle."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
