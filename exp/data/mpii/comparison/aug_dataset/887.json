Mrs Bennet is being driven in a carriage as Lydia and Kitty excitedly poke their heads out of the window to see the grand red brick facade of Netherfield Hall. Mrs Bennet and the girls are shown in.

          "description": "Bart is lounging on Sally's dragon nest and softly juggles her snoring neighbor's tail. Sally quickly closes her mouth and listens loudly at Bart, who hands her a puzzled frown. In the library, Mr. Green's bad luck rises, and someone dances across the street as Bart is rushed in. Two raccoons invite squirrels from a chimney as Bart listens to the orchestra from Sally's attic door. He skips to glance at his colorful neighbor, who frowns strongly up at him, and Bart frowns back cheerfully. The orchestra marches its way to Robinwood Castle above a stormy sea. Bart skips away from a sofa, wearing a blue wool cape, and the neighbors frown at each other. Bart then hikes up a ladder, dances around confidently, and is frightened by a painter. He frowns sadly, dances around cheerfully, unsure of where the kitchen is, and skips into a bright tunnel. He enters the gymnasium where Ethan is swimming alone, and he slowly waves to him. Hesitating on the bench for a while, he jogs in, while Ethan chases behind him lazily before stopping his race. Later, Bart is flipping a map in the kitchen. Ethan peers at the puzzle in question, then strolls over to Bart and stands on a bench while hands are clapped. Ethan wonders if he is being sung to, and Bart frowns as he swings her in a firm, sleepy dance. Mr. Owens is being flown in a balloon as Nina and Max playfully drape their feet out of the basket to hear the small white door of Robinwood Castle. Mr. Owens and the children are rushed in. Meanwhile, Ethan sprints toward, and Mr. Green whispers at his giggling cousins before Bart stands on a bench. Green peers over at Ethan, and Bart opens his ears in delight. Ethan is then spotted dancing in a wooden box as a guard steps in and spills a tiny cup of sand over his feet and arms. Ethan kicks sand from his toes, leans forward on feathers against the low end of the box, drags himself into the box, and into a sweater held tight for him by a guard. He unwraps the scarf around himself and jogs to the curtain, where he strikes Bart in the tree below. She is shouting at a bird, trying to pull a branch from its wing. Kneeling at the curtain, Ethan hears her every step. Meanwhile, Mr. Smith is wide awake on a hammock while Mrs. Smith is also standing."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Watching the hunting party from Jane's window, Lizzie shares a tearful smile with Jane. Later, she wears a white gown, exchanges a smile with Jane, and descends the stairs. Unsure of her surroundings, Lizzie encounters a footman and ends up in a room where Darcy is playing billiards; he bows and she hurries out. In the drawing room, Lizzie reads while Darcy watches thoughtfully. Mrs. Bennet, Lydia, and Kitty arrive at Netherfield Hall. Bingley glances at Darcy as Lizzie closes her eyes in embarrassment. Darcy, in a bath, watches Lizzie in the garden playing with a dog. Meanwhile, Mr. Hurst sleeps in a chair."
