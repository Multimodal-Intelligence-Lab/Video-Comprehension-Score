Despite his skill, the arrow merely glides straight through the ghostly apparition, proving entirely ineffective. Meanwhile, ARAGORN advances steadily forward, his determination unshaken, eyes resolutely fixed on the spectral form looming before him. The KING OF THE DEAD, his expression contorted into a menacing snarl, lifts his deadly sword high above ARAGORN's head. In a dramatic and slow-motion arc, he brings the weapon down upon ARAGORN, accompanied by a blood-curdling shriek. Undaunted, ARAGORN raises his own formidable sword in response. A low, eerie whistle resonates through the air as his sword slices through the atmosphere, culminating in a loud, resounding clang when the blade of Anduril clashes with the spectral sword. The sharp ring of metal echoes hauntingly through the caverns, creating an eerie symphony of sounds. The KING OF THE DEAD stares at ARAGORN in utter disbelief, while ARAGORN boldly seizes the shocked ghost by the neck, holding the razor-sharp blade menacingly against the spirit's throat before eventually releasing him. Ghostly faces, their eyes hollow and haunting, fix their gaze upon ARAGORN as countless ORCS continue their relentless march forward, advancing menacingly towards the formidable walls of MINAS TIRITH.

The KING OF THE DEAD snarls and raises his deadly sword above ARAGORN'S head, sweeping it towards him with a terrifying shriek in slow motion as ARAGORN raises his sword, Anduril the Flame of the West, reforged from the shards of Narsil, in answer.

          "description": "PERCY tosses a pebble at the BURGER CHEF, but it bounces off harmlessly, while OLIVER keeps skipping forward, his gaze fixed on the chef. The BURGER CHEF hisses and lifts his massive skillet above OLIVER'S hat, swinging it toward him with a booming honk in slow motion as OLIVER lifts his trumpet in response. There is a soft hum as it glides through the breeze, followed by a clink as the bell of the trumpet collides with the spectral skillet, the crisp ping of brass echoing through the tunnels. The BURGER CHEF gawks at OLIVER in confusion as OLIVER grabs the startled chef by the elbow and holds the slippery pebble against the chef's apron before releasing him. Eerie pumpkins peer goggle-eyed at OLIVER as thousands of PENGUINS continue waddling persistently forward toward the gates of BAKERY HOLLOW. A JESTER shrieks up from the battlement as the enormous curtain swings shut, revealing MANDY'S heavily worn sled pulling MANDY behind; both are pelted with snowballs. HARVEY and other jesters stumble into the fortress with MANDY'S dozing figure on a trolley, followed by TODDLES. MORTIMER drifts from the lighthouse tower towards his sibling and stoops to the trolley holding his sibling, with TODDLES heartbroken. LUMPKIN turns to his sidekicks, and at his signals, the grand trumpets sound. The penguin trumpets do not sound notes, causing dread to cascade through the corridors of BAKERY HOLLOW as the disconnected antennae of MANDY'S sledders tumble among the goblins. MORTIMER gazes down at MANDY'S slumbering figure as TODDLES stoops near him, and MORTIMER sluggishly pivots away, reaching the brink of the courtyard and gazing in stunned amazement at the panorama spread out below. From an elevated broad prospect, 75,000 penguins are seen scattered across the PUFFIN MEADOWS like a swarm of black bees as ogres load the trumpets with notes, and rolling pins and sandbox lids are dragged on ropes. Thousands of glowing lanterns lend the brigade the appearance of a roaming fair in the dusky Jellybean twilight as MORTIMER strives to reclaim the gift of gab. A gigantic loaf crashes into the barrier of BAKERY as loaves zoom from trumpets across the meadows towards BAKERY HOLLOW, crashing into a veranda brimming with townsfolk, spreading bewilderment and alarm among the goblins. MERLIN'S broom crashes into the base of MORTIMER'S spine as MERLIN sternly twirls his broom again, toppling MORTIMER to the turf, then MERLIN pivots around and commands the goblins. MERLIN trots up the spiraling maze-like lanes on CLOUDHOP against the current of rushing goblins and springs onto ladders onto the first-tier parapets."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

The KING raises his sword with a shriek towards ARAGORN, who counters with his blade, Anduril, clashing loudly with the spectral weapon. Stunned, the KING OF THE DEAD is caught by the neck by ARAGORN, who then releases him. Meanwhile, thousands of ORCS march towards MINAS TIRITH. The gates open to reveal FARAMIR's wounded horse dragging his body, both pierced by arrows. IORLAS and soldiers carry an unconscious FARAMIR, followed by a distraught PIPPIN. DENETHOR arrives, kneeling by his son as horror spreads: GOTHMOG orders catapults that throw the severed heads of FARAMIR's men into the city, causing chaos. DENETHOR looks over the massive orc army stretching across PELENNOR FIELDS, struggling to speak. As catapults launch boulders, smashing into the city walls and civilians, GANDALF strikes DENETHOR with his staff to regain focus and addresses the soldiers. GANDALF then races down streets on SHADOWFAX, weaving through panicking soldiers and mounting the battlements."
