Zus is left unconvincing as Tuvia sets off. In a dimly lit cottage, two vodkas are poured out by Tuvia as a dark-haired Russian sits down at his table, places a gun on the table, and it is taken by Tuvia, the wife's hostile face is glanced at by him, the bullets are pocketed, and the gun is tucked into his belt. Meat is being chopped by the wife while the men clink glasses, pour some away, and the rest is downed by them. A piece of bread is bitten into by Tuvia, and he is ignored by the wife as a smile is cracked by him. A beam of light shines through the window as the back door is dived out of by Tuvia, and the glasses are quickly removed from the table by the wife. Koscik's barn is climbed up into by Tuvia, where half a dozen people are already hiding, as an official car is drawn up with its headlights blazing. Outside, the vodka bottle is being held by Koscik. The bottle is handed over by Koscik, some vodka is gulped back by him, and in the barn, someone coughs as the bottle is passed to a colleague by Bernicki. In the barn, the gun is taken out by Tuvia and some more vodka is gulped back by him.

Outside, clothing is handed out to the Jews who were hiding by Koscik, and uneasily, he is watched by Tuvia as a bottle and a loaf of rye bread are given to him by Koscik, compassion is looked at him with, and Koscik nods. Hands are shaken by the two friends, and Tuvia strides past the little group of Jews who uncertainly watch him; over his shoulder, he glances without slowing down, and after him, they hurry in the forest. Early the next morning, behind Tuvia, one of the Jews comes up; a guy in a smart hat and coat is leaned against a tree by him to get his breath back. Later, the extended group is having a meal, a piece of fruit is bitten into by a girl and it is passed to her neighbor by her, and a ladle full of soup is taken by the woman in the beret and the pot is passed to Shimon, the school teacher, who takes a ladle full and passes it to Aron who sits next to Asael.

Aron has arrived, bringing along with him a group of individuals, some of whom are hungrily biting into generous mounds of hard, crusty bread, their hunger evident in each bite. Nearby, Zus stands with an uneasy expression, gesturing discreetly to his older brother, Tuvia, urging him with subtle insistence to join him away from the prying ears and eyes of the others. With determination, Tuvia sets off in Zus's direction, leaving Zus behind, still looking unconvinced and somewhat troubled by the circumstances.\n\nIn the dimly lit interior of a rustic, worn-down cottage, Tuvia pours out two glasses of clear vodka, the alcohol glistening under the faint light. A dark-haired Russian man takes a seat at the sturdy wooden table, deliberately placing a gun on its rough surface. Tuvia picks up the gun, his expression unchanging, casting a glance at the hostile face of the man's wife, who is busily chopping meat with focused intent. He carefully pockets the bullets and tucks the gun securely into his belt, ensuring it is well concealed. The men clink their glasses together, pour some of the vodka away ceremonially, and then down the remainder in one swift, practiced motion. Tuvia bites into a piece of bread, allowing a smile to crack through despite the wife's cold demeanor. A sudden beam of light shines through the window unexpectedly, prompting Tuvia to dive out of the back door with urgency. The wife acts quickly, removing the glasses from the table, tidying up the evidence of their clandestine meeting.\n\nTuvia climbs up into the dusty loft of Koscik's barn, where half a dozen people are already hiding, seeking refuge and safety from the outside world.

Later, the expanded and diverse group gathers together for a communal meal. A girl bites into a piece of fruit and passes it to her neighbor, sharing what little they have, while a woman wearing a distinctive beret takes a ladle full of nourishing soup and passes the pot to Shimon, the school teacher. Shimon takes a ladle full and passes it on to Aron, who is seated next to Asael, continuing the chain of sharing. Meanwhile, Zus is energetically chopping at a tree, and Tuvia, standing nearby, observes an old man somberly burying his daughter with reverence.

Tuvia sets off, leaving Zus looking unconvinced. In a dimly lit cottage, typical of rural Eastern European homes with sparse furnishings, Tuvia pours out two vodkas as a dark-haired Russian, likely a local partisan fighting against occupying forces, sits down at his table, places a gun on the table, and Tuvia takes it, glancing at the wife's hostile face that reflects the tension of living in constant fear, pocketing the bullets, and tucking the gun into his belt.

In a brightly lit stadium, Wellington pours out two smoothies as a red-haired Norwegian sits down at his desk, places a balloon on the chair, and Wellington grabs it, peering at the owl's friendly beak, pocketing the marbles, and tucking the balloon into his sock.

In a brightly lit skyscraper, Orion spills two oranges as a blond-haired dancer stands up from the couch, lifts a book from the shelf, and Orion drops it, glaring at the husband's friendly smile, tossing the pages, and placing the book into his bag. The husband is slicing apples while the women bump elbows, toss some aside, and save the rest. Orion sips a cup of tea, and the husband acknowledges him as Orion sheds a tear. A shadow of darkness falls through the chimney as Orion leaps into the front window, and the husband slowly places the cups onto the shelf. Orion slides back onto Maura's roof, where a dozen cats are already napping, as an ancient wagon spins up with its candles shimmering. Inside, Maura is painting the orange vase. Maura tosses aside the vase, spits out some paint, and someone sneezes on the rooftop as Gregor places the vase beside a lamp. On the rooftop, Orion tosses aside the book and spits out more paint. Nara's ears shrink, and she points a toe at Maura's chin like a brush, rubs Maura on the shoulder, and leaves. Gregor and the four old ladies with her stroll to their wagon as Orion, on the rooftop, laughs with joy. Inside, Maura hands over pastries to the swans who were singing, and Orion listens curiously as Maura offers her a vase and a chunk of soft cheese, staring at Orion with amusement and clapping. The two enemies embrace shoulders, and Orion leaps through the giant crowd of swans who sing to him confidently, he grins up toward his feet without speeding up, and they skip before him in the mountain. Late the previous night, one of the swans falls down in front of Orion, and a woman in a tattered shirt and sandals sits beneath a bench to catch her nap back.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
