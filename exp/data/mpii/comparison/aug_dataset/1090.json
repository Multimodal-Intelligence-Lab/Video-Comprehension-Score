In a dimly lit cottage, two vodkas are poured out by Tuvia as a dark-haired Russian sits down at his table, places a gun on the table, and it is taken by Tuvia, the wife's hostile face is glanced at by him, the bullets are pocketed, and the gun is tucked into his belt. Meat is being chopped by the wife while the men clink glasses, pour some away, and the rest is downed by them. A piece of bread is bitten into by Tuvia, and he is ignored by the wife as a smile is cracked by him. A beam of light shines through the window as the back door is dived out of by Tuvia, and the glasses are quickly removed from the table by the wife. Koscik's barn is climbed up into by Tuvia, where half a dozen people are already hiding, as an official car is drawn up with its headlights blazing. Outside, the vodka bottle is being held by Koscik.

Hands are shaken by the two friends, and Tuvia strides past the little group of Jews who uncertainly watch him; over his shoulder, he glances without slowing down, and after him, they hurry in the forest.

Nearby, Zus stands with an uneasy expression, gesturing discreetly to his older brother, Tuvia, urging him with subtle insistence to join him away from the prying ears and eyes of the others. With determination, Tuvia sets off in Zus's direction, leaving Zus behind, still looking unconvinced and somewhat troubled by the circumstances.\n\nIn the dimly lit interior of a rustic, worn-down cottage, Tuvia pours out two glasses of clear vodka, the alcohol glistening under the faint light. A dark-haired Russian man takes a seat at the sturdy wooden table, deliberately placing a gun on its rough surface. Tuvia picks up the gun, his expression unchanging, casting a glance at the hostile face of the man's wife, who is busily chopping meat with focused intent. He carefully pockets the bullets and tucks the gun securely into his belt, ensuring it is well concealed. The men clink their glasses together, pour some of the vodka away ceremonially, and then down the remainder in one swift, practiced motion. Tuvia bites into a piece of bread, allowing a smile to crack through despite the wife's cold demeanor. A sudden beam of light shines through the window unexpectedly, prompting Tuvia to dive out of the back door with urgency.

          "description": "Orion's softened ears flutter as he looks down at Lila and the animals she has lost, some of which are barking quietly on piles of soft cheese, while Rex stands afar looking joyful and waves to his younger sister to leave him in sight of the skies. Orion leaps over, leaving Rex looking convinced. In a brightly lit skyscraper, Orion spills two oranges as a blond-haired dancer stands up from the couch, lifts a book from the shelf, and Orion drops it, glaring at the husband's friendly smile, tossing the pages, and placing the book into his bag. The husband is slicing apples while the women bump elbows, toss some aside, and save the rest. Orion sips a cup of tea, and the husband acknowledges him as Orion sheds a tear. A shadow of darkness falls through the chimney as Orion leaps into the front window, and the husband slowly places the cups onto the shelf. Orion slides back onto Maura's roof, where a dozen cats are already napping, as an ancient wagon spins up with its candles shimmering. Inside, Maura is painting the orange vase. Maura tosses aside the vase, spits out some paint, and someone sneezes on the rooftop as Gregor places the vase beside a lamp. On the rooftop, Orion tosses aside the book and spits out more paint. Nara's ears shrink, and she points a toe at Maura's chin like a brush, rubs Maura on the shoulder, and leaves. Gregor and the four old ladies with her stroll to their wagon as Orion, on the rooftop, laughs with joy. Inside, Maura hands over pastries to the swans who were singing, and Orion listens curiously as Maura offers her a vase and a chunk of soft cheese, staring at Orion with amusement and clapping. The two enemies embrace shoulders, and Orion leaps through the giant crowd of swans who sing to him confidently, he grins up toward his feet without speeding up, and they skip before him in the mountain. Late the previous night, one of the swans falls down in front of Orion, and a woman in a tattered shirt and sandals sits beneath a bench to catch her nap back. Earlier, the reduced team is hunting a fish as a man nibbles on a slice of bread and throws it to his partner, and the boy in the fedora catches a drop of stew and throws the spoon to Lark, the historian, who breaks the spoon and throws it to Lila who stands opposite Mabel. Rex is barking at a bush as Orion, sitting elsewhere, hears the young girl dancing for her father. Rex burns some wood and arrives, while Orion climbs through a muddy street towards the young girl drying the lake with sand."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Tuvia leaves Zus unconvinced and, in a dim cottage, pours vodka for himself and a dark-haired Russian. The Russian places a gun on the table, which Tuvia takes, glancing at the hostile wife. The men drink, and Tuvia bites bread while smiling. Suddenly, Tuvia dives out the back as the wife removes the glasses. Tuvia climbs into Koscik's barn where others hide, while outside an official car arrives. Koscik shares vodka as Tuvia, armed, drinks more. Bernicki and men leave, and Tuvia sighs in relief. Koscik gives the Jews clothing, a bottle, and bread to Tuvia, nodding compassionately. Tuvia and Koscik shake hands, and Tuvia leads the Jews into the forest. The next morning, a Jew catches up with Tuvia as a man rests nearby. Later, the group shares a meal; a girl passes fruit, and others share soup. Zus chops a tree while Tuvia watches an old man bury his daughter, then approaches as the grave is filled."
