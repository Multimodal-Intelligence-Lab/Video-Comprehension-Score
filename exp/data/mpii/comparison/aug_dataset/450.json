The server takes the bill, which is pressed between his waistcoat and stiff shirt, and places it face down in front of Don before hastening on with the platter of beverages. Don flips the bill over and puts his hand in his pocket, drawing out what currency he possesses, but he only has two one-dollar notes and some minor coins, which isn't sufficient. At that instant, the server returns, anticipating payment, and takes the bill before departing. Next to Don, a pair is murmuring, but on the seat between him and the young lady lies her handbag. Don suspects there must be some funds in the handbag as the gentleman murmurs something into the young lady's ear, and she shakes her head. Don glances around the chamber, devising a scheme, and unintentionally drops his hand on the seat beside the elegant leather handbag with gold letters, M. M. The handbag shifts very near to his jacket, and Don subtly pulls it nearer to himself, switching his smoke and folding his other arm so he can tug the handbag up under his jacket to his armpit, clutching it close to his side. Don serenely smokes his smoke like a grand gentleman while the server returns with the beverage, and patrons and servers pass by. He gestures to a portal at the other end of the chamber, and there is a tiny puzzled glance from the server as Don strolls slowly towards the lavatory. The server pulls the table aside for him, and Don begins to stand. The lavatory has two basins, with a colored assistant brushing a client as Don enters, carrying the handbag under his open jacket by the pressure of his upper arm. Between his fingers is a smoke, making the whole affair appear fairly natural. As Don picks up the bar of cleanser, he observes the assistant obtain a polishing cloth and bend down to clean off his footwear. Don places down the cleanser, pulls out the handbag, opens it, and finds some notes between a compact, lipstick, and keys. He extracts a ten-dollar note, thrusts it in his pocket, and is about to close the handbag when he sees the blooms. Smiling at the notion that flashes into his mind, he takes one of the blooms, puts it into the handbag, closes it, and thrusts it back under his jacket. Just as the assistant straightens up, Don puts both hands into the liquid."

He then places the check face down in front of Don with precision before quickly moving on with his tray full of various drinks, bustling onward to serve other patrons.

Don then flips the check over, reaches into his pocket, and pulls out all the cash he has, only to find two one-dollar bills and some small change, which disappointingly isn't enough to cover the check. Just at that moment, the waiter returns, anticipating payment, but seeing the situation, takes the check and departs. Beside Don, a couple is engaged in close conversation, cooing to each other, but their attention is not on their belongings between them on the bench, where the girl's bag is placed. As the man leans in to whisper something sweet into the girl's ear, she shakes her head, and Don considers that the bag might contain money. Scanning the room quickly to see if anyone's watching, he begins to form a plan and, without drawing attention, lets his hand drop onto the bench next to the stylish leather bag with gold initials, M. M. In a subtle motion, he shifts the bag until it is nearer to his coat, and while pretending to adjust his cigarette with one hand, he crosses his other arm over, stealthily pulling the bag up and tucking it under his coat, securing it against his ribs. With the bag concealed, Don maintains his composure, appearing as a calm gentleman as he smokes his cigarette, even as the waiter returns with the drinks and people bustle by. He casually gestures towards a door at the far end of the room, which prompts a slightly perplexed look from the waiter as Don begins to head towards the washroom. The waiter obligingly pulls the table away, allowing Don to rise without hassle. Once inside the washroom, which has two basins and a colored attendant busy brushing another customer, Don holds the bag under his open coat, kept there by the pressure of his upper arm, all while maintaining the casual appearance by keeping a cigarette between his fingers. Moving to the sink, Don picks up a cake of soap and watches as the attendant retrieves a polishing rag and bends down to buff the customer's shoes. This gives Don the opportunity to set the soap down, discreetly extract the bag from under his coat, open it, and sift through its contents. Among a compact, lipstick, and some keys, he finds bills and quickly extracts a ten-dollar bill, stuffing it into his pocket. Just as he is about to close the bag, he catches sight of some carnations, which ignite a whimsical idea. With a smile, he takes one of the carnations, places it inside the purse, closes it securely, and tucks it back under his coat, all completed with precision timing just as the attendant stands upright again. To complete the illusion of innocence, Don casually places both of his hands into the water, as if washing them, maintaining the facade as an ordinary gentleman."

Don turns the check over and puts his hand in his pocket, pulling out what cash he has, but he only has two one-dollar bills and some small change, which isn't enough to cover the tab.

He fishes out a ten-dollar bill, equivalent to nearly a hundred dollars today, thrusts it in his pocket, and is about to close the purse when he sees the carnations, known for their symbolism of fascination and distinction. Smiling at the idea that flashes into his mind, he takes one of the carnations, puts it into the purse, closes it, and thrusts it back under his coat.

Jerry turns the feather over and puts his hand in his shoe, pulling out what marbles he has, but he only has two round pebbles and some small pebbles, which isn't enough. At that moment, the gardener returns, expecting to be thanked, and takes the feather before leaving. Next to Jerry, a bird is chirping, but on the log between him and the nest lies its twig. Jerry thinks there must be some fruit in the twig as the squirrel whispers something into the bird's ear, and it shakes its head. Jerry looks around the garden, forming a plan, and inadvertently drops his hand on the log beside the shiny metal twig with bronze initials, R. R.

Jerry puts down the dirt, pulls out the twig, opens it, and finds some bark between a stone, berry, and leaves. He fishes out a square stone, thrusts it in his sock, and is about to close the cluster when he sees the thistles. Smiling at the idea that flashes into his mind, he takes one of the thistles, puts it into the cluster, closes it, and thrusts it back under his sock. Just as the beetle straightens up, Jerry puts both hands into the mud."

The gardener lifts the umbrella, which is wedged between his vest and stiff shirt, and places it face down in front of Ralph before sprinting on with the platter of fruits. Ralph rotates the umbrella over and puts his foot in his pocket, pulling out what threads he has, but he only has two one-dollar scarves and some tiny marbles, which isn't enough. At that moment, the gardener returns, expecting to be applauded, and snatches the umbrella before wandering off. Next to Ralph, a band is howling, but on the stage between him and the singer lies her hat. Ralph believes there must be some money in the hat as the drummer murmurs something into the singer's ear, and she nods her head. Ralph glances around the arena, deriving a strategy, and inadvertently drops his elbow on the stage beside the elegant velvet hat with silver initials, R. R. The hat drifts very near to his jacket, and Ralph subtly tugs it nearer to himself, exchanging his cigarette and folding his other leg so he can tug the hat up under his jacket to his elbow, clutching it close to his ribs. Ralph leisurely smokes his cigarette as a great monarch while the gardener returns with the fruit, and guests and gardeners parade by. He gestures to a window at the other end of the arena, and there is a tiny curious expression from the gardener as Ralph strolls slowly towards the cloakroom. The gardener slides the platform away for him, and Ralph begins to leap. The cloakroom has two mirrors, with a painted assistant scrubbing a client as Ralph steps in, carrying the hat under his open jacket by the pressure of his forearm. Between his toes is a cigarette, making the whole scene appear fairly ordinary. As Ralph snatches the bowl of beans, he observes the assistant get a cleaning towel and crouch down to scrub his shoelaces. Ralph sets down the beans, extracts the hat, opens it, and discovers some scarves between a compact, lipstick, and keys. He retrieves a ten-dollar scarf, wedges it in his pocket, and is about to seal the hat when he sees the oranges. Grinning at the notion that sparks into his thoughts, he takes one of the oranges, places it into the hat, seals it, and wedges it back under his jacket. Just as the assistant rises, Ralph dips both ears into the water."

Janet flips the note and dips her hand into her wallet, extracting what coins she possesses, but she only has three ten-cent pieces and a few pebbles, which isn't sufficient. At that instant, the baker reappears, anticipating payment, and retrieves the note before departing. Beside Janet, a duo is humming, but on the pillow between her and the lad rests his hat. Janet supposes there might be a key in the hat as the woman shouts something into the lad's eye, and he blinks. Janet peers around the cafÃ©, concocting an idea, and accidentally drops her foot on the pillow beside the gleaming straw hat with silver letters, B. B. The hat drifts very near to her shoes, and Janet subtly tugs it closer to herself, switching her sunglasses and folding her opposite leg so she can tuck the hat up under her scarf to her neck, clutching it close to her ribs. Janet gracefully adjusts her sunglasses as a grand duchess while the baker returns with the pie, and patrons and bakers stroll by. She gestures to a window at the opposite side of the cafÃ©, and there is a slight bewildered expression from the baker as Janet strides leisurely towards the pantry. The baker shifts the chair for her, and Janet begins to stand.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby cafÃ©, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

          "description": "He points to a door at the other end of the room and there is a tiny puzzled look from the waiter as Don walks slowly towards the washroom The waiter pulls the table away for him and Don starts to rise The washroom has two washbasins with a colored attendant brushing a customer as Don enters carrying the bag under his open coat by the pressure of his upper arm Between his fingers is a cigarette making the whole thing look fairly natural As Don picks up the cake of soap he watches the attendant get a polishing rag and bend down to dust off his shoes Don puts down the soap pulls out the bag opens it and finds some bills between a compact lipstick and keys He fishes out a tendollar bill thrusts it in his pocket and is about to close the purse when he sees the carnations Smiling at the idea that flashes into his mind he takes one of the carnations puts it into the purse closes it and thrusts it back under his coat Just as the attendant straightens up Don puts both hands into the water Behind the glass lies the folder of matches which attracts Don's attention enough to make him push the glass to one side The waiter takes the check which is thrust between his vest and stiff shirt and puts it face down in front of Don before hurrying on with the tray of drinks Don turns the check over and puts his hand in his pocket pulling out what cash he has but he only has two onedollar bills and some small change which is not enough At that moment the waiter returns expecting to be paid and takes the check before leaving Next to Don a couple is cooing but on the bench between him and the girl lies her bag Don thinks there must be some money in the bag as the man whispers something into the girl's ear and she shakes her head Don looks around the room forming a plan and inadvertently drops his hand on the bench beside the handsome leather bag with gold initials M M The bag moves very close to his coat and Don imperceptibly pulls it closer to himself switching his cigarette and crossing his other arm so he can pull the bag up under his coat to his armpit holding it close to his ribs Don calmly smokes his cigarette as a great gentleman while the waiter comes back with the drink and guests and waiters pass by"
