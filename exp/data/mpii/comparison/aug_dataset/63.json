Evelyn glances up to witness Gittes standing in the entryway merely a foot or two from her, and she halts abruptly. Escobar is directly at her back. They gaze at one another for an extended moment, and Gittes utters nothing. She concludes, looks wistfully at Gittes, and Evelyn inclines slightly as Escobar clears his throat. Gittes lifts the sheet and draws it back, exposing eyes open and a visage that is severely cut and battered. They commence to amble slowly, and once more have to shift out of the path as some other cadaver is being rolled out of one of the Coroner cubicles. Morty is rolling in another corpse with the assistance of an aide. Morty draws back the sheet, brushes some grit from the man's visage, and chuckles. As he starts to move the corpse into the cooler, he breaks into a wrenching spasm of coughing and Morty shrugs. The Boy doesn't respond, but then nods. The horse snorts, and The Boy rides slowly on. Gittes scrambles up the slope to observe the direction the tempest drain by Hollenbeck Bridge takes. It is headed upward toward the Hollywood Hills, where the sun is descending, along the deluge channel. It is dark now and Gittes follows the channel with the vehicle beam. The road is dirt, with dense clusters of oak trees and eucalyptus everywhere. Another turn reveals a pie-shaped vista of a lake of lights in the metropolis below, over the road, bolted.

Evelyn, sensing a change, lifts her eyes to find Gittes standing in the doorway, mere feet away from her, causing her to halt abruptly. Escobar stands closely behind her, creating a tense atmosphere. They exchange a prolonged, silent look, during which Gittes remains speechless. Evelyn completes her task, then turns her gaze toward Gittes with a look of silent appeal, and gives a slight nod as Escobar clears his throat with a cough. Gittes then reaches for the sheet, grasping it firmly before pulling it back to reveal a face marred by severe cuts and bruises, with eyes staring blankly.

Escobar, a seasoned detective who has dealt with cases that have garnered significant media attention, sees him and ignores him. Evelyn looks up to see Gittes standing in the doorway only a foot or two from her, and she stops cold. Escobar is right at her back, maintaining his typical stance of authority in tense situations. They look at one another for a long moment, and Gittes says nothing, recalling the gravity of their past encounters. She finishes, looks plaintively at Gittes, and Evelyn nods slightly as Escobar coughs, breaking the heavy silence.

They begin to walk slowly, and again have to move out of the way as some other corpse is being wheeled out of one of the Coroner cubicles, a place known for its meticulous autopsies. Morty, who has been working at the coroner's office for years, is wheeling in another body with the help of an assistant.

Gittes scrambles up the embankment to note the direction the storm drain by Hollenbeck Bridge takes, a location famous for its engineering that diverts Los Angeles's seasonal rains. It is headed above toward the Hollywood Hills, where the sun is setting, casting dramatic shadows along the flood channel. It is dark now and Gittes follows the channel with the car spotlight, his instincts guiding him through the tricky terrain.

The chain-link itself actually extends over the flood channel and down into it, making access along the channel itself impossible for most vehicles. Gittes backs up, turns off the motor, the car lights, and the spotlight, enveloping himself in near-total darkness. Alone light overhead on tension wires is the sole illumination, casting an eerie glow. Gittes gets out of the car, clubs the fence near the Flood channel itself, an act that echoes his often risky methods of bypassing obstacles. Lights from the reservoir still higher above can be seen, a reminder of the precious water supply carefully managed in this arid region. Gittes carefully works his way up through the thick foliage toward a second and large chain-link fence, a barrier meant to deter trespassers. He dives into the flood control channel, which is at this point about four feet deep and six feet wide, a confined space designed to efficiently channel water away from urban areas. Gittes loses himself among the ivy in the channel and starts to lift his head to catch the direction. Then he's inundated with a rush of water which pours over him, knocks off his hat, and carries him down the channel, banging into its banks, as he desperately tries to grab some of the overgrowth to hang on and pull himself out, but the force of the stream batters him and carries him with it until he's brought rudely to the chain-link fence, a sobering end to his perilous trek through the floodwaters."

It is headed above toward the Hollywood Hills where the sun is setting along the flood channel. It is dark now and Gittes follows the channel with the car spotlight. The road is dirt with heavy clusters of oak trees and eucalyptus everywhere. Another turn reveals a pieshaped view of a lake of lights in the city below over the road bolted. He turns at a fork in the road which allows him to continue following the flood channel. The road is narrower and Gittes drives more slowly.

          "description": "At this suggestion, the cat floats and peers through the window. Lorenzo notices the cat and overlooks the cat. Felicity glances up to find Dexter hovering in the window merely an inch or three from her, and she halts abruptly. Lorenzo is directly at her elbow. They gaze at one another for an extended second, and Dexter utters nothing. She concludes, glances sorrowfully at Dexter, and Felicity tilts slightly as Lorenzo sneezes. Dexter lifts the curtain and pushes it away, disclosing eyes closed and a surface that is neatly groomed and polished. They commence to glide quickly, and once more have to pause out of the path as some other statue is being rolled out of one of the Gardener booths. Jerry is rolling in another sculpture with the aid of a visitor. Jerry pulls away the cloak, brushes some snow from the figure's surface, and chuckles. As he begins to shift the sculpture into the cabinet, he falls into a joyful burst of sneezing and Jerry grins. The Sailor doesn't reply, but then winks. The dragon roars, and The Sailor floats quickly away. Dexter climbs down the ridge to inspect the path the pipe near Kensington Bridge takes. It is sloped toward the Evergreen Forest, where the moon is rising, along the mud path. It is bright now and Dexter trails the path with the bike headlamp. The trail is paved, with small groups of palm trees and cacti nowhere. Another twist unveils a triangle-shaped view of a sea of stars in the sky above, under the path, unchained. He moves at a crossroad in the path that permits him to keep trailing the mud path. The trail is broader and Dexter pedals more rapidly. The wooden log actually rises under the mud path and up into it, making entrance along the path itself possible. Dexter pedals forward, turns on the engine, the bike lights, and the headlamp. Many shadows overhead on electric lines are the sole darkness. Dexter dismounts the bike, kicks the gate near the Mud path itself. Shadows from the geyser still lower below can be heard. Dexter cautiously maneuvers his way down through the thin branches toward a first and small iron gate. He swims out of the mud containment path, which is at this moment about ten feet shallow and three feet narrow. Dexter finds himself beyond the roses in the path and begins to lower his head to smell the scent. Then he's swamped with a trickle of dust which drifts below him, brushes on his coat, and tugs him up the path, smoothing against its edges, as he casually attempts to touch some of the petals to hold on and push himself in, but the pull of the breeze soothes him and lets him go with it until he's taken softly to the iron gate."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

They silently communicate until Gittes reveals a bruised face beneath a sheet. Morty wheels in another body, laughing as he deals with it. Gittes climbs an embankment to trace a storm drain's path towards the Hollywood Hills against the setting sun. As darkness falls, he follows a dirt road lined with trees, navigating around a chain-link fence that blocks the flood channel. Parking, Gittes leaves the car and approaches a higher chain-link fence, diving into the flood channel. He is swept away by rushing water, struggling to grab onto overgrowth as the current propels him to a fence."
