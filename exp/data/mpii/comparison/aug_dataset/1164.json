          "description": "Harry, feeling an intense rush of frustration, aggressively kicks his trunk, a sudden action that leaves Ron momentarily stunned. As Ron absorbs this unexpected display, he slowly turns away, leaving Harry by himself in the quiet room. Harry, now alone, lowers himself onto his bed, his gaze drifting into an unfocused stare as he becomes lost in his own thoughts. He begins to twist and flex his neck, attempting to release the tension that has taken hold of his muscles. In the midst of this solitude, Harry finds his consciousness drifting away; he soon finds himself lying in a black tiled corridor with menacing shadows stretching across the floor, and at the end of this eerie passage, a blue door stands in stark contrast. As he tosses and turns in his sleep, the skin on his arm pulsates, causing veins to bulge and twist frighteningly beneath the surface. The unsettling image of the black corridor reappears in his mind, followed by the striking vision of a glass sphere clutched by a bony hand. This jarring imagery jolts him awake; sweat clings to his skin, and he becomes aware of Ron's concerned eyes fixed upon him. The scene shifts to a lively classroom, where a girl with an amused expression throws a white paper airplane into the air. As it takes flight, the airplane begins to transform, its paper bending and folding until it becomes a delicate paper bird, flapping its newly-formed wings with a graceful flutter. Seamus, with an eager, playful swipe of his hand, attempts to catch the bird, but it deftly evades him, soaring just out of reach and drawing a path across the classroom. Meanwhile, Crabbe, with a focused and mischievous glint in his eyes, readies his catapult, aiming at the flying paper creation. The bird hovers momentarily, its paper wings still fluttering, before it suddenly combusts into flames. This dramatic and abrupt transformation occurs just as Professor Umbridge, her expression fixed in a sickly sweet smile, lowers her wand, now directing her attention to the books that begin to distribute themselves neatly onto each student's desk. The students, feeling the oppressive atmosphere in the room, lower their eyes, anxiety etched across their faces as Umbridge, searching for the right words, lets her gaze wander around the classroom before her focus ultimately lands on Harry. She begins a slow, deliberate walk towards him with calculated steps. Inside her overly pink office, Umbridge meticulously counts out three spoonfuls of pale pink sugar, adding each to a china cup adorned with pink roses. Her movement is accompanied by the subtle sound of cats that eerily move across the china plates on the wall, as she stirs her tea with an air of contentment. Placing the cup down with care, she briefly touches a pen on her desk, rearranging it before selecting a curled brown quill with a slight flourish, which she then sets in front of Harry. Harry, upon entering the office, can't help but notice the peculiar plates on the wall and a white cat with an intense gaze directed at him. Umbridge turns her head towards the window, her expression softening into a smile of secret pleasure. Harry, slightly unnerved yet curious, begins to write using the quill in his right hand. To his astonishment, the words he writes appear in vivid red upon the parchment. Umbridge's smile widens as Harry's face contorts in a wince of pain; angry red lines cut into the back of his left hand, leaving words etched into his skin. Harry's gaze shifts to the quill, his disbelief evident, as Umbridge, with an air of smug satisfaction, stands before him, her eyebrows raised in a gesture of mock innocence. Despite the pain, Harry meets her gaze head-on, not flinching as he blinks firmly while she leans forward, reveling in the moment. Meanwhile, Fred and George enthusiastically experiment with their latest inventions, their excitement filling the air. Ron and Hermione sit close to Harry, who is seated with a book in hand. As he turns the page, he silently stretches out his right hand to show Hermione the faded scars, her eyes tracing over the marks with concern. As if a switch had been flipped, Harry gets up without a word, leaving Hermione and Ron sitting there, their expressions a mix of confusion and worry as they watch him depart. Outside, Hedwig, Harry's loyal owl, gracefully takes flight from the familiar spires of Hogwarts, her wings cutting through the sky. Harry finds himself standing before Hagrid's deserted cottage, his eyes scanning the surroundings until they catch sight of a large winged creature majestically swooping into the depths of the Forbidden Forest. Driven by curiosity and solitude, he wanders deeper into the woods until he stumbles upon an extraordinary sight: a group of horse-like creatures with huge, bat-like wings pulling a carriage. Captivated, he watches a girl gently stroke the nose of one of these fantastical creatures, a serene interaction amidst the surrounding mystery."

Before Ron departs, leaving Harry alone to wrestle with his thoughts, Harry sits on his bed, staring into space and twisting and flexing his neck to alleviate the tension building up from endless worries. He lies in a black tiled corridor, reminiscent of the cold and sterile hallways of a forgotten institution, with a mysterious blue door at the end that seems to call to him, tossing and turning in his sleep as veins twist under his skin like dark serpents. The image of the black corridor and the blue door reappears vividly, followed by a haunting glass sphere and a bony hand, symbols of ominous omens from his past.

Seamus attempts to swipe at it, but the bird eludes capture, flying out of reach and soaring around the classroom as Crabbe, notorious for his mischievous antics, aims his catapult with mischievous intent. The bird hovers briefly before bursting into flames as Professor Umbridge, notorious for her authoritarian rule at Hogwarts, lowers her wand, executing her power over the room, and causes books to distribute themselves on the students' desks with a sickly smile that chills the air. Students nervously lower their eyes, avoiding her steely gaze, and Umbridge, dressed in her customary pink cardigan, searches for words while glancing around the classroom, slowly walking towards Harry with deliberate steps. Inside her pink office, a room filled with an unsettling number of feline-related decorations, Umbridge puts three spoonfuls of pale pink sugar into a china cup decorated with pink roses, a testament to her obsession with all things pink, while enchanted cats move on the china plates on the wall, and she stirs her tea with palpable contentment. Umbridge puts down the cup, touches a pen on her ornate desk, and places a curled brown quill known for its sinister magic in front of Harry as he enters, noticing the plates on the wall and a white cat staring at him with unnerving stillness. She looks out the window, catching a glimpse of the vast Hogwarts grounds, and smiles with secret anticipation as Harry writes with the quill in his right hand, surprised to see the words, etched in a painful red reminiscent of blood, appear on the paper. Umbridge smiles as Harry winces in pain, feeling the angry red arcs appear on the back of his left hand as words are cut into his skin like a cruel reminder of her power. Harry looks at the quill in disbelief, understanding its dark magic, while Umbridge stands in front of him, smiling sweetly with raised eyebrows that suggest concealed malice. Harry boldly meets her gaze, blinks, and she leans over him with satisfaction, her authority momentarily unchallenged. Meanwhile, Fred and George, known for their inventive spirit and mischievous pranks, try out their latest inventions with gleeful mischief as Ron and Hermione sit beside Harry, who turns a page of his ancient book on magical creatures, shows his right hand, and Hermione looks at the scars, a testament to their shared struggles. Harry walks off, leaving Hermione and Ron looking bewildered by his quiet determination, as his owl, Hedwig, a loyal and intelligent companion, flies away from the towering spires of Hogwarts. Harry stands outside Hagrid's deserted cottage, where memories of friendship linger, spots a large winged creature swooping into the mysterious depths of the Forbidden Forest, and wanders alone until he sees a group of Thestrals, ethereal horse-like creatures visible only to those who have witnessed death, pulling a carriage with huge bat-like wings.

          "description": "Bernard nudges his suitcase, leaving Tim bewildered before Tim saunters away, leaving Bernard in solitude. Bernard perches on his sofa, gazing at the ceiling and wriggling and bending his fingers. He reclines in a white carpeted hallway with a red gate at the end, flipping and flopping in his nap as tendrils coil over his frame. The vision of the white hallway and the red gate resurfaces, followed by a ceramic cube and a skeletal toe. Bernard awakens soaked with water, noticing Tim observing him with puzzlement. In a workshop, a boy propels a green rubber ball that morphs into a complex rubber butterfly that flaps its legs. Brendan attempts to snatch at it, but the butterfly glides beyond grasp, gliding around the workshop as Goyle aims his slingshot. The butterfly floats before exploding into sparks as Instructor Fudge lowers his baton, aims it, and causes scrolls to scatter themselves on the apprentices' benches with an unhealthy grin. Apprentices nervously avert their gazes, and Fudge searches for phrases while peering around the workshop and leisurely walking towards Bernard. Inside his lavender cubicle, Fudge puts three servings of bright yellow spice into a porcelain mug embellished with yellow lilies while dogs animate on the porcelain platters on the partition and he stirs his drink. Fudge sets down the mug, taps a ruler on his counter, and places a coiled golden pencil in front of Bernard as he steps in, noticing the platters on the partition and a spotted fish glaring at him. He peers out the porthole and grins with hidden eagerness as Bernard scribbles with the pencil in his left hand, astounded to see the symbols appear on the sheet in green. Fudge grins as Bernard flinches in discomfort as furious green spirals surface on the back of his right hand and symbols are etched into his skin. Bernard stares at the pencil in incredulity while Fudge stands before him, grinning tenderly with raised lashes. Bernard bravely holds her stare, nods, as she stoops over him with contentment. Meanwhile, Phil and George test their creations as Tim and Fiona sit beside Bernard, who flips a chapter of his tome, displays his left hand, and Fiona inspects the imprints. Bernard strolls away, leaving Fiona and Tim looking dumbfounded as his parrot, Wisdom, glides away from Llamalot. Bernard stands beside Edward’s vacant hut, spots a massive feathered beast gliding into the Cursed Meadow, and roams alone until he notices a lineup of zebra-like beasts hauling a wagon with immense moth-like limbs. A boy is patting the forehead of one of them."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
