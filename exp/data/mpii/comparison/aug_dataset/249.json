Like an imaginative young girl lost in a game of make-believe, pretending to be a cowboy, she carefully spreads the tobacco onto a piece of rolling paper, skillfully imitating the same process she observed him perform earlier. With precision, she moistens the edge of the paper with her tongue and adeptly rolls it into an impressively decent cigarette.

Mia feels an overwhelming joy, her heart swelling with satisfaction.\n\nIn her moment of triumph, she eagerly brings the robust flame to her well-crafted cigarette, setting it ablaze with a sense of accomplishment, and then audibly snaps the lighter shut with a flourish. The cigarette, a product of her own creation, is lifted to her lips, and she indulges in a long, smooth drag. With all the grace in the world, her hand returns the Zippo to the overcoat's pocket, but there's a pause as her fingers come into contact with another object. Curiosity piqued, her fingers retrieve a small plastic bag containing a white powder—the very same illicit substance that Vincent had previously acquired from Lance. Mia’s face lights up with an innocent yet wide smile as she holds the bag of heroin close to her face, unaware of its dangerous contents.\n\nShe unwittingly and meticulously arranges the heroin into substantial lines on the pristine glass top of her coffee table. Armed with her reliable, rolled-up hundred dollar bill, she leans forward like a human Dust-Buster and rapidly inhales the hefty line. The instant reaction is visceral; her head snaps back, while her hands instinctively clutch at her nose, which now feels as though it is engulfed in flames. It becomes painfully evident that something is gravely amiss. Meanwhile, Vincent is nearby, drying his hands with a towel, engaged in an ongoing dialogue with his reflection in the mirror. \n\nMia, in a desperate state, finds herself on all fours, struggling to crawl towards the sanctuary of the bathroom. It's as if she is attempting to move without the bones in her knees, making her progress slow and ungainly. Blood starts to trickle from her nose, and in a grim, synchronized reaction, her stomach rebels, causing her to vomit. Vincent remains preoccupied, as the disturbing scene unfolds—blood and vomit staining her front and her face contorting into a slack-jawed expression. \n\nIn a different part of the house, Lance abandons his half-eaten cereal and hastens towards the phone.

Lance quickly moves from the window to the door leading out to his front lawn, and by the time he arrives, Vincent is already there, frantically working to extract Mia from the car. \n\nThe scene shifts to the bedroom shared by Lance and Jody, where Jody, still in bed, discards the covers and stands, clad in an oversized tee-shirt adorned with an image of Fred Flintstone. As she makes her way into the living room, her eyes fall upon Vincent and Lance, standing over Mia, who is now lying prone on the floor at the center of the room.

Her quest is successful as she retrieves his treasured pouch of tobacco, a cherished item he holds dear. Much like an imaginative young girl immersed in a whimsical game of make-believe, fantasizing about being a cowboy in a dramatic Western saga, she deftly spreads the tobacco out onto a piece of rolling paper. All the while, she expertly mimics the process she had observed him perform with such skill earlier. With precise care, she wets the edge of the paper with her tongue and deftly rolls it into an impressively substantial cigarette. Her hand journeys back into the pocket once more, this time bringing forth his trusty Zippo lighter, which he frequently relies upon. In a playful manner, she slaps it against her leg, endeavoring to ignite it with the same flashy, stylish flair that Vince always employed, and, to her great delight and amazement, she is victorious! This triumph fills Mia with an overwhelming joy, her heart swelling with pure satisfaction.\n\nIn this jubilant moment of success, she eagerly positions the robust flame near her meticulously crafted cigarette, setting it ablaze with a profound sense of accomplishment and satisfaction. She then audibly snaps the lighter shut with a flourish, adding a final touch of style to her actions. The cigarette, a creation she has crafted all on her own, is lifted gently to her lips, and she indulges in a long, smooth drag with elegance. With utmost grace, her hand returns the Zippo lighter to the overcoat’s pocket, but there is a momentary pause as her fingers brush against an unexpected object. Curiosity is piqued, and her fingers retrieve a small plastic bag containing a white powder—the very same illicit substance that Vincent had previously obtained from Lance. Mia’s face lights up with a wide, innocent smile, holding the bag of heroin close to her face, completely unaware of the perilous nature of its contents.\n\nUnwittingly, she meticulously lines up the heroin into substantial lines on the pristine glass surface of her coffee table. Equipped with her ever-reliable, rolled-up hundred dollar bill, she leans forward like a human vacuum and rapidly inhales the hefty line. The instantaneous reaction is visceral; her head snaps back with force, while her hands instinctively clutch at her nose, which now feels as if it is engulfed in searing flames. It quickly becomes painfully clear that something has gone gravely wrong. Meanwhile, Vincent is positioned nearby, drying his hands with a towel, engaged in an ongoing conversation with his own reflection in the mirror.\n\nMia, now in a desperate state of distress, finds herself struggling on all fours, attempting to crawl toward the safety and sanctuary of the bathroom. It's as if she is attempting to propel herself forward without the support of bones in her knees, making her movements slow and awkward. Blood begins to trickle from her nose, and in a grim, synchronized reaction, her stomach violently rebels, causing her to vomit. Vincent remains preoccupied and unaware as the distressing scene unfolds—blood and vomit leaving a harsh stain on her front, while her face contorts into a pained, slack-jawed expression.\n\nElsewhere in the house, Lance hastily abandons his half-eaten bowl of cereal and rushes to his phone. In the background, his wife Jody calls out from the bedroom, her voice carrying the weight of someone rudely awakened from slumber. Lance quickly moves from the window to the door that leads out to his front lawn, and by the time he reaches it, Vincent is already there, frantically working to extricate Mia from the car.\n\nThe scene shifts to the bedroom shared by Lance and Jody, where Jody, still nestled in bed, discards the covers and stands. She is clad in an oversized tee-shirt adorned with the cartoon image of Fred Flintstone. As she ventures into the living room, her eyes fall upon Vincent and Lance, who stand over Mia, now lying prone on the floor at the center of the room.

Channeling the whimsical spirit of a little girl play-acting as a cowboy, she carefully spreads the tobacco across a piece of rolling paper, mirroring the steps she had observed him perform earlier. Her tongue delicately wets the edge of the paper, which she then skillfully rolls into a cigarette that turns out surprisingly well-formed. Her fingers dive back into the coat pocket and emerge clutching his Zippo lighter. With a playful slap against her leg, she attempts to ignite it with the same flair as Vince had shown, and to her delight, the flame springs to life on the first try. Brimming with satisfaction, Mia raises the lighter, the robust flame meeting the end of her freshly rolled cigarette, and as the tobacco begins to burn, she confidently snaps the Zippo shut with a loud click. Bringing the Mia-crafted cigarette to her lips, she inhales deeply, relishing the coolness of the smoke. As she returns the Zippo to the pocket, her fingers brush against another object. Curiosity piqued, she extracts a small plastic bag filled with white powder, unknowingly holding the heroin Vincent had acquired from Lance. With an innocent grin, Mia brings the bag closer to inspect it, still unaware of its true nature. She proceeds to cut the contents into thick lines on her glass coffee table, employing a hundred-dollar bill as her tool. In one swift motion, she leans forward and snorts the hefty line, only to jerk her head back violently as her senses are overwhelmed by a searing pain in her nose; something is alarmingly amiss. While Vincent nonchalantly dries his hands with a towel, maintaining a conversation with his reflection, Mia struggles on all fours, attempting to reach the bathroom, but her movements are awkward, as though her knees have lost their structure. Blood starts to trickle from her nose, and her stomach revolts, leading to a bout of vomiting. Vincent remains preoccupied as Mia's condition deteriorates, her face now marked by a mix of blood, vomit, and a slack-jawed expression. Meanwhile, Lance halts mid-bite of his cereal, leaving his breakfast behind as he heads towards the phone, responding to the escalating crisis. In another part of the house, Jody is roused from her sleep by the commotion, calling out from the bedroom. Lance discards his cereal and dashes through the door to the front lawn, where Vincent is already out of the car, urgently working to extract Mia. The scene shifts to Lance and Jody's bedroom, where Jody, clothed in a long tee-shirt depicting Fred Flintstone, throws off the covers and rises. She moves into the living room only to find Vincent and Lance standing over Mia, who is now sprawled on the floor at the center of the room. From this moment, the atmosphere is charged with a sense of urgency akin to an emergency room in crisis, yet the stark reality is that everyone is navigating blindly. Lance's gaze meets Jody's before he rushes out of the living room and into a cluttered room filled with miscellaneous items, searching for a solution amidst the chaos."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
