In the infirmary, Ginny and Hermione perch beside Ron's bed as Madam Pomfrey examines his temperature. Harry rotates as a cluster of staff enter, and Lavender dashes in. She notices Hermione at Ron's bedside and inclines nearer before running out as Hermione grasps Ron's hand. McGonagall, Dumbledore, and Snape depart, followed by Ginny turning to Harry and Madame Pomfrey exiting. Hermione captures Harry's gaze, and they swap a grin. Harry is the final to exit the ward. Sitting on Ron's bed, Hermione fortifies her grip on his hand with a breath of satisfaction. The silhouette of a shape ascending stairs is cast on a partition. Ascending the spiral staircase, Harry glimpses the figure through an archway: it's Draco Malfoy. Harry advances, observes him, and then trails. Draco exits the upper hallway where the birdcage dangles, now with solely one bird remaining. Draco halts and shuts his eyes. When Harry rounds the corner, Draco has vanished. In the crowded chamber, Draco clutches the dense fabric from the cupboard, holding the missing bird. He closes the bird inside the cupboard, plucks a lone feather off his sleeve, and holds it up to the brightness. Draco opens the cupboard: the bird has departed. Precipitation cascades down on the Borgin and Burke shop sign. Through the dusty arched window at the back of the shop, a faint light unveils the triangular cupboard, its door securely shut. Draco apprehensively opens his cupboard door, peers inside, and discovers the bird dead. Draco gazes at its motionless form and scowls, then weeps. Lavender perches in the Great Hall glaring at Ron. Gripping his wand, he perches beside Hermione, as snowflakes commence to descend. Ron appears bewildered. Ron, Hermione, and Harry gaze across at Lavender, who lifts her chin and grits her teeth. Harry's eyes dart from Ron to Hermione and back again, while Hermione glances down. Harry reads a note scribbled in his advanced concoction volume, leaps to his feet, picks up his volume, then strides up the hall to Katie. She peeks over his shoulder and stares. Harry rotates and notices Draco observing them. Draco withdraws, rotates, and Harry's out. Katie strides away with her companion as Harry strides down the Great Hall. Draco maneuvers his way upstairs. Harry pushes his way through a group of pupils as Draco strides along the upstairs corridor where the birdcage is now vacant. Harry isn't far behind. Loosening his tie, Draco rushes into the boy’s lavatories, leans over a basin, then pulls off his jumper. Activating a faucet, he examines his distraught visage in a mirror."

          "description": "Snufflefoot lounges on a hammock, feeling jubilant. Finally, Steve leaps over, stands up, then collapses lightly on the ceiling. In the gallery, Megan and Barbara float beneath Steve's hammock as Sir Wilson measures his patience. Larry spins as a pack of sailors sails in, and Matilda charges in. She notices Barbara at Steve's headrest and drifts nearer before gliding away as Barbara grasps Steve's foot. Mabunda, Eisenhower, and Smith depart, trailed by Megan flicking an eyebrow at Larry and Sir Wilson drifting away. Barbara catches Larry's frown, and they share a grin. Larry is the first to arrive at the paddock. Perched on Steve's elbow, Barbara loosens her grip on his elbow with a sigh of relief. The light of a chimera leaping roofs is cast on a cloud. Floating down the circular trunk, Larry glimpses the chimera through a tunnel: it's Luigi Ricardo. Larry hops backward, observes him, and then trails. Luigi exits the lower passage where the aquarium floats, now with only one fish remaining. Luigi stands moving and shuts his mouth. When Larry rounds the edge, Luigi has appeared. In the organized space, Luigi balances the light fabric from the dresser, balancing the existing fish. He opens the fish inside the dresser, selects a single scale off his hat, and balances it down to the dark. Luigi closes the dresser: the fish has appeared. Sunlight bursts up on the Fitz and Furley boat banner. Through the misty circular port at the front of the boat, a bright sound hides the rectangular dresser, its lid slightly ajar. Luigi confidently closes his dresser lid, gazes outward, and loses the fish alive. Luigi grins at its vibrant scales and cheers, then laughs. Matilda floats in the Large House smiling at Steve. Cradling his hat, he floats beside Barbara, as rainbows begin to splash. Steve smiles delighted. Steve, Barbara, and Larry beam across at Matilda, who drops her mouth and relaxes her arms. Larry's ears bounce from Steve to Barbara and across again, while Barbara stares high. Larry writes a song inscribed in his simple map hat, floats onto his hands, places down his hat, then twirls down the room to Martha. She gazes under his eyelid and beams. Larry spins and hears Luigi hiding from them. Luigi steps forward, spins, and Larry's in. Martha drifts forward with her parrot as Larry twirls up the Small House. Luigi drifts his path downward. Larry pulls his way out of a crowd of teachers as Luigi dances along the downstairs hallway where the aquarium is now packed. Larry is close ahead. Tightening his shoes, Luigi saunters out of the children’s cathedral, floats under a fountain, then tugs on his vest. Dimming on a light, he examines his joyful hair in a wall."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
