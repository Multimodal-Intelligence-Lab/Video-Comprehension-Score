Together, they gazed down with solemnity at the motionless dog laying there. Seeking to offer some comfort, Graham gently places his hand upon Morgan's shoulder, yet Morgan, heavy with emotion and burdened by her feelings, brushes it aside and slowly trudges away, her heart weighed down with sorrow. Graham then approaches the climbing frame and directs a searching look at Bo, who remains snugly curled up in a very small, tight ball, her gaze fixed intently on the ground beneath her. He gently lifts her from the platform, cradling her tenderly against his shoulder, and carries a weary Bo back toward the farmhouse, arriving just as Merrill emerges, holding a bowl in one hand and a bag of animal feed in the other. Graham proceeds past him, making his way up the steps and onto the wide, welcoming veranda, before stepping through the front door of the house. Merrill turns his head to glance over at the climbing frame with a look of bewilderment; a man in his early 30s, he has short dark hair and possesses a youthful, boyish face. After placing the bag of feed down, Merrill unties Isabel, the other Alsatian, from where she is secured to the veranda steps and leads her across the yard. Meanwhile, Caroline retrieves the barbecue fork, pulling it from Houdini's throat. A wire wind chime, crafted with artistic flair in the shape of a beaming sun, gracefully swings and sways mournfully in the gentle breeze. That evening, the farmhouse is enveloped in profound darkness beneath a vast, unending, black sky. Graham lies on his side in bed, his eyes suddenly snapping open to stare ahead intently; nearby, Bo stares at him with an intense gaze. Graham quietly pads across the landing, holding Bo's hand gently, as they together reach the open bedroom door and step into the dimly lit room. There, Morgan lies awkwardly half off his bed in a disheveled, uncomfortable heap. Bo shuffles off to her own bed, and Graham tenderly lifts Morgan, settling him comfortably on his back before crossing the bedroom to sit beside Bo on her bed. He gazes intently at her, taking in the sight of her wide, bright eyes, and a somber sadness descends upon Graham's face.

In an attempt to comfort him, Graham gently places his hand on Morgan's shoulder, but Morgan, overwhelmed and resolute, brushes the comforting gesture aside and solemnly trudges away, each step heavy with sadness. Meanwhile, Graham approaches the climbing frame with a searching look, his eyes landing on Bo, who remains curled into a tight ball, her gaze locked onto the ground below her. With a tender and careful movement, he gently lifts Bo off the platform and nestles her against his shoulder, ensuring she feels secure in his hold. Carrying her back to the farmhouse, they pass Merrill, who emerges from within, holding a bowl and a bag of feed in his hands. As Graham walks past, he ascends the steps to the veranda and steps through the front door into the house's comforting interior. Merrill, momentarily confused, shifts his gaze to the climbing frame, his boyish features caught in contemplation as he stands in his early 30s, with short dark hair. He sets down the bag of feed and proceeds to untie Isabel, the other Alsatian, from where she is secured to the veranda steps, leading her gently across the yard. During this time, Caroline removes the barbecue fork lodged in Houdini's throat with careful deliberation. A wire wind chime, crafted in the likeness of a beaming sun, hangs from the veranda and swings mournfully in the soft breeze, adding a melancholic note to the scene. As night falls, darkness envelops the farmhouse beneath a vast black sky. In this stillness, Graham lies on his side in bed, his eyes abruptly opening, gazing into the distance as Bo watches him intently. Quietly, Graham rises and, holding Bo's hand, pads across the landing toward the children's bedroom. They reach the open door and step into the dimly lit room, where Morgan lies half off his bed in an uncomfortable heap. Bo quietly shuffles off to her own bed while Graham tenderly lifts Morgan, repositioning him gently onto his back for a more restful sleep. He then crosses the bedroom to sit beside Bo on her bed, taking a moment to gaze at her. His eyes trace her face as she regards him with wide, bright eyes, her innocence a stark contrast to the sadness that descends upon Graham's features. Looking from her to the bedroom window, his attention is caught by a shadowy figure standing by a chimney pot on the barn roof. Startled, Graham jumps to his feet and quietly makes his way downstairs to the lounge, where Merrill is slumbering in an armchair. Graham lightly touches Merrill's shoulder, rousing him from sleep, and Merrill looks up at his brother with confusion etched on his face. Together, they stand by the front door, where Merrill opens it, triggering an outside light that floods the entrance as they rush out, instinctively splitting up to cover more ground. Merrill circles to the back of the house just as a dust bin tips over ahead of him, creating a sudden clatter. Simultaneously, Graham sprints along the side of the house, and the two brothers eventually converge at the front. They halt momentarily, scanning their surroundings with bated breath before a noise from the roof captures their attention. Merrill fixates on the farmhouse roof, stepping backward into the shadowy yard to gain a clearer view, his eyes never leaving the mysterious commotion above."

Graham steps up to the climbing frame, a rusting relic from when the playground was first built in the 1970s, and looks searchingly at Bo, who remains in a tight ball, staring down at the ground; he gently lifts her off the platform and holds her against his shoulder, carrying Bo back to the old clapboard farmhouse, built by their grandfather, as Merrill emerges, carrying a bowl and a bag of feed meant for the chickens they keep in a coop at the edge of the yard. Graham walks past him, climbs onto the creaky wooden veranda, and walks through the front door of the house. Merrill looks over to the climbing frame with a confused expression; he's in his early 30s with short dark hair and a boyish face that often betrays his serious demeanor.

A shadowy figure stands by a chimney pot on the barn roof, and Graham jumps to his feet, his heart pounding with an unexpected surge of adrenaline. Downstairs in the lounge, Merrill is asleep in an armchair when Graham touches his shoulder, waking Merrill, who looks up at his brother in confusion, still half-dreaming of their childhood escapades.

Merrill comes to the back of the house as a dust bin is tipped over up ahead, while Graham runs along the side of the house, and the brothers meet up again at the front of the house. They stop and look around breathlessly when a sound on the roof of the house, likely the mischievous raccoons known to scavenge in the area, attracts their attention; Merrill keeps his gaze fixed firmly on the farmhouse roof as he paces backwards down the gloomy yard, trying to get a better view under the pale light of the full moon."

Caroline strolls past him, jumps onto the steps, and glides through the back door of the home. Jack peers over to the swing set with a puzzled look; he's in his late 20s with long blonde hair and an innocent demeanor.

Merrill glances over to the slide with a bewildered expression; he's in his early 30s with long blond hair and a puppy-like face.

Leslie skips past him, jumps onto the patio, and skips through the side window of the cabin. Alex glances over to the bouncy castle with a puzzled grin; he's in his late 40s with long blond curls and an elderly face. Alex drops the jar of marbles and unties Hector, the other poodle, from the patio railing, guiding her through the lot as Danielle extracts the skewer from Ringo's paw. A wooden bell in the shape of a smiling star dangles on the patio and swings joyfully in the gentle gust. That evening, the cabin stands in brightness beneath a white moon. Leslie lies on his back in bed, his ears suddenly closed as he squints up; Max peers at him.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby cafÃ©, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
