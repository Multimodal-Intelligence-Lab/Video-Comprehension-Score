His shoes are grabbed, thrown on, and the bedroom is hurried out of by him, as the driveway is run across to the garage. There, two cars are found: Mulwray's Buick and Evelyn's Packard. Over to the Buick, Gittes moves, opens the passenger's door, and a kick is given to the right rear taillight of the car with the heel of his shoe, causing the red lens to shatter.

With a sense of immediacy, she strides swiftly toward the bathroom, her thoughts racing. Abruptly, she pauses in her tracks, turns back with deliberate intent, and kneels gently beside the bed. With a tender, caring touch, she takes Gittes' hand into her own, looking at him intently. In response to her actions, Gittes, with equal swiftness, leaps out of the bed himself, frantically searching for his scattered clothes in a bit of a frenzy. He quickly tosses on his trousers in haste, grabs hold of his shoes with determination, and hurriedly slips them onto his feet. With time pressing heavily upon them, he rushes out of the bedroom, sprinting directly across the driveway with purpose to reach the garage's location. Inside the spacious garage, two distinct cars are neatly parked: Mulwray's Buick and Evelyn's elegant Packard. Gittes makes a quick, decisive move toward the Buick, opening the passenger door with clear intent in his eyes. Utilizing the heel of his shoe, he kicks forcefully at the right rear taillight of the car, shattering the red lens into pieces. Proceeding with caution and precision, he rises, meticulously removing the broken red lens from the taillight, thereby revealing the white light underneath. He casually tosses the shattered remnants of the red lens into the thick surrounding shrubbery and hurries back toward the house with unwavering determination and swift steps. Meanwhile, Evelyn's car is speeding along the winding, serpentine curves of Sunset Boulevard, with the alternating red and white lights flickering and disappearing intermittently from view. Gittes diligently follows closely behind the wheel of Mulwray's car, carefully maintaining a safe and prudent distance from Evelyn, who is ahead of him on the road. Eventually, he pulls up in front of a modest-looking bungalow house, as Evelyn hurriedly makes her way up the walkway toward the front entrance. Gittes drives the car a few more yards further down the street, carefully parking it near Evelyn's vehicle, allowing the engine to idle quietly with the headlights turned off to avoid drawing attention. He steps out of the car cautiously and walks deliberately up the walkway to the house, where the curtains are tightly drawn, except for one of the small windows on the side. He approaches it with a sense of curiosity and peers inside, balancing precariously on the edge of the porch for a better view. Through his careful observation, he sees Evelyn's Oriental servant rushing through the living room of the small house, where the blinds are pulled down, blocking most of the view. In search of a clearer line of sight, he moves over to a window where the blinds are not entirely drawn down, finding a narrow inch or so of space at the bottom that offers a different perspective. Evelyn is pacing back and forth incessantly, moving in and out of his line of vision without ceasing. After a brief moment passes, someone comes into view, rising from what seems to be a supine position on a bed: Mulwray's girlfriend, just a few feet away from Evelyn in close proximity. Her face, stained with tears, becomes visible as Evelyn kneels beside her, and the girl looks up at Evelyn, speaking softly in Spanish, her words filled with emotion. Gittes continues to watch intently and observes as the servant comes back through the living room, carrying a tray that holds a glass and a pitcher, moving with practiced ease. Evelyn insists that the girl take some pills, which the girl reluctantly swallows with hesitation, before emerging from the house, making her way over to her car, and getting inside. Evelyn then notices Gittes sitting in her car, his gaze fixed coldly and intensely upon her. As Gittes begins to exit the car with a sense of resolve, Evelyn frantically grabs his arm with urgency, nearly screaming with such intensity that she ends up tearing Gittes' already partially torn jacket even further. He looks at the damage with slight astonishment and then turns his gaze toward her, which has an unexpectedly calming effect on both of them, albeit only for a moment. Finally, Evelyn's head sinks heavily onto the steering wheel, her silky hair cascading down to obscure her face from view, creating a veil of privacy even in their shared presence."

Evelyn then makes a quick dash toward the bathroom, only to abruptly reverse her course and return to the bed's edge, where she kneels, her fingers tenderly wrapping around Gittes' hand in a moment of heartfelt connection. Responding to her presence, he promptly springs out of bed as well, his movements hurried as he frantically searches through his belongings, eventually finding and pulling on his trousers with quick precision. He swiftly scoops up his shoes, hurriedly dons them, and rushes out of the bedroom, his strides turning into a sprint as he traverses the driveway leading to the garage. Inside the garage, he encounters two vehicles: Mulwray's Buick and Evelyn's Packard. With a decisive motion, Gittes approaches the Buick, opens the passenger door with an assertive tug, and delivers a forceful kick to the right rear taillight using the heel of his shoe, causing the red lens to shatter into pieces. Rising from his crouch, he carefully removes the remaining fragments of the red lens, revealing the bright white light underneath, and discards the broken pieces into a nearby cluster of shrubbery before making a hurried return to the house. Meanwhile, Evelyn is navigating her car along the winding paths of Sunset Boulevard, the vehicle's red and white lights intermittently visible in the night, as Gittes follows in Mulwray's car, maintaining a cautious distance between their two vehicles. He eventually brings the Buick to a stop in front of a modest bungalow house, watching as Evelyn hastily makes her way up the walkway to the front door. Choosing a spot a few yards further down the street, Gittes parks the car near Evelyn's, allowing the engine to idle quietly with the lights switched off. Exiting the car, he treads up the walkway where the curtains are drawn tight, save for a small, uncovered window on the side of the house. Balancing precariously on the edge of the porch, he peers through this window, observing the flurry of activity inside. Inside, Evelyn's Oriental servant is seen rushing through the living room, a space where the windows are shielded by blinds. Gittes shifts his position to a window where the blind is not fully closed, finding a narrow gap of mere inches at the bottom. Through this slender opening, he watches Evelyn pacing back and forth, her movements intermittently disappearing from his line of sight. His attention is soon drawn to the rising figure of Mulwray's girlfriend, who emerges into view from a previously reclining position on a bed. Her face is stained with tears as Evelyn kneels beside her, engaging in a conversation conducted in Spanish. Gittes continues to watch the scene unfold as the servant reappears in the living room, this time carrying a tray laden with a glass and pitcher. Evelyn's insistence grows as she urges the girl to swallow down some pills, which the girl does so reluctantly. Emerging from the house, she heads toward her car and gets in, only to find Gittes already seated there, his gaze fixed on her with a piercing coldness. As Gittes makes a move to exit the car, Evelyn reacts with urgency, grabbing his arm with such vehement force that it nearly results in her screaming, the action effectively completing the tear across the already partially ripped fabric of Gittes' jacket. Their attention momentarily diverted to the jacket, a shared sense of calm washes over them, however brief. In the aftermath, Evelyn's head sinks forward onto the steering wheel, her hair cascading over her face in a curtain of disarray."

Then he leaps out of bed, rummages around the vintage furniture in the bedroom, and tosses on his trousers, tailored by a renowned Los Angeles tailor. He grabs his shoes, throws them on, and hurries out of the bedroom, running across the driveway, which is lined with now-blooming rose bushes, to the garage.

          "description": "He tumbles out of the hammock, donning a poncho. Oliver dashes leisurely for the pantry, then returns and sits by the side of the hammock, gripping Harper's foot. Then she tumbles out of the hammock, digs around, and flings on her trousers. She snatches her sandals, slips them on, and meanders out of the den, strolling across the courtyard to the shed. There are two bicycles there: Thompson's Schwinn and Oliver's Raleigh. Harper shifts over to the Schwinn, unlatches the compartment door, and stomps at the left front reflector of the bicycle with the toe of her boot, cracking the blue casing. She rises, gingerly removes the blue casing off the reflector, revealing the yellow glow beneath it, flings the blue casing into the flowerbed, and saunters back toward the barn. Oliver's bicycle glides along the twists on Elm Street, the blue and yellow glimmers popping in and out of sight, with Harper behind the handlebars of Thompson's bicycle, maintaining a cautious gap from Oliver ahead of her. She coasts up before a quaint cabin porch, and he rushes up the path to the main entrance, while she directs the bicycle a few feet further down the road, parking it beside Oliver's, and lets the gears idle with the lanterns off. Harper hops off the bicycle and strides up the path, where the shutters are closed except for one of the narrow apertures on the back of the cabin. She approaches it and peeks, balancing on the edge of the stoop, and glimpses Oliver's French cook bustling through the sitting room of the quaint cabin, where the apertures have screens. She shifts to one where the screen is not completely shut, discovering a sliver of room at the base. Oliver is striding to and fro in and out of her line of sight. Suddenly, someone springs into view, clearly from resting on a loveseat: Thompson's companion, mere inches from Oliver. Her sorrowful expression comes into focus as Oliver sits, and the companion gazes up to Oliver, conversing in Mandarin. Harper continues to gaze as the cook reappears through the sitting room carrying a platter with a cup and jug on it. Oliver insists that the companion gulp down some tablets, which the companion hesitantly does, before departing the cabin, heading to his bicycle, and hopping on. Oliver notices Harper seated on her bicycle, glaring icily at him. As Harper aims to step off the bicycle, Oliver seizes his wrist, almost shrieking, with his fervor actually tearing Harper's already partially frayed coat. She gazes at it and him, which has a fleeting soothing effect on both of them, before Oliver's chin lowers onto the handlebars, his locks veiling his eyes."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

He breaks the taillight of Mulwray's Buick, discards the red lens, and follows Evelyn, who drives her Packard along Sunset Boulevard. Gittes maintains a distance behind her in Mulwray's car. Evelyn stops at a bungalow, and Gittes discreetly observes through a window. Inside, Evelyn's servant hurries through the living room, while Evelyn paces, speaking to Mulwray's tearful girlfriend in Spanish. She insists the girl take some pills. Evelyn leaves the house and sees Gittes in her car. When Gittes exits, Evelyn intensely grabs his arm, tearing his jacket. They both calm momentarily before Evelyn collapses onto the steering wheel, her hair obscuring her face."
