Hi and Ed watch intently, their heads following the sun's slow downward arc, savoring the tranquility. As the amber light transitions to a more neutral dusky hue with the sun's disappearance, Hi and Ed continue to stare at the point where it vanished, holding onto the moment. The dusk eventually gives way to darkness, enveloping the scene in pitch black, while crickets chirp softly from the shadows, adding a serene soundtrack. Ed, marking the passage of time, crosses off the last day on the calendar before a day circled in red, signifying anticipation. Hi enters wearily after a long day at work, clutching his lunch pail, his fatigue evident.

Hi and Ed watch, their heads following its slow downward arc. The amber turns to a more neutral dusky light as the sun sets, and Hi and Ed continue to stare at the point where it disappeared, losing themselves in the tranquility of the fading day. The dusk slips away into darkness, and we are by now holding on pitch black. Crickets chirp from the darkness, their song a familiar nighttime serenade. Ed crosses off the last day on the calendar, a methodical countdown to a significant event, before a day circled in red as Hi wearily enters after a long day at work, clutching his lunch pail filled with the remnants of a hastily packed meal.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
