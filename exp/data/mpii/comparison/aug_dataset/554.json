After a breath of relief, Indy stands in a diminutive aperture leading to a 100-foot plunge and a vista of a rocky escarpment wall 100 feet across, with no evident method to traverse. He glances to the Grail Diary for counsel, then perceives a lion's head etched in the stone above. Indy calls to his offspring, jumps into void, and dangles in midair. Realizing the clever First Crusaders have depicted a walkway in enforced perspective to merge with the rocks below, Indy hurls soil on the overpass and traverses it like the original Crusader in the artwork over Henry's desk. Indy wriggles through a small cliff aperture and enters a sanctuary with a vast assortment of chalices in numerous dimensions, formations, gold, and silver. He observes a man supplicating at the altar with his back turned, clad as a Grail Knight, though the knight's visage is unseen. The Grail Knight tiredly prepares for battle, maneuvering a dual-handed longsword, but struggles with its burden. Indy evades the awkward slices until the fatigued knight collapses. Indy elevates the knight's visor, unveiling a very old man, who reaches for Indy's garments and offers his sword. At that moment, Donovan and Elsa emerge, and Donovan turns to the display of receptacles while Elsa and Indy exchange glances. Elsa chooses a solid gold, emerald-studded chalice, which Donovan seizes, fills with liquid, and consumes. Donovan's body then begins to shudder."

In search of guidance, Indy consults the Grail Diary in his possession and soon notices a lion's head inscribed in the rock positioned above him. Without a moment's hesitation, Indy calls out to his son and bravely takes a daring leap into what appears to be empty space, momentarily hanging there in midair. In this fleeting moment, he recognizes the brilliant ingenuity of the First Crusaders, who had cleverly painted a pathway using forced perspective to blend seamlessly with the rocks below. Indy scatters a handful of dirt over the cleverly disguised bridge and expertly crosses it, imitating the actions depicted by the first Crusader in the painting that hangs prominently over Henry's desk.

After releasing a sigh of relief, he finds himself standing at the edge of a small opening that abruptly transitions into a daunting 100-foot drop, presenting him with a view of a sheer stony cliff wall positioned 100 feet across from where he stands, and no apparent route to traverse this gap. He then diverts his attention to the Grail Diary, seeking its wisdom for guidance, before his eyes are drawn to the depiction of a lion's head intricately inscribed into the rock face high above him. Calling out to his son for reassurance, Indy summons his courage, makes a calculated leap into what appears to be empty space, and hangs suspended in midair, defying expectations. It is then that he deduces the clever First Crusaders have ingeniously camouflaged a pathway, designed in forced perspective to merge seamlessly with the pattern of the rocks below. Indy proceeds to throw dirt onto the hidden bridge to reveal its contours and confidently walks across the newly visible passageway in a manner resembling the First Crusader from the painting over Henry's desk. Upon reaching the other side, Indy crawls through a narrow opening in the cliff face and emerges into a temple filled with an extensive collection of chalices varying in size, shape, and composition, including gold and silver. Within the temple, he observes a figure kneeling at the altar in a posture of prayer, clad in garb befitting a Grail Knight, though the knight's face remains concealed from view. This Grail Knight, visibly fatigued, prepares to engage in combat, struggling to manage the weight of a cumbersome two-handed broadsword. Indy deftly dodges the awkward and unsteady swings until the weary knight can no longer sustain the effort and collapses from exhaustion. Taking advantage of the pause, Indy gently lifts the knight's visor to reveal the visage of a very ancient man who, in a gesture of surrender, reaches towards Indy's clothing and offers the sword to him. At this juncture, Donovan and Elsa enter the scene, redirecting the focus as Donovan turns his attention to the array of cups on display, while Elsa and Indy exchange meaningful glances. With careful deliberation, Elsa selects a goblet of solid gold adorned with emeralds, which Donovan eagerly takes in hand, proceeds to fill with water, and then drinks from. Almost immediately, Donovan's body begins to convulse violently in reaction to the choice."

After a chuckle of amusement, Barry stands in a tiny closet leading to a 200-foot rise and a sight of a wooden hill wall 200 feet wide, with no apparent route to scale. He glances to the Travel Journal for hints, then spots a dragon's tail carved in the wood below. Barry shouts to his cousin, dances onto the ground, and freezes in time. Discovering the clever Second Knights have taped a ladder in disguised perspective to blend with the trees above, Barry sprinkles flour on the tunnel and climbs it like the second Knight in the photograph under George's rug. Barry slithers through a large hill entrance and arrives at a library with a small collection of scrolls in various colors, textures, copper, and bronze. He observes a woman meditating at the podium with her face concealed, cloaked as a Shield Soldier, though the soldier's hands are invisible. The Shield Soldier eagerly readies for discussion, brandishing a single-handed dagger, but struggles with its balance. Barry sidesteps the awkward stabs until the weary soldier trips. Barry lowers the soldier's hood, revealing an extremely youthful person, who reaches for Barry's footwear and offers her dagger. At that point, Theodore and Clara emerge, and Theodore turns to the shelf of vases while Clara and Barry exchange glances. Clara picks a fragile wooden, sapphire-studded urn, which Theodore grabs, fills with soda, and sips. Theodore's form then begins to pulsate."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby cafÃ©, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
