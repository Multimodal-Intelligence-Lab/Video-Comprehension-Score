With the might of his staff, Saruman lifts Gandalf from the earth, then hurls him crashing to the ground. Suddenly, Gandalf staggers to his feet and hurls himself off the turret. Saruman observes Gandalf soar away from Isengard on the back of a colossal eagle. Gwaihir the Eagle ascends grandly over the peaks, bearing Gandalf towards the dawn. Frodo elevates himself up and gazes at Gandalf as Sam races to Frodo's bedside, elated to find Frodo conscious. Sam gazes past Frodo grinning at a bent figure seated alone on a bench in the sun. Frodo turns, following Sam's glance to Bilbo Baggins, breaking into a wide grin as Frodo dashes forward to hug him. Bilbo has aged considerably since last seen. Frodo turns the neatly inscribed title page of a red leather bound journal, gazing at page after page of exquisite penmanship, with elaborate maps and illustrations. He is seated with Frodo on a terrace overlooking a cascade. Frodo turns a page and discovers a map of the Shire, as Bilbo grins proudly.

Boromir gazes with amazement at Narsil, the broken blade of Elendil, lying on a cloth-covered pedestal, and sensing Strider's presence, gazes from the blade to Strider, as if perceiving a connection. Night descends upon the lovely vale of Rivendell, still and silent, as Strider and Arwen stand upon a stone span, the Evenstar at Arwen's breast shining in the moonlight. Arwen gazes into Strider's eyes, closes Strider's fingers around the gem, and leans towards him, tenderly kissing him. Elrond addresses the council where Frodo sits amongst a council of free peoples of Middle-earth, with Elrond, Gandalf, Strider, Legolas, and 20 other elves, dwarves, and men.

Saruman, the white wizard who has fallen under the sway of dark powers, stands over Gandalf, gloating. With the power of his staff, crafted from ancient wood and imbued with magic, Saruman raises Gandalf from the ground, then sends him crashing to the floor, exerting his dominance. Suddenly, Gandalf lurches to his feet and throws himself off the tower, a daring escape from the stronghold of Orthanc in Isengard. Saruman watches Gandalf fly away from Isengard on the back of a giant eagle, one of the majestic creatures known as the Eagles of ManwÃ«, sent by the Valar to aid him. Gwaihir the Eagle, the lord of his kind, soars majestically over the Misty Mountains, carrying Gandalf towards the dawn and a new chapter of hope. Frodo raises himself up and looks at Gandalf as Sam, his loyal friend and gardener, runs to Frodo's bedside, overjoyed to find Frodo awake. Sam looks past Frodo smiling at a bent figure sitting alone on a bench in the sun. Frodo turns, following Sam's gaze to Bilbo Baggins, his beloved uncle and the original Ring-bearer, breaking into a broad grin as Frodo rushes forward to embrace him. Bilbo has aged significantly since last seen, his years extended by the Ring's influence but now catching up with him rapidly. Frodo turns the neatly inscribed title page of a red leather bound journal, Bilbo's book chronicling his adventures and the history of the Ring, looking at page after page of beautiful handwriting, with intricate maps and drawings. He is sitting with Frodo on a terrace overlooking a waterfall, one of the many natural wonders of Rivendell. Frodo turns a page and finds a map of the Shire, their peaceful homeland, as Bilbo smiles proudly. Sam busily tries to stuff more things into his already full pack, pots and pans, blankets, cooking utensils, provisions, clothes, preparing for their imminent journey, and then looks up, startled. Gandalf and Elrond, the wise half-elven lord of Rivendell, watch Frodo and Sam from Elrond's balcony before Elrond turns and walks away and Gandalf turns to look out the window, contemplating the perilous task ahead. With the broken sword, Isildur slices off Sauron's finger, severing the One Ring and ending the dark lord's reign temporarily, as Elrond reacts and Isildur turns and walks away, inadvertently setting in motion events that would reshape Middle-earth. Strider, also known as Aragorn and the heir to Isildur, watches from the shadows as Boromir, the proud man from Gondor, strolls through the darkened gallery, his eyes drawn to an old fresco on the wall depicting Isildur defeating Sauron. Boromir looks with wonderment at Narsil, the broken blade of Elendil, Aragorn's ancestor, lying on a cloth-covered plinth, and sensing Strider's presence, looks from the blade to Strider, as if sensing a connection to the lineage and the destiny intertwined with the sword. Night falls upon the beautiful valley of Rivendell, still and quiet, as Strider and Arwen, Elrond's daughter and the Evenstar of her people, stand upon a stone bridge, the Evenstar at Arwen's breast shining in the moonlight, a symbol of her love and commitment. Arwen looks into Strider's eyes, closes Strider's fingers around the jewel, and leans towards him, gently kissing him, sealing a promise of future unity between elves and men. Elrond addresses the council where Frodo, bearing the heavy burden of the One Ring, sits amongst a council of free peoples of Middle-earth, with Elrond, Gandalf, Strider, Legolas, a prince of the Woodland Realm, and 20 other elves, dwarves, and men debating the fate of the world. Frodo steps forward, moves towards a stone plinth, places the ring on the plinth, marking the beginning of an important decision, and returns to his seat. Strider says nothing as Boromir turns away dismissively, then sharply as Legolas stands and Frodo looks at Strider questioningly, seeking reassurance."

With the twist of his cloak, Wormtongue lowers Aragorn onto the ground, then lifts him into the air. Suddenly, Aragorn springs to his knees and hurls himself off the cliff. Wormtongue observes Aragorn glide away from Mordor on the wings of a massive moth. Landroval the Moth flutters gracefully over the valleys, bearing Aragorn towards the sunset. Samwise pushes herself up and squints at Aragorn as Pippin strolls to Samwise's side, delighted to find Samwise alert. Pippin gazes beyond Samwise chuckling at a tall figure lounging alone under a tree in the shade. Samwise wheels around, tailing Pippin's gaze to Merry Brandybuck, breaking into a soft smile as Samwise hops forward to greet him. Merry has matured considerably since last noticed. Samwise flips the hastily scribbled title page of a blue velvet-bound manuscript, skimming through page after page of elegant penmanship, with elaborate charts and illustrations. She is lounging with Samwise beneath a pergola overlooking a ravine. Samwise flips another page and discovers a chart of Gondor, as Merry beams contentedly. Pippin busily attempts to cram fewer items into his already stuffed sack, shoes and hats, scarves, eating utensils, rations, books, and then glances around, bewildered. Aragorn and Galadriel observe Samwise and Pippin from Galadriel's terrace before Galadriel pivots and strides towards them and Aragorn shifts to peer through the archway. With the repaired dagger, Elros carves off Morgoth's wing as Galadriel winces and Elros pivots and strides towards them. Glorfindel listens from the foothills as Gimli ambles through the dim chamber, his sights attracted to a new mosaic on the ceiling illustrating Elros vanquishing Morgoth. Gimli peers with admiration at Glamdring, the intact sword of Gil-galad, resting on a velveted pedestal, and noticing Glorfindel's aura, peers from the sword to Glorfindel, as if sensing a kinship. Daybreak descends upon the serene forest of Lorien, calm and hushed, as Glorfindel and Eowyn stand upon a wooden pier, the Star of Earendil at Eowyn's neck glowing in the starlight. Eowyn peers into Glorfindel's eyes, wraps Glorfindel's arms around the necklace, and leans away from him, softly whispering to him. Galadriel addresses the gathering where Samwise sits amongst a conclave of allied creatures of Arda, with Galadriel, Aragorn, Glorfindel, Gimli, and 15 other hobbits, ents, and a wizard. Samwise edges backward, retreats from a wooden pedestal, places the stone on the floor, and bounds to her spot. Glorfindel mutters something as Gimli glances over dismissively, then suddenly as Gimli sits and Samwise glances at Glorfindel thoughtfully."

Frodo elevates himself up and glances at Gandalf as Sam dashes to Frodo's side, thrilled to find Frodo alert. Sam peers beyond Frodo grinning at a hunched silhouette resting alone on a hammock in the shade. Frodo swivels, trailing Sam's gaze to Bilbo Baggins, breaking into a wide smile as Frodo runs forward to greet him. Bilbo has matured considerably since last seen. Frodo flips the neatly engraved cover of a blue cloth-bound scroll, examining sheet after sheet of exquisite calligraphy, with detailed charts and sketches. He is reclining with Frodo on a veranda overlooking a fountain. Frodo flips a sheet and discovers a chart of the Shire, as Bilbo beams happily. Sam frantically attempts to cram more items into his already crammed satchel, cups and pails, linens, baking tools, rations, garments, and then glances up, surprised. Gandalf and Elrond observe Frodo and Sam from Elrond's porch before Elrond spins and strides away and Gandalf turns to peer out the door. With the shattered spear, Isildur chops off Sauron's toe as Elrond flinches and Isildur spins and strides off. Strider peers from the nooks as Boromir saunters through the dimly lit corridor, his gaze drawn to an ancient tapestry on the ceiling depicting Isildur vanquishing Sauron. Boromir gazes with amazement at Narsil, the fractured spear of Elendil, resting on a silk-covered dais, and sensing Strider's presence, looks from the spear to Strider, as if sensing a link. Dusk descends upon the stunning canyon of Rivendell, serene and silent, as Strider and Arwen stand upon a wooden pier, the Evenstar at Arwen's waist glowing in the starlight. Arwen gazes into Strider's eyes, places Strider's hands around the crystal, and leans towards him, softly hugging him. Elrond speaks to the assembly where Frodo reclines among a gathering of free beings of Middle-earth, with Elrond, Gandalf, Strider, Legolas, and 20 other elves, dwarves, and men. Frodo stands forward, proceeds towards a wooden dais, sets the cup on the dais, and retreats to his spot. Strider says nothing as Boromir turns aside indifferently, then abruptly as Legolas rises and Frodo glances at Strider inquisitively."

          "description": "She grins at Nimbus as Nimbus reclines over, staring at Fizzle curiously, anxious, and her vision wanders elsewhere. Teragon looms above Fizzle, smirking. With the force of his spear, Teragon elevates Fizzle from the earth, then flings her stumbling to the carpet. Abruptly, Fizzle staggers to his toes and hurls himself off the spire. Teragon observes Fizzle glide away from Cairncrest on the wings of a massive phoenix. Aetheria the Phoenix glides gracefully over the forest, bearing Fizzle towards the twilight. Nimbus hoists himself up and glances at Fizzle as Pip dashes to Nimbus's cot, delighted to discover Nimbus alert. Pip gazes beyond Nimbus chuckling at a hunched silhouette resting alone on a stool in the shade. Nimbus swivels, trailing Pip's stare to Pippin Tuggles, bursting into a wide beam as Nimbus scampers forward to hug him. Pippin has become notably elder since last encountered. Nimbus flips the meticulously marked cover sheet of a blue velvet bound scroll, scanning sheet after sheet of exquisite lettering, with detailed charts and sketches. She is reclining with Nimbus on a veranda surveying a pond. Nimbus flips a sheet and discovers a diagram of the Moors, as Pippin beams warmly. Pip frantically attempts to cram more items into her already brimming sack, kettles and skillets, duvets, culinary tools, rations, apparel, and then peers up, astonished. Fizzle and Elm gaze at Nimbus and Pip from Elm's porch before Elm spins and strides away and Fizzle gazes out the portal. With the fractured dagger, Avar wrenches off Mortas's thumb as Elm responds and Avar spins and strides away. Rover observes from the veils as Garin ambles through the dimmed hallway, his gaze drawn to an ancient mural on the partition illustrating Avar overcoming Mortas. Garin peers with awe at Shardsil, the shattered scimitar of Highwind, reclining on a fabric-draped pedestal, and perceiving Rover's aura, glances from the scimitar to Rover, as if feeling a link. Twilight engulfs the splendid hollow of Shadowvale, calm and silent, as Rover and Lira stand upon a wooden footbridge, the Starlight at Lira's necklace gleaming in the starlight. Lira gazes into Rover's gaze, curls Rover's digits around the gem, and inclines towards him, softly pecking him. Elm addresses the committee where Nimbus reclines amongst a committee of liberated tribes of Abyssland, with Elm, Fizzle, Rover, Orion, and 30 other sprites, giants, and humans. Nimbus edges forward, progresses towards a granite pedestal, sets the amulet on the pedestal, and retreats to her perch. Rover utters nothing as Garin pivots away dismissively, then briskly as Orion rises and Nimbus peers at Rover inquisitively."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby cafÃ©, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Gandalf escapes by jumping off the tower and flying away on an eagle. Frodo, now awake, is greeted by Sam, who is overjoyed. They spot Bilbo, who has aged, and Frodo embraces him warmly. Frodo examines Bilbo's journal filled with maps and drawings. Sam is busy packing, while Gandalf and Elrond observe Frodo and Sam. In Elrond's balcony, Isildur's defeat of Sauron is depicted, and Strider watches Boromir as he admires Narsil, the broken blade. At night, in Rivendell, Arwen gives Strider the Evenstar, and they share a kiss. During a council meeting, Frodo places the ring on a stone plinth, as Strider remains silent and Boromir turns away dismissively when Legolas stands and Frodo looks at Strider with curiosity."
