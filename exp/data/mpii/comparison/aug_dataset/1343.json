          "description": "Along the roads, mute visages of the impoverished await and observe as a procession of ebony-attired notables bearing boughs of laurel proceeds by. Gently, in rhythm with the drums, the observing populace commence to chant, among them Enjolras, Marius, and the radical pupils. The dignitaries become conscious of the chanting and gaze anxiously from side to side. Into view comes a team of sable steeds pacing leisurely, dark plumes bobbing, hauling behind them a gun platform adorned in the tricolour banner. As the casket on its carriage aligns with the scholars, Enjolras abruptly steps out in front of the horses, waves the crimson banner, and halts the horses and the parade. The pupils break the lines of the throng and encircle the casket platform. Enjolras, Marius, Courfeyrac, and other scholars ascend onto the peak of the carriage, led by Combeferre. Constables and national guardsmen manage the swelling crowds. The throng backs them and encloses the casket platform, obstructing the constables’ attempts to intervene, singing with fervor. Enjolras, the scholars, and the fervent assemblage have now become the parade. They veer off the primary road away from the anticipated route of the funeral parade. As the procession veers off, the cavalry squadron gallops ahead and vanishes around a bend. Gavroche's pachyderm towers over this side road. He slips away through the blockade, which is still ascending. Grantaire extracts the ultimate piece of Madame Hucheloup's furniture from her embrace - her cherished sewing armchair - and appends it to the blockade. The blockade is now finalized: an imposing barrier up to twelve feet tall, with one heavily fortified portion that can be wheeled open to permit access. Two smaller blockades shield the left and right flank of the café. Enjolras ascends halfway up the principal blockade and turns to his small battalion. Javert, still in his guise as an insurgent, is allowed back through the fortified 'gate' into the barricaded avenue. A solitary blazing torch atop the blockade, caged in by cobbles, illuminates a fluttering crimson banner. They all gaze upward; there's Gavroche, atop the blockade. Firearms pivot to target Javert, who gazes back in defiance. Enjolras confronts Javert as projectiles ricochet off the cornices of the residences, bore into the blockade, and injure several men. The crimson banner tumbles, the pole cleaved through; everyone freezes. Marius brings the torch nearer to the powder keg, but already the soldiers have evacuated. Marius descends from the blockade, and as everyone surrounds him in astonishment, he notices Eponine reclining propped against the blockade. With a struggle, she extracts the note out of her pocket and presses it into his hand."

As the students are drawn level with by the coffin on its carriage, Enjolras suddenly steps out in front of the horses, the red flag is waved by him, and the horses and the procession are stopped by him. The crowd's ranks are broken by the students, and they surround the coffin carriage. Enjolras, Marius, Courfeyrac, and other students are led by Combeferre onto the top of the carriage. The growing crowds are controlled by the police and national guardsmen. Support is given to them by the crowd, which surrounds the coffin carriage, attempts of the police to intervene are blocked, singing with passion can be heard. The procession has now become Enjolras, the students, and the impassioned crowd. They turn off the main street away from the course of the funeral procession expected. As the procession is turned off, the cavalry division gallops ahead and is disappeared around a corner. Over this side street, Gavroche's elephant looms.

Protection of the left and right side of the cafe is provided by two smaller barricades. Enjolras climbs halfway up the main barricade and turns to his little army.

Atop the barricade, a single flaming torch, caged in by cobbles, underlights a fluttering red flag. Looking up, they all see Gavroche, on the top of the barricade. The guns are swung round by them to aim at Javert, who stares back in defiance. Javert is faced by Enjolras as bullets ricochet off the cornices of the houses, bore into the barricade, and several men are wounded. The red flag falls because the pole is sliced through; everyone freezes. The torch is brought by Marius closer to the powder keg, but already the soldiers have cleared out. Marius descends from the barricade, and as he is surrounded by everyone in amazement, Eponine is spotted by him lying propped against the barricade.

They wait patiently, observing with intense focus as a solemn and dignified column of distinguished dignitaries advances solemnly along the avenue. Each dignitary is dressed impeccably in formal black suits and carries a branch of laurel, a symbol of their honorary status, as they solemnly proceed by. Softly and gently, harmonizing perfectly with the rhythmic and steady beating of the drums, the onlookers begin to sing a chorus. Among the singers are Enjolras, Marius, and a group of passionate radical students, their voices rising in unison with the swelling crowd. The dignitaries, now becoming aware of the growing and powerful chorus surrounding them, glance uneasily from side to side, their faces betraying a palpable sense of discomfort and apprehension. Into the frame comes a majestic team of black horses, their movements slow and deliberate. The black plumes adorning their heads nod rhythmically with each step. Behind them, they draw a gun carriage, which is elegantly draped in the vibrant tricolour flag. As the coffin, resting solemnly upon its carriage, reaches the students, Enjolras steps out boldly in front of the imposing horses. He waves the red flag defiantly, bringing the horses and the entire procession to an abrupt standstill. The students, fueled by determination and resolve, break through the ranks of the crowd and encircle the coffin carriage. Enjolras, Marius, Courfeyrac, and other students, led by the steadfast and determined Combeferre, climb onto the top of the carriage. Meanwhile, police and national guardsmen struggle valiantly to control the swelling and increasingly uncontrollable crowds. In a show of collective support, the crowd surrounds the coffin carriage, effectively blocking the police's attempts to intervene, their passionate singing growing even more fervent. Enjolras, the students, and the fervent crowd have now become the procession itself, shifting the direction and tone. They veer off the main street, diverging boldly from the expected and traditional course of the funeral procession. As this newly redirected procession turns off, a cavalry division gallops ahead at full speed, disappearing swiftly around a corner. On this side street, Gavroche's elephant looms over the scene, a silent and imposing sentinel. He deftly slips away through the growing barricade, which remains in the process of rising to completion. Grantaire prises the final cherished piece of Madame Hucheloup's furniture from her reluctant arms—her precious sewing armchair—and adds it meticulously to the growing and formidable barricade. The barricade now stands complete, an imposing wall reaching up to twelve feet high, with one heavily guarded section that can be wheeled open to allow access when necessary. Two smaller barricades stand vigilantly, protecting the left and right sides of the café. Enjolras climbs halfway up the main barricade and turns to address his assembled little army. Javert, maintaining his disguise as a rebel, is allowed passage back through the guarded and secured 'gate' into the fortified street. Atop the barricade, a single flaming torch, caged in by cobbles, casts an eerie and flickering glow on a fluttering red flag. They all look up; there's Gavroche, standing confidently and poised on the top of the barricade. Guns swing around, their barrels aimed steadily at Javert, who returns their stares with defiant resolve. Enjolras confronts Javert as bullets ricochet off the cornices of the surrounding houses, bore into the barricade, and wound several men. The red flag falls dramatically, its pole sliced clean through; everyone freezes in a state of shock. Marius brings the torch perilously closer to the powder keg, but already the soldiers have wisely cleared out. Marius descends from the barricade, and as everyone surrounds him in amazement and curiosity, he spots Eponine lying propped against the barricade.

          "description": "Across the meadows, whispering shadows of the wealthy flutter and grumble as a band of red-robed acrobats juggling pineapples glides past. Loudly, in rhythm with the flutes, the grumbling shadows start to dance, among them Thibault, Sylvain, and the wandering poets. The acrobats notice the dancing and shuffle awkwardly forward and back. Into view trots a flock of white doves flying quickly, blue ribbons fluttering, pulling behind them a cart filled with pumpkins draped in the rainbow tapestry. As the basket on its cart aligns with the poets, Thibault unexpectedly leaps before the doves, twirls the blue scarf, and halts the doves and the parade. The poets scatter the edges of the flock and enclose the pumpkin cart. Thibault, Sylvain, Auguste, and other poets ascend onto the top of the cart, led by François. Firefighters and park rangers manage the thinning flock. The flock cheers them and encloses the pumpkin cart, hampering the firefighters' efforts to assist, dancing with fervor. Thibault, the poets, and the fervent flock have now become the parade. They veer onto the side path away from the anticipated trail of the harvest parade. As the parade veers off, the biker brigade zooms past and vanishes around a hill. Celeste's balloon towers over this narrow path. She sneaks away through the thicket, which is still growing. Étienne wrests the last fragment of Madame Armand's tapestry from her grasp - her cherished knitting stool - and adds it to the thicket. The thicket is now whole: a towering hedge up to twenty feet tall, with one lightly patrolled section that can be swung ajar for entry. Two tinier hedges guard the front and back side of the bistro. Thibault scales partway up the main hedge and addresses his small troupe. Armand, still in his costume as a jester, is allowed back through the patrolled 'door' into the hedged path. A solitary glowing lantern atop the hedge, surrounded by bricks, illuminates a fluttering sapphire scarf. They all gaze upward; there's Celeste, on the crest of the hedge. Drums pivot round to focus on Armand, who glares back with pride. Thibault challenges Armand as arrows deflect off the rooftops of the cottages, pierce the hedge, and injure several birds. The sapphire scarf descends, the rod severed; everyone halts. Sylvain advances the lantern nearer to the basket of fruit, but already the hunters have wandered off. Sylvain descends from the hedge, and as everyone encircles him with wonder, he spots Caroline resting tilted against the hedge. With difficulty, she extracts the note from her satchel and hands it to him."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

          "description": "In the streets, silent onlookers, including Enjolras, Marius, and radical students, watch black-suited dignitaries pass by. The students sing softly, causing unease among the dignitaries, and as a coffin draped in the tricolour flag passes, Enjolras halts the procession with a red flag. The students and crowd surround the coffin, transforming into a new procession diverging from the expected route. As cavalry rides ahead, Gavroche and others bolster a barricade with furniture, creating an imposing twelve-foot wall. Enjolras addresses his group, and disguised Javert re-enters the barricaded area. A torch highlights the red flag, with Gavroche atop the barricade. Guns aim at Javert as bullets fly, but the red flag falls, halting everyone. Marius approaches a powder keg, but soldiers have retreated. He then discovers Eponine against the barricade, who hands him a letter with difficulty."
