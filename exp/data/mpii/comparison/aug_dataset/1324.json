Michael shuts his eyes. Humming encircles them. Gabriel glides elegantly through the shattered eatery, toward the origin of the ticking. He steps behind the counter and discovers Bob lying in a vast pool of gore. It takes the beast a moment to realize that the ticking noise is emanating from Bob's chrome Zippo. Bob is channeling every last bit of vitality in his form to igniting that lighter. Bob gazes at Gabriel. And with one final flick of his thumb, Bob's reliable Zippo. Gabriel's eyes widen as the small flame dances before the range's fractured gas line. Gabriel pivots and dashes like mad as the gas detonates. The enormous detonation shakes the sluggishly moving automobile. Jeep swivels the gun around. Blam! Gabriel receives one in the arm, but it doesn't hinder him.

Suddenly, a shadowy figure leaps onto the car's hood, coming into view as the light uncovers the grotesque visage of a shopping mall Santa Claus, his face distorted and framed by an unkempt beard, with an enormous belly protruding unnaturally. Gabriel, unperturbed, hoists a formidable mace high above his head, preparing to strike, while Michael, feeling the tension and impending doom, shuts his eyes tightly. All around them, a buzzing noise fills the air, intensifying the atmosphere. As Gabriel glides smoothly through the wreckage of the diner, he moves with purpose toward the ominous clicking sound. He steps lightly behind the counter to discover Bob lying motionless in a vast sea of his own blood. The creature takes a moment to comprehend that the persistent clicking emanates from Bob's treasured silver Zippo. With his remaining strength, Bob focuses every fragment of his waning life on igniting the lighter. Mustering the last of his will, Bob looks intently at Gabriel, and with one final motion of his thumb, he sparks the Zippo to life. Gabriel's eyes widen in horror as the small flame flickers dangerously close to the broken gas line of the stove. Quickly reacting, Gabriel spins on his heels and sprints away with all his might as the gas ignites in a massive explosion, violently shaking the sluggish vehicle nearby. Seizing the opportunity, Jeep swiftly maneuvers the gun, aiming with precision to fire, and sends a bullet into Gabriel's shoulder, though it fails to slow him down. Meanwhile, Audrey frantically attempts to load a flare into the gun, her hands trembling as she tries to evade Gabriel's advancing grasp. Jeep finds himself unable to fire another shot, fearing he might inadvertently hit Audrey. Gabriel begins to clamber into the car, his presence menacingly close. In a desperate bid to stop him, Audrey swings the flare gun toward Gabriel, but he deftly deflects her hand just as she pulls the trigger, and the flare erupts within the car. Jeep instinctively ducks, causing the vehicle to swerve wildly as the flare ricochets off surfaces, lighting up the car's interior with bursts of light akin to a Fourth of July celebration. Gabriel lunges forward, aiming for Charlie, just as the flare ricochets off the windshield with a sharp \"ping\" and strikes him in the face, momentarily halting him. This distraction allows Jeep a critical moment to adjust his position and aim. Gripping the car firmly, Gabriel begins to hoist himself back inside, but Jeep pulls the trigger again, only to hear a disheartening click. With swift agility, Gabriel’s hand sweeps, knocking Audrey harshly against the car's interior, freeing his path to Charlie once more. Charlie, sensing the threat, urgently pushes herself and her baby onto the floor before the passenger seat in an attempt to shield them. Jeep responds by slamming the accelerator, causing the speedometer needle to jump forward. As Gabriel lunges over the passenger seat, his hand, fierce and relentless, reaches inches from Charlie and the baby, Audrey intervenes by launching herself at Gabriel, forcibly dragging him away at the crucial moment. The two become entangled, their bodies spiraling into a fiery mass upon hitting the pavement. Simultaneously, the Cruiser loses control, veering off the road and colliding with a massive rock formation, bringing the chaotic scene to a crashing conclusion."

Jeep, the nickname for the rugged vehicle renowned for its ability to handle rough terrains, gives it some gas, but the engine's not catching due to a mechanical issue. A dark shape pounces onto the hood of the car. The light catches it, revealing the disfigured face and beard of a shopping mall Santa Claus, known for entertaining children during the holiday season, his oversized belly gruesomely distended from some unnatural curse. Gabriel raises the mighty mace above his head, a weapon reminiscent of ancient warriors. Michael closes his eyes, steeling himself for the impending chaos. Buzzing surrounds them like a swarm of angry bees. Gabriel moves gracefully through the destroyed diner, once a bustling hub for weary travelers craving a hot meal, toward the source of the clicking. He steps behind the counter and finds Bob lying in a massive pool of blood. It takes the creature a moment to realize that the clicking sound is coming from Bob's silver Zippo, a type of lighter known for its durability and windproof flame. Bob is focusing every last ounce of life in his body to lighting that lighter. Bob looks at Gabriel. And with one last brush of his thumb, Bob's trusty Zippo ignites. Gabriel's eyes go wide as the tiny flame dances in front of the stove's broken gas line, a potential powder keg. Gabriel spins and runs like hell as the gas explodes, the kind of blast that leaves nothing untouched. The massive explosion rocks the slow-moving vehicle. Jeep swings the gun around. Blam! Gabriel takes one in the shoulder, but it doesn't slow him down, driven by an unnatural resilience. Audrey desperately tries to load a flare while avoiding Gabriel's grasp.

Jeep ducks as the car swerves madly. The flare ricochets through the cabin, lighting it up like the Fourth of July, known for its brilliant fireworks displays. Gabriel lunges for Charlie just as the flare bounces off the windshield with a metallic ping and nails him right in the face, setting him ablaze. And that gives Jeep the chance to swing around and fire. He holds onto the car with an iron grip, taught through years of surviving under pressure. Starts to pull himself back in, adrenaline pumping fiercely. Jeep pulls the trigger again and click, the gun out of ammo. Brings it up to fire, but he's too fast! Whack! Gabriel knocks her into the side of the car with a sweep of his hand, a move filled with terrifying strength. Now he's clawing his way unobstructed toward Charlie again. Charlie pushes herself and the baby down on the floor in front of the passenger seat, instilled with a maternal instinct to protect. Jeep punches it, accelerating with a frantic urgency. The speedometer leaps ahead, a gauge that marks their increasing speed. Gabriel lunges over the passenger seat, grasping for Charlie, his ferocious hand only inches from her and the baby, when Audrey leaps onto Gabriel, pulling him away from Charlie just in time with a heroic effort. The intertwined bodies of Gabriel and Audrey hit the road with a sickening crunch and roll into a ball of fire. The Cruiser, another term for this iconic vehicle, spins out of control, swerving off the road and careening into a large rock formation, the type sculpted by years of natural erosion."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
