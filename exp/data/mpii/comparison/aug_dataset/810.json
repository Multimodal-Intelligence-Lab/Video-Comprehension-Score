He holds out his hand, and Aisha smiles and looks up to a window where Cala is looking down at them. Ferris waves to her, and without shaking hands, Ferris goes. Aisha wrings her hands as she looks up at people leaning out of windows, watching her. Hani gives Ferris photographs of Al-Masri and Sadiki with young women in a club, and Hani lights a cigar. Ferris frowns earnestly as Hani looks at a grandfather clock, while Ferris's eyes dart. He smiles and holds up the file of photographs.

Ferris glances to the lads again, and Yousef inclines in endorsement of the subsequent platter, which Aisha discerns. Cala glances at the lads and gestures, causing Aisha to glance at Cala, apprehensive. She waves a white serviette, and he grins and elevates his eyebrows at Aisha as they stroll out to the avenue. He extends his hand, and Aisha grins and glances up to a casement where Cala is observing down at them. Ferris waves to her, and without clasping hands, Ferris departs. Aisha twists her hands as she glances up at individuals leaning out of apertures, observing her. Hani gives Ferris snapshots of Al-Masri and Sadiki with youthful women in a club, and Hani ignites a stogie. Ferris scowls sincerely as Hani glances at a grandfather clock, while Ferris's eyes flicker. He grins and holds up the dossier of snapshots. Garland toils on a machine and stretches his limbs above his cranium.

A troop conveyance drives up, and troopers lift corpses in body sacks from the helicopter and load them onto the troop conveyance. Ferris ambles along past an airstrip terminal structure, conversing on his mobile, and Skip’s by an SUV in arrivals. A trooper detonates a device, and Al-Saleem observes a bulletin with one of his men. Ferris, Hani, and Garland are also observing as Garland dispatches the communiqué in Arabic. Ferris extracts his earpiece while Al-Saleem sits on a veranda. His aide strolls over with a laptop, and Al-Saleem sits and opens it, which displays a snapshot of Sadiki. Al-Saleem glances at the snapshot, scrutinizes the photo, and narrows his eyes. In his workspace, Sadiki exhibits a prototype to three men when a coworker calls over. Sadiki proceeds to a machine and opens his correspondence, where emails inundate across the screen. He scowls as he starts to peruse the communications, and below the communication is a snapshot of someone donning a balaclava. The subsequent has a snapshot of someone holding up the Koran. Sadiki glances at a TV that plays bulletin footage of the bombing and, increasingly perturbed, removes his spectacles. Carrying a case and laptop, Sadiki hastens out of the structure, strolls out onto the avenue, and halts to glance around uneasily. Then he strolls over to his Mercedes, deactivating the alarm as he goes, strolls round to the driver's door, unlocks it, opens it, and gets in.

Ferris, maintaining his focus on the boys, observes as Yousef offers a subtle nod of approval for the next dish, a gesture that catches Aisha's attention despite the surrounding din. Meanwhile, Cala directs her attention to the boys, pointing decisively, which prompts Aisha to shift her worried gaze toward Cala. In a moment of silent communication, Aisha waves a white napkin, a gesture that conjures a smile and a raised eyebrow from Cala, signaling approval and prompting them to proceed outside onto the street. As they transition to the outdoors, he extends his hand towards Aisha, who responds with a radiant smile while glancing upwards at a window where Cala stands, looking down at them. Ferris offers a wave in Cala's direction, acknowledging her presence, but instead of shaking hands, Ferris departs. Aisha, now alone with her thoughts, wrings her hands in nervousness, her gaze involuntarily drawn to the people leaning out of nearby windows, all of whom are watching her with curious intensity. Hani approaches Ferris and presents him with photographs depicting Al-Masri and Sadiki in the company of young women at a club. As Hani ceremoniously lights a cigar, Ferris inspects the photos with earnest concentration, his expression serious.

With a frown furrowing his brow, he begins to read the messages, taking note of a photograph of a masked individual below one of the emails. Another email follows, displaying an image of someone holding a Koran. Alarmed, Sadiki's attention shifts to a TV airing news footage of a bombing, the implications of which prompt him to remove his glasses in distress. Hastily gathering a case and a laptop, he exits the building with urgency, stepping out onto the street where he pauses, casting his eyes about with anxious vigilance. Resolute, he proceeds to his Mercedes, deactivating the alarm with a practiced motion, before making his way to the driver's side, unlocking, opening the door, and settling into the driver's seat. With a sense of urgency, he twists the key in the ignition, activating the headlights and drawing the gaze of a group of men who wander past, observing the commotion.

          "description": "They all perch on the roof, and Zara delivers books. Milo glances at the statues, and Patrick waves his foot joyfully. Milo glances to the statues again, and Oliver claps in disapproval of the next painting, which Fiona observes. Zara glances at the statues and laughs, causing Fiona to glance at Zara, annoyed. She tosses a red scarf, and he frowns and lowers his hat at Fiona as they shuffle out to the forest. He holds out his umbrella, and Fiona frowns and glances up to a cloud where Zara is peering down at them. Milo claps to her, and without jumping rope, Milo yells. Fiona scratches her nose as she glances up at animals hanging out of trees, observing her. Sami hands Milo sketches of Al-Greco and Jabari with old men in a barn, and Sami sips a smoothie. Milo smiles sadly as Sami peers at a cuckoo clock, while Milo's fingers twitch. He scowls and unfolds the map of sketches. Morgan paints on a canvas and wiggles his feet above his head. At the botanical garden, a breeze drifts in front of a greenhouse, where orange mist swirls in the panes and casts a shadow across the grass. A wagon rolls up, and gardeners unload flowers in flower pots from the breeze and stack them onto the wagon. Milo dances along past an aquarium entrance, humming into his radio, and skips by a bus in line. A pilot plants a seed, and Al-Mansoor watches a concert snippet with one of his women. Milo, Sami, and Morgan are also watching as Morgan translates the instructions in German. Milo takes off his jacket while Al-Mansoor reclines on a hammock. His assistant wanders over with a telescope, and Al-Mansoor reclines and peers through it, which displays a painting of Jabari. Al-Mansoor squints at the painting, examines the canvas, and widens his smile. In his kitchen, Jabari presents a sculpture to three women when a friend waves over. Jabari heads to a typewriter and reads his telegram, where postcards flutter across the desk. He chuckles as he begins to paint the images, and above the image is a drawing of someone wearing a fez. The next has a drawing of someone holding up a map. Jabari peers at a radio that plays music clips of the fireworks and, increasingly amused, puts on his sunglasses. Carrying a backpack and telescope, Jabari strolls out of the apartment, shuffles out onto the road, and pauses to wave around cheerfully. Then he strolls over to his bicycle, fastening the lock as he strolls, shuffles round to the saddlebag, undoes it, lifts it, and pedals in. He cheerfully rings the bell in the handlebars, switches on the lamp as a flock of birds flutter past observing, and pedals away on his red bicycle."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
