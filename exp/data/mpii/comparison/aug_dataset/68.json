From a nearby, well-organized shelf, a can of glossy shoe polish is picked up. DANTE dips his fingers into the dark, rich shoe polish, using it to boldly scrawl large, eye-catching letters across the now fully unfurled sheet, leaning against the sturdy cooler for much-needed support as he diligently works. With determination and a sense of purpose, DANTE climbs onto a nearby garbage can, meticulously securing one corner of the sheet under the awning to ensure it stays in place. Then, with a careful jump, he descends back down to the ground. The banner proudly displays the message: I ASSURE YOU, WE'RE OPEN. Meanwhile, the sign on the door shifts conspicuously from CLOSED to OPEN, as the clock ticks over to precisely 6:20. DANTE, having completed his morning routine with routine precision, leans back behind the counter. He stares blankly ahead, adopting a catatonic appearance, before slowly lowering his head into his weary hands. The store, now illuminated by its improvised banner, casts a shadow in the gentle early morning light, just after the break of dawn. A car passes by quietly. DANTE waits on a customer, an ACTIVIST purchasing a warm cup of coffee, who casually leans on a briefcase while thoughtfully sipping the brew. As another CUSTOMER confidently steps into the doorway, the ACTIVIST lifts his briefcase onto the counter, opening it to reveal a sickly-looking lung model. From inside the briefcase, the ACTIVIST hands something to him, presenting a vivid picture. The first CUSTOMER discreetly exits the scene. Another CUSTOMER then approaches the counter.

The CROWD exchanges uncertain glances, and someone points to something or someone out of view. The ACTIVIST discreetly carries his briefcase toward the exit, attempting to leave unnoticed. VERONICA leaps down from the freezer case, aiming the extinguisher's nozzle at the ACTIVIST in a threatening manner. He quickly reaches into his briefcase and pulls out a business card, handing it over to her carefully. She reads it with a critical eye, scrutinizing every detail. He nods once, then nods again for emphasis. She retaliates by spraying him with even more chemicals as he retreats hastily, trying to avoid further confrontation. The CROWD departs shamefacedly, offering apologetic looks as they exit one by one. VERONICA watches them leave, her expression filled with intense disgust. DANTE struggles to recover his composure. As the last of the crowd leaves, DANTE remains seated forlornly on the floor, his head resting heavily in his folded arms. VERONICA approaches him and slaps him to snap him out of his dazed state."

The hand moves with purpose, extracting the sheet with a gentle tug, simultaneously picking up a can of shoe polish from its place on the shelf. With deliberate concentration, DANTE dips his fingers into the glistening shoe polish and begins to scrawl large, bold letters across the unfurled sheet, using the surface of a cooler to steady the makeshift canvas. The letters form a clear message as DANTE, with careful balance, ascends a garbage can, stretches out to tuck one corner of the sheet securely under the awning before nimbly jumping back down to the ground. The stark banner, proclaiming \"I ASSURE YOU, WE'RE OPEN,\" sways slightly in the early morning breeze. Inside, the door sign flips from CLOSED to OPEN, accompanied by the quiet ticking of the clock reading 6:20. DANTE leans back behind the counter, having completed his morning routine, allowing himself a moment to stare blankly into space before cradling his head in his hands in a gesture of weary resignation. The store, bathed in the dim light just after dawn, stands quietly as a car drives past. DANTE attends to a customer, known as the ACTIVIST, who is purchasing a cup of coffee. The ACTIVIST casually leans on a briefcase while sipping his drink. Another CUSTOMER momentarily appears in the doorway. With a sense of intrigue, the ACTIVIST lifts his briefcase onto the counter, opens it, and reveals a sickly-looking lung model, which he presents alongside a picture handed to DANTE. As the CUSTOMER leaves, a new customer approaches the counter. A blank wall frames the scene before JAY energetically enters the frame, trailed by SILENT BOB. JAY bursts into an impromptu slam dance, swinging his arm and mock-punching SILENT BOB, adding to the chaos by shrugging off his coat and tossing it into SILENT BOB’s arms. SILENT BOB, unfazed, lights a cigarette and gestures towards an unseen point off-screen, nodding in agreement with whatever he observes. JAY, animatedly, mimics obscene gestures down an imaginary line of spectators, producing little humming sounds with each exaggerated nod. Quickly, the small gathering begins to chant and jeer directly in DANTE's face. VERONICA enters, her eyes scanning the unfolding disorder. The CROWD, growing more boisterous, pelts DANTE with cigarettes. Abruptly, a loud blast reverberates, and a flurry of white powder engulfs the scene. All eyes turn to VERONICA, who stands resolute in a freezer case, clutching a fire extinguisher. The CROWD exchanges bewildered looks as someone discreetly gestures towards O.C. With stealth, the ACTIVIST edges towards the exit, briefcase in hand. VERONICA boldly jumps down from the freezer, directing the extinguisher at the ACTIVIST in a warning stance. As a final act of defiance, he produces a business card from the briefcase and extends it to her. She scrutinizes it, and as he nods twice in acknowledgment, she unleashes another burst of chemicals, prompting his hasty retreat. The CROWD, now subdued, sheepishly disperses, casting apologetic glances as they leave. VERONICA observes the departing throng, her expression one of disgust. Meanwhile, DANTE struggles to regain his composure as the final stragglers exit. Left alone, he sits on the floor with his head buried in his folded arms. With a mix of frustration and a desire to snap him out of his stupor, VERONICA delivers a sharp slap to him."

          "description": "The car trunk pops open in the quiet morning, still tinged with the chill of dawn, and a hand reaches inside, pulling out a folded white sheet that seems hastily taken from a linen closet. A can of shoe polish, which was commonly used by street protestors for makeshift signage due to its stark contrast and bold visibility, is grabbed from the dusty shelf. DANTE dips his fingers into the shoe polish and writes large letters on the unfurled sheet, leaning on the old picnic cooler that’s been in the store since its opening decade ago. DANTE stands precariously on a garbage can, left from the weekly collection that missed pick up, and tucks a corner of the sheet under the faded blue awning. He jumps down with a slight thud on the asphalt. The banner reads I ASSURE YOU, WE'RE OPEN, a phrase that has become iconic in small businesses trying to attract a morning crowd. The door sign shifts from CLOSED to OPEN with a creak that has become part of the store's character. The clock, an old analog model permanently set ten minutes fast, reads 6:20. DANTE leans behind the counter, the morning routine completed as he wrestles with the monotony of another day. He stares ahead, catatonic, then drops his head in his hands, a gesture that reflects his daily struggle to find meaning. The store, with its makeshift banner looming in the dim morning hour, just after dawn, reflects his state of disarray. A car drives by, its tires crackling over the loose gravel. DANTE waits on a customer, an ACTIVIST who frequents the shop, buying coffee as he leans on a briefcase filled with pamphlets calling for change. The ACTIVIST leans on a briefcase and drinks his coffee. Another CUSTOMER, wearing a faded baseball cap emblematic of the local minor league team, leans in the door. The ACTIVIST lifts his briefcase onto the counter. He opens it and extracts a sickly-looking lung model, part of his engagement in an anti-smoking campaign. The ACTIVIST hands DANTE something from the briefcase. Hands him a picture, possibly of a rally he'd organized. The CUSTOMER exits, nodding slightly at DANTE. Another CUSTOMER comes up to the counter as the interaction continues. A blank wall, marked with years of wear, serves as a backdrop for the shifting events. JAY steps into the frame, followed by his stoic companion, SILENT BOB, known around town for their antics. JAY then throws down with a makeshift slam dance, spinning his arm and fake-hitting SILENT BOB, reminiscent of their street performances that often gather small crowds. JAY pulls off his coat and swings it into the arms of SILENT BOB, who stands unfazed. SILENT BOB lights a smoke, the flick of his lighter catching briefly in the dim light. SILENT BOB points to something off-screen, perhaps another regular who just walked past. SILENT BOB nods, a silent agreement to whatever plan JAY has concocted. JAY makes blow job faces down an imaginary line of guys, looking quite like a performing seal, drawing laughter from anyone watching. He throws a little humming sound behind each nod, adding to the absurdity. He then hops up quickly, restoring the energy. The small crowd begins to chant and jeer in DANTE's face, a minor rebellion against the mundane. VERONICA enters and surveys the mess with a look of disbelief. The CROWD throws cigarettes at DANTE, pelting him in the face with butts and ash, a move meant to provoke. Suddenly, a loud blast is heard, and white powder from the fire extinguisher explodes over the throng, creating an instant spectacle. Everyone turns to face VERONICA as she stands in one of the freezer cases, holding a fire extinguisher as if it were a weapon. The CROWD looks among themselves, confusion evident in their glances. Someone points to O.C., another bystander caught in the chaos. The ACTIVIST carries his briefcase surreptitiously toward the door, his mission apparently disrupted. VERONICA jumps off the freezer case, training the nozzle of the extinguisher on the ACTIVIST, making her stance clear. She pokes the extinguisher nozzle at him, warningly. He reaches into his briefcase, preparing for a different kind of confrontation. He pulls out a business card and hands it to her, identifying himself as part of a cause bigger than the morning commotion. She reads it, unmoved. He nods, acknowledging her read. He nods again, maybe as an apology or a plea. She blasts him with more chemical as he exits, making a statement of her own. He quickly flees, leaving behind a spray of extinguishing powder. The CROWD sheepishly exits, one by one, offering apologetic glances as the tension diffuses. VERONICA watches the crowd disperse, disgusted by the morning’s havoc. DANTE tries to regain his composure, picking himself up slowly. The last of the crowd exits, taking with them the echo of their disruption. DANTE is sitting on the floor, head in his folded arms, exhausted by the turmoil. She slaps him softly, more out of concern than anger, urging him to shake off the despondency."

          "description": "The suitcase lid flips open and a paw delves inside, extracting a crumpled blue tarp. A jar of honey is snatched from the cabinet. MILES sinks his toes into the honey and draws tiny symbols on the crumpled tarp, leaning on the bicycle. MILES perches on a park bench and drapes a corner of the tarp over the fountain. He somersaults down. The placard reads WE PROMISE, WE'RE HERE. The window shade switches from LOCKED to UNLOCKED. The sundial shows 9:45. MILES reclines behind the lemonade stand, the evening routine concluded. He gazes forward, entranced, then rests his chin on his knees. The park, with its haphazard placard hanging in the bright afternoon light, just before dusk. A skateboard zooms past. MILES assists a visitor (TRAVELER) purchasing lemonade. The TRAVELER reclines on a hammock and sips his lemonade. Another GUEST peeks in the window. The TRAVELER hoists his hammock onto the stand. He unfolds it and reveals a worn-out hat. The TRAVELER offers him something from the hammock. Gives him a postcard. The GUEST departs. Another GUEST approaches the stand. A blank sidewalk. LEO barges into the picture, trailed by QUIET RICK. LEO then launches into an impromptu breakdance, swinging his leg and pretend-kicking QUIET RICK. LEO shrugs off his jacket and flings it into the arms of QUIET RICK. QUIET RICK ignites a sparkler. QUIET RICK gestures to something off-camera. QUIET RICK nods. LEO mimics trumpet sounds along an invisible lineup of musicians, resembling a juggling clown. He emits a soft whistle with every nod. He then springs up suddenly. The small assembly begins to chant and mock in MILES's direction. ALEX strolls in and assesses the chaos. The ASSEMBLY hurls biscuits at MILES, striking him in the chest. Abruptly, a loud crash resounds, and purple glitter showers over the multitude. Everyone spins to look at ALEX as she perches on one of the merry-go-rounds, aiming a water gun. The ASSEMBLY glances among themselves. Someone signals to O.C. The TRAVELER lugs his hammock stealthily toward the window. ALEX leaps down from the merry-go-round, aiming the water gun at the TRAVELER. She nudges the water gun at him, warningly. He dips into his hammock. He extracts a souvenir and hands it to her. She examines it. He smiles. He smiles again. She drenches him with more water as he scampers away. He rapidly dashes out. The ASSEMBLY bashfully departs, one by one, offering regretful looks. ALEX observes the assembly scatter, unimpressed. MILES attempts to gather his wits. The last of the assembly leaves. MILES lounges on the grass, face in his closed paws. She nudges him."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

An ACTIVIST with a briefcase buys coffee and shows DANTE a lung model and a picture. JAY and SILENT BOB appear, engaging in antics that attract a small crowd, which starts chanting at DANTE.

The crowd exits apologetically, leaving VERONICA disgusted while DANTE sits dejectedly on the floor. She tries to snap him out of it by slapping him."
