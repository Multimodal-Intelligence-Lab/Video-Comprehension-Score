  "ground_truth": "Denethor continues with his meal as Faramir exits. High above Minas Morgul, on a small ledge next to the stairs, lie Frodo, Sam, and Gollum. Sam watches a sleeping Gollum suspiciously as he desperately tries to stay awake, but slowly, inevitably, Sam falls asleep. Gollum's eyes snap open, he sits up, and quietly crawls towards Sam's knapsack. Sam breathes deeply now, heavily asleep. Gollum grimaces in distaste as he pulls out the lembas bread and quietly sprinkles crumbs over the sleeping Sam before throwing the remaining lembas bread over the cliff. Sam's eyes flick open and Gollum spins around, caught off guard. Too exhausted to argue, Sam turns away and gently shakes Frodo's shoulder. Sam rummages through his knapsack, looking for a bite to eat, but stops rummaging, shock on his face, and slowly turns to Gollum. Gollum slaps his hand against Sam's jacket, sending lembas crumbs raining down. Sam is enraged, throws himself at Gollum, and punches him. Frodo pulls Sam off Gollum and collapses on the ground, with Sam's horrified face showing. Sam attempts to fuss around Frodo, but a terrible light comes into Frodo's eyes as he stares into Sam's earnest eyes. Frodo pushes Sam away, clutching the ring beneath his shirt, and rises to his feet as if empowered with a frightening intense energy. Sam stares at Frodo with disbelief, tears well in his eyes, and spill down his cheeks as Frodo turns and leaves with Gollum. Sam is in complete misery. Meanwhile, Faramir leads a column of 200 knights through the streets towards the city gate, with people rushing forward, throwing flowers over the knights. Gandalf hurries alongside Faramir's horse, reading the pain in Faramir's eyes, and calls after him, trying one more time to stop the young man. From a high angle, Faramir leads the 200 mounted knights through the gates of Minas Tirith and across the Pelennor Fields towards the ruins of Osgiliath as the people of Minas Tirith watch. Faramir's knights fan out to form one straight line of 200 horsemen as Gothmog and his men watch them approach. Suddenly, fast pushing into Pippin, who looks on as Denethor eats, Gothmog rises amidst the ruins. Faramir's knights thunder towards the camera, 75 yards away, and Gothmog turns to camera and raises his hand. Behind Gothmog, 5,000 Orc archers rise to their feet, black arrows already strung on their bows. Faramir yells defiantly, but in wide profile and slow motion, his 200 knights ride straight into a black wall of flying arrows. At normal speed, fast cuts of screaming orcs are shown, and throughout the above sequence, Denethor continues to eat.",

          "description": "Denethor persists with his repast as Faramir departs. High above Minas Morgul, on a small shelf next to the steps, recline Frodo, Sam, and Gollum. Sam observes a slumbering Gollum warily as he desperately attempts to remain conscious, but gradually, inexorably, Sam succumbs to slumber. Gollum's eyes spring open, he sits upright, and silently crawls towards Sam's bag. Sam breathes deeply now, soundly asleep. Gollum grimaces in disgust as he extracts the lembas bread and quietly scatters crumbs over the sleeping Sam before tossing the remaining lembas bread over the precipice. Sam's eyes flicker open and Gollum swivels around, taken by surprise. Too fatigued to quarrel, Sam turns away and gently shakes Frodo's shoulder. Sam searches through his bag, seeking a morsel to consume, but halts searching, astonishment on his visage, and slowly turns to Gollum. Gollum smacks his hand against Sam's coat, sending lembas crumbs cascading down. Sam is incensed, hurls himself at Gollum, and strikes him. Frodo pulls Sam off Gollum and collapses on the terrain, with Sam's aghast expression showing. Sam attempts to tend around Frodo, but a dreadful light emerges in Frodo's eyes as he gazes into Sam's sincere eyes. Frodo shoves Sam away, clutching the ring beneath his garment, and rises to his feet as if infused with a terrifying potent energy. Sam stares at Frodo with incredulity, tears gather in his eyes, and spill down his cheeks as Frodo turns and departs with Gollum. Sam is in utter desolation. Meanwhile, Faramir guides a procession of 200 cavaliers through the avenues towards the city portal, with individuals rushing forward, tossing blossoms over the cavaliers. Gandalf hastens alongside Faramir's steed, reading the anguish in Faramir's eyes, and calls after him, attempting once more to halt the young man. From a high perspective, Faramir leads the 200 mounted cavaliers through the gates of Minas Tirith and across the Pelennor Fields towards the remnants of Osgiliath as the inhabitants of Minas Tirith observe. Faramir's cavaliers fan out to create one linear formation of 200 horsemen as Gothmog and his troops watch them approach. Unexpectedly, fast shifting into Pippin, who observes as Denethor consumes, Gothmog ascends amidst the ruins. Faramir's cavaliers thunder towards the lens, 75 yards distant, and Gothmog turns to lens and elevates his hand. Behind Gothmog, 5,000 Orc archers rise to their feet, obsidian arrows already notched on their bows. Faramir shouts defiantly, but in wide outline and slow motion, his 200 cavaliers charge directly into a sepulchral barrier of flying arrows. At normal speed, rapid cuts of shrieking orcs are displayed, and throughout the aforementioned sequence, Denethor continues to consume."

A sleeping Gollum is watched suspiciously by Sam as he desperately tries to stay awake, but Sam is slowly, inevitably overtaken by sleep. Gollum opens his eyes with a snap, sits up, and crawls quietly towards Sam's knapsack. Deep breathing by Sam signifies he is heavily asleep. In distaste, Gollum grimaces as the lembas bread is pulled out by him and crumbs are quietly sprinkled over Sam before the remaining lembas bread is thrown over the cliff by him. Sam's eyes are flicked open, and around spins Gollum, caught off guard. Too exhausted to argue, away is turned by Sam and Frodo's shoulder is gently shaken by him. Sam's knapsack is rummaged through by him, looking for a bite to eat, but shock shows on his face as he stops rummaging and slowly turns to Gollum. Gollum's hand is slapped against Sam's jacket by him, sending lembas crumbs raining down. Enraged, Sam throws himself at Gollum and punches him. Frodo pulls Sam off Gollum and the ground is collapsed on by him, with Sam's horrified face showing. Around Frodo, Sam attempts to fuss, but a terrible light comes into Frodo's eyes as Sam's earnest eyes are stared into by him. Away is pushed by Frodo, who clutches the ring beneath his shirt and rises to his feet, empowered with frightening intense energy. At Frodo, Sam stares with disbelief, tears welling in his eyes and spilling down his cheeks as Frodo, with Gollum, turns and leaves. Complete misery is felt by Sam.

Sam, battling his deep-seated suspicions, keeps a watchful eye on the quietly sleeping Gollum, fighting valiantly and desperately to remain awake. However, despite his best efforts, Sam slowly and inevitably succumbs to fatigue and falls into a deep slumber. \n\nAt that moment, Gollum's eyes suddenly snap open. He sits up with a quick, decisive movement and begins to silently crawl over to Sam's knapsack with a sly, calculated stealth. Sam, now breathing deeply in his heavy sleep, is unaware of the surroundings.

In a stark contrast to the scene in Minas Tirith, high above Minas Morgul, Frodo, Sam, and Gollum are situated precariously on a small ledge that lies adjacent to the winding stairs. Sam casts a wary eye over the sleeping Gollum, his suspicion ever-present as he fights the overwhelming urge to succumb to fatigue, but despite his efforts, sleep overcomes him slowly but surely. As Sam drifts into a deeper slumber, Gollum's eyes snap open abruptly, filled with a cunning alertness. He smoothly sits up and, with calculated stealth, begins to crawl quietly towards Sam's knapsack, motivated by a hidden agenda. Sam, now entirely asleep, breathes deeply and heavily, a testament to his exhaustion. Gollum grimaces with distaste as he extracts the lembas bread from the bag, and with quiet precision, he sprinkles crumbs over the unsuspecting Sam before coldly disposing of the remaining lembas over the cliff's edge. Sam's eyes flutter open just in time to see Gollum spin around, startled by Sam's waking gaze. Sam, too exhausted to mount a verbal defense, simply turns away and gently shakes Frodo's shoulder, seeking his attention. As Sam begins to rummage through his own knapsack in search of something to sate his hunger, he abruptly halts, shock etched across his features, and he slowly pivots his gaze towards Gollum. Gollum, quick to act, slaps his hand against Sam's jacket, causing crumbs of lembas to cascade down conspicuously. Enraged by this revelation, Sam launches himself at Gollum in a fit of anger and lands a firm punch. Frodo, caught up in the escalating tension, intervenes by pulling Sam off Gollum, but collapses on the ground immediately afterward, leaving Sam to stare, horror-stricken, at the scene that has just unfolded. Despite Sam's attempts to fuss over Frodo, a menacing light ignites in Frodo's eyes as he meets Sam's earnest gaze, and he forcefully pushes Sam away, clutching the ring securely beneath his shirt as if it grants him power. Rising to his feet, Frodo appears imbued with an intense, frightening energy that propels him forward. Sam, left in disbelief, watches Frodo with eyes filled with unshed tears that soon spill down his cheeks, defeated as Frodo turns and departs with Gollum, leaving Sam in the depth of misery. Meanwhile, with determined resolve, Faramir leads a column of 200 knights through the bustling streets towards the city gate, as enthusiastic townspeople eagerly rush forward, showering them with flowers. Gandalf, perceiving the pain etched on Faramir's face, moves briskly alongside Faramir's horse, calling out to him in a last effort to dissuade the young captain from his mission. As the scene shifts to a high vantage point, Faramir gallantly leads his 200 mounted knights through the great gates of Minas Tirith and across the expansive Pelennor Fields, their destination the battered ruins of Osgiliath, as the people stand vigil, watching intently. In a display of martial precision, Faramir's knights maneuver into a single, unbroken line of 200 horsemen, even as Gothmog and his men scrutinize their approach. The camera rapidly shifts focus to Pippin, who looks on anxiously as Denethor continues to eat, seemingly oblivious to the impending confrontation. Amidst the ruins, Gothmog rises, his presence ominous, as Faramir's knights charge forward relentlessly, now only 75 yards from the camera's view. Gothmog turns decisively to face the camera, raising his hand in an authoritative gesture. Behind him, a formidable force of 5,000 Orc archers rises in unison, their black arrows already strung on their bows, poised and ready. Faramir bellows defiantly into the fray, but as the scene shifts to slow motion, his 200 valiant knights ride headlong into a barrage of flying arrows, a metaphorical black wall of impending doom. The pace quickens, and rapid cuts capture the chaos of screaming orcs, the battle cries mingling with the relentless advance, while throughout this escalating tension, Denethor remains steadfast, continuing his meal, unaffected by the tumult unfolding."

          "description": "Boromir skips with his dessert as Legolas vanishes. Deep within Mordor's valley, on a wide balcony next to the ladders, rest Merry, Pippin, and Smaug. Pippin observes a snoring dragon cautiously as he eagerly attempts to remain alert, but gradually, unavoidably, Pippin drifts into slumber. Smaug's wings flap wide, he stands up, and quietly glides towards Pippin's backpack. Pippin snores softly now, profoundly asleep. Smaug sneers with disdain as he pulls out the cheese biscuits and quietly scatters crumbs over the snoozing Pippin before tossing the remaining cheese biscuits into the abyss. Pippin's eyes pop open and Smaug twirls around, taken by surprise. Too weary to protest, Pippin turns away and softly pats Merry's elbow. Pippin digs through his satchel, searching for a crumb to munch, but halts his search, shock on his face, and slowly turns to Smaug. Smaug smacks his claw against Pippin's coat, sending biscuit crumbs cascading down. Pippin is furious, flings himself at Smaug, and kicks him. Merry hauls Pippin off Smaug and collapses on the ground, with Pippin's astonished face revealing. Pippin attempts to fuss around Merry, but a dreadful glow ignites in Merry's gaze as he glares into Pippin's genuine eyes. Merry nudges Pippin away, grasping the trinket beneath his vest, and stands as if charged with a daunting fierce vigor. Pippin gawks at Merry with disbelief, tears rise in his eyes, and cascade down his cheeks as Merry turns and departs with Smaug. Pippin is in utter despair. Meanwhile, Legolas guides a procession of 200 elves through the forests towards the mountain pass, with animals bounding forward, tossing leaves over the elves. Aragorn dashes alongside Legolas's stag, interpreting the sorrow in Legolas's eyes, and shouts after him, trying once more to halt the youthful leader. From a lofty vantage, Legolas guides the 200 mounted elves through the gates of Lothlórien and across the Enchanted Glades towards the fragments of Helm's Deep as the elves of Lothlórien observe. Legolas's elves spread out to form one unbroken line of 200 riders as Sauron and his creatures watch them draw near. Suddenly, briskly pivoting into Merry, who gazes on as Boromir feasts, Sauron emerges amidst the debris. Legolas's elves gallop towards the view, 75 meters away, and Sauron pivots to view and lifts his palm. Behind Sauron, 5,000 troll archers rise to their feet, crimson arrows already nocked on their bows. Legolas shouts defiantly, but in broad aspect and slow motion, his 200 elves charge directly into a dark wave of shooting arrows. At normal speed, rapid clips of screeching trolls are depicted, and throughout the above scene, Boromir persists in consuming."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
