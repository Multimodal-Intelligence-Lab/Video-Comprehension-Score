A woman, who is dressed in a neat and tidy business suit, approaches the unfolding scene. Ron, making an effort to appear inconspicuous, pretends to tie his shoelace as if it were the most natural thing in the world. As this scene unfolds, Harry swiftly casts a spell, which results in the woman fainting with a sudden collapse. With a sense of urgency and care, Ron assists Harry in carrying the unconscious woman inside. There, they place her gently beside two other men who are also lying unconscious. Hermione, known for her precision and attention to detail, plucks a single hair from the woman's head, and they each prepare themselves to consume a cup of the transformative Polyjuice Potion. Harry undergoes a remarkable transformation into a man named Albert Runcorn, who is characterized by his dark hair. He peeks timidly out the door before stepping out with newfound confidence. He is followed by Ron, who assumes the persona of a tall man with auburn hair and a mustache, named Reginald Cattermole. Hermione transforms into the businesswoman, Mafalda Hopkirk, completing their disguises.\n\nOnce they are inside, Harry and Ron, now without the presence of Hermione, join the men who are standing in an orderly fashion within lines outside the cubicles. An older man brusquely pushes past them, making his way forward. Ron seizes this opportunity to enter one of the cubicles while Harry waits patiently for his own turn at the next available one. Harry enters his assigned cubicle, firmly shuts the door with determination, and then looks up to find Ron, now in his Reg form, curiously peering over the dividing wall. Harry shifts his gaze to the pedestal before once again looking back at Ron, who responds with a concerned frown. In a carefully executed maneuver, Harry stands on the edge of the toilet, steps delicately onto the bowl, and then pulls the chain with decisiveness. He is swiftly flushed down, spinning down the loo, and emerges seamlessly within a green-tiled fireplace. He steps out into a long, tiled corridor, with Ron emerging slightly further back along the same corridor. \n\nEveryone around them is moving in the same direction, and Ron and Harry seamlessly merge into the crowd of people.

          "description": "Ron cautiously leans out from behind a corner, taking care to avoid being seen, while across the street, Harry stands discreetly positioned within the narrow confines of a small doorway. As they wait, a woman dressed in a sharp, neatly pressed business suit walks toward them, and in response, Ron quickly pretends to be absorbed in tying his shoelace to avoid suspicion. At the same moment, Harry deftly casts a spell, causing the woman to collapse into unconsciousness. Moving swiftly, Ron assists Harry in lifting the woman and guiding her into the nearby building, where they gently lay her down beside two other men who are also unconscious. Hermione, capitalizing on the opportunity, reaches over and plucks a single hair from the woman's head. Each of them then takes hold of a cup containing Polyjuice Potion, and with deliberate motions, they consume it. As the potion takes effect, Harry undergoes a transformation into Albert Runcorn, a man with striking dark hair. He cautiously peeks out from the door, ensuring the coast is clear, before stepping out. He is closely followed by Ron, who has transformed into Reginald Cattermole, a tall man with distinctive auburn hair and a mustache, and then Hermione, who has assumed the identity of Mafalda Hopkirk, the businesswoman. Once inside, Harry and Ron—now without Hermione—blend into the lines of men waiting outside the cubicles. An older man barges his way past, prompting Ron to enter an available cubicle, while Harry bides his time for the next one to free up. Once it does, Harry enters his cubicle, closes the door behind him, and looks up to notice Ron, now in his Reg persona, peering over the dividing wall. The two exchange glances, with Ron frowning in return. Harry then carefully balances on the edge of the toilet, steps onto the bowl, pulls the chain forcefully, and is sent spinning down the toilet through a powerful flushing mechanism. He emerges in a green fireplace, steps out into a long corridor lined with tiles, and sees Ron appearing further down the passageway. In a synchronized manner, they join the flow of people moving in the same direction. Ahead, Harry spots guards in uniform and observes as two of them apprehend a man walking behind him. He reunites with Hermione, who now carries the anxious demeanor of Mafalda, while he himself remains in the guise of Albert. As they press forward, they take in the unsettling sight of a statue depicting muggles being crushed. Ron catches up with them, and they all pile into a lift. Once inside, Yaxley, a Death Eater with a striking fair pigtail, briefly addresses Ron before walking away just as the gate clangs shut. The lift suddenly lurches backward, then rapidly ascends, and when it comes to a halt, the gate opens, allowing Harry to push Ron out into the circular atrium. The lift then reverses course, descends, and two men scuttle quickly across the area in front of Ron. As the gate opens once more, Umbridge steps inside and turns her gaze to Harry. With a series of stiff, robotic movements, Harry exits the lift as the gate screeches shut, then casts a glance back at Hermione as the lift recedes and descends. Harry ambles along a gently curving corridor, catching sight of a spacious open-plan office where clerks, wands in hand, are flicking copies of a booklet from their desks into trays with practiced ease. As he passes by with a throng of minions carrying stacks of papers, he notices an eerie eyeball rotating within a peephole. Taking a moment to glance around for any observers, Harry discreetly drops a small black object onto the floor. It rapidly sprouts legs and feet, scuttling away as it multiplies. Each new creature carries a horn and a white \"up\" key on top, scattering throughout the desks in the open-plan office, where they explode in a series of distractions, effectively creating a diversion for Harry and his companions."

          "description": "Ron, who is adept at espionage techniques thanks to his years of training with the Order of the Phoenix, peeks around a corner, and across the street behind him, Harry stands inside a small doorway that once belonged to an old magical apothecary. A woman in a neat business suit, typical of those working for the Ministry of Magic, approaches, and Ron pretends to tie his shoelace as Harry, using a nonverbal Stupefy charm, casts a spell, causing the woman to faint. Ron helps Harry carry her inside, where they place her beside two unconscious men who are high-ranking Ministry officials. Hermione, experienced in potion-making from her Hogwarts days, plucks a hair from the woman's head, and they each hold a cup of Polyjuice Potion, a complex brew that allows the drinker to assume the form of someone else. Harry morphs into Albert Runcorn, a man known for his dark hair and intimidating presence within the Ministry, peeks out the door, and steps out, followed by Ron as the tall man with auburn hair and a mustache, Reginald Cattermole, a maintenance worker known to toil in the depths of the Ministry, and then by Hermione as the businesswoman, Mafalda Hopkirk, a bureaucrat infamous for her strict adherence to rules. Inside, Harry and Ron, minus Hermione, join the men who are standing in lines outside cubicles, reminiscent of the dreary offices within the Ministry of Magic. An older man, known for his brusque demeanor, pushes past, and Ron enters a cubicle while Harry waits for the next one. Harry enters his cubicle, shuts the door, looks up to see Ron, now Reg, peering over the dividing wall, looks at the pedestal typically used for enchantments, then at Ron, who frowns. Harry, recalling a trick from the Marauder’s Map days, stands on the edge of the toilet, steps onto the bowl, pulls the chain, and is flushed spinning down the loo, a secret entrance to the Ministry. He emerges in a green-tiled fireplace and steps out into a long tiled corridor, designed to disorient intruders, with Ron emerging further back along the corridor. Everyone is walking in the same direction, reminiscent of workers bound by magical contracts, and Ron and Harry join them. Ahead, Harry sees guards in uniform, a sign of the increasing security measures, and two guards apprehend a man walking behind him. He joins a nervous-looking Hermione, both in their morphed shapes of Mafalda and Albert, blending into the Ministry's daily routine. A statue shows Muggles being crushed, symbolizing the oppressive regime, and Ron has joined them as they enter a lift, one of the many magical elevators within the Ministry. Yaxley, a Death Eater known for his fair pigtail and ruthless tactics, addresses Ron, then walks away as the gate closes. The lift hurtles backward, a reminder of the disorienting magical transport systems, then shoots up, and when the gate slides open, Harry pushes Ron out to stand in a circular atrium, a hub of Ministry activity. The lift reverses, descends, and two men scuttle across in front of Ron, likely lower-level Ministry employees. The gate opens onto Umbridge, infamous for her deceitful pink outfits and cruel policies, who steps in and turns to Harry. With stiff robotic movements, Harry, trying to suppress his disdain for her, gets out of the lift as the gate closes, then looks round at Hermione while the lift backs away and descends. Harry wanders along a curved corridor, passing a large open-plan office where clerks with wands flick copies of a booklet from their desks into trays, illustrating the Ministry’s bureaucratic machinery. He passes with a herd of minions carrying papers, and an enchanted eyeball rotates in a peephole, part of the Ministry's surveillance system. Harry glances around, drops a small black object onto the floor, a clever device similar to a decoy detonator, that develops legs and feet, and it scuttles away, multiplying as it goes. Each one produces a horn and a white up-key on top, and they scatter among the desks in the open-plan office, erupting and causing a diversion, a tactic often used by the resistance to create chaos."

          "description": "Sam pokes around a hedge, and across the plaza behind him, Nancy sits inside a narrow gazebo. A chef in a tidy chef's coat arrives, and Sam feigns polishing his trumpet as Nancy brews a potion, causing the chef to collapse. Sam guides Nancy to move her inside, where they set her next to two sleeping sailors. Betty snags a thread from the chef's apron, and they each clutch a bowl of Elixir. Nancy transforms into Gordon Flynch, a woman with blonde curls, peeks past the curtain, and steps outside, shadowed by Sam as the stout individual with raven curls and a monocle, Thomas Greenspan, and then by Betty as the head waitress, Julia Riverton. Indoors, Nancy and Sam, without Betty, mingle with the sailors standing in rows outside booths. A young woman squeezes through, and Sam climbs into a booth while Nancy waits for the following one. Nancy enters her booth, closes the curtain, looks across to see Sam, now Tom, peeping over the dividing panel, looks at the plinth, then at Sam, who scowls. Nancy perches on the rim of the sink, leaps onto the bowl, pulls the lever, and is whisked swirling down the drain. She surfaces in a yellow furnace and steps out into a wide brick walkway, with Sam surfacing further along the walkway. Everyone is strolling in the same path, and Sam and Nancy merge with them. Ahead, Nancy spots workers in gear, and two workers seize a woman walking ahead of her. She meets an anxious-looking Betty, both in their altered forms of Julia and Gordon. A sculpture depicts elves being squished, and Sam has joined them as they board an elevator. Thomson, a Goblin with a sleek ponytail, addresses Sam, then strides away as the gate shuts. The elevator zips sideways, then shoots downward, and when the gate opens, Nancy nudges Sam out to stand in a hexagonal hall. The elevator reverses, climbs, and two women scurry across in front of Sam. The gate opens onto Mrs. Leech, who enters and faces Nancy. With rigid mechanized steps, Nancy exits the elevator as the gate closes, then glances back at Betty while the elevator moves upwards and rises. Nancy strolls along a bending path, passing a spacious shared lounge where scribes with rods flick sheets of parchment from their tables into baskets. She proceeds with a throng of lackeys carrying scrolls, and an eye spins in a spyglass. Nancy peers around, drops a tiny white gadget onto the ground that sprouts arms and shoes, and it creeps away, duplicating as it goes. Each one sprouts a bell and a blue down-arrow on top, and they disperse among the tables in the shared lounge, exploding and creating a distraction."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Ron pretends to tie his shoelace while Harry uses a spell to incapacitate a woman, whom they carry away. Hermione extracts the woman's hair for a Polyjuice potion, transforming Harry into Albert Runcorn, Ron into Reginald Cattermole, and Hermione into Mafalda Hopkirk. Harry and Ron enter cubicles, with Harry using a toilet to sneak into a corridor. There, they blend into a crowd headed towards a suspicious statue. Joined by Hermione, they step into a lift, encountering Yaxley, a Death Eater. As the lift stops, Harry and Ron enter a circular atrium, bumping into Umbridge. Harry exits the lift, passing an office with clerks flicking booklets. He discreetly releases a device that multiplies and causes chaos, serving as a diversion."
