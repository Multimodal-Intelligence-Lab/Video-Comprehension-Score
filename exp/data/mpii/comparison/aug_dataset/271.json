The infant ceases wailing, and Florence's attention reverts to her publication.

Suddenly, another baby begins to cry, capturing Florence's attention once again as she looks up at the ceiling.

As she immerses herself in the text, a sudden cry pierces the air from somewhere upstairs, causing her to momentarily halt her reading and direct her eyes upward toward the ceiling in response to the sound, even as Nathan remains unaware of the disturbance. The crying subsides, allowing Florence to refocus her attention back on her book. Meanwhile, Nathan, seated elsewhere, extends his arm outward with a quick flick, checking the time on his wristwatch as a third title appears on the screen, indicating the time as 8:45 p.m. He begins the motion of returning the phone receiver to its cradle but pauses with a sudden idea, bringing it back to his ear for a moment before decisively slamming it down, causing the on-screen titles to vanish. Yet again, the stillness is interrupted by another baby's cries, prompting Florence to lift her gaze to the ceiling once more. A close-up shot reveals Hi, gently but a bit frantically bouncing one of the restless babies, trying to soothe it. A wide-angle perspective at floor level captures a baby crawling determinedly toward the camera while another baby, bursting with energy, makes a swift escape attempt from the nursery, rounding the open door with a sense of urgency. Hi exits the nursery just in time to avoid the second baby, maneuvering skillfully around it as he heads toward the first baby in the foreground. By the time he reaches it, the camera, angled low, offers a view of only Hi's feet and calves, along with the baby and the stairway leading down to the main floor. Swiftly and quietly, Hi gathers the baby into his arms and retreats back toward the nursery on tiptoe. As Hi maneuvers deftly to collect the baby at the nursery door, footsteps are heard ascending the stairs. With his free arm, he lifts the baby just out of view as Florence's head comes into sight, bobbing up the staircase as she makes her ascent, still clutching the Dr. Spock book. Entering from the hallway door, she moves back into the room, steadily approaching the crib. Midway to her destination, she halts abruptly, frozen in shock as her gaze locks onto an unexpected sight. From Ed's point of view, we see Hi approaching the car, his body language a mix of resignation and innocence, with his empty hands held up in a shrug. Hi positions himself at the driver's window, reaching out to open the door, but Ed reacts swiftly, swatting his hand away from the handle. He makes a further attempt to open the door, but Ed resists, holding it firmly shut with all her strength while simultaneously rolling up the window and securing the lock. Through the barrier of the closed window, a muffled and forlorn voice faintly reaches Ed's ears. Meanwhile, inside, Florence is seen cradling one of the babies tenderly against her shoulder, the baby's curious eyes peeking over to gaze out the window. Hi's face appears framed in the window, looking back at Florence with a quiet plea for silence as he presses a finger to his lips. Florence begins to gently bounce the baby, rhythmically patting it on the back, creating a synchronized movement as both Hi and the window seem to bounce in unison."

The portrait looms over the mantelpiece, offering a classic symbol of family unity. From somewhere upstairs in their suburban home, an infant starts to cry, interrupting Florence's reading and drawing her gaze upward to the ceiling, while Nathan remains oblivious to the noise, absorbed in his own world. The baby's cries cease, allowing Florence to immerse herself back in the comforting and instructive pages of her book. At this point, Nathan throws out his wrist to check his watch, a sleek model indicative of his punctual nature, and at that moment, a third title appears beneath the first two: 8:45 p.m., marking the late evening hour that signals approaching bedtime for the babies.

          "description": "Gerald lounges scribbling in Grandpa Joe's Cookbook, surrounded by a hallway dominated by a colossal tapestry of Maxine and Gerald, peering out from the ceiling above the chandelier. From a corner in the basement, a cat begins to purr, prompting Gerald to halt scribbling and glance at the window, while Maxine remains indifferent. The cat ceases purring, and Gerald's focus returns to his scrapbook. As she flings out her umbrella to gaze at her compass, a fifth tagline is pasted beneath the initial ones: 3:20 a.m. She hesitates to close the laptop but reopens it with a whim, and as she tosses the mouse onto the mat, the taglines vanish. Another cat begins purring, causing Gerald to glance at the window once more. A close-up on the purring cat shows Lu jiggling it tenderly but anxiously. The cats seem agitated. A ceiling-mounted wide-angle shot shows a cat skulking away from the camera in the background, while another cat is poking through the bedroom door, making a wild dash toward the garden in the foreground. Lu emerges from the bedroom, stepping over the foreground cat and prancing toward the cat in the background. By the time he reaches it, the high-angle cropping reveals only his hat and shoulders, along with the cat and the ladder up to the top floor. He picks up the cat and gently tiptoes away toward the bedroom. The cat is at the bedroom door in the background with the ladder in the foreground. As Lu reaches the cat, whispers are heard echoing down. Lu's free leg scoops the cat up and out of sight just as Gerald's shoes emerge, bobbing down as she descends the ladder. She approaches the bedroom, clutching Grandpa Joe's scrapbook. As Gerald enters from the garden door, she tracks forward into the kitchen and approaches the pantry. Partway there she stares, gaping in awe. TED's POV shows Lu approaching the cabin, shrugging and showcasing absolutely full arms. Lu appears at the passenger's hatch, reaching to open the trunk, but Ted slaps his arm away from the latch. He tries to open the trunk, which Ted is holding closed with all his strength, tinting the glass and bolting the trunk. Through the tinted glass, a muffled, very cheerful tune can be heard. Gerald is holding one of the cats nestled against her elbow, with the cat peering over her elbow, facing the backyard, gazing. Lu's hat looms in the backyard, gazing back as he places a finger to his chin. Gerald starts tickling the cat, rubbing it on the ear, and Lu and the backyard jiggle side to side."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby cafÃ©, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

An infant's cry from upstairs momentarily distracts her before she resumes reading. At 8:45 p.m., another baby starts crying, and Florence glances up again. Hi tries to calm restless babies; one crawls away while another races toward freedom. He retrieves the baby, navigating around the nursery. As footsteps approach, Hi hastily scoops up the baby, evading Florence, who climbs the stairs with her book. She freezes upon entering the nursery, shocked. From her perspective, Hi approaches a car, empty-handed, and tries to open the door, but Ed locks him out. Through the closed window, Florence sees Hi, signaling for quiet while she cradles a baby and continues to soothe it."
