She falls back into the water, and the boys help each other out of the pool and run. Jamal looks back for his mother, but Salim urges him onward while a man falls and is stamped on by a mob. Salim and Jamal run past another man throwing a Molotov cocktail at a door, fleeing down an alley where they come face to face with a young boy dressed as the Hindu god Rama, covered in blue paint with his hair bound up on his head. Both of them run, passing the girl, Latika, hiding in an alley as a man sets another man on fire. The boys run towards a police station, with Latika falling behind. Inside, the policemen are playing cards while a man runs into the street with his clothes in flames, and the policemen do nothing. The boys run again, beckoning Latika to follow, and Jamal's mother lies face down in the pool. In the present day, back in the police station, Jamal remembers seeing the young boy dressed as the god Rama. The boys had been frozen to the spot momentarily, staring at the bow and arrow in the boy's hand. Back on the show, Jamal is lost in thought. Five-year-old Jamal and Salim stand on high ground looking down on their slum burning amidst the riots, while Latika stands some distance away. In the street, Latika stands drenched in the torrential rain as Jamal and Salim sit in a shelter; Salim rolls onto his side, and Jamal looks at Latika in the rain for a moment before lying down. Jamal and Salim's mother screams as flames explode, and Jamal wakes up as Salim lies with his back to him, wide awake. Jamal looks at Latika still out in the rainy street, seeing her squat down tracing letters in the puddles; he calls out to her, and she stands up, runs over to the shelter, and squats next to Jamal. Latika shakes her head while Salim's eyes remain wide open, and she lies down next to Jamal. The three children lie on the floor out of the rain, shivering in the cold. In the present, Jamal sits on the studio stage opposite the host as people scavenge on mountains of rotting rubbish while lorries offload more refuse sacks. Jamal appears pensive in the studio, while on the rubbish tip, Latika picks through scraps with a stick.

The boys, feeling helpless, are forced to witness the brutal scene as attackers mercilessly beat defenseless men and women. Jamal stands frozen in horror as his own mother is struck violently in the face, forcing her to stumble and fall backward into the water. Amidst the growing turmoil, the boys scramble, helping each other out of the pool and sprinting for safety. Jamal’s heart aches as he glances back, searching for a sight of his mother, but Salim, sensing the urgency, pulls him forward with insistence, urging him to keep running as they pass a man trampled by a frenzied mob.\n\nThe two brothers, Salim and Jamal, dash by another figure who hurls a Molotov cocktail towards a nearby door, and they flee down a narrow alleyway. There, they suddenly find themselves face to face with a young boy, strikingly painted blue, portraying the Hindu god Rama, complete with hair artistically tied up atop his head. Without hesitation, they continue their flight, running past their young friend, Latika, who is desperately trying to conceal herself in the alley. The scene turns even more horrifying as a man sets another ablaze. They sprint towards the safety of a police station, though Latika struggles to keep pace. Inside the station, oblivious to the chaos, policemen are engrossed in a card game while outside, chaos reigns, with a man bolting into the street, his clothes ablaze, yet they remain indifferent.\n\nThe boys, undeterred, continue their desperate escape, gesturing for Latika to follow them, as behind them, Jamal’s mother lies in the water, motionless. In the present day, back at the police station, Jamal's memories resurface, vividly recalling the striking image of the young boy dressed as god Rama. He recalls how both he and Salim were momentarily rooted to the spot, captivated and paralyzed by the sight of the bow and arrow clutched in the boy’s hand. Returning to reality, Jamal appears lost in his thoughts on the show. In the past, five-year-old Jamal and Salim stand on elevated ground, casting their eyes down on the catastrophic scene of their slum engulfed in flames during the riots, with Latika maintaining a distance from them.\n\nIn the pouring rain, Latika stands, drenched and shivering, amidst the overwhelming downpour, while Jamal and Salim huddle under a shelter. Salim rolls onto his side, trying to find comfort, as Jamal momentarily fixes his gaze on Latika, who remains out in the rain. Turning away, Jamal lies down, but his concern for her lingers.

Salim, though lying beside him with his back turned, remains wide awake, fueling the tension. Jamal peers outside at Latika, observing her as she crouches in the rain, tracing letters in puddles on the ground. He calls out to her, prompting her to stand up and rush over to their shelter, where she squats down next to him. Latika shakes her head slightly, and as she lies down, Salim’s eyes remain unblinking. Now, all three children huddle together on the cold floor, lying close to one another, trying to shield themselves from the relentless rain.\n\nIn the present, the scene shifts to Jamal who sits on a studio stage, facing the host, his expression pensive. Meanwhile, back in the bustling garbage dump, people scavenger through mountains of decaying refuse as trucks continue to unload even more rubbish. Jamal, lost in contemplation in the studio, seems detached, while on the waste heap, Latika sifts through scraps, using a stick to probe for anything of value. Her sharp eyes catch sight of a minibus's arrival, prompting her to alertly turn and call out as two intimidating men exit the vehicle and approach a makeshift tent, drawn by the sight of two pairs of small, resting feet sticking out.

The boys, overwhelmed and feeling utterly helpless, are forced to stand by and witness the brutal scene unfolding before them. Attacked mercilessly, defenseless men and women fall victim to the onslaught. Jamal finds himself frozen in terror, unable to move, as he sees his own mother struck viciously in the face. The force of the blow causes her to stumble backward and fall into the water. Amidst the escalating turmoil, the boys scramble frantically, supporting one another as they clamber out of the swimming pool and break into a sprint, seeking safety. Jamal’s heart is heavy with anguish as he glances over his shoulder, desperately searching for a glimpse of his mother. However, Salim, acutely aware of the urgency of the situation, tugs him insistently forward, urging him to keep running as they race past a man trampled by a frenzied mob.\n\nWith adrenaline pumping through their veins, the two brothers, Salim and Jamal, dash past another figure, who recklessly hurls a Molotov cocktail towards a nearby door. They flee into a narrow alleyway, where they unexpectedly come face to face with a young boy, strikingly painted in vibrant blue. This boy, portraying the Hindu god Rama, has his hair artistically styled in a topknot. Despite the surprise encounter, they continue their desperate flight, sprinting past their young friend Latika, who struggles to hide herself within the confines of the alley. The scene around them turns increasingly horrifying as a man is doused and set alight. Their feet pound the ground as they race towards the safety of a police station, but Latika, struggling, trails behind. Inside the station, oblivious to the pandemonium outside, policemen engross themselves in a card game. Meanwhile, outside, chaos prevails, with a man running into the street, his clothes ablaze, while the officers remain indifferent to the tragic scene unfolding.\n\nUndeterred by the obstacles, the boys persist in their frantic escape, motioning for Latika to follow them. Behind them, unseen, Jamal’s mother lies motionless in the water. In the present day, back at the police station, fragments of Jamal's memories surge back, vividly recalling the striking image of the young boy dressed as god Rama. He remembers how both he and Salim had been momentarily transfixed, rooted to the spot, captivated by the sight of the bow and arrow clutched in the boy’s hand. As he returns to reality, Jamal appears to drift into his thoughts while on the show. In the past, five-year-old Jamal and Salim stand on elevated ground, casting their worried eyes down on the catastrophic scene of their slum consumed by flames during the riots, with Latika standing at a distance.\n\nIn the relentless pouring rain, Latika stands, drenched to the skin and shivering, amid the overwhelming downpour that shows no mercy. Meanwhile, Jamal and Salim huddle together under a meager shelter, seeking refuge from the storm. Salim rolls onto his side, trying to find a semblance of comfort, as Jamal momentarily turns his gaze towards Latika, who remains outside in the rain. Although he turns away and lies down, his concern for her lingers in his mind. Their mother’s piercing scream of terror reverberates as the flames erupt violently, causing Jamal to awaken abruptly. Salim, though lying beside him, remains wide awake with his back turned, adding to the tension. Jamal peers through the rain at Latika, watching her as she crouches, tracing letters in puddles on the ground. He calls out to her, prompting her to stand up and rush over to their shelter, where she huddles next to him. Latika shakes her head slightly, and as she lies down, Salim’s eyes remain unblinking. Now, all three children lie huddled together on the cold floor, pressed close to one another, trying to shield themselves from the incessant rain.\n\nTransitioning to the present, the scene shifts to Jamal who sits quietly on a studio stage, facing the host with a pensive expression. Meanwhile, back in the bustling garbage dump, people scavenge through mountains of decaying refuse as more waste is continuously unloaded by the trucks. Jamal, lost in a world of contemplation in the studio, seems detached. Meanwhile, on the waste heap, Latika diligently sifts through scraps, using a stick to probe for anything of interest or value. Her sharp eyes catch the sight of a minibus arriving, prompting her to alertly turn and call out as two intimidating men exit the vehicle, approaching a makeshift tent drawn by the sight of two pairs of small, resting feet sticking out.

          "description": "As Jamal's mother raises her voice in a panicked scream at the boys, the chaotic scene unfolds with attackers mercilessly bludgeoning defenseless men and women. Amidst the turmoil, Jamal fixates on his mother at the very moment a brutal club strikes her face. The force of the blow sends her reeling backward into the water, compelling the boys to scramble, assisting each other out of the pool in a hurried frenzy before sprinting away from the scene. In the midst of fleeing, Jamal casts a desperate glance back in search of his mother, yet Salim, sensing the urgency, urges him to keep moving forward while in their path, a man succumbs to the vicious mob's stampede. As they maneuver through the chaos, Salim and Jamal dodge past a man who flings a Molotov cocktail towards a door, and they bolt down an alleyway, only to be met with the striking sight of a young boy, painted blue and clad in costume as the Hindu god Rama, his hair elaborately styled atop his head. They don't pause for long and take off again, passing by the girl, Latika, who is crouched in an alley, desperately hiding while witnessing a man being set ablaze. The boys make an urgent dash toward what they hope is the safety of a police station, although Latika struggles to keep up, trailing behind them. Inside the station, the indifference of the policemen is stark as they continue their card game while chaos unfolds outside, a man consumed by flames racing into the street without eliciting any reaction from the officers. The boys resume their flight, calling out for Latika to join them, and behind them lies the motionless figure of Jamal's mother, face down in the pool. In a flashback to the present day at the police station, Jamal's mind is haunted by the vivid memory of the young boy dressed as Rama, the memory frozen in his mind with the boy's bow and arrow silently casting a powerful image. Meanwhile, Jamal sits in the glowing studio of the quiz show, momentarily lost in thought. Five-year-old Jamal and Salim once stood on elevated ground, gazing down at their slum engulfed in flames, with riots raging below, and Latika stood at a distance, witnessing the destruction. Back on the street, Latika was drenched in relentless rain, while Jamal and Salim took refuge in a makeshift shelter; Salim turned onto his side, while Jamal's eyes wandered towards Latika, watching her stand in the pouring rain before lying down himself. The haunting cry of their mother pierced through the crackling noise of exploding flames, jolting Jamal from sleep to find Salim still awake, lying with his back turned. Through the sheets of rain, Jamal watched Latika squatting, her fingers tracing letters in puddles, and he called out to her. She rose, ran toward the shelter, and settled beside Jamal, shaking her head sorrowfully, while Salim remained wide-eyed and alert. As the night stretched on, the three children lay huddled together on the hard ground, shivering and seeking warmth out of the rain's reach. Returning to the present, Jamal finds himself seated on the brightly lit studio stage opposite the TV host, reflecting pensively while outside, scavengers sift through towering heaps of rotting garbage as trucks relentlessly unload fresh refuse. Jamal's contemplative demeanor contrasts with the scene at the rubbish tip, where Latika, stick in hand, picks methodically through scraps. She glances up as a minibus arrives, instinctively turning to shout a warning as two men step out and approach a makeshift tent, noting the visible presence of two pairs of feet inside. Within the tent, amidst the refuse, Jamal and Salim lie dosed, unaware of the unfolding events."

She falls back into the water thrown in disarray from an overhead water tank, and the boys help each other out of the pool and run. Jamal looks back for his mother, but Salim urges him onward while a man falls and is stamped on by a mob driven by religious hatred. Salim and Jamal run past another man, whose desperation leads him to throw a Molotov cocktail at a door, fleeing down an alley where they come face to face with a young boy dressed as the Hindu god Rama, a deity symbolizing virtue and strength, covered in blue paint with his hair artistically bound up on his head. Both of them run, passing the girl, Latika, hiding in an alley as a man sets another man on fire, a savage act during the chaos. The boys run towards a local police station, known for its corruption and inefficiency, with Latika falling behind. Inside, the policemen are playing cards, indifferent to the chaos outside, while a man runs into the street with his clothes in flames, and the policemen do nothing, highlighting systemic failure. The boys run again, beckoning Latika to follow, and Jamal's mother lies face down in the pool, a tragic casualty of the violence. In the present day, back in the police station, Jamal remembers seeing the young boy dressed as the god Rama, whose image lingered in his mind. The boys had been frozen to the spot momentarily, staring at the bow and arrow in the boy's hand, reminiscent of the epic tales of Ramayana. Back on the show, Jamal is lost in thought, haunted by these memories. Five-year-old Jamal and Salim stand on high ground looking down on their slum burning amidst the riots, while Latika stands some distance away, witnessing the destruction of their home. In the street, Latika stands drenched in the torrential rain of the monsoon season as Jamal and Salim sit in a shelter; Salim rolls onto his side, and Jamal looks at Latika in the rain for a moment before lying down. Jamal and Salim's mother screams as flames explode in the distance, and Jamal wakes up as Salim lies with his back to him, wide awake, both boys entrenched in fear. Jamal looks at Latika still out in the rainy street, seeing her squat down tracing letters in the puddles; he calls out to her, and she stands up, runs over to the shelter, and squats next to Jamal. Latika shakes her head while Salim's eyes remain wide open, filled with anxiety and unrest, and she lies down next to Jamal. The three children lie on the floor out of the rain, shivering in the cold, their frailty palpable. In the present, Jamal sits on the studio stage opposite the host of the popular game show, \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?\" as people scavenge on mountains of rotting rubbish in the sprawling Dharavi slum while lorries offload more refuse sacks. Jamal appears pensive in the studio, while on the rubbish tip, Latika picks through scraps with a stick, a testament to her resilience. She looks up when a minibus arrives, turns, and shouts as two men emerge from the minibus, agents of a local crime syndicate, and approach a makeshift tent, counting two pairs of feet. Inside, Jamal and Salim lie dosed in the tent amidst the rubbish, exhausted by their struggles and unaware of the danger approaching."

          "description": "Carlos's cousin chuckles at the kittens as the dancers tickle sleeping cats and dogs, and Carlos listens as his cousin is tickled in the ear. She tumbles forward onto the sand, and the kittens nudge each other out of the garden and skip. Carlos glances back for his cousin, but Diego nudges him sideways while a clown tumbles and is stomped on by a throng. Diego and Carlos skip past another clown juggling a rubber chicken at a tree, skipping down a tunnel where they encounter a tiny rabbit dressed as the Greek god Zeus, covered in red feathers with its ears tied up over its head. All of them skip, avoiding the zebra, Penelope, crouching in a tunnel as a clown sprints past a rabbit on a skateboard. The kittens skip towards a bakery, with Penelope skidding after. Inside, the bakers are drinking tea while a rabbit skips into the yard with its legs covered in mud, and the bakers hide inside. The kittens skip again, signaling Penelope to scamper, and Carlos's cousin drifts face up in the sand. In the future moment, back in the bakery, Carlos dwells on meeting the tiny rabbit dressed as the god Zeus. The kittens had been glued to the ground momentarily, gaping at the flute in the rabbit's paws. Back in the studio, Carlos is lost in reverie. Five-year-old Carlos and Diego stand on low hills looking up at their tents flying amidst the parade, while Penelope hovers some space away. On the bridge, Penelope hovers drenched in the heavy mist as Carlos and Diego huddle next to a cart; Diego rolls onto his back, and Carlos peers at Penelope in the mist for a minute before curling up. Carlos and Diego's cousin chuckles as trumpets burst, and Carlos dozes off as Diego curls with his back to him, fully asleep. Carlos peers at Penelope still in the misty bridge, watching her crouch down sketching circles in the puddles; he calls out to her, and she jumps up, skips over to the cart, and crouches next to Carlos. Penelope wags her finger while Diego's toes remain tightly curled, and she curls up next to Carlos. The trio of kittens curl up on the cushions out of the mist, trembling in the warmth. Now, Carlos sits on the bicycle opposite the gardener as people frolic on piles of silky fabric while donkeys unload more fabric bundles. Carlos appears curious in the bicycle, while on the fabric pile, Penelope prods through buttons with a spoon. She peers up when a tractor arrives, turns, and yawns as two owls hop from the tractor and scuttle to a wooden shed, counting four pairs of eyes. Inside, Carlos and Diego curl snoozing in the shed amidst the fabric."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

He and his brother Salim flee, passing scenes of violence, including a man throwing a Molotov cocktail and another being set on fire. The boys run to a police station, beckoning a girl, Latika, to follow, but inside officers ignore the chaos outside. They remember being momentarily frozen when encountering a boy painted as the god Rama. Back on the game show, Jamal recalls these events. During the riots, Jamal and Salim view their burning slum from a distance while Latika stands drenched in rain. As the chaos unfolds, Jamal calls Latika to join them in their shelter, where they lie shivering together. In the present, Jamal appears thoughtful on the show while Latika scavenges through trash. As a minibus arrives at the rubbish tip, she alerts Jamal and Salim, who lie dosed in a makeshift tent."
