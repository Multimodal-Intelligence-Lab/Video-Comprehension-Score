With careful fingers, he plucks a plant featuring two delicate leaves that flutter gently like wings, and with a soft, guiding motion, he offers it to Lily. The red-haired Lily responds with a warm smile directed at young Severus, and he briefly meets her gaze with a shy glance. Together, they both shift their eyes upward, focusing on the majestic Willow tree that stands tall above them, just as a gentle breeze stirs the branches, causing the leaves to detach and descend, fluttering gracefully through the air, reminiscent of tiny birds in flight. These delicate leaves lightly skim the surface of the water, creating a serene scene. The visual abruptly transitions to reveal Lily adorned with the Sorting Hat perched upon her head. As she makes her way down the hall, she casts a quick, knowing glance at Severus. Sitting at the long dining table, another boy takes a seat beside her while Severus, with his pale complexion, watches her intently with wide, doe-like eyes. James, sitting nearby, offers Lily an affectionate smile, and she reciprocates with a tender gaze. Subsequently, Lily and James are seen embracing in a kiss and sharing a dance. The scene darkens as Voldemort appears, enacting Lily's tragic demise, followed closely by the unsettling image of Wormtail, and a subtle change softens Snape's expression. The narrative shifts, spotlighting Dumbledore's cursed, blackened hand, then Draco and the vanishing cabinet, culminating in the fateful night of Dumbledore's death, witnessed solemnly by Harry from the Astronomy Tower. A succession of images follows, depicting the ominous figure of Voldemort, and then a restless Harry lying in his sleep, haunted by the memory of the night Lily was killed. The scene transitions to Snape entering a dimly lit bedroom within the house at Godric's Hollow, where he finds Lily lying lifeless beside Harry's crib. Overcome by profound grief, Snape stands frozen, gazing down at her still form. In the crib, baby Harry's eyes glisten with tears above a fresh, raw scar etched across his forehead. The scene shifts again to an adolescent Harry, peering through an open doorway, observing as Snape raises his wand with intention, performing two precise circles in the air. From this motion, ethereal white wisps coalesce into a magnificent Patronus, taking the form of a radiant silver doe. The doe leaps gracefully through a nearby window, watched with longing by Snape, as Dumbledore spins around in amazement, his mouth agape in surprise. Cradling Lily's lifeless body tenderly, Snape's face mirrors deep sorrow. In a mystical forest, Harry encounters the silver doe approaching, and the swirling blackness of the Pensieve envelops him. Slowly, he lifts his head out of the Pensieve's basin, eyes wide, filled with a mixture of understanding and anxiety. Dazed, he steps backward, unconsciously placing a hand over his heart, before sinking onto a step. His face is worn, unshaven, and grimy, betraying exhaustion as he stares blankly ahead. After a moment seated in stillness, he rises, navigating his way downstairs along paths cleared through the rubble. As he reaches a landing, he spots Hermione and Ron seated on a step below. Harry halts, briefly watching them, then resumes his descent. Hermione and Ron, noticing him, begin to follow. Hermione clings to Ron's arm, barely holding back her tears, then rushes forward, wrapping her arms around Harry's neck in a comforting embrace. Over her shoulder, Harry exchanges a glance with Ron, who briefly lowers his eyes. Hermione releases her hold on Harry, and they part. Harry then takes his leave, and Ron steps closer to Hermione. Together, they stand side by side, witnessing Harry's slow, deliberate descent down the stone staircase. Exiting into the open air, Harry crosses the deserted courtyard, where the remnants of flickering fires cast elongated shadows before him. With careful steps, he enters The Forbidden Forest, proceeding with caution, and eventually comes to a halt beside a tree, enveloped by the silence of the woods."

The red-haired Lily, whose fiery hair was admired for its vivid color, smiles at the boy Severus, and he glances at her. Then, they both look up at the Willow tree, a majestic tree often associated with melancholy and magic, above them as the wind rustles the branches and the leaves fall flying like tiny birds. The fluttering leaves skim over the water of the nearby pond, reflecting the dappled sunlight. The image changes to Lily wearing the Sorting Hat, a magical hat that determines the house assignments of new students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and she glances at Severus as she walks down the hall.

Snape is overcome with grief, and he gazes at her lying lifeless on the floor. There are tears in baby Harry's eyes and a raw, jagged scar on his forehead, the famous lightning-shaped mark left by Voldemort's curse. Teenage Harry peers through a doorway as Snape raises his wand and completes two circles in the air, creating white wisps of cloud that gather to form a Patronus in the shape of a beautiful silver doe, a symbol of his love for Lily. It leaps out through a window, and longingly, Snape watches it leave as Dumbledore spins around, mouth agape at the revelation. Snape rocks Lily's lifeless body in his arms, his face somber.

Harry lifts his head out of the bowl, his eyes wide and anxious. Dazed, he slowly backs away, holding his hand to his heart, then sits down on a step, his face unshaven and dirty, staring ahead blankly after enduring many battles. He sits motionless, then walks downstairs along pathways cleared amongst the rubble left by the fierce battle at Hogwarts. He turns on a landing and sees Hermione and Ron sitting together, exhausted but united, on a step further down. He pauses, stares at them, and descends. They start to follow him, and Hermione holds Ron's arm, fighting back tears of relief and sorrow. She rushes forward and flings her arms around Harry's neck. Over her shoulders, Harry glances at Ron, who lowers his gaze for a moment, overwhelmed by the aftermath of the long-fought war. Hermione unwraps her arms from around Harry, and they separate.

Over her shoulder, Harry glances at Ron, who lowers his gaze for a moment. Hermione unwraps her arms from around Harry, and they part. Harry takes his leave, and Ron scoots over to Hermione. Side by side, they watch as Harry slowly makes his way down the stone stairway. Outside, Harry strolls slowly across the empty courtyard, where the remnants of flickering candles cast his silhouette before him. He enters The Forbidden Forest, stepping cautiously, and pauses by a log."

          "description": "Frog stoops low and grabs a stone with two bumps, which shimmer like stars, and it directs it to Rose. The green-haired Rose grins at the girl Thomas, and she peers at him. Then, they both glance down at the Birch bush below them as the breeze shakes the blossoms and the petals drift soaring like tiny bees. The shimmering petals glide over the grass. The image shifts to Rose donning the Selection Cap, and she peers at Thomas as she strolls through the corridor. At the banquet bench, another girl rests next to her, while the dark-haired Thomas gazes at her, starry-eyed. Michael grins at Rose, who peers back at him. Rose and Michael hug and spin. Gregory traps Rose, followed by an image of Rathead, and Frog's visage relaxes. Elder's whitened foot, Benson and the disappearing cupboard, and the evening of Elder's demise, which Larry observed on the Astrology terrace, appear. There are images of Gregory, and Larry, uneasy in his dreams, and the evening of Rose's demise. Frog arrives at the attic in the manor in Griffin's Den and discovers her lifeless beside Larry's cradle. Frog is consumed with sorrow, and he peers at her lying motionless on the carpet. There are droplets in infant Larry's eyes and a raw, crooked mark on his cheek. Young Larry glimpses through a window as Frog lifts his staff and traces two loops in the air, crafting silver tendrils of mist that gather to shape a Guardian in the form of a magnificent golden fox. It bounds out through a door, and yearningly, Frog notices it vanish as Elder twirls around, mouth open. Frog cradles Rose's motionless form in his embrace, his expression grave. In the grove, Larry observes the fox nearing, and the dark twirls and the Thoughtspring recur. Larry raises his gaze out of the dish, his eyes wide with worry. Stunned, he gradually steps away, pressing his palm to his chest, then settles down on a step, his face rough and smudged, staring ahead vacantly. He remains immobile, then strides down corridors cleared amid the wreckage. He pivots on a platform and observes Emma and Andy lounging together on a step further down. He halts, gazes at them, and descends. They begin to trail him, and Emma grips Andy's elbow, holding back sobs. She dashes forward and wraps her arms around Larry's shoulders. Over her arms, Larry peeks at Andy, who drops his gaze briefly. Emma loosens her arms from Larry, and they part. Larry bids farewell, and Andy shifts closer to Emma. Together, they observe as Larry gradually proceeds down the rocky steps. Outside, Larry wanders slowly across the barren plaza, where the remnants of smoldering embers cast his silhouette before him. He enters The Secretive Jungle, stepping cautiously, and pauses by a shrub."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

          "description": "Snape picks a wing-like plant and offers it to Lily, who smiles back. They look up at a Willow tree as leaves flutter like birds. The scene shifts to Lily wearing the Sorting Hat and glancing at Severus while sitting next to James, who eventually dances with and kisses her. Images flash of Voldemort killing Lily, Snape's grief, Dumbledore's death, and teenage Harry witnessing these memories. Snape conjures a silver doe Patronus, gazing longingly as it leaves. Harry sees the doe in the forest, then learns the truth about Snape through the Pensieve. Shaken, Harry sits, then joins Ron and Hermione; Hermione embraces him, and they part. Harry walks alone across a courtyard, enters The Forbidden Forest, and stops by a tree, pondering his next steps."
