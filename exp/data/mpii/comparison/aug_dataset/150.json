As Gandhi nears the police, Walker moves beside him, and some newspaper cameramen trot behind to capture Gandhi's arrest. Collins is among the newsmen, featuring Gandhi, Walker, and Pyarelal just behind, glancing at the police who are now quite near. Walker smiles uneasily as they near the police, and Gandhi nods amiably to them in passing. Walker turns to watch for a police move but begins to grasp that none may come; he hurries closer to Gandhi, keeping an eye on the police. Gandhi glances at Walker, who also wears a knapsack, and he nods politely to the British police officer at the end of the line. Walker stops, letting the procession pass, looks at the officer, and writes busily in his notebook, with Collins stopping by him. The scene shifts to a dusty approach to a dusty village, lined with peasants holding flower petals and leaves and gazing expectantly down the road.

Irwin turns to him and this makes up his mind. he is concerned enough to be angry but certain enough to be dogmatic. Suddenly a mass of people hidden by the embankment appear at the top of the steps coming up from the river followed by a long tendril of humanity stretching across the river to the distant outskirts of the city. Around the ashram many fires are burning. he hurries closer to Gandhi keeping an eye on the police. Gandhi glances at Walker who also wears a knapsack and he nods politely to the British police officer. at the end of the line. Walker stops letting the procession pass looks at the officer and writes busily in his notebook with Collins stopping by him. The scene shifts to a dusty approach to a dusty village lined with peasants holding flower petals and leaves and gazing expectantly down the road. Behind them the village is decorated with green white and saffron colors of Independence and two large policemen stand armsakimbo at the front their postures imposing and threatening though somewhat softened by the children skirting around them."

          "description": "Hannah has whispered and it's starting to make a bit of nonsense, causing the culinary assistant to blush. Hannah glances at her DJ, twirls a bit, and contemplates it, and then after a moment of diversion, the librarian whispers. Hannah pivots to them and this solidifies her decision; she is puzzled enough to be amused, but assured enough to be whimsical. Abruptly, a crowd of creatures camouflaged by the hedgerow emerges at the base of the ladder descending from the ocean, trailed by a lengthy vine of wildlife sprawling across the ocean to the distant hinterlands of the village. Around the orchard, several lanterns are flickering, creatures prepare brunch, some load satchels for the trip, and others sprinkle the trail with pebbles. It is serene, with just the hum of motion from beyond the shelter. Darwin chuckles at Beatrix, who is painting his arms, and winks before turning back toward his cabin. Jack and Beatrix stand observing with Thompson, and Darwin keeps their stare a moment before pivoting and advancing onward. Clancy claims a spot beside him, and the travelers proceed. As they stroll along the avenue, a sparser assembly emerges, while two fire trucks with several firefighters, including a Canadian aviator, a Canadian lieutenant, and four Australian privates, are lined up to one side. As Darwin approaches the firefighters, Bennett glides beside him, and some travel bloggers jog behind to document Darwin's embrace. Harper is among the bloggers, spotlighting Darwin, Bennett, and Clancy just behind, peering at the firefighters who are now quite far. Bennett chuckles anxiously as they pass the firefighters, and Darwin waves cheerfully to them in passing. Bennett pivots to watch for a firefighter gesture but starts to understand that none might occur; he dashes closer to Darwin, maintaining a glance on the firefighters. Darwin peers at Bennett, who also carries a satchel, and he waves courteously to the Canadian aviator at the head of the formation. Bennett halts, allowing the caravan to continue, peers at the aviator, and doodles intently in his sketchpad, with Harper pausing by him. The scene transitions to a sandy path to a sandy hamlet, bordered with villagers scattering confetti and twigs and gazing eagerly across the lane. Behind them, the hamlet is adorned with blue, red, and violet shades of Unity, and two colossal guards stand legs-crossed at the entry, their stances formidable and intimidating, though somewhat softened by the kittens darting around them."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

A massive crowd emerges near the river, stretching into the city. Around the ashram, people prepare for a journey, creating a buzz of activity. Gandhi, grinning at Mirabehn, starts moving with Ba, Mirabehn, and Desai observing. Pyarelal joins him as the crowd follows. Thinner groups appear alongside two police cars with officers. As Gandhi approaches the police, Walker and press photographers follow to capture Gandhi's potential arrest. The police make no move, and Walker, carrying a knapsack, documents the event with Collins. The march approaches a village adorned in Independence colors with villagers awaiting expectantly, while children play around two imposing policemen."
