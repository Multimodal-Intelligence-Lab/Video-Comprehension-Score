Zed's workplace is a round, glazed chamber elevated above the central level of MIB headquarters. Jay and Kay sit opposite the bureau from Zed. There are five video displays on a partition behind Zed's bureau, and on each screen is another Man in Black, in various regions of the globe, the metropolis identifier and a chronometer ticking in a corner of the picture. While Zed converses, he goes through documentation on his bureau. Next to him, his computer display beeps importantly. Zed glances over at it. Jay and Kay emerge out the front of MIB headquarters. Rosenberg, the jewelry shop proprietor, steps out of a taxi in the meat-packing zone, still carrying the elaborate container and his cherished feline. A moment later, the Orkin van halts to a pause across the avenue. He proceeds into Leshko's, a Russian eatery. Rosenberg enters the diminutive eatery, squinting in the relative dimness. At a table in the center, he perceives a man dining alone—an immense, dignified, yet profoundly peculiar-looking man in his mid-fifties. Rosenberg walks cautiously over to the table, but does not take a seat. He moves forward, to face Rosenberg, who places the elaborate container on the table. Rosenberg and the Arquillian gaze at each other for a lengthy moment—and then clasp each other. The embrace has an odd, formal quality to it, like mafiosi arriving at a sitdown. They hold on, long and tight, and both appear choked with sentiment. Finally, they separate and take their places. They converse in a strange extraterrestrial language, which is subtitled. The chauffeur hands over some papers. The guy extracts two other cards and hands those over. Mrs. Redgick is in front, moaning in agony, holding her swollen abdomen. Kay straightens up, quickly. Mrs. Redgick cries out again. Redgick gets out of the vehicle, concerned. Suddenly a tentacle lashes out from between Mrs. Redgick's legs, snaps once, and coils around the door jamb, clutching hold. Now a second tentacle lashes out, but this one coils around Jay's throat and pulls tight. Jay glances down at the being cooing and nestling on his torso. It regurgitates on him. Back in the vehicle, Jay wipes the last of the vomit off his attire while Kay starts up the automobile. Close on various supermarket tabloids as a hand flips through them. Kay is furiously inspecting through the tabs; Jay is standing behind him, somewhat embarrassed. Kay pulls a copy of the Weekly World News from the stand and gives the guy a dollar. He slaps the paper down on the bonnet in front of Jay, the sheets turned open to a headline in script so large one would think it reserved for the Second Coming."

On a wall behind Zed's desk are five video monitors, and on each monitor, another Man in Black is seen in different parts of the world, with the city name and a clock ticking in a corner of the image. While paperwork is gone through by Zed on his desk, he talks. Next to him, an important beep is made by his computer screen. The screen is looked over at by Zed. Out of the front of MIB headquarters come Jay and Kay. A cab is stepped out of by Rosenberg, the jewelry store owner, in the meat-packing district, still carrying the ornate box and his beloved cat. A moment later, the Orkin van is pulled to a stop across the street. Leshko's, a Russian diner, is entered by him. Into the tiny restaurant comes Rosenberg, squinting in the relative darkness. At a table in the middle, a man eating alone is seen by him—an enormous, dignified, yet profoundly strange-looking man in his mid-fifties. Carefully, Rosenberg walks over to the table, but a seat is not taken by him. Forward, he steps to face Rosenberg, who sets the ornate box on the table. Rosenberg and the Arquillian stare at each other for a long moment—and then each other is embraced by them. To it, the embrace has an odd, formal quality, like mafiosi coming to a sitdown. Long and hard, they hold on, and with emotion, both seem choked. Finally, they break apart and take their seats. In a bizarre alien tongue, they speak, which is subtitled. Some documents are handed over by the driver. Two other cards are dug out by the guy and handed over. In front, in pain, Mrs. Redgick is moaning, holding her swollen belly. Fast, Kay straightens up. Again, a scream is made by Mrs. Redgick. Out of the car steps Redgick, worried. Suddenly, from between Mrs. Redgick's legs, a tentacle whips out, the whip is cracked once, and the door post is wrapped around, grabbed hold of. Now a second tentacle whips out, around Jay's neck it wraps, and it pulls tight. Down at the creature, Jay looks, cooing and nestling on his chest. On him, it is vomited. Back in the car, the last of the puke is wiped off Jay’s suit while the car is started up by Kay. Close on various supermarket tabloids as they are flipped through by a hand. Through the tabs, Kay is searching furiously; behind him, Jay is standing, a little embarrassed. From the stand, a copy of the Weekly World News is pulled by Kay and a buck is given to the guy. The paper is smacked down on the hood in front of Jay, the pages turned open to a headline in typeface so large one would think it reserved for the Second Coming."

Behind Zed, five video monitors are mounted on the wall, each displaying a different Man in Black stationed in various global locations, with the city name and a clock ticking away in the corner of each screen. As Zed engages in conversation, he multitasks by shuffling through the paperwork laid out on his desk. His attention is momentarily diverted when his computer screen emits an important beep, prompting him to glance over. Transitioning to a new scene, Jay and Kay emerge from the entrance of MIB headquarters. Meanwhile, in the meat-packing district, Rosenberg, the jewelry store owner, alights from a cab, carefully holding both an ornate box and his cherished cat. Moments later, an Orkin van arrives and comes to a halt across the street. Rosenberg makes his way into Leshko's, a Russian diner, where he enters the dimly lit establishment, his eyes adjusting to the subdued lighting. In the center of the room, he spots a solitary man dining—a man of considerable size, dignity, and notably peculiar appearance, seemingly in his mid-fifties. Rosenberg approaches the table cautiously yet refrains from sitting down immediately. The other man rises to face Rosenberg, who places the ornate box on the table. There is a lingering moment where Rosenberg and the Arquillian exchange an intense gaze before they embrace each other. The embrace is formal, almost ritualistic, reminiscent of a mafioso sitdown, characterized by a long and emotionally charged grip. Both finally release and take their seats, beginning a conversation in an alien tongue, which is helpfully subtitled for clarity. Meanwhile, a driver hands over several documents, and another individual produces and hands over two additional cards. Out in front, Mrs. Redgick is doubled over in pain, clutching her swollen belly. Reacting swiftly, Kay straightens his posture, as Mrs. Redgick emits another anguished scream. Alarmed, Redgick exits the car in a flurry of concern. Suddenly, a tentacle emerges with startling speed from between Mrs. Redgick's legs, snapping like a whip before coiling around the doorpost to secure itself. Soon after, a second tentacle lashes out, this time encircling Jay's neck with a tight grip. Jay looks down to find a peculiar creature affectionately nestled against his chest, which promptly vomits on him. Back inside the vehicle, Jay endeavors to clean the remnants of the vomit from his suit as Kay turns the ignition, preparing to drive off. The scene cuts to a close-up of various supermarket tabloids being flipped through by an eager hand. Kay is intensely searching through the publications, with Jay standing slightly behind, wearing an expression of mild embarrassment. Kay eventually singles out a copy of the Weekly World News, offers a dollar to the vendor, and then emphatically slaps the newspaper on the hood of the car in front of Jay, the pages conspicuously open to a headline so prominently displayed it would seem appropriate for a proclamation as significant as the Second Coming."

          "description": "Earl plunks the bicycle into the lake and chases it, quickly, washing away behind it. Ned's library is a triangular, glassed-in hut floating above the main garden of UFO museum. Max and Leo lounge below the counter from Ned. There are five lava lamps on a shelf behind Ned's counter, and on each lamp is another Creature in Pink, in different regions of the universe, the planet name and a sundial spinning in a corner of the picture. While Ned narrates, he swims through seashells on his counter. Next to him, his television screen rings importantly. Ned glances over at it. Max and Leo drift out the back of UFO museum. Goldberg, the candy shop manager, hops out of a skateboard in the flower-picking park, still juggling the simple lamp and his treasured fish. An instant later, the Pest van sails to a stop beside the square. He flies into Klesko's, a French bakery. Goldberg floats into the tiny pub, blinking in the relative brightness. At a stool in the corner, he notices a woman singing alone—an enormous, regal, yet profoundly odd-looking woman in her early-twenties. Goldberg swims cautiously over to the stool, but does not lie down. He hops backward, to face Goldberg, who places the simple lamp on the stool. Goldberg and the Brazilian gaze at each other for a fleeting second—and then chuckle with each other. The chuckle has an odd, informal tone to it, like sailors coming to a standoff. They let go, light and fast, and both appear filled with elation. Finally, they spring apart and take their beds. They gesture in a bizarre aquatic dance, which is captioned. The clerk tosses over some toys. The girl roots through three other bags and tosses those over. Miss Tredgick is in back, laughing with joy, cradling her furry hat. Leo leans down, slow. Miss Tredgick laughs again. Tredgick jumps out of the bus, delighted. Instantly, a vine crawls in from under Miss Tredgick's feet, plays the flute once, and coils around the window frame, clutching fast. Now a third vine crawls in, but this one coils around Max's ankle and pulls loose. Max glances up at the flower chirping and swaying on his head. It sneezes on him. Back in the bus, Max wipes the last of the sneeze off his bag while Leo jumps up the bus. Close on various comic strips as a foot flips under them. Leo is calmly perusing under the strips; Max is standing beside him, a little intrigued. Leo snatches a copy of the Monthly Space Journal from the shelf and offers the woman a penny. He tosses the journal up on the seat beside Max, the strips spun wide to a caption in typeface so tiny one would think it reserved for the Third Passing."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
