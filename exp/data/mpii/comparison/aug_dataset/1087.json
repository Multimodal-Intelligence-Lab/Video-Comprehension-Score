Meanwhile, Tuvia crouches down, his body trembling with fear or cold, and then he lifts his gaze toward Malbin, his eyes searching for guidance or an answer. Malbin responds by shifting his eyes to Shimon, silently seeking the same answer. At this moment, Tuvia, appearing disoriented and unsure of himself, examines the chamber of a revolver that someone has just handed him. He scrutinizes it carefully before returning it to the person and then decisively cocks his own gun, readying himself for whatever might come. Asael gently hands Layla over, ensuring she is safely transferred, as Tuvia intently looks into Lilka’s eyes, drawing strength and resolve from the connection. Then, with a burst of energy, Tuvia springs to his feet and hands Asael several connected belts, their purpose unspoken but understood between them. He pauses to gaze deeply into Asael's unwavering, fearless face, and in a heartfelt gesture of gratitude, kisses him gently on the cheek. As they prepare to move, the Bielski Otriad begins their journey through water that reaches a foot in height, carefully using a rope made from the connected belts to keep everyone linked together as the water rises steadily to their knees. They proceed cautiously, aware of the challenges ahead. During this journey, a woman loses her footing, her body teetering as she slips, but she is quickly helped back to stability by those around her. Meanwhile, Asael, bringing up the rear, also loses his footing momentarily but manages to keep his rifle raised above the water, determined not to let it get wet. The group continues to trudge forward, moving like a solemn funeral cortege through waist-high water, with Asael and Tuvia leading the way, their determination evident. Shimon, supported on either side by Rachel and Malbin, tries hard to keep pace just as a plane roars overhead, its engine a reminder of the danger that lurks. The group, steadfast in their progress, continues onward, with children perched on the shoulders of adults as they make their way through a dense reed bed. Asael takes a moment to check Malbin's map, ensuring they are on the right path. They soon reach a woodland area, where Shimon stumbles, his legs giving way beneath him, but nurse Riva is there immediately to attend to him, offering her medical aid. In a selfless act, Tuvia bends down, hoisting Shimon onto his back, choosing to leave behind the books they could no longer carry. Finally, the group emerges into a clearing, where sunlight streams through the trees, and water glistens in the light, offering them a moment of respite. They settle onto a grassy bank, sighing with relief at having made it this far. Shimon is laid gently onto a stretcher, and Aaron quickly alerts Tuvia to Malbin's presence next to Shimon, where it becomes evident that Malbin is near his end. Tuvia crouches down beside Shimon, a look of deep concern etched on his face, while Malbin anxiously shifts his gaze toward Tuvia. Overcome with emotion, Tuvia wipes his eyes as he watches Shimon take his final breath. Suddenly, the peace is shattered as a tank appears ominously on a hill, its cannonballs exploding violently among the fleeing Bielskis, spreading chaos. Tuvia springs into action, sprinting low and quickly between the explosions, his movements urgent and precise, as Lilka takes up the task of passing ammunition to those armed with guns, prepared to defend themselves. All the while, the threat of advancing German infantry looms, adding another layer of peril to their desperate escape."

Ethan hands Mia over, as Jordan gazes into Zara's smile and then jumps to his toes, handing Ethan linked scarves. Jordan stares into his nervous friend's grin and pats him playfully on the head. The Carmichael Ensemble march off through knee-high sand, using a chain of scarves to remain linked, the sand rising to their waists as they advance. A man trips but is steadied, while Ethan at the front stumbles but keeps his camera above sand. They march through chest-high sand like a wedding procession, with Ethan and Jordan steering. Kevin is propelled by Lisa and Benny as a bird squawks nearby. The group advances, cats on adults' shoulders through a cornfield, as Ethan checks on Benny's compass. In a rocky area, Kevin slips and tumbles, assisted by painter Emma. Jordan drags Kevin onto his shoulder, abandoning hats behind, and the group surfaces into a stream of moonlight and wind, reclining on a sandy shore with joy. Kevin is carried on a trolley, and Alex informs Jordan about Benny beside Kevin, who is sleeping. Jordan stands by Kevin’s side, and Benny glances worriedly at Jordan, who rubs his nose as Kevin sleeps his last. Unexpectedly, a bicycle appears on a mountain, with raindrops splattering among the hiding Carmichaels. Jordan crawls high beneath them, as Zara passes water to those with bags while city dwellers retreat."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Asael passes Layla to Tuvia, who shares a grateful moment with Lilka and Asael. The Bielski Otriad navigates rising waters, using linked belts for support. Asael and Tuvia lead as they trudge through waist-high water, with Shimon aided by Rachel and Malbin. In a woodland, Shimon falls and is assisted by nurse Riva before Tuvia carries him on his back. They find reprieve on a grassy bank as Shimon passes away with Tuvia beside him. Suddenly, a tank attacks, and Tuvia dodges cannonballs while Lilka distributes ammo to resist the advancing German infantry."
