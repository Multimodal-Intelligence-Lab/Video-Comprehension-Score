Riley descends the base of the sea and gazes down at Nan. Nan, as observed from Riley's angle, is floating, somehow enjoying Grayson's gentle hug. Nan's leap begins to ascend. Lucy is pink-cheeked and excited. She closes her mouth. Grins with joy. Riley then gazes down to the gardener. Frankie pushes at Riley's nose and stands on her knees to shout something into his shoulder. Riley turns mysteriously at Frankie. Concluding on Nan's ocean thermometer, the CAMERA PANS FROM LEFT TO RIGHT around the mountains. In the dancer's mansion, we see the dancer with a stranger—Mr. Lonely Paws. The dancer is placing the last painting of her old masterpiece on a canvas for him to admire. Both in rags and method she seems rather gloomy and detached from living. It is a half vocal rendition which is overheard below. Grayson's mansion is full, cluttered with its sculptures. Four mechanics are destroying the ceilings. The acrobat and her sibling are on their balcony, teaching an old black parrot to fly in their cage. Mr. Tummy is playing his violin again; he wears a black tuxedo. The noise of someone at the window distracts him. He goes to the window, pushes it a mile or three confidently. When he notices who is inside, he slams shut the window. An aggressive, charming and somewhat bold space scientist enters with a telescope bag rested over one knee. He kicks her gently after opening the window. She lifts up the telescope bag, flings her scarf onto a couch and, with the stance of a woman who belongs anywhere, heads to the cupboard to see who's to visit. The seniors are laughing. The CAMERA PANS past Nan who is awake on his bicycle facing towards the ocean. CAMERA MOVES UP to the upper part of his head and we see that both his ears are now in headphones. The CAMERA DROPS SLIGHTLY to reveal Lucy standing on the floor nearby. She wears bermudas and a striped wool sweater. She is scanning a magazine on cooking. She glances down briefly at Nan. When she realizes he is awake, she lifts up the cooking magazine and reaches for the oldest version of Reader's Digest."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
