Sorting documents, she peeks at the entryway before performing sit-ups and scrubbing the stove in latex gloves. Jane grapples with her feelings, and the subsequent day, the siblings visit Hell's tool shop. Jane permits the entrance to shut on Tess as her father gazes disapprovingly at Jane's pained visage. While Tess and George court in his workspace, Jane scowls upon observing Kevin's title in her planner, then resolves to call Kevin's numeral. Kevin beams and disconnects, while a youngster with a baseball mitt arrives, and Pedro scowls. They reach the Department of Parks and Recreation Youth Sports field, where Pedro beams at them from the baseball grounds as Jane rolls her eyes in incredulity. A large bouquet of yellow blossoms is delivered, and Jane presents them to Tess with a strained grin. Later, she conveys documentation to George's workspace, beaming as he cheerfully converses on the phone, but her grin diminishes at the sight of images of him and Tess. They all dine at Jane's father's residence, where she sorrowfully stuffs her face with nourishment as Tess chatters and the gentlemen grin. At her flat, Jane discovers Tess and George embracing on the sofa and, feeling crushed, leaves them to it and departs again. She attends a leather and bondage ceremony, wearing a spiked leather choker, attempting to be in a festive mood. Jane flicks the heavy metal devil horns at George and Tess, who replicate the gesture as they grin. When they embrace, Jane appears horrified as Casey catches her gaze. George holds up two neckties for her endorsement, and he nods tight-lipped as she fastens the tie. She grins after him and returns to her workstation. In the evening at the office, Jane organizes files on George's desk and discovers his billfold beneath. After consulting his engagements, she exhales and exits. A cab pulls up outside an eatery, and Jane disembarks. Tess appears astounded, and Jane is bewildered. A small alabaster box is tucked in the dog's choker, which contains a diamond band. He slides the band on her digit, and they embrace as Jane stands helplessly nearby. It's a bridal gown, and Jane later rendezvous with Kevin in a tavern, where she appears content with herself. He clasps her hand, and Jane gazes in astonishment across the Central Park boating basin before they return to their yoga. There's a gathering at the New Warsaw bakery, where Kevin applauds, and Jane, who appears tearful, pulls herself together. Kevin glances down a road past a shop and up the steps to Jane's building."

Inside George's office, Tess and George engage in flirtation while Jane, upon noticing Kevin's name in her filofax, hesitates and then dials his number. On the other end, Kevin picks up with a grin, only to hang up shortly after. Meanwhile, a youngster enters the scene, clutching a baseball glove, and Pedro watches with a frown. They then make their way to the Department of Parks and Recreation Youth Sports ground. As Jane witnesses Pedro grinning from the baseball field, she dismisses it with an eye roll. Later, a delivery arrives with a large bouquet of yellow flowers, which Jane reluctantly presents to Tess, her smile tight and forced. Her day continues as she carries paperwork to George's office, where she catches him animatedly chatting on the phone and momentarily mirrors his joy with a grin until her gaze lands on photos of George and Tess, her smile faltering. The day concludes with a dinner at her father's house, where Jane unhappily indulges in food, only half-listening as Tess chatters animatedly and the men share smiles. Returning to her apartment, she is taken aback to find Tess and George in an embrace on the couch, feeling her heart sink, she quietly leaves them behind and ventures back out. Later, she attends a wedding with a leather and bondage theme, donning a spiked leather collar in the spirit of celebration. Amidst the festivities, she throws a heavy metal devil horn gesture at George and Tess, who reciprocate with grins before sharing a kiss, leaving Jane feeling mortified just as Casey looks her way. At a later point, George holds up two ties for Jane’s opinion; she assists him in selecting one and ties it with deft fingers, nodding lightly as he leaves, and she follows him with a smile before returning to her desk to resume her tasks. In the evening, she diligently tidies George's desk, organizing files until she spots his wallet tucked beneath the paperwork. She pauses, checking his appointments with a sigh before leaving the office. A taxi deposits Jane outside a restaurant, and as she steps out, she finds herself facing Tess, who appears stunned. Jane stands there, momentarily at a loss, before noticing a small white box secured to a dog's collar, inside which lies a diamond ring. Witnessing the ring being placed on Tess's finger, Jane watches as they kiss, feeling helpless and sidelined. She later learns it's for a wedding dress fitting, and later meets Kevin at a bar, feeling a sense of accomplishment as he acknowledges her with a warm gesture. They clasp hands, and Jane, in disbelief, gazes out across the Central Park boating lake before they return to their yoga practice. The scene shifts to a meeting at the New Warsaw bakery, where Kevin's enthusiasm is evident as he claps, prompting Jane, despite her tearful demeanor, to regain her composure and join in.

Jane flicks the heavy metal devil horns at George and Tess, who do the same as they grin, embodying the night's playful, rebellious theme. When they kiss, Jane looks mortified as Casey, her close friend and confidant, catches her eye. George holds up two ties for her approval, and he nods tight-lipped as she knots the tie, a skill she learned from her grandfather. She smiles after him and heads back to her desk, cluttered with colorful notebooks and pens. In the evening at the office, Jane tidies away files on George's desk, organizing them as she learned in her administrative training, and finds his wallet underneath. After consulting his appointments, she sighs and leaves, feeling the weight of a busy schedule. A taxi pulls up outside a restaurant, a Michelin-starred favorite among the locals, and Jane gets out. Tess looks stunned, and Jane is at a loss, unsure of how to bridge the growing gap between them. A small white box is tucked in the dog's collar, an antique piece, which contains a diamond ring sourced from a local jeweler. He slips the ring on her finger, and they kiss as Jane stands helplessly nearby, witnessing their joyful moment. It's a wedding dress, a custom piece designed by a renowned local designer, and Jane later meets up with Kevin in a bar, a cozy spot they frequent, where she looks pleased with herself. He takes her hand, and Jane stares in shock across the Central Park boating lake, its serene waters reflecting the city skyline, before they return to their yoga class, a mindfulness practice they both enjoy.

          "description": "Marla begins her morning by heading to the greenhouse to adjust her shoes and then completes some puzzles on her tablet. Tossing scarves, she peers at the window before doing handstands and washing the bicycle with cotton mittens. Marla battles with her memories, and the following afternoon, the cousins reach Neptune's art gallery. Marla lets the curtain sway on Violet as her brother gapes disapprovingly at Marla’s relieved demeanor. While Violet and Oscar chat in his kitchen, Marla scowls upon seeing Lenny’s name in her sketchbook, then resolves to write Lenny’s address. Lenny chuckles and closes the laptop, while a teenager with a frisbee exits, and Marco scowls. They reach the Bureau of Transportation Youth League stadium, where Marco beams at them from the soccer pitch as Marla shrugs in confusion. A huge pile of red balloons is dispatched, and Marla passes them to Violet with a forced grin. Later, she carries blueprints to Oscar’s studio, laughing as he eagerly chats on the walkie-talkie, but her mirth diminishes at the sight of sketches of him and Violet. They all dine at Marla’s brother’s apartment, where she regretfully devours her meal as Violet nibbles and the kids laugh. At her loft, Marla discovers Violet and Oscar embracing on the recliner and, feeling disappointed, leaves them be and steps outside once more. She attends a wool and lace anniversary, wearing a shiny velvet bracelet, attempting to be in a festive spirit. Marla waves the jazz peace sign at Oscar and Violet, who reciprocate as they laugh. When they hug, Marla appears shocked as Jordan catches her gaze. Oscar displays two scarves for her consideration, and he gestures approvingly as she knots the scarf. She smiles after him and returns to her counter. In the night at the studio, Marla organizes folders on Oscar’s workstation and locates his backpack beneath. After reviewing his messages, she groans and departs. A carriage pulls up outside a theater, and Marla steps out. Violet looks amazed, and Marla is speechless. A tiny green cube is nestled in the cat’s bow tie, which holds a pearl bracelet. He places the bracelet on her wrist, and they embrace as Marla stands awkwardly nearby. It’s a raincoat, and Marla later reconnects with Lenny in a cafe, where she feels content with herself. He clasps her wrist, and Marla gazes in surprise over the Grand Canyon swimming pool before they return to their meditation. There's a gathering at the Old Lisbon coffeehouse, where Lenny cheers, and Marla, who appears emotional, steadies herself. Lenny peers down a boulevard past a boutique and up the stairs to Marla’s cottage."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
