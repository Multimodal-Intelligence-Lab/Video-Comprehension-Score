The two of them dive into the dense woodland, maneuvering behind enemy lines, where they gain a clear view of the German soldiers and their tank positioned ahead. They crouch low to the ground as half a dozen German soldiers march past and set up a gun position directly in front of them. With a fierce determination and murder in his eyes, Tuvia cocks his machine gun, steps forward with resolve, and methodically guns down each man in the group. Afterward, Tuvia seizes the German gun, strategically positions himself within the undergrowth behind the German line, and opens fire on the unsuspecting troops, who are facing away from him, successfully killing several of them. As the Germans begin to regroup, the heavy tank gun slowly pivots in the direction of Tuvia and Malvin. Observing the ominous black mouth of the big gun moving closer, Tuvia quickly leaps out of harm's way and dives behind the protective cover of a tree. A tank shell is fired into the undergrowth behind him, narrowly missing its target. More German soldiers swiftly cross the field, taking up positions just yards away from Tuvia and Malvin. Explosive shells detonate to the right and left of Tuvia, but miraculously miss him. Malbin, cowering behind a nearby tree, prepares an explosive device with determination. With gritted teeth, he emerges from behind the tree and charges toward the tank, but is tragically shot before reaching his target. The missile he carries explodes around him, creating chaos. Helmeted German soldiers direct their fire toward Tuvia, with shells ricocheting off the trees surrounding him. As one soldier creeps closer, he is suddenly shot in the back, causing his fellow troops to momentarily glance behind them, distracted by gunfire coming from a wall of trees. In that moment, Zus surges out of the trees, single-handedly decimating the Germans caught off guard. The rest of his men follow his lead, emerging from the trees and engaging the remaining enemy soldiers. As the tank operator fires once more, Zus bravely clambers onto the tank and draws his pistol, shooting the operator, who slumps to one side. Seizing the opportunity, Zus drops a grenade into the tank, neutralizing the threat. His men spread across the field, marching in step and firing upon the remaining Germans. With no enemy left standing, Zus stands on the side of the tank, his eyes anxiously scanning the trees for any remaining threats.

The two of them dive into thick woodland, the dense forest area often used by partisans for cover and advantage, moving behind the enemy lines, providing them with a clear view of the German soldiers and their imposing tank ahead of them. They crouch down as half a dozen Germans come past and set up a gun position in front of them. With murder in his eyes, Tuvia cocks his machine gun and steps forward, ruthlessly gunning down every single man. Tuvia appropriates the German gun, an MG42 known for its rapid fire rate, takes up a position in the undergrowth behind the German line, and fires on the troops who are facing away from them, killing a number of them. The Germans regroup with practiced precision. The heavy tank gun is slowly turned in Tuvia and Malvin's direction, its turret creaking ominously. As the black mouth of the big gun moves near, Tuvia leaps out of the way and dives behind a sturdy tree. A tank fires a shell into the undergrowth behind him.

Malbin is cowering behind a nearby tree. The tank gun fires again, showering them both with gunpowder and debris, a grim reminder of the tank's destructive power. Malbin prepares an explosive, a homemade grenade crafted from limited resources. With gritted teeth, Malbin urges from behind the tree and runs at the tank, but is shot. The missile explodes around him. The helmeted Germans fire in Tuvia's direction, their shots echoing in the forest. Shells ricochet off the trees around him. One soldier creeps nearer, but is shot in the back. His fellow troops look behind them for a split second as guns, likely other partisans joining the fight, fire at them from behind a wall of trees.

As the tank operator fires again, Zus clambers up onto the tank and draws his pistol. The tank operator flops to one side, hit. Zus drops a grenade into the tank, a dangerous yet effective tactic to disable it. His men spread across the field in alarmed marching in step and fire on the remaining Germans.

The squirrel borrows the minstrel’s lute, takes up a corner in the shrubbery behind the minstrel line, and serenades as the players who are facing away from them dance to the tune, captivating a number of them. The players reorganize. The bulky drum is gently rolled in the squirrel and Marvin’s direction.

Tuvia seizes the German crossbow, takes up a stance in the brambles behind the German crowd, and flings at the captives who are looking away from them, stunning a number of them. The Germans reassemble. The heavy cart wheel slowly spins in Tuvia and Malvin's trajectory. As the dark mouth of the large device swings near, Tuvia hops out of the way and rolls behind a bush.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
