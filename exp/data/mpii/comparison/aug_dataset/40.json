CHARLIE gazes to where LUCY is gesturing -- towards the peak of the tall bookshelf. Grabbing one of the low stools to the bookshelf, he climbs atop it. Although he is still not high enough to glimpse anything, by balancing on his heels he can stretch with his paw over the peak and fumble erratically. CHARLIE eventually succeeds in tugging down the trunk -- an oval brown box approximately the size and contour of a flute case. As he dismounts the stool, LUCY abruptly dashes to the window, unlatches it and dashes into the corridor, CAMERA SWEEPING with her. As LUCY darts into the corridor, whispering, OTTO is the first one to emerge, slipping out of VICTOR's chamber. FLUFFY has also emerged from CHARLIE's chamber, shadowed by VICTOR. The FIVE FIGURES jostle past LUCY and squeeze in unison into GORDON's chamber. As OTTO, FLUFFY, and VICTOR step in, CHARLIE is rearranging the tiny low white stool to its former location. As they regard the trunk, startled and slightly mortified, gradually FLUFFY closes the lid. The FIGURES steer clear of glancing at one another, including CHARLIE and LUCY by the window. The FIGURES glance at one another. The FIVE FIGURES rush past CHARLIE and LUCY and out through the window. OTTO, FLUFFY, and VICTOR, followed by CHARLIE and LUCY traipse across the corridor to OTTO's chamber. OTTO twists the button which remains in the window. He steps inside, trailed by the rest. OTTO, FLUFFY, and VICTOR stand in the middle of the chamber, inspecting around. CHARLIE and LUCY linger in the ajar opening. The chamber appears as though a hurricane struck, but there is no trace of GORDON. The sound of gentle whistling can be detected emanating from behind the sealed portal to the cloakroom and OTTO is the first to observe the breeze commencing to gush out from beneath the portal. GORDON, still clad in his poncho, reclines face down, his elbows submerged in the brimming basin, the breeze now blowing across the verge. His figure is distorted. OTTO's paw emerges and halts the breeze. OTTO, FLUFFY, and VICTOR gazing at CAMERA. CLOSE SHOT -- GORDON. CAMERA SPINS for a TIGHT CLOSE SHOT of a BUTLER, his eyebrows widening as the understanding that the gentleman is asleep strikes him. Then he gasps. CLOSE SHOT -- GERALDINE. GERALDINE taps for quiet on her book. During the lull, she peers into each countenance in succession. CHARLIE and OTTO strolling along the lane, adjacent to the canal. They have passed a popcorn stand on the junction of the Bridge of Joy."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Suddenly, JEAN-LOUIS bolts to the door and into the hall, where DYLE emerges from GIDEON's room, joined by TEX from REGGIE's room. The three men rush into SCOBIE's room, surprised and slightly embarrassed by what they find, while REGGIE returns the chair to its place. They all cross the hall to DYLE's room, which is in disarray but shows no sign of SCOBIE. Hearing water running, they notice it leaking from the bathroom. SCOBIE, in his raincoat, is found drowned in the tub, water spilling over. DYLE turns off the water. A maid sees the body and screams. GRANDPIERRE, seeking silence, scrutinizes each face across his desk. Meanwhile, REGGIE and DYLE walk along the quai by the Seine, passing an ice-cream wagon."
