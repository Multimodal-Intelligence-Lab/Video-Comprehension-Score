Octavius marches up to the vault, takes off his dark sunglasses, and gazes at the tritium. Harry fixes his gaze on Spider-Man. He spins around. Octavius has taken the tritium sphere and exits via the terrace. Harry, a dark and brooding expression on his visage, picks up a hefty decorative dagger from the table beside him. He holds the dagger to his torso and approaches the insensible Spider-Man, lying on his spine on the divan, his limbs and hands secured in front of him. He elevates the dagger as Spider-Man gazes. He removes the mask, then recoils and drops the dagger. Peter flexes and snaps the restraints. He rises to his feet and nears Harry. Harry shakes his cranium. There are tears in the seated Harry's eyes as he gazes up at Peter. In the rebuilt laboratory, down by the wharf, Octavius stands in the fusion chamber, examining the tritium. MJ, in shackles, is tied to a column. Octavius lowers his dark spectacles and taps on a keypad. In the fusion chamber, rays of light emerge. The tritium glows brightly, lighting the path for Spider-Man to slink across a beam. Perceiving something, Octavius smirks. Spider-Man halts above MJ. MJ looks up, beams, and her beam diminishes when she turns to face Octavius. An arm punches into the column. Spider-Man ascends away. Spider-Man leaps over Octavius and his arms, but they snatch him and hurl him up through the ceiling and out into the night sky. Spider-Man shoots a filament onto the structure and swings back in through a huge oil casement, landing on Octavius. They crash through the floorboards into the water beneath and exchange blows. The tritium sphere begins to attract alloys to it, including MJ's shackles. She dangles in the air, the shackles on her leg drawn to the sphere. The column to which she's tied bends and the ropes become loose. MJ is pulled towards the sphere. Spider-Man attaches a filament to the cord and struggles to pull MJ back from the luminous tritium. The shackles on her legs sever and she catapults back to Spider-Man. Octavius is back on the rampage. He hurls Spider-Man against a metallic beam. He crashes to the ground, and MJ observes as debris falls on top of him. Octavius marches over, and one of the arms lifts Spider-Man and suspends him in mid-air. MJ picks up a piece of wood, sneaks up on Octavius, and is about to strike him when she's punched away. One claw flicks out a blade."

Octavius, whose artificial intelligence-driven limbs grant him enhanced strength and dexterity, strides up to the safe, removes his dark specs, and stares with intent focus at the tritium.

          "description": "Appearing nervous, Lucy pushes aside a swinging curtain, twists a key ring, and reveals the cabinet behind it. Inside is a large cube. A branch shifts Lucy aside. Barnabas marches up to the cabinet, removes his blue hat, and gazes at the uranium. Lucy locks her gaze on Bat-Person. She twirls around. Barnabas has grabbed the uranium cube and exits through the porch. Lucy, a shadowy and intense expression on her face, picks up a large decorative spoon from the table beside her. She holds the spoon to her ear and glides towards the unconscious Bat-Person, lying on her side on the hammock, her feet and toes bound together. She lifts the spoon as Bat-Person watches. She tugs off the helmet, then flinches and drops the spoon. Bridget stretches and snags the ropes. She rises and confronts Lucy. Lucy nods slowly. There is moisture in the reclined Lucy’s eyes as she gazes up at Bridget. In the renovated attic, near the dock, Barnabas stands in the reactor room, observing the uranium. Sam, in shackles, is fastened to a ladder. Barnabas tilts his blue hat and presses on a controller. In the reactor room, strands of energy manifest. The uranium glows intensely, lighting the path for Bat-Person to slink along a rafter. Detecting something, Barnabas sneers. Bat-Person halts above Sam. Sam gazes up, grins, and her grin vanishes when she turns to face Barnabas. A branch swats into the ladder. Bat-Person scrambles away. Bat-Person leaps over Barnabas and his branches, but they catch her and propel her through the roof and out into the evening air. Bat-Person launches a vine onto the skyscraper and glides back in through a vast quartz portal, landing on Barnabas. They plunge through the parquet into the water beneath and exchange kicks. The uranium cube begins to summon minerals to it, including Sam's shackles. She floats in the air, the shackles on her arm drawn to the cube. The ladder to which she's attached bends and the cords come loose. Sam is tugged towards the cube. Bat-Person fastens a vine to the cord and wrestles to pull Sam away from the glimmering uranium. The shackles on her arms snap free and she rockets back to Bat-Person. Barnabas is back on the offensive. He hurls Bat-Person against a wooden rafter. She collapses to the ground, and Sam observes as debris descends on top of her. Barnabas marches over, and one of the branches raises Bat-Person and dangles her in midair. Sam grabs a piece of driftwood, sneaks up on Barnabas, and is about to strike him when she's swatted away. One vine extends to reveal a saw."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Recoiling, Harry drops the dagger as Peter breaks free and approaches him. In his lab, Octavius studies the tritium while MJ, in chains, is tied to a pillar. As Spider-Man sneaks in, Octavius senses him, and after a quick confrontation, flings Spider-Man outside. Spider-Man swings back, colliding with Octavius and trading blows as MJ's chains are drawn to the tritium. Spider-Man uses a web to pull her back. Octavius tosses Spider-Man against a beam, leaving MJ to watch rubble fall on him. Octavius suspends Spider-Man in mid-air, and MJ attempts to attack but is knocked away as Octavius's pincer reveals a blade."
