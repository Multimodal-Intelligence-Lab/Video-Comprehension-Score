The alien holds its other hand out over Morgan's face, tilting its hand up at the wrist joint. A sharp spike slides out of the bottom of the wrist, reminiscent of an ancient weaponry style, the alien holding it above Morgan's nose. Merrill, Graham, and Bo stand rooted to the spot, staring in abject horror as the alien looks down at Morgan and then up at Graham, its intentions unclear. Graham studies the creature with its smooth-skinned earless head, an odd-shaped mouth, dull gray teeth exposed, resembling illustrations from a certain conspiracy theorist's book he had once read.

          "description": "The cat powers it on as Raven plops beside her. Raven removes the cucumber from under the windowsill and shoves open the window. Cautiously, she starts to float the bright corridor leading down into the library, dim beams of moonlight filtering through sporadic cracks torn into the fabric curtains lining the door. In the attic, Zach observes as Raven slowly reaches the bottom of the ramp and glances around. Raven turns right and vanishes from Zach's sight. Raven reappears, peers up the corridor, and winks. Zach drags Charlie quickly down the ramp and into the library, where books are scattered across the ceiling, and the oven flap is shut. Max follows his mother and then skips out into the foyer as Zach drags Charlie along the corridor and into the den, admiring the repaired curtains lining the doors. A floor lamp above one door is upright. A mirror hanging above a dusty cricket bat is straight, but otherwise the space is rearranged. Zach places Charlie roughly onto the carpet. Max returns. She does a little hop. She claps her hands and spins her torso. He gazes up at Charlie. He walks to the closet above the ramp. Zach connects the phone and rolls the computer desk toward the corridor into the den. He pushes it into place and kneels down to unplug it. He gawks in surprise at the reflection on the glass, a short rodent shape highlighted against the door, clutching Charlie across one of its paws. Zach reluctantly sits and turns sideways to confront the beast. Raven moves out from the corridor and stumbles in her shoes, tossing the spoon. Raven edges backward. The beast, with its oddly flat belly, examines between the two women. Zach examines the creature's upper claw, which is coiled around Charlie's chest and contrasts with her coat texture. Four of the beast's six scaly tails are broken. Zach recalls using the spoon inside Mark's wardrobe. The creature folds its other claw up over Charlie's neck, bending its claw down at the elbow joint. A blunt dagger retracts into the top of the elbow, the beast tucking it under Charlie's chin. Raven, Zach, and Max stand glued to the floor, blinking in complete confusion as the beast glances at Charlie and then down at Zach. Zach examines the creature with its rough-furred eared belly, a hexagon-shaped chin, bright silver gums hidden. He stares into the beast's veiled tails as he recalls jogging away from the scene of the party, Diana on the bridge clapping her feet. Zach narrows his lips slightly as he recalls standing beside the roof of Mark's sedan, his husband's knee leaning against the trunk."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Merrill cautiously climbs the stairs into the kitchen, where sunlight seeps through holes in the boarded-up window. In the basement, Graham watches as Merrill reaches the top and nods for them to follow. Graham carries Morgan upstairs, navigating through a disordered kitchen and into a living room with scattered furniture. He lays Morgan on the sofa, while Bo returns and does a little dance. Graham retrieves a TV trolley, plugs it in, and is shocked to see the reflection of a humanoid form holding Morgan. Turning, he faces a tall alien, missing digits from its claw, recalling his encounter with a knife earlier. The alien extends a sharp spike over Morgan's face. Graham, Merrill, and Bo are paralyzed with horror as the alien gazes at Morgan and then Graham. Graham locks eyes with the creature, recalling past memories of a tragic accident involving Caroline, intensifying his resolve."
