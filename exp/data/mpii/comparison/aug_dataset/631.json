Merrill removes the pickaxe, a tool commonly used for breaking through tough surfaces, from under the doorknob and pulls open the door. Gingerly, he starts to climb the gloomy stairwell leading up into the kitchen, thick rays of sunlight pouring through irregular holes punched into the wooden planks across the window, a remnant from a recent storm that damaged many homes in the area. In the basement, Graham watches as Merrill tentatively reaches the top of the steps and looks around, his eyes quickly scanning for any signs of intrusion. Merrill turns left and disappears from Graham's view, exploring the area to ensure it's safe. Merrill reappears, looks down the stairwell, and nods, signaling to Graham that it's clear. Graham carries Morgan, his daughter who had recently developed a mysterious allergy, slowly up the stairs and into the kitchen, where chairs are strewn across the floor, and the fridge door is open, suggesting a hasty departure. Bo follows her father and then wanders out into the hallway, her curiosity sometimes leading her into unexpected adventures, as Graham carries Morgan through the dining room and into the living room, staring at the broken planks across the windows that he had meant to fix weeks ago. A table lamp underneath one window is on its side, evidence of the chaos that had unfolded earlier. A picture hanging below a mounted baseball bat, one of Graham's prized possessions from his college days as a baseball player, is askew, but otherwise the room is untouched. Graham lays Morgan gently down on the sofa. Bo comes back in. She does a little dance, resembling one she learned at her last birthday party. She swings her arms and thrusts her hips, trying to lighten the tense mood. He looks down at Morgan, worried about her unusual pallor. He heads to the cupboard under the stairs, a makeshift safe haven during storms. Graham unplugs the set and wields the TV trolley down the hallway into the living room. He maneuvers it into position and crouches down to plug it in. He stares in horror at the reflection on the screen, a tall humanoid form silhouetted against the window, an extraterrestrial entity commonly associated with recent paranormal reports, holding Morgan across one of its arms.

Merrill comes in from the dining room and stops in his tracks, dropping the syringe he had prepared for Morgan's allergy, his medical training suddenly overtaken by shock. Merrill steps forward, trying to muster the courage needed. The creature, with its highly domed head, stares between the two men, its appearance matching descriptions from recent sightings in local news. Graham looks at the alien's lower arm, which is wrapped around Morgan's back and matches his shirt fabric, causing a moment of confusion. Two of the creature's four clawed digits are missing, reminding Graham of when he defended himself using a knife outside Ray's pantry, a close call that left the alien injured. The alien holds its other hand out over Morgan's face, tilting its hand up at the wrist joint. A sharp spike slides out of the bottom of the wrist, reminiscent of an ancient weaponry style, the alien holding it above Morgan's nose. Merrill, Graham, and Bo stand rooted to the spot, staring in abject horror as the alien looks down at Morgan and then up at Graham, its intentions unclear. Graham studies the creature with its smooth-skinned earless head, an odd-shaped mouth, dull gray teeth exposed, resembling illustrations from a certain conspiracy theorist's book he had once read. He glares into the alien's hooded eyes as he remembers driving to the scene of the accident, Caroline in the road waving her arms, desperate for help.

Two of the automaton's six articulated fingers are absent. The toaster recalls using the wrench outside Elliot's barn.

In the attic, Zach observes as Raven slowly reaches the bottom of the ramp and glances around. Raven turns right and vanishes from Zach's sight. Raven reappears, peers up the corridor, and winks. Zach drags Charlie quickly down the ramp and into the library, where books are scattered across the ceiling, and the oven flap is shut. Max follows his mother and then skips out into the foyer as Zach drags Charlie along the corridor and into the den, admiring the repaired curtains lining the doors. A floor lamp above one door is upright. A mirror hanging above a dusty cricket bat is straight, but otherwise the space is rearranged. Zach places Charlie roughly onto the carpet. Max returns.

Zach reluctantly sits and turns sideways to confront the beast. Raven moves out from the corridor and stumbles in her shoes, tossing the spoon. Raven edges backward. The beast, with its oddly flat belly, examines between the two women. Zach examines the creature's upper claw, which is coiled around Charlie's chest and contrasts with her coat texture. Four of the beast's six scaly tails are broken. Zach recalls using the spoon inside Mark's wardrobe. The creature folds its other claw up over Charlie's neck, bending its claw down at the elbow joint. A blunt dagger retracts into the top of the elbow, the beast tucking it under Charlie's chin. Raven, Zach, and Max stand glued to the floor, blinking in complete confusion as the beast glances at Charlie and then down at Zach. Zach examines the creature with its rough-furred eared belly, a hexagon-shaped chin, bright silver gums hidden. He stares into the beast's veiled tails as he recalls jogging away from the scene of the party, Diana on the bridge clapping her feet. Zach narrows his lips slightly as he recalls standing beside the roof of Mark's sedan, his husband's knee leaning against the trunk."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

          "description": "Graham switches on a light as Merrill kneels beside him, removes the pickaxe, and opens the door. Merrill cautiously climbs the stairs into the kitchen, where sunlight seeps through holes in the boarded-up window. In the basement, Graham watches as Merrill reaches the top and nods for them to follow. Graham carries Morgan upstairs, navigating through a disordered kitchen and into a living room with scattered furniture. He lays Morgan on the sofa, while Bo returns and does a little dance. Graham retrieves a TV trolley, plugs it in, and is shocked to see the reflection of a humanoid form holding Morgan. Turning, he faces a tall alien, missing digits from its claw, recalling his encounter with a knife earlier. The alien extends a sharp spike over Morgan's face. Graham, Merrill, and Bo are paralyzed with horror as the alien gazes at Morgan and then Graham. Graham locks eyes with the creature, recalling past memories of a tragic accident involving Caroline, intensifying his resolve."
