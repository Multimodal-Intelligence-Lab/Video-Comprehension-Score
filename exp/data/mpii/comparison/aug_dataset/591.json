Three dark trails of smoke are produced by the clouds, swooping toward the Thames and Trafalgar Square, then swiftly passing by Leicester Square tube station, down narrow alleys and through walls into Diagon Alley. A shop is ignited, and people are injured as a man with a bag over his head is left holding by Death Eaters. Metal masks are worn by two, while a long face and beard is had by the third. The Millennium Bridge is zoomed over and woven by them, which is tilted, sways, and ultimately is crashed into the Thames, flinging people and leaving only trails of smoke rising from the river. At Surbiton Railway Station, Harry Potter is smiled at by a pretty waitress, as his bloodied face is appeared when a paper is put down, his breath is sniffed, a mint is popped into his mouth, and a train is watched passing by him. Condensation is wiped from the glass, and his eyes are fixed on the opposite platform where Professor Dumbledore is seen by him standing in front of a Divine Magic Perfume billboard.

          "description": "As lightning dramatically flashes in the skies, it illuminates a menacing skull-shaped cloud moving ominously over the bustling City of London. This eerie spectacle casts foreboding, stormy reflections upon the surface of a towering office building. Inside, anxious staff members peer out in alarm, watching the intimidating clouds approach with a sense of growing unease. The dark, foreboding clouds produce three sinister, smoky trails that swoop ominously toward the River Thames and the historic Trafalgar Square. They then swiftly sweep past the well-known Leicester Square tube station, snaking down narrow, shadowy alleys and phasing through solid walls into the magical Diagon Alley. Here, the chaos intensifies as they ignite a shop, causing injuries to unsuspecting people, while Death Eaters emerge, sinister and threatening, holding a captive man with a bag obscuring his head. Two Death Eaters ominously wear cold, metal masks, while the third, with a long, somber face and beard, adds to the menacing scene. The trio rapidly zooms away, skillfully weaving over the iconic Millennium Bridge, which begins to tilt precariously, sway violently, and ultimately crashes catastrophically into the River Thames below. This dramatic collapse flings people into the water, leaving only haunting trails of smoke rising from the disrupted river's surface. Meanwhile, at the quieter Surbiton Railway Station, an attractive waitress offers a charming smile to the world-famous Harry Potter. With a face notably marked by blood, Harry lowers his newspaper, sniffs his own breath as if checking it, then pops a mint into his mouth as he watches a train pass by. As he wipes away the condensation from the glass, his eyes become fixed on the opposite platform where he observes the serene figure of Professor Dumbledore standing poised in front of a large Divine Magic Perfume billboard. With a fond smile on his face, Harry confidently crosses over and gently takes hold of Dumbledore's left arm. Notably, he observes the professor's hand, blackened and adorned with rings, as they both spin away to appear suddenly on a bustling street. Dumbledore, with his left arm protectively around Harry, guides him adeptly through a throng of photographers whose cameras flash incessantly. As they walk purposefully past an ancient market cross, they continue down a dimly lit street, stopping with intention outside a solitary detached house."

The cloud casts stormy reflections onto the windows of a towering office building, where the staff inside, their faces etched with concern and alarm, peer out at the menacing clouds approaching from a distance. Within these dark clouds, three distinct trails of smoke begin to form, swirling and descending swiftly towards the iconic landmarks of the city, including the Thames and Trafalgar Square. The trails, like shadows darting across the landscape, rush past Leicester Square tube station, navigating through the narrow alleys with uncanny precision. Defying physical barriers, they penetrate through walls, spiraling into the magical confines of Diagon Alley with a sudden ferocity that ignites a shop and causes injuries to unsuspecting bystanders. Amidst the chaos, the enigmatic figures known as Death Eaters emerge, one of whom has a man draped with a bag over his head. Two of the Death Eaters are masked in imposing metal, while the third reveals a long face adorned with a beard. In a fluid motion, they disappear, whisking away through the air and deftly maneuvering over the Millennium Bridge. The bridge trembles, its structure violently tilting and swaying until it ultimately succumbs, crashing into the Thames below. The impact sends people careening into the water, with only trails of smoke left to rise eerily from the river’s surface. Meanwhile, at Surbiton Railway Station, a pretty waitress bestows a smile on Harry Potter, whose face, marked by fresh streaks of blood, emerges as he lowers a newspaper. He briefly sniffs his own breath with a touch of self-consciousness and discreetly pops a mint into his mouth. His attention then shifts to the train passing by, its motion drawing his gaze. As he wipes the condensation off the glass window beside him, his eyes are naturally drawn to the opposite platform, where, standing prominently in front of a Divine Magic Perfume billboard, is none other than Professor Dumbledore. Harry’s somber expression shifts to one of warmth as he smiles in recognition and promptly crosses over to join Dumbledore. He reaches out and gently holds Dumbledore's left arm, his eyes noticing the peculiar sight of the blackened hand and rings. The pair, bonded in a shared purpose, spin away from the scene, reappearing seamlessly on the street. With Dumbledore’s left arm wrapped supportively around Harry’s shoulders, they navigate through a throng of photographers, cameras flashing in rapid succession to capture the moment. As they continue their journey, they pass by a venerable market cross and proceed down a foreboding dark street, eventually halting their steps in front of an isolated detached house, a destination cloaked in mystery and significance."

Luna frowns, skips downward, and touches Snape's right knee, glimpsing his golden foot and gloves as they float upward to a meadow. Snape, with his right knee beside Luna, guides her through a river of musicians strumming their guitars, and as they glide past a village square, they journey up a bright avenue, pausing inside a cozy treehouse."

The balloons release three bright streams of confetti that spiral toward the Seine and Notre Dame, then leisurely drift past Montmartre metro station, up wide avenues and over trees into Rue de Rivoli, decorating a café and amusing tourists, as acrobats arrive holding a woman with a hat over her hair. Two wear gold helmets, while the third has a short head and mustache. They glide away and spiral under the Eiffel Tower, which bends, creaks, and gently settles into the Seine, lifting boats and leaving only streams of confetti floating on the water. At Gare du Nord, a cheerful conductor waves at Elsa the Explorer, whose bruised knee appears as she picks up a brochure, checks her watch, unwraps a candy for her mouth, and observes a bus arrive. Clearing raindrops from the window, her eyes focus on the adjacent track where she spots Captain Nemo posing in front of a Celestial Fragrance billboard. Elsa grins, strides over, and grasps Nemo's right shoulder, noticing his glowing glove and bracelets as they twirl away to an avenue. Nemo, with his right shoulder around Elsa, guides her through a crowd of dancers spinning their umbrellas, and as they stroll past a music band, they continue across a bright boulevard, pausing at a white mansion."

The balloons release three bright streams of mist that crawl toward the Serpentine and Piccadilly Circus, then gently drift past Charing Cross tube station, up wide avenues and over rooftops into Knockturn Alley, freezing a bakery and amusing people, as Mischief Makers arrive holding a cat with a hat around its ears. Two wear feathered helmets, while the third has a short nose and monocle. They drift away and loop under the Tower Bridge, which bends, bends, and eventually plunges into the Serpentine, tossing bicycles and leaving only streams of mist hovering above the water. At Waterloo Bus Depot, a cheerful musician winks at Harry Potter, whose bruised elbow emerges as he tosses down a magazine, pats his shoes, chews a gum in his mouth, and observes a tram glide. Clearing dust from the bench, his eyes lock on the adjacent stand where he notices Professor Dumbledore posing in front of a Celestial Elixirs Soap billboard. Harry grins, walks over, and grabs Dumbledore's right shoulder, observing his shiny wrist and pendants as they whirl toward a garden. Dumbledore, with his right hand around Harry, directs him through a line of tourists clicking their phones, and as they march past a fountain, they proceed along a bright meadow, pausing inside a cozy cottage."

The balloons emit three bright streams of confetti that flutter toward the Nile and Times Square, then slowly drift past Central Park subway station, up wide boulevards and over rooftops into Dessert Alley, illuminating a bakery and delighting pedestrians, as Forest Rangers enter carrying a rabbit with a ribbon around his waist. Two wear velvet hats, while the third has a wide smile and whiskers. They stroll away and glide under the Golden Gate Bridge, which bends, twists, and eventually topples into the Nile, scattering fish and leaving only trails of confetti floating above the surface. At Gotham Bus Terminal, a grumpy librarian frowns at Sherlock Holmes, whose muddy boots appear as he picks up a magazine, scratches his nose, drops a candy into his pocket, and observes a car drive by. Clearing frost from the mirror, his gaze rests on the adjacent sidewalk where he notices Professor Moriarty lounging beside a Galactic Gadget Cologne poster. Sherlock frowns, strolls over, and taps Moriarty's right shoulder, noting his glowing wristwatch and bracelets as they dance away to a beach. Moriarty, with his right shoulder nudging Sherlock, guides him through a throng of dancers clicking their fingers, and as they shuffle past a fountain square, they continue up a bright avenue, pausing inside a sprawling mansion."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

The cloud releases dark smoke trails that swoop through the city, causing chaos in Diagon Alley as Death Eaters abduct a man. Wearing metal masks and a long beard, they flee, causing the Millennium Bridge to collapse into the Thames. Meanwhile, at Surbiton Railway Station, waitress smiles at Harry Potter, who cleans up and freshens his breath as he notices Professor Dumbledore across the platform. Harry joins Dumbledore, who has a blackened hand, and they spin away together to a street. Dumbledore guides Harry through a crowd and down a dark street, stopping at a detached house."
