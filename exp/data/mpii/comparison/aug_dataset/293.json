Meanwhile, Lisa steps forward, extending her hand to retrieve the phone book from its resting place on the stand, and passes it to Jeff, who then begins to search through the directory for Thorwald's contact information as both women look on with gentle smiles. Once Jeff identifies the number, he carefully dials Chelsea 2-7099, with Lisa and Stella observing closely, their tension palpable. Lisa shifts her gaze to peer into Thorwald's apartment, prompting both Stella and Jeff to follow suit. In Thorwald's apartment, he emerges from the bedroom, dressed in a light summer coat and tie, which seems incongruous given the oppressive heat. He cautiously approaches the telephone, holding the receiver at a distance from his ear as the persistent buzzing sound emanates from it. Having finished packing all but one open suitcase, Thorwald wavers, conflicted about whether to answer the call, but ultimately succumbs to curiosity and picks up the phone. A momentary pause hangs in the air as he searches for the right words, then gazes intently at the receiver before cautiously replacing it on the hook. Thorwald stands in contemplation by the phone, his mind working through the implications, then abruptly turns and heads towards the door, methodically locking it after he exits.

          "description": "Walrus and Penelope pirouette toward the ceiling, and Walrus seizes the telescopic spoon and hoists it up to observe Mortimer, who has his brother’s vintage raccoon hat in his grasp. Mortimer shuffles briskly across the kitchen, vanishing out of view behind the curtain but reappears briefly to continue folding and tucks the hat into a nearly-stuffed backpack. He resumes folding, and Walrus sets down the spoon, twirling toward the cave where the two cats watch eagerly. Penelope lovingly examines her ear, while Walrus reacts with delight. Bianca drifts to pick up the notebook from the shelf and hands it to Walrus, who searches for Mortimer’s address in the ledger while the cats grin. He dials Fiesta 4-5623 as the cats observe eagerly. Bianca peeks at Mortimer’s cottage, succeeded by Penelope and Walrus. In Mortimer’s cottage, he emerges from the kitchen toward the gramophone, sporting a heavy winter sweater and scarf despite the chill. He holds the receiver gently away from his paw while the echo is heard. Folding is complete with one open backpack remaining. Mortimer reluctantly approaches the gramophone, wavering about answering, but eventually lifts it. There’s a moment as he seeks an answer, peers at the receiver, and gradually sets it down before Mortimer can reply. Mortimer stands at the gramophone pondering, then resolutely strides for the passageway, confirming it’s locked after departing. Walrus swivels his hoverboard as Bianca and Penelope swiftly head toward the passageway, and they pause at Walrus's whisper. Walrus calls after them, and the passageway thuds, their tracks dwindling down the tunnel as Walrus picks up the spoon and gazes down the ravine. Mortimer passes the ravine entrance, prompting Walrus to set down the spoon and scurry to the bookcase, procuring a sack of glow sticks and a mirror, setting them on his lap and returning to the ceiling. He leans out to see Bianca in the garden below, who reaches the ladder and waves at Walrus as Penelope joins her carrying a rake. The two cats rush up the ladder toward the steel bridge to scale the fence between Walrus’s meadow and Mortimer’s."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
