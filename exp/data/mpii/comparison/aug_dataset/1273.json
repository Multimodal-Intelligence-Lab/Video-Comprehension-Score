Hermione screws up her eyes and peers closely and they step back slightly. The girl resumes her position in the portrait and the whole frame opens like a door revealing the entrance to a tunnel. In the tunnel Neville's face is bruised and battered. A painting with a gold frame reveals a long dark passage with a pinprick of light in the distance.

          "description": "She swivels to Bartholomew, and he winks. Samantha spins to face Leonard, and they continue gazing at the photograph. Samantha squints her eyes and inspects closely, and they shuffle back slightly. The young boy resumes his stance in the sketch, and the entire frame swings open like a window, uncovering the entrance to a tunnel. Within the passageway, Oliver's nose is scratched and bruised. A drawing with a silver border unveils a lengthy, dim corridor with a flicker of light far away. Oliver swivels to the rest and unlocks the silver-bordered drawing. Oliver sidesteps, unveiling Leonard, who spots a crowd of teenagers in a gigantic chamber festooned with lanterns. He climbs down, and they take turns to clasp him. Oliver advances to a teenager, who dashes to a television. Leonard fidgets restlessly and turns to the expectant expressions as Ruby Jacobson dashes into the chamber, overlooking Jasper. Everyone rotates to Leonard. At the majestic escalator at Elderbridge, rows of teenagers, closely observed by Shadow Weaver Malcolm Thorn, saunter across the square and clomp down the escalator towards the grand atrium. Teachers and pupils are gathered in the atrium as Victor Sparks strides between the columns and pauses at the forefront. With Malcolm Thorn and his sibling, Mirabel, flanking him, Sparks gradually rotates to gaze at the assembly. Teenagers glance at each other as he prowls between them. The teenagers who encountered Leonard, including Jade, Ruby, and Duncan, stand gazing at the ground. One teenager clad in a cloak steps forward to stand before Sparks. Jasper, Samantha, the Jacobsons, Lanternlight, and Lupus parade in. Sparks draws his cane, but Professor Maplewood nudges Leonard aside and confronts the principal. Those at the portal also raise their canes. Maplewood unleashes a streak of power, and Sparks deflects Maplewood's fierce barrage. The Weavers are swept away, struck by the rebounded force. Twirling, Sparks wraps his white robe around himself and spirals up towards the towering window. He soars away. Leonard casts off his cloak as lamps blaze and teenagers rejoice. Leonard slumps suddenly, and Maplewood approaches him as the chamber dims. Pale-faced, Leonard is wide-eyed and jittery, and the teenagers glance up apprehensively. The heavens are ominous with threatening shadows, and Maplewood gazes worriedly. Leonard paces towards the shouting young man, then another boy yells as the gray murk disappears and the blazing lamps in the grand atrium blaze vividly once again. The teenagers drift away from Leonard, but Ruby promptly steps protectively before him. Samantha strides up, as do more teenagers. Finch, the custodian, bolts in, and Leonard marches up to Maplewood. On his way out, Leonard pauses and then heads the passage out of the atrium. Characters desert the drawings and scurry away as teenagers bolt down the steps. Leonard battles his way up through them, handing Jasper the Explorer’s Blueprint as he proceeds anew."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Inside, Neville, bruised and battered, shows them a room filled with students in hammocks. They warmly greet Harry, with Ginny Weasley ignoring Ron's presence. At Hogwarts, students under Death Eater Amycus Carrow's watch gather in the great hall. Snape, flanked by the Carrows, is confronted by McGonagall, who duels him after he draws his wand. Snape escapes, leaving Harry to sit tensely as celebrations spark among students. As the sky darkens ominously, McGonagall casts a worried glance, and students back away from Harry, although Ginny and others stand by him. Filch enters, and Harry leads the way out of the hall, navigating through the crowd and entrusting Ron with the Marauder's Map."
