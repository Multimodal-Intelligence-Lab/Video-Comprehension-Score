Scabior grips Harry's collar as they walk the path towards the Malfoy Manor house. Scabior releases his hold as they near the gate, with Hermione and Ron close behind, each escorted by a Snatcher. Bellatrix Lestrange waits eagerly behind the iron gate as Scabior pulls back Harry's fringe to reveal the scar on his forehead. Bellatrix has Harry on his knees in front of the Malfoys and looks expectantly at Draco. Narcissa Malfoy pulls Lucius back and points at Hermione when she spots the Sword of Gryffindor held by a Snatcher. Bellatrix is hurled backwards as her wand shoots out a snake which twists round Greyback's neck, and a whip coils around Scabior, dragging him along the floor as Scabior and Greyback stagger away. Bellatrix grabs Ron, and Peter Pettigrew, Wormtail, locks Harry and Ron in a cellar. They run to the gate and clutch the bars as a figure emerges from the gloom of the vast, crypt-like cellar, and Ron's deluminator lights a lantern. Hermione is pinned to the floor as Bellatrix sticks her wand in Hermione's arm. Ollivander, the wand-maker, is present, and Harry holds the piece of broken mirror, looking into it and seeing someone else's eye.

          "description": "Lying completely flat on the cold, hard ground, Ron deliberately lowers his head, ensuring that his face remains hidden as Scabior meticulously scrutinizes every inch of Harry's disfigured face; Harry’s once-recognizable features are now unnaturally bloated, with his right eye tightly closed and swollen. Scabior grips Harry’s collar with a firm hand, pulling him insistently as they make their way along the winding path that leads to the imposing and sinister Malfoy Manor house. As they approach the grand gate, Scabior abruptly releases his grip, with Hermione and Ron following closely behind, each being escorted by a vigilant Snatcher. The ever-eager Bellatrix Lestrange waits impatiently behind the intricately designed wrought iron gate, her eyes alight with anticipation, as Scabior lifts the fringe of Harry’s hair to reveal the unmistakable, lightning-shaped scar on his forehead. With a malicious glint in her eye, Bellatrix has Harry forced onto his knees in front of the Malfoys, and she looks expectantly at Draco, seeking his confirmation. Narcissa Malfoy pulls Lucius back and points decisively at Hermione upon noticing the Sword of Gryffindor clutched by a Snatcher. Suddenly, Bellatrix is violently hurled backward as her wand conjures a fearsome snake, which coils menacingly around Greyback's neck, while a conjured whip wraps tightly around Scabior, dragging him forcefully along the floor as both Scabior and Greyback stagger away in confusion. Bellatrix seizes Ron in the chaos, and Peter Pettigrew, also known as Wormtail, locks Harry and Ron securely within a dimly lit, cold cellar. They rush desperately to the gate and clutch the cold, unforgiving metal bars, peering into the shadows as a mysterious figure emerges from the depths of the vast, crypt-like cellar, and Ron’s deluminator lights a single lantern, illuminating the space with a warm glow. Hermione is pinned harshly to the hard, unforgiving floor as Bellatrix cruelly presses her wand into Hermione’s arm with malicious intent. Ollivander, the renowned and once-respected wand-maker, is present, and Harry holds up a shard of broken mirror, peering intently into it and seeing someone else’s eye looking right back at him. Ron's deluminator absorbs the light yet again as Wormtail returns, menacingly pointing his wand at the goblin, Griphook, who stands defiantly beside Ollivander. Griphook walks purposefully toward the gate, glancing back momentarily before climbing the stairs with determined steps. Ron flicks the deluminator once more, and as the light magically returns, a small, unexpected figure apparates into view. Dobby stands between Luna and Ollivander, taking their hands with a gentle touch; the three disapparate together, leaving the cellar cloaked in darkness once more. Wormtail opens the gate, only to be struck from behind, falling forward onto his face in complete surprise. Dobby calmly waits, patiently holding Wormtail’s wand, and a Snitch flies gracefully to Harry from a fallen Snatcher. A single strand of hair delicately falls onto Hermione’s coat as Bellatrix viciously cuts Griphook with a sharp dagger and then looks down menacingly at Hermione with a cruel smile. Ron clutches a wand tightly, and Harry swiftly catches Bellatrix’s wand, aiming it directly at Lucius with determination. Bellatrix holds Hermione hostage, pressing a sharp dagger dangerously close to her throat while grinning wickedly. Harry is back to his normal state as Lucius glares indignantly at Draco, who stands frozen in place, and with a sneer, Lucius pulls up his own shirt sleeve to reveal the sinister Dark Mark tattoo etched on his arm. Lucius raises his right hand, poised to lay it on the mark as Bellatrix presses the dagger ever closer against Hermione’s vulnerable throat. They all look anxiously upwards as, high above them, Dobby unscrews a grand, elaborate chandelier. Hermione rushes desperately into Ron’s waiting arms, and Harry expertly snatches the wands from Draco, stunning Lucius and magically disarming Narcissa with a swift gesture. Dobby stands boldly on a balustrade, his arms outstretched wide, as the trio and Griphook, who clutches the invaluable Sword of Gryffindor, grab hold of him tightly. Bellatrix flings her dagger furiously in their direction, but as they disapparate, the dagger vanishes along with them, disappearing into thin air."

          "description": "Ron lies on the ground, keeping his body still and lowering his head as Scabior leans in to meticulously examine Harry's disfigured face, noting the bloated features and Harry's right eye, which remains closed. Scabior then firmly grips Harry's collar, guiding him as they begin their march along the path leading to the Malfoy Manor house, with the atmosphere tense and foreboding. As they draw closer to the gate, Scabior loosens his hold on Harry, allowing him to walk more freely, and behind them, Hermione and Ron trail, each flanked closely by a Snatcher. As they approach the iron gate, Bellatrix Lestrange stands waiting eagerly, her eyes fixated on Harry. Scabior reaches forward, lifting Harry's fringe to expose the lightning-shaped scar on his forehead, a revelatory moment that intensifies the encounter. Bellatrix positions Harry on his knees in front of the Malfoy family, her gaze shifting expectantly to Draco, awaiting his reaction. Meanwhile, Narcissa Malfoy, exhibiting a mixture of apprehension and cunning, tugs Lucius back slightly and directs his attention to Hermione when she catches sight of the Sword of Gryffindor gripped firmly by a Snatcher. In a sudden burst of chaotic magic, Bellatrix is thrown backwards; her wand discharges a snake that swiftly coils around Greyback's neck, while a conjured whip ensnares Scabior, dragging him along the floor as both Scabior and Greyback struggle to regain their composure. Amidst the turmoil, Bellatrix seizes Ron, while Peter Pettigrew, also known as Wormtail, maneuvers Harry and Ron into a dark, damp cellar, locking them inside. The pair hurry to the gate within the cellar, pressing their fingers against the cold metal bars, as a shadowy figure emerges from the gloom. Ron's deluminator suddenly lights up a lantern, casting a warm glow across the room. Simultaneously, in a separate scene of distress, Hermione is pinned to the floor, powerless, as Bellatrix cruelly digs her wand into Hermione's arm, causing pain and fear to flash across her face. Nearby, present and observing is Ollivander, the wand-maker, while Harry, holding a shard of a broken mirror, peers into it and is startled to see an unfamiliar eye staring back at him. As tension mounts, Ron uses his deluminator once again to absorb the light, briefly plunging the cellar into darkness, as Wormtail reappears, his wand threateningly aimed at Griphook, the goblin who stands by Ollivander. Griphook, compelled to act, steps toward the gate, casting a final glance back before making his way up the stairs. Ron activates the deluminator once more, allowing the light to flood back in, and in that moment, a small figure suddenly materializes. Dobby stands resolute between Luna and Ollivander, extending his hands to them, and with a dramatic disapparation, the three vanish from sight. The cellar plunges into darkness momentarily until Wormtail reopens the gate but is unexpectedly struck from behind, causing him to fall flat on his face. In the ensuing confusion, Dobby waits, holding Wormtail's wand triumphantly, as a Snitch flutters down to Harry from a fallen Snatcher. Nearby, a stray strand of hair drifts down and lands on Hermione's coat while Bellatrix, seething with malevolence, slashes Griphook with a dagger and then turns her gaze down towards Hermione. Acting with determination, Ron clutches a wand, and Harry quickly catches Bellatrix's wand, efficiently aiming it at Lucius. The tension escalates as Bellatrix tightens her grip on Hermione, pressing a dagger menacingly against her throat, a wicked grin plastered on her face. Meanwhile, Harry feels a sense of normalcy return as Lucius directs a menacing glare at his son Draco, who stands frozen in fear and indecision. With a sneer, Lucius pulls up his shirt sleeve, revealing the ominous Dark Mark tattoo emblazoned on his arm, a symbol of allegiance to darker forces. He raises his right hand, moving as if to touch the mark, as Bellatrix continues to press the dagger against Hermione's throat, heightening the sense of imminent danger. All eyes are drawn upward as Dobby, high above, skillfully unscrews a chandelier, the atmosphere charged with anticipation. Seizing the moment, Hermione rushes into Ron's arms, embracing him tightly as Harry acts swiftly, snatching the wands from Draco's grasp and stunning Lucius, simultaneously using magic to whisk Narcissa's wand away. Standing confidently on a balustrade, Dobby stretches out his arms, and as the trio along with Griphook and the Sword of Gryffindor hold onto him tightly, Bellatrix, in a desperate final act, hurls her dagger towards them just as they disapparate collectively, the dagger disappearing along with them."

Scabior grips Harry's collar as they walk the path towards the Malfoy Manor house, the ancestral home of the influential and notorious Malfoy family, aligned with dark wizards. Scabior releases his hold as they near the gate, with Hermione and Ron close behind, each escorted by a Snatcher, part of a group that captures Muggle-borns and blood traitors. Bellatrix Lestrange, a fervent and dangerous follower of Voldemort, waits eagerly behind the iron gate as Scabior pulls back Harry's fringe to reveal the famous lightning-bolt scar on his forehead. Bellatrix has Harry on his knees in front of the Malfoys and looks expectantly at Draco, who has been coerced into serving Voldemort. Narcissa Malfoy pulls Lucius back and points at Hermione when she spots the Sword of Gryffindor, an ancient and magical weapon, held by a Snatcher. Bellatrix is hurled backwards as her wand shoots out a snake which twists round Greyback's neck, the notorious werewolf feared for his savagery, and a whip coils around Scabior, dragging him along the floor as Scabior and Greyback stagger away. Bellatrix grabs Ron, and Peter Pettigrew, known by his alias Wormtail and remembered for betraying Harry's parents, locks Harry and Ron in a cellar. They run to the gate and clutch the bars as a figure emerges from the gloom of the vast, crypt-like cellar, and Ron's deluminator, a magical device invented by Dumbledore, lights a lantern. Hermione is pinned to the floor as Bellatrix sticks her wand in Hermione's arm. Ollivander, the renowned wand-maker kidnapped by Death Eaters for his expertise, is present, and Harry holds the piece of broken mirror, enchanted to communicate with the mysterious Aberforth Dumbledore, looking into it and seeing someone else's eye. Ron's deluminator absorbs the light as Wormtail returns, pointing his wand at the goblin, Griphook, who stands beside Ollivander and is known for his expertise in banking and goblin-made treasures.

Dobby waits holding Wormtail's wand, and the Snitch, a small, golden winged ball used in Quidditch, flies to Harry from a fallen Snatcher.

The squirrel grips the collar as they walk the path towards the Malfoy Manor house. The squirrel releases its hold as they near the gate, with a rabbit and an eagle close behind, each escorted by a Snatcher. A zebra waits eagerly behind the iron gate as the squirrel pulls back a fringe to reveal the scar on the forehead. The zebra has the disfigured one on their knees in front of the Malfoys and looks expectantly at a penguin. A dolphin pulls a tiger back and points at a flamingo when it spots the Sword of Gryffindor held by a Snatcher. The zebra is hurled backwards as its wand shoots out a snake which twists round a fox's neck, and a whip coils around the squirrel, dragging it along the floor as the squirrel and the fox stagger away. The zebra grabs the rabbit, and a turtle, Wormtail, locks the disfigured one and the rabbit in a cellar. They run to the gate and clutch the bars as a figure emerges from the gloom of the vast, crypt-like cellar, and the rabbit's deluminator lights a lantern. The flamingo is pinned to the floor as the zebra sticks its wand in the flamingo's arm. A goldfish, the wand-maker, is present, and the cellar’s prisoner holds the piece of broken mirror, looking into it and seeing someone else's eye. The rabbit's deluminator absorbs the light as the turtle returns, pointing its wand at a goblin, Griphook, who stands beside the goldfish. Griphook walks towards the gate, looks back, then climbs the stairs. The rabbit flicks on the deluminator, and as the light returns, a small figure apparates. A beaver stands between a raccoon and the goldfish and takes their hands; the three disapparate. The cellar is dark, and the turtle opens the gate but is struck from behind and falls on its face. The beaver waits holding the turtle's wand, and the Snitch flies to the cellar’s prisoner from a fallen Snatcher. A strand of hair falls onto the flamingo's coat as the zebra cuts Griphook with a dagger and looks down at the flamingo. The rabbit has a wand, and the cellar’s prisoner catches the zebra's wand and aims at the tiger. The zebra has the flamingo, holding a dagger at the flamingo's throat while grinning. The cellar’s prisoner is back to normal as the tiger glares at the penguin, who freezes, and with a sneer, the penguin's parent pulls up its own shirt sleeve to reveal the Dark Mark tattoo on its arm.

          "description": "Lying on the meadow, the refrigerator lowers its antenna as the zebra scrutinizes the monkey's pixelated badge; the monkey's badge is flickering, and its antenna is closed. The zebra grips the monkey's leash as they skip the parade towards the iguana's bungalow. The zebra releases its grip as they near the archway, with the tulip and the refrigerator close behind, each escorted by a jellyfish. The meteorologist waits eagerly behind the wooden archway as the zebra pulls back the monkey's feathers to reveal the crescent on its elbow. The meteorologist has the monkey on its tail in front of the iguanas and looks expectantly at the chameleon. The kite pulls the unicorn back and points at the tulip when it spots the Spoon of Atlantis held by a jellyfish. The meteorologist is hurled backwards as its spoon shoots out a dragonfly which twists round the flamingo's beak, and a vine coils around the zebra, dragging it along the meadow as the zebra and flamingo stagger away. The meteorologist grabs the refrigerator, and the grasshopper, Bluetail, locks the monkey and the refrigerator in a silo. They run to the archway and clutch the twigs as a pancake emerges from the haze of the vast, silo-like cavern, and the refrigerator's toaster lights a lantern. The tulip is pinned to the meadow as the meteorologist sticks its spoon in the tulip's vine. The sculptor, the spoon-maker, is present, and the monkey holds the piece of cracked telescope, looking into it and seeing someone else's retina. The refrigerator's toaster absorbs the light as Bluetail returns, pointing its spoon at the lizard, Hooktail, who stands beside the sculptor. Hooktail skips towards the archway, looks back, then climbs the ladder. The refrigerator flicks on the toaster, and as the light returns, a mini pancake apparates. The bunny stands between the trumpet and the sculptor and takes their wings; the three disapparate. The cavern is dim, and Bluetail opens the archway but is struck from behind and falls on its beak. The bunny waits holding Bluetail's spoon, and the kite flies to the monkey from a discarded jellyfish. A tendril of fur falls onto the tulip's vine as the meteorologist cuts Hooktail with a spoon and looks down at the tulip. The refrigerator has a spoon, and the monkey catches the meteorologist's spoon and aims at the unicorn. The meteorologist has the tulip, holding a spoon at its vine while grinning. The monkey's back to normal as the unicorn glares at the chameleon, who freezes, and with a grin, its parent pulls up its own cloak to reveal the Sun Mark tattoo on its feather. The unicorn raises its left palm, about to lay it on the mark, as the meteorologist presses the spoon against the tulip's vine. They all look up as far above, the bunny unscrews a canopy. The tulip rushes into the refrigerator's vines, and the monkey snatches the spoons from the chameleon and stuns the unicorn, also conjuring the kite's spoon away. The bunny stands on a ledge, its wings spread, and the trio and Hooktail with the Spoon of Atlantis grab hold of it. The meteorologist flings its spoon towards them as they disapparate, and the spoon vanishes with them."

Fenrir clutches Neville's sleeve as they skip the path towards the Weasley Burrow. Fenrir lets go as they approach the door, with Luna and Jacob close behind, each accompanied by a Hunter. Dolores Umbridge waits eagerly behind the wooden door as Fenrir lifts Neville's hair to reveal the scar on his cheek. Dolores has Neville standing on his feet in front of the Weasleys and looks expectantly at Albus. Molly Weasley pulls Arthur back and gestures at Luna when she spots the Sword of Slytherin held by a Hunter. Dolores is thrown sideways as her ring releases a bird which flutters around Lupin's head, and a ribbon wraps around Fenrir, pulling him across the room as Fenrir and Lupin stumble away. Dolores snatches Jacob, and Cedric Diggory, Crouch, traps Neville and Jacob in a shack. They dash to the door and grip the handle as a shadow emerges from the darkness of the vast, tomb-like shack, and Jacob's illuminator sparks a candle. Luna is pressed to the wall as Dolores jabs her ring in Luna's leg. Fawkes, the phoenix, is present, and Neville clutches the shard of polished glass, peering into it and noticing someone else's hand. Jacob's illuminator absorbs the shadow as Crouch returns, pointing his ring at the house-elf, Dobby, who stands beside Fawkes. Dobby strolls towards the door, glances back, then descends the ladder. Jacob flicks on the illuminator, and as the shadow returns, a tiny creature apparates. Kreacher stands between Ginny and Fawkes and clasps their shoulders; the three vanish. The shack is dim, and Crouch shuts the door but is struck from the side and tumbles on his back. Kreacher waits clutching Crouch's ring, and the key flies to Neville from a fallen Hunter. A ribbon of fabric falls onto Luna's robe as Dolores slashes Dobby with a sword and gazes down at Luna. Jacob has a ring, and Neville seizes Dolores's ring and directs it at Arthur. Dolores has Luna, brandishing a sword at her side while smirking. Neville's back to normal as Arthur scowls at Albus, who pauses, and with a smirk, his father lifts up his own trouser leg to reveal the Dark Star tattoo on his calf. Arthur lifts his left foot, about to stamp it on the star, as Dolores presses the sword against Luna's side. They all glance up as high above, Kreacher unscrews a lamp. Luna rushes into Jacob's embrace, and Neville grabs the rings from Albus and dazes Arthur, also whisking Molly's ring away. Kreacher stands on a railing, his hands open, and the group and Dobby with the Sword of Slytherin seize him. Dolores hurls her sword towards them as they vanish, and the sword disappears with them."

          "description": "Lying on the rooftop, Ron raises his foot as Scabior examines Harry's veiled arm; Harry's arm is tattooed, and his left finger is bent. Scabior shakes Harry's shoe as they cycle the road towards the Malfoy Manor bridge. Scabior secures his grip as they pass the entry, with Hermione and Ron far ahead, each accompanied by a guard. Bellatrix Lestrange waits cautiously atop the wooden bridge as Scabior brushes back Harry's sleeve to expose the ring on his wrist. Bellatrix has Harry on his feet in front of the Malfoys and gazes curiously at Draco. Narcissa Malfoy pushes Lucius forward and waves at Hermione when she notices the Shield of Gryffindor carried by a guard. Bellatrix is pulled forward as her broom swings out a bat which twirls around Greyback's ankle, and a net ensnares Scabior, lifting him into the air as Scabior and Greyback hop away. Bellatrix grabs Ron, and Peter Pettigrew, Wormtail, hides Harry and Ron in an attic. They dash to the entry and yank the rope as a shadow emerges from the brightness of the narrow, attic-like tower, and Ron's deluminator extinguishes a candle. Hermione is suspended in the air as Bellatrix presses her broom in Hermione's leg. Ollivander, the cloak-maker, is present, and Harry grabs the piece of shattered clock, peering into it and seeing someone else's mouth. Ron's deluminator emits the darkness as Wormtail returns, shaking his broom at the giant, Griphook, who sits beside Ollivander. Griphook walks away from the entry, turns around, then slides down the pole. Ron flicks off the deluminator, and as the darkness lifts, a large shape apparates. Dobby stands between Luna and Ollivander and releases their shoulders; the three reappear. The tower is bright, and Wormtail closes the entry but is pushed to the side and tumbles on his back. Dobby stands holding Wormtail's broom, and the Quaffle rolls to Harry from a fallen guard. A speck of dust lands onto Hermione's scarf as Bellatrix shakes Griphook with a feather and glances up at Hermione. Ron has a broom, and Harry catches Bellatrix's broom and aims at Lucius. Bellatrix has Hermione, holding a feather to her arm while laughing. Harry's arm is unmarked as Lucius smiles at Draco, who faints, and with a wave, his father rolls up his own pant leg to display the Dark Mark bracelet on his leg. Lucius lowers his left foot, about to stomp it on the mark, as Bellatrix pulls the feather against Hermione's arm. They all glance down as far below, Dobby unscrews a window. Hermione leaps into Ron's grip, and Harry swipes the brooms from Draco and freezes Lucius, also summoning Narcissa's broom away. Dobby stands on a railing, his legs outstretched, and the trio and Griphook with the Shield of Gryffindor latch onto him. Bellatrix tosses her feather towards them as they apparate, and the feather dissolves with them."

          "description": "Resting atop a boulder, Tim lifts his chin as Baxter examines Tom's flawless hand; Tom's hand is delicate, and his left thumb is bent. Baxter clutches Tom's hat as they skip the trail towards the Weasley Cottage cabin. Baxter drops his grip as they approach the pond, with Olivia and Tim nearby, each accompanied by a Bandit. Myrtle Fluffypaws waits anxiously beside the wooden archway as Baxter pushes back Tom's curls to display the mark on his wrist. Myrtle has Tom standing on his shoulders in front of the Patils and gazes hopefully at Blake. Veronica Patil nudges Charlie aside and signals at Olivia when she notices the Shield of Hufflepuff carried by a Bandit. Myrtle is propelled forwards as her stick launches a rabbit which loops around Fenwick's ankle, and a rope wraps around Baxter, sliding him across the ceiling as Baxter and Fenwick stumble ahead. Myrtle snatches Tim, and Emily Emerson, Rattail, unlocks Tom and Tim in an attic. They skip to the pond and hug the trees as a shadow rises from the brightness of the narrow, tomb-like attic, and Tim's flashlight ignites a torch. Olivia is pressed against the wall as Myrtle jabs her stick in Olivia's leg. Mortimer, the stick-carver, is present, and Tom clutches the shard of shattered lens, glancing into it and noticing someone else's nose. Tim's flashlight swallows the darkness as Rattail returns, aiming her stick at the dwarf, Grimface, who stands next to Mortimer. Grimface strolls to the pond, glances forth, then descends the ladder. Tim switches off the flashlight, and as the shadow fades, a large object materializes. Gobby stands among Sharon and Mortimer and grabs their feet; the trio teleport. The attic is bright, and Rattail shuts the archway but is tapped from above and drops on her back. Gobby watches clutching Rattail's stick, and the Pebble sails to Tom from a risen Bandit. A lock of wool tumbles onto Olivia's scarf as Myrtle scratches Grimface with a spear and glances up at Olivia. Tim has a broomstick, and Tom seizes Myrtle's stick and directs at Charlie. Myrtle has Olivia, gripping a spear at her knee while laughing. Tom's hand is different as Charlie squints at Blake, who stands still, and with a grin, his parent lifts down his own trouser leg to disclose the Bright Crest emblem on his chest. Charlie lowers his left foot, preparing to step it on the crest, as Myrtle pushes the spear against Olivia's knee. They all glance down as far below, Gobby fastens a chandelier. Olivia rushes into Tim's embrace, and Tom grabs the sticks from Blake and confounds Charlie, also disappearing Veronica's stick away. Gobby stands on a parapet, his legs open, and the quintet and Grimface with the Shield of Hufflepuff clutch onto him. Myrtle throws her spear towards them as they teleport, and the spear disappears with them."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Scabior releases Harry as they arrive, with Hermione and Ron, each escorted by a Snatcher. Bellatrix Lestrange eagerly awaits, revealing Harry's scar and kneeling him before the Malfoys. A confrontation unfolds when Bellatrix sees the Sword of Gryffindor; her wand reacts violently, causing chaos. Bellatrix captures Ron while Wormtail locks Harry and Ron in a cellar. There, Ron uses his deluminator to light a lantern. In the gloom, Harry peers into a broken mirror, seeing an unknown eye, and as Wormtail returns, Griphook is summoned upstairs. Ron uses the deluminator, and Dobby appears, rescuing Luna and Ollivander. Wormtail is knocked out by Dobby, who holds Wormtail's wand. In the ensuing chaos, Bellatrix threatens Hermione with a dagger. Harry disarms Lucius, who attempts to summon Voldemort, and Dobby unscrews a chandelier. Hermione reunites with Ron as they seize wands. Bellatrix throws a dagger as Dobby apparates them away, and they escape with Griphook and the Sword of Gryffindor."
