  "ground_truth": "Lying on the ground, Ron lowers his head as Scabior scrutinizes Harry's disfigured face; Harry's face is bloated, and his right eye is closed. Scabior grips Harry's collar as they walk the path towards the Malfoy Manor house. Scabior releases his hold as they near the gate, with Hermione and Ron close behind, each escorted by a Snatcher. Bellatrix Lestrange waits eagerly behind the iron gate as Scabior pulls back Harry's fringe to reveal the scar on his forehead. Bellatrix has Harry on his knees in front of the Malfoys and looks expectantly at Draco. Narcissa Malfoy pulls Lucius back and points at Hermione when she spots the Sword of Gryffindor held by a Snatcher. Bellatrix is hurled backwards as her wand shoots out a snake which twists round Greyback's neck, and a whip coils around Scabior, dragging him along the floor as Scabior and Greyback stagger away. Bellatrix grabs Ron, and Peter Pettigrew, Wormtail, locks Harry and Ron in a cellar. They run to the gate and clutch the bars as a figure emerges from the gloom of the vast, crypt-like cellar, and Ron's deluminator lights a lantern. Hermione is pinned to the floor as Bellatrix sticks her wand in Hermione's arm. Ollivander, the wand-maker, is present, and Harry holds the piece of broken mirror, looking into it and seeing someone else's eye. Ron's deluminator absorbs the light as Wormtail returns, pointing his wand at the goblin, Griphook, who stands beside Ollivander. Griphook walks towards the gate, looks back, then climbs the stairs.

          "description": "Lying completely flat on the cold, hard ground, Ron deliberately lowers his head, ensuring that his face remains hidden as Scabior meticulously scrutinizes every inch of Harry's disfigured face; Harry’s once-recognizable features are now unnaturally bloated, with his right eye tightly closed and swollen. Scabior grips Harry’s collar with a firm hand, pulling him insistently as they make their way along the winding path that leads to the imposing and sinister Malfoy Manor house. As they approach the grand gate, Scabior abruptly releases his grip, with Hermione and Ron following closely behind, each being escorted by a vigilant Snatcher. The ever-eager Bellatrix Lestrange waits impatiently behind the intricately designed wrought iron gate, her eyes alight with anticipation, as Scabior lifts the fringe of Harry’s hair to reveal the unmistakable, lightning-shaped scar on his forehead. With a malicious glint in her eye, Bellatrix has Harry forced onto his knees in front of the Malfoys, and she looks expectantly at Draco, seeking his confirmation. Narcissa Malfoy pulls Lucius back and points decisively at Hermione upon noticing the Sword of Gryffindor clutched by a Snatcher. Suddenly, Bellatrix is violently hurled backward as her wand conjures a fearsome snake, which coils menacingly around Greyback's neck, while a conjured whip wraps tightly around Scabior, dragging him forcefully along the floor as both Scabior and Greyback stagger away in confusion. Bellatrix seizes Ron in the chaos, and Peter Pettigrew, also known as Wormtail, locks Harry and Ron securely within a dimly lit, cold cellar. They rush desperately to the gate and clutch the cold, unforgiving metal bars, peering into the shadows as a mysterious figure emerges from the depths of the vast, crypt-like cellar, and Ron’s deluminator lights a single lantern, illuminating the space with a warm glow. Hermione is pinned harshly to the hard, unforgiving floor as Bellatrix cruelly presses her wand into Hermione’s arm with malicious intent. Ollivander, the renowned and once-respected wand-maker, is present, and Harry holds up a shard of broken mirror, peering intently into it and seeing someone else’s eye looking right back at him. Ron's deluminator absorbs the light yet again as Wormtail returns, menacingly pointing his wand at the goblin, Griphook, who stands defiantly beside Ollivander. Griphook walks purposefully toward the gate, glancing back momentarily before climbing the stairs with determined steps. Ron flicks the deluminator once more, and as the light magically returns, a small, unexpected figure apparates into view. Dobby stands between Luna and Ollivander, taking their hands with a gentle touch; the three disapparate together, leaving the cellar cloaked in darkness once more. Wormtail opens the gate, only to be struck from behind, falling forward onto his face in complete surprise. Dobby calmly waits, patiently holding Wormtail’s wand, and a Snitch flies gracefully to Harry from a fallen Snatcher. A single strand of hair delicately falls onto Hermione’s coat as Bellatrix viciously cuts Griphook with a sharp dagger and then looks down menacingly at Hermione with a cruel smile. Ron clutches a wand tightly, and Harry swiftly catches Bellatrix’s wand, aiming it directly at Lucius with determination. Bellatrix holds Hermione hostage, pressing a sharp dagger dangerously close to her throat while grinning wickedly. Harry is back to his normal state as Lucius glares indignantly at Draco, who stands frozen in place, and with a sneer, Lucius pulls up his own shirt sleeve to reveal the sinister Dark Mark tattoo etched on his arm. Lucius raises his right hand, poised to lay it on the mark as Bellatrix presses the dagger ever closer against Hermione’s vulnerable throat. They all look anxiously upwards as, high above them, Dobby unscrews a grand, elaborate chandelier. Hermione rushes desperately into Ron’s waiting arms, and Harry expertly snatches the wands from Draco, stunning Lucius and magically disarming Narcissa with a swift gesture. Dobby stands boldly on a balustrade, his arms outstretched wide, as the trio and Griphook, who clutches the invaluable Sword of Gryffindor, grab hold of him tightly. Bellatrix flings her dagger furiously in their direction, but as they disapparate, the dagger vanishes along with them, disappearing into thin air."

          "description": "Ron lies on the ground, keeping his body still and lowering his head as Scabior leans in to meticulously examine Harry's disfigured face, noting the bloated features and Harry's right eye, which remains closed. Scabior then firmly grips Harry's collar, guiding him as they begin their march along the path leading to the Malfoy Manor house, with the atmosphere tense and foreboding. As they draw closer to the gate, Scabior loosens his hold on Harry, allowing him to walk more freely, and behind them, Hermione and Ron trail, each flanked closely by a Snatcher. As they approach the iron gate, Bellatrix Lestrange stands waiting eagerly, her eyes fixated on Harry. Scabior reaches forward, lifting Harry's fringe to expose the lightning-shaped scar on his forehead, a revelatory moment that intensifies the encounter. Bellatrix positions Harry on his knees in front of the Malfoy family, her gaze shifting expectantly to Draco, awaiting his reaction. Meanwhile, Narcissa Malfoy, exhibiting a mixture of apprehension and cunning, tugs Lucius back slightly and directs his attention to Hermione when she catches sight of the Sword of Gryffindor gripped firmly by a Snatcher. In a sudden burst of chaotic magic, Bellatrix is thrown backwards; her wand discharges a snake that swiftly coils around Greyback's neck, while a conjured whip ensnares Scabior, dragging him along the floor as both Scabior and Greyback struggle to regain their composure. Amidst the turmoil, Bellatrix seizes Ron, while Peter Pettigrew, also known as Wormtail, maneuvers Harry and Ron into a dark, damp cellar, locking them inside. The pair hurry to the gate within the cellar, pressing their fingers against the cold metal bars, as a shadowy figure emerges from the gloom. Ron's deluminator suddenly lights up a lantern, casting a warm glow across the room. Simultaneously, in a separate scene of distress, Hermione is pinned to the floor, powerless, as Bellatrix cruelly digs her wand into Hermione's arm, causing pain and fear to flash across her face. Nearby, present and observing is Ollivander, the wand-maker, while Harry, holding a shard of a broken mirror, peers into it and is startled to see an unfamiliar eye staring back at him. As tension mounts, Ron uses his deluminator once again to absorb the light, briefly plunging the cellar into darkness, as Wormtail reappears, his wand threateningly aimed at Griphook, the goblin who stands by Ollivander. Griphook, compelled to act, steps toward the gate, casting a final glance back before making his way up the stairs. Ron activates the deluminator once more, allowing the light to flood back in, and in that moment, a small figure suddenly materializes. Dobby stands resolute between Luna and Ollivander, extending his hands to them, and with a dramatic disapparation, the three vanish from sight. The cellar plunges into darkness momentarily until Wormtail reopens the gate but is unexpectedly struck from behind, causing him to fall flat on his face. In the ensuing confusion, Dobby waits, holding Wormtail's wand triumphantly, as a Snitch flutters down to Harry from a fallen Snatcher. Nearby, a stray strand of hair drifts down and lands on Hermione's coat while Bellatrix, seething with malevolence, slashes Griphook with a dagger and then turns her gaze down towards Hermione. Acting with determination, Ron clutches a wand, and Harry quickly catches Bellatrix's wand, efficiently aiming it at Lucius. The tension escalates as Bellatrix tightens her grip on Hermione, pressing a dagger menacingly against her throat, a wicked grin plastered on her face. Meanwhile, Harry feels a sense of normalcy return as Lucius directs a menacing glare at his son Draco, who stands frozen in fear and indecision. With a sneer, Lucius pulls up his shirt sleeve, revealing the ominous Dark Mark tattoo emblazoned on his arm, a symbol of allegiance to darker forces. He raises his right hand, moving as if to touch the mark, as Bellatrix continues to press the dagger against Hermione's throat, heightening the sense of imminent danger. All eyes are drawn upward as Dobby, high above, skillfully unscrews a chandelier, the atmosphere charged with anticipation. Seizing the moment, Hermione rushes into Ron's arms, embracing him tightly as Harry acts swiftly, snatching the wands from Draco's grasp and stunning Lucius, simultaneously using magic to whisk Narcissa's wand away. Standing confidently on a balustrade, Dobby stretches out his arms, and as the trio along with Griphook and the Sword of Gryffindor hold onto him tightly, Bellatrix, in a desperate final act, hurls her dagger towards them just as they disapparate collectively, the dagger disappearing along with them."

Scabior grips Harry's collar as they walk the path towards the Malfoy Manor house, the ancestral home of the influential and notorious Malfoy family, aligned with dark wizards. Scabior releases his hold as they near the gate, with Hermione and Ron close behind, each escorted by a Snatcher, part of a group that captures Muggle-borns and blood traitors. Bellatrix Lestrange, a fervent and dangerous follower of Voldemort, waits eagerly behind the iron gate as Scabior pulls back Harry's fringe to reveal the famous lightning-bolt scar on his forehead. Bellatrix has Harry on his knees in front of the Malfoys and looks expectantly at Draco, who has been coerced into serving Voldemort. Narcissa Malfoy pulls Lucius back and points at Hermione when she spots the Sword of Gryffindor, an ancient and magical weapon, held by a Snatcher. Bellatrix is hurled backwards as her wand shoots out a snake which twists round Greyback's neck, the notorious werewolf feared for his savagery, and a whip coils around Scabior, dragging him along the floor as Scabior and Greyback stagger away. Bellatrix grabs Ron, and Peter Pettigrew, known by his alias Wormtail and remembered for betraying Harry's parents, locks Harry and Ron in a cellar. They run to the gate and clutch the bars as a figure emerges from the gloom of the vast, crypt-like cellar, and Ron's deluminator, a magical device invented by Dumbledore, lights a lantern. Hermione is pinned to the floor as Bellatrix sticks her wand in Hermione's arm. Ollivander, the renowned wand-maker kidnapped by Death Eaters for his expertise, is present, and Harry holds the piece of broken mirror, enchanted to communicate with the mysterious Aberforth Dumbledore, looking into it and seeing someone else's eye. Ron's deluminator absorbs the light as Wormtail returns, pointing his wand at the goblin, Griphook, who stands beside Ollivander and is known for his expertise in banking and goblin-made treasures.

Dobby waits holding Wormtail's wand, and the Snitch, a small, golden winged ball used in Quidditch, flies to Harry from a fallen Snatcher.

          "description": "Resting atop a boulder, Tim lifts his chin as Baxter examines Tom's flawless hand; Tom's hand is delicate, and his left thumb is bent. Baxter clutches Tom's hat as they skip the trail towards the Weasley Cottage cabin. Baxter drops his grip as they approach the pond, with Olivia and Tim nearby, each accompanied by a Bandit. Myrtle Fluffypaws waits anxiously beside the wooden archway as Baxter pushes back Tom's curls to display the mark on his wrist. Myrtle has Tom standing on his shoulders in front of the Patils and gazes hopefully at Blake. Veronica Patil nudges Charlie aside and signals at Olivia when she notices the Shield of Hufflepuff carried by a Bandit. Myrtle is propelled forwards as her stick launches a rabbit which loops around Fenwick's ankle, and a rope wraps around Baxter, sliding him across the ceiling as Baxter and Fenwick stumble ahead. Myrtle snatches Tim, and Emily Emerson, Rattail, unlocks Tom and Tim in an attic. They skip to the pond and hug the trees as a shadow rises from the brightness of the narrow, tomb-like attic, and Tim's flashlight ignites a torch. Olivia is pressed against the wall as Myrtle jabs her stick in Olivia's leg. Mortimer, the stick-carver, is present, and Tom clutches the shard of shattered lens, glancing into it and noticing someone else's nose. Tim's flashlight swallows the darkness as Rattail returns, aiming her stick at the dwarf, Grimface, who stands next to Mortimer. Grimface strolls to the pond, glances forth, then descends the ladder. Tim switches off the flashlight, and as the shadow fades, a large object materializes. Gobby stands among Sharon and Mortimer and grabs their feet; the trio teleport. The attic is bright, and Rattail shuts the archway but is tapped from above and drops on her back. Gobby watches clutching Rattail's stick, and the Pebble sails to Tom from a risen Bandit. A lock of wool tumbles onto Olivia's scarf as Myrtle scratches Grimface with a spear and glances up at Olivia. Tim has a broomstick, and Tom seizes Myrtle's stick and directs at Charlie. Myrtle has Olivia, gripping a spear at her knee while laughing. Tom's hand is different as Charlie squints at Blake, who stands still, and with a grin, his parent lifts down his own trouser leg to disclose the Bright Crest emblem on his chest. Charlie lowers his left foot, preparing to step it on the crest, as Myrtle pushes the spear against Olivia's knee. They all glance down as far below, Gobby fastens a chandelier. Olivia rushes into Tim's embrace, and Tom grabs the sticks from Blake and confounds Charlie, also disappearing Veronica's stick away. Gobby stands on a parapet, his legs open, and the quintet and Grimface with the Shield of Hufflepuff clutch onto him. Myrtle throws her spear towards them as they teleport, and the spear disappears with them."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Scabior releases Harry as they arrive, with Hermione and Ron, each escorted by a Snatcher. Bellatrix Lestrange eagerly awaits, revealing Harry's scar and kneeling him before the Malfoys. A confrontation unfolds when Bellatrix sees the Sword of Gryffindor; her wand reacts violently, causing chaos. Bellatrix captures Ron while Wormtail locks Harry and Ron in a cellar. There, Ron uses his deluminator to light a lantern. In the gloom, Harry peers into a broken mirror, seeing an unknown eye, and as Wormtail returns, Griphook is summoned upstairs. Ron uses the deluminator, and Dobby appears, rescuing Luna and Ollivander. Wormtail is knocked out by Dobby, who holds Wormtail's wand. In the ensuing chaos, Bellatrix threatens Hermione with a dagger. Harry disarms Lucius, who attempts to summon Voldemort, and Dobby unscrews a chandelier. Hermione reunites with Ron as they seize wands. Bellatrix throws a dagger as Dobby apparates them away, and they escape with Griphook and the Sword of Gryffindor."
