He stands galvanized before going to the kitchenette, where he lifts the lid of the sugar bowl on the counter under the cupboards. There's nothing but sugar in the bowl, but lining the lid is a folded five-dollar bill, which Don takes out.

Rising with a measured, deliberate slowness from the comfort of the couch, he cautiously takes a few tentative steps towards the entrance door. There, standing firmly, is Mrs. Foley, who is a middle-aged charwoman. Draped over her arm is a large utility bag that seems to tell tales of daily errands. Don stands there, momentarily galvanized, before snapping out of his daze and heading directly to the kitchenette. Upon reaching it, he lifts the lid of the sugar bowl resting on the counter beneath the cupboards. Inside the bowl is nothing but sugar, but hidden cleverly along the lid is a folded five-dollar bill, which Don hurriedly retrieves. He makes his way back into the entrance hall and, though Mrs. Foley cannot see him, instinctively tucks the five-dollar note behind his back. She closes the door with a resolute click, takes the key with her, and begins her journey down the stairs. Don gazes intently at the five-dollar bill, carefully folds it, and tucks it into his pocket. He places his hat on his head and, with a sudden afterthought, heads into the living room.

From his vantage point behind the rack, through the glass door, Don Birnam can be seen hurrying towards the shop with purpose. He peers inside, ensuring that the coast is clear and that no other customers are present, then rapidly steps inside, breathing heavily with anxiety. With a furtive glance in each direction to confirm he's not being watched, he proceeds. A salesman, with his back to the camera, rises into the foreground just as Don gestures towards two specific bottles. The salesman dutifully retrieves the bottles from the rack and places them on the counter. In exchange, Don quickly hands him the money and clutches the bottles with the eagerness of a miser seizing precious gold.

He takes the package and skillfully maneuvers past a newcomer towards the door, concealing it with the grace of a football player executing a sneaky play. Emerging into the open with the bottles safely ensconced in the paper bag, Don pauses in front of a fruit stand. With a careful, deliberate move shielded from view by his back, he picks up three apples and places them strategically at the top of the bag to cleverly disguise the bottles beneath.

There, he finds Mrs. Foley, a middle-aged charwoman, standing with a large utility bag slung over her arm. He stands there, momentarily stunned and galvanized, before he decisively heads to the kitchenette. Upon reaching the counter situated under the cupboards, he gently lifts the lid of the sugar bowl. Upon inspection, he finds nothing but sugar, but cleverly tucked within the lining of the lid is a folded five-dollar bill, which he deftly removes. Transitioning into the entrance hall, he instinctively hides the five dollars behind his back, although Mrs. Foley is unable to see him. She closes the door behind her, secures the key, and begins her descent down the stairs. Don takes a moment to gaze at the five-dollar bill, folding it neatly with precision before slipping it into his pocket. He then places his hat atop his head and, after a brief second thought, turns towards the living room. As the camera pans slowly, it captures a rack of liquor bottles, revealing the shop with its window facing Third Avenue, alongside its entrance door. From this vantage point, Don Birnam is observed hurrying towards the shop. Upon arriving, he peers cautiously inside to confirm that no other customers are present before he darts inside, where he stands, breathing heavily. His eyes quickly scan each direction, ensuring he remains unseen. The salesman, with his back turned to the camera, rises in the foreground as Don gestures towards two bottles. Responding to his indication, the salesman retrieves the two bottles from the rack and places them on the counter. Don hands over the money with a quick, furtive motion, snatching the bottles as if they were prized treasures. The salesman, stepping out of the frame towards the cash register, returns with a bag, while Don hurriedly shoves the bottles inside. The change the salesman offers is slightly less than expected, and as Don pockets it, he notices the necks of the bottles protruding slightly from the bag. Clutching the package with a calculated attempt at discreetness, Don strides past a newcomer towards the door, shielding the package as if executing a skillful football maneuver. Emerging with the bottles securely hidden in the paper bag, he halts in front of a nearby fruit stand. With his back shielding his actions from nearby ladies, he discreetly selects three apples and arranges them at the top of the bag, effectively camouflaging the bottles within. He places a coin down in payment and, with the bag now appearing to brim with apples, walks confidently down the street. As he approaches, a lady with a dog notices him, and despite his intention to proceed, he finds himself only twenty-five feet away from two middle-aged Hokinson ladies, one of whom is preoccupied with managing her dog on a leash."

          "description": "Don freezes his eyes turning towards the door horrified. He rises slowly from the couch and takes a few steps towards the entrance door where Mrs Foley a middleaged charwoman with a large utility bag over her arm stands. He stands galvanized before going to the kitchenette where he lifts the lid of the sugar bowl on the counter under the cupboards. There is nothing but sugar in the bowl but lining the lid is a folded fivedollar bill which Don takes out. He goes into the entrance hall and even though Mrs Foley cannot see him instinctively holds the five dollars behind his back. She closes the door takes the key and starts down the stairs. It is a little short and the necks of the bottles protrude which Don pockets. Don takes the package and walks past a newcomer towards the door hiding it gracefully like a football in a sneak play. Don comes out with the bottles in the paper bag and stops in front of a fruit stand. Screening his gesture from the ladies with his back he picks up three apples and puts them in the top of the bag to camouflage the bottles. He puts down a coin then walks down the street toward the ladies flaunting a paper bag which is obviously full of apples. The lady with the dog sees him and although he wants to start down the street about twentyfive feet away stand two middleaged Hokinson ladies one of them kerbing her dog on a leash."

          "description": "Max halts, his gaze shifting towards the window, stunned. He springs up quickly from the chair and ambles a few steps towards the patio door, where Mr. Jenkins, an elderly accountant with a small satchel over his shoulder, waits. Max pauses electrified before rushing to the dining room, where he opens the cover of the cookie jar on the table beside the shelves. There's nothing but cookies in the jar, but tucked inside the cover is a rolled ten-dollar coin, which Max extracts. He moves into the foyer and, even though Mr. Jenkins can't glimpse him, instinctively hides the ten dollars behind his back. He locks the window, takes the lock, and saunters down the ladder. Max examines the ten-dollar coin, rolls it carefully, pockets it, puts on his scarf, and, with a second thought, heads into the study. The camera drifts slowly toward a shelf of flower vases, revealing the gallery, its curtain on Main Street, and its patio door. From beyond the shelf, through the glass curtain, Max Linden is spotted darting up to the gallery. He glances inside to ensure there are no other visitors, then swiftly strides inside and stands panting lightly. He casts a brief look in each direction to confirm he's not perceived. A cashier, with his back to the lens, rises in the foreground as Max gestures to three bouquets. The cashier lifts three bouquets from the shelf and lays them on the table. Max hands him the currency and clutches the bouquets like a dragon hoarding gems. The cashier gives him a basket and steps out of the frame toward the vault. Meanwhile, Max thrusts the bouquets in the basket. The cashier returns his difference. It is a little lacking, and the blooms of the bouquets jut out, which Max stows. Max takes the collection and strolls past a guest toward the exit, concealing it elegantly like a magician in a trick move. Max emerges with the bouquets in the wicker basket and halts before a vegetable stall. Concealing his motion from the gentlemen with his side, he picks up five oranges and tucks them into the top of the basket to disguise the bouquets. He sets down a token, then meanders down the aisle towards the gentlemen, flaunting a wicker basket which is conspicuously full of oranges. The gentleman with the bird notices him, and although he wishes to proceed down the path, about thirty feet distant stand two elderly Anderson ladies, one of them restraining her bird on a string."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

          "description": "Don, initially frozen in shock, cautiously approaches the door where Mrs. Foley, a middle-aged charwoman, stands. He retrieves a hidden five-dollar bill from a sugar bowl lid in the kitchenette. As Mrs. Foley leaves, Don discreetly conceals the money and heads to a liquor shop. Ensuring he is unobserved, Don hastily enters the shop, indicates two bottles to the salesman, pays, and carefully conceals them in a bag. He exits, stopping at a fruit stand to disguise the bottles with apples. He places a coin on the stand, cleverly masking his purchase, and continues down the street, passing by two middle-aged women and a leashed dog."
