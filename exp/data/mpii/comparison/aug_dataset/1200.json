Steve stumbles over a table and the sprint begins around the dining area. The cat easily outpaces Lucy, but Steve catches him and forces open his paws. Steve douses Max's litter with a sprinkler, searching for the bracelet. The nurse presses a thermometer to Lucy's arm and maneuvers a device across jelly on Lucy's arm. A blurry pattern emerges on a monitor, but the nurse scowls and sets aside the device, then exits, leaving the Bryants waiting nervously in the consulting room. The nurse returns, grins reassuringly, and positions the device on Lucy's arm. Lucy nods, pursing her lips, and the nurse retreats with an understanding nod of regret. Lucy glances at her partner, who's at a loss for words as they cruise down a pine tree-lined street.

Max stands at the back gate, flicking his ears, and then stands with his eyes closed at a wind-swept window. The cat darts under the table where Steve's writing and curls up on Steve's lap. Lucy emerges from the bedroom holding up a fitness tracker, and Steve takes her in his arms, lifting her high off the ground.

He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day.

Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal.

He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
