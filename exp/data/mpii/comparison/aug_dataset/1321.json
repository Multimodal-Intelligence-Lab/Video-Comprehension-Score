Kyle gazes at Audrey's gorgeous, resolute visage and then extracts his argent .45. The headlights transform into a family van skidding wildly off the road to halt at the stations, and Kyle and Audrey direct their arms at the automobile. A finely-dressed gentleman in his mid-thirties leaps out of the car, glancing around apprehensively, and after perceiving the coast is unobstructed, he gives a pacifying wave to his spouse and young lad who await nervously inside the car. He dashes around to the fuel dispenser as Kyle and Audrey swivel to glance out over the posterior side of the eatery, observing a legion of murky forms swarming in fast. Kyle peers urgently back at the family as the father hoists the pump, and Kyle and Audrey signal their limbs desperately at the family. Kyle discharges his firearm into the sky, and at the noise of gunshot, the man glances quickly up to the roof, and his family commences to yell to him. The man can only observe outlines in the light, but he doesn't pause to discern if they are ally or adversary. Audrey observes in terror as the dark forms reach the diner. The father bolts to the driver's flank but notices a blur of motion rushing at him, and his blood stains the car panes. Kyle elevates his MP5 to discharge upon the dark shapes that encircle the vehicle like swarming vermin. The possessed advance in from all directions, but Kyle is remarkably nimble, dropping them one after another. He closes in on the family, blasting back the entities clustered around them, and discovers the young boy curled up with his hands protectively covering his visage.

Kyle halts, sensing something dreadfully amiss. Audrey elevates the .45 and pulls the trigger, but it clicks. She continues pulling the trigger as the boy's tears cease instantaneously. Audrey retreats and peers toward the entry to the diner, obstructed by advancing entities. They're everywhere, and she's ensnared. She notices the open doorway to the van, dives into the car, and as the entities swiftly close in, she slams the auto door lock. Clunk! She moves to the center of the car as grotesque visages press against the panes, a nightmare materialized. Charlie dashes to Michael's flank, but he's immovable. Charlie cocks the weapon, moves toward the door, and glances back at him defiantly."

A family minivan is careening wildly off the highway to stop at the pumps, and the vehicle is aimed at by Kyle and Audrey with their weapons. A well-dressed man in his mid-thirties jumps out of the car, looking around nervously, and after the coast is seen as clear by him, a calming wave is offered to his wife and young boy who wait anxiously inside the car. He races around to the gas pump as the back side of the diner is spun to be looked out over by Kyle and Audrey, seeing an army of dark shapes swarming in fast. The family is looked at urgently by Kyle as the pump is lifted by the father, and frantic waves are given to the family by Kyle and Audrey. Kyle fires his gun in the air, and at the sound of gunfire, the roof is quickly looked up to by the man, and screams to him are started by his family. Silhouettes can only be seen by the man in the light, but seeing if they are friend or foe isn't waited for by him. Dark shapes are watched in horror by Audrey as they reach the diner. The driver's side is dashed to by the father, but a blur of movement rushing at him is seen, and the car windows are painted with his blood. Kyle raises his MP5 to fire upon the vehicle-surrounding dark shapes that swarm like insects.

Meanwhile, the headlights reveal themselves to belong to a family minivan that is careening wildly off the highway only to come to a sudden halt at the gas pumps. Instantly, Kyle and Audrey find themselves on high alert, raising their weapons and pointing them at the vehicle with intense focus. \n\nEmerging from the car is a well-dressed man, appearing to be in his mid-thirties. He jumps out with a look of nervousness etched onto his face. After taking a careful glance around to ensure there are no immediate threats, he offers a soothing wave to his wife and young son, who sit anxiously inside the confines of the minivan.

Meanwhile, Kyle is intently focused on Audrey's beautiful, determined face before he reaches down and retrieves his silver 45 from his side. The headlights soon reveal themselves to belong to a family minivan that is careening wildly off the highway, suddenly coming to a stop at the gas pumps. In response, Kyle and Audrey swiftly raise their weapons, taking aim at the approaching vehicle. From the minivan, a well-dressed man in his mid-thirties hastily emerges, his eyes darting around nervously as he scans the area. Once assured the coast is clear, he turns back to the car, waving reassuringly to his wife and young boy who are waiting anxiously inside. The man hastens to the gas pump, and at that moment, Kyle and Audrey pivot, their attention drawn by an ominous sight of dark shapes quickly swarming in from the back side of the diner. Kyle turns his urgent gaze back to the family as the father lifts the gas pump handle, and he and Audrey frantically wave their arms in warning. In desperation, Kyle fires his gun into the air, the gunshot echoing through the night. Startled by the sound, the man instinctively looks up towards the rooftop while his family's screams pierce the air. Despite the chaos, he can only make out silhouettes in the glaring light, but sensing immediate danger, he decides not to wait to determine if the figures he sees are friend or foe. Audrey watches in horror as the menacing dark shapes reach the periphery of the diner. The father hastily darts toward the driverâ€™s side of the minivan, only to be met by a swift blur of movement, and in the next instant, his blood splatters, painting the car windows in crimson. Kyle, with urgency, raises his MP5 and begins firing upon the dark figures that have enveloped the vehicle like a swarm of insects. Despite being surrounded by these possessed beings from all sides, Kyle displays remarkable agility, skillfully taking them down one by one. He methodically pushes forward, clearing the creatures surrounding the family and reaches the young boy, who is curled up, hands shielding his face from the terror around him. With swift and decisive action, Kyle swoops down, gathering the boy into his arms before moving on to the mother. Mysteriously, the creatures have ceased their aggressive advance and are instead standing silently, simply watching him. Kyle halts, a chilling sense of something being terribly amiss washing over him. Meanwhile, Audrey, in a desperate bid to defend herself, raises the 45 and pulls the trigger, but is met with only the hollow click of an empty chamber. Her futile attempts to pull the trigger continue as the boy suddenly ceases his tears. Audrey, filled with dread, backs away, her gaze shifting toward the dinerâ€™s entrance now blocked by the advancing creatures. Realizing she is surrounded, she spots the open door of the minivan and makes a split-second decision to dive into the vehicle. As the creatures rapidly close in on her position, she slams the auto door lock with a decisive clunk, ensuring her temporary safety. She moves to the center of the car, besieged by grotesque faces pressing against the windows, a living nightmare encroaching. Meanwhile, Charlie rushes to Michael's side, desperately urging him for action, but Michael remains motionless, unyielding. Determined and defiant, Charlie cocks his gun, moves purposefully toward the door, and casts a last glance back at Michael, ready to face whatever comes."

Kyle stares at Audrey's beautiful, determined face and then pulls out his silver 45, a trusted sidearm model known for its reliability and stopping power. The headlights reveal a family minivan, an enduring symbol of suburban life, careening wildly off the highway to stop at the pumps of a remote gas station surrounded by dense woods, and Kyle and Audrey aim their weapons at the vehicle. A well-dressed man in his mid-thirties, possibly a corporate executive based on his attire, jumps out of the car, looking around nervously, and after seeing the coast is clear, he offers a calming wave to his wife and young boy who wait anxiously inside the car, clutching each other in fear. He races around to the gas pump as Kyle and Audrey spin to look out over the back side of the diner, a place that once served as a popular roadside stop for travelers, now eerily deserted, seeing an army of dark shapes swarming in fast like an ominous, moving shadow. Kyle looks urgently back at the family as the father, in a frantic hurry, lifts the pump, and Kyle and Audrey wave their arms frantically at the family. Kyle fires his gun in the air, a desperate attempt to warn them, and at the sound of gunfire, the man looks quickly up to the roof, and his family starts to scream to him in terror. The man can only see silhouettes in the light, but he doesn't wait to see if they are friend or foe. Audrey watches in horror as the dark shapes, possibly the rumored creatures that locals say haunt these woods, reach the diner. The father dashes to the driver's side but sees a blur of movement rushing at him, and his blood paints the car windows, a gruesome testament to the danger they face. Kyle raises his MP5, a submachine gun typically used by special forces, to fire upon the dark shapes that surround the vehicle like swarming insects. The possessed, a name given to these creatures by the few who have survived encounters, move in from all sides, but Kyle is remarkably agile, dropping them one after another with precision. He closes in on the family, blasting back the creatures huddled around them, and finds the young boy curled up with his hands protectively covering his face, a subconscious attempt to hide from the horror around him. Kyle swoops down, gathers the boy into his arms, invoking a sense of urgency and protection, and moves on to the mother. The creatures have stopped coming at him; instead, they're just standing there watching him, a chilling display of intelligence. Kyle freezes, sensing something terribly wrong, an instinct honed from past experiences with danger. Audrey raises the 45 and pulls the trigger, but it clicks, signaling an empty magazine at the worst possible moment.

They're everywhere, and she's trapped. She notices the open door to the minivan, dives into the car, and as the creatures rapidly close in, she hammers the auto door lock. Clunk! The reassuring sound of safety amidst chaos. She moves to the center of the car as gruesome faces press against the windows, a nightmare come to life that she never imagined facing. Charlie rushes to Michael's side, but he's immovable, perhaps frozen by fear or a deeper sense of doom. Charlie cocks the gun, preparing to defend them, moves toward the door, and looks back at him defiantly, as if daring the darkness to take them."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby cafÃ©, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
