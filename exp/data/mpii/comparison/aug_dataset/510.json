Later, the park is walked through by Alyssa and Holden, who eat hot dogs, and upon the reaching of a swing set, the swings are sat down on by them. A hand is held up by Alyssa, and after she's chewed, her tongue, which is just huge, is released by her, leaving Holden transfixed.

A four-way stop is drawn by Banky, and after the drawing is finished, illustration according to his voice-over occurs. The head of Holden shakes and a storm away occurs, with a following by Banky. A long moment is taken by Holden to look at Banky as a stare is returned by Banky, then suddenly, a softening and dropping of his head occurs, and his eyes are looked into by him as he walks away, while a watch is given by Holden as he goes and exits. Her food is picked through by Alyssa as she and Holden sit at a booth, then her bag is grabbed by her, she slides out of the booth, and the cashier's desk is headed to by her with Holden following, offering a puzzled shrug.

Later on, Alyssa and Holden find themselves taking a leisurely stroll through the picturesque park, enjoying hot dogs along the way. As they meander through the greenery, they approach a swing set and decide to sit down.

Later, Alyssa and Holden meander through the park, each savoring a hot dog as they stroll. Upon reaching a swing set, they settle down on the swings, gently rocking back and forth.

With a playful smile, Alyssa retracts her tongue, stands up from the swing, and walks away, leaving Holden sitting on the swing, bewildered. Alyssa soon returns as Banky struggles to manage an awkwardly large amount of luggage, attempting to find balance, while Holden checks his beeper and takes his leave. Banky begins to gather and organize his scattered magazines, and as he does so, a young child enters the scene, stopping to stare curiously at Banky before vanishing from sight, leaving Banky standing there in open-mouthed astonishment. They proceed to the skee-ball lanes, where Holden takes his turn, carefully rolling the ball and successfully landing it within a twenty-point circle. Alyssa then picks up a ball, squints with determination as she aims, and throws it with an overhand motion, inadvertently causing it to ricochet off one of the circles and rebound toward them, prompting both to duck. Holden instinctively ducks again as the ball, defying expectations, sails back toward his head. He then rises, and in a moment of surprise, he throws the ball with an unexpected trajectory, causing it to careen off the ceiling and shatter the glass of an old pinball machine, eliciting laughter from Alyssa.

Holden trails after her, offering a puzzled shrug in response to the sudden movement.

Later, Alyssa and Holden walk through Central Park, a famous landmark in New York City known for its sprawling landscapes and recreational areas, eating hot dogs, a staple of New York street food, and upon reaching a swing set, they sit down on the swings. Alyssa holds up her hand, and after swallowing what she's chewing, she releases her tongue, which is just huge, leaving Holden transfixed by the unexpected display of her talent. Alyssa wraps it back up with a smile and stands, then exits while Holden remains in the swing. Alyssa returns as Banky tries to balance way-too-much luggage, likely from a recent trip or move, while Holden checks his beeper, a once-common personal device for receiving messages, and exits. Banky starts packing his magazines up, nostalgic collections of classic comic art, and a little kid enters, staring at him before disappearing, leaving Banky standing open-mouthed. They head toward the skee-ball runs, a popular arcade game with roots in early 20th-century amusement parks, where Holden rolls the ball, landing it in a twenty-point circle. Alyssa picks up a ball, squints to aim, and throws it overhand, causing it to pop off one of the circles and shoot back, making them duck. Holden reacts as Alyssa laughs, and he ducks again as the ball comes sailing back at his head, then gets up and throws the ball in surprise, causing it to ricochet off the ceiling and smash through the glass of an old pinball machine, a relic from the golden age of arcades, while Alyssa laughs. Later, Banky sits there, shocked, puts the controller down for the latest video game technology, and crosses to the drawing table, a place of creativity and focus, where Holden starts drawing as Banky stares at him, then starts drawing something himself. Banky draws a four-way stop, a common intersection design in American roadways, finishes drawing, and illustrates according to his voice-over. Holden shakes his head and storms away, with Banky following. Holden looks at Banky for a long moment as Banky stares back, then suddenly softens and drops his head, looks into Holden's eyes, a moment of unspoken understanding between close friends, and walks away, while Holden watches him go and exits. Alyssa picks through her food at a retro-style diner as she and Holden sit at a booth, then she grabs her bag, slides out of the booth, and heads to the cashier's desk with Holden following, offering a puzzled shrug. Alyssa gestures with a 'just wait' finger when the cashier turns to her, perhaps settling the bill or arranging something unexpected, as Holden stares at her, then ahead, swerving the wheel to the right to pull the car to the side of the road, throws it into park, noting the rain is a bit heavier now, reminiscent of a classic romantic movie moment. Holden stares at Alyssa, and she stares back before getting out of the car. With the rain now pouring, Alyssa starts hitching up the road, and Holden reaches her, with both being drenched, creating a dramatic scene. She shakes her head ruefully and walks away, leaving Holden standing there at a loss before he turns and heads back to his car."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
