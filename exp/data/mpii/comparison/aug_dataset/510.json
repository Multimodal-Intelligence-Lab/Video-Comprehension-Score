Alyssa soon returns as Banky struggles to manage an awkwardly large amount of luggage, attempting to find balance, while Holden checks his beeper and takes his leave. Banky begins to gather and organize his scattered magazines, and as he does so, a young child enters the scene, stopping to stare curiously at Banky before vanishing from sight, leaving Banky standing there in open-mouthed astonishment. They proceed to the skee-ball lanes, where Holden takes his turn, carefully rolling the ball and successfully landing it within a twenty-point circle. Alyssa then picks up a ball, squints with determination as she aims, and throws it with an overhand motion, inadvertently causing it to ricochet off one of the circles and rebound toward them, prompting both to duck.

Later, Alyssa and Holden walk through Central Park, a famous landmark in New York City known for its sprawling landscapes and recreational areas, eating hot dogs, a staple of New York street food, and upon reaching a swing set, they sit down on the swings.

          "description": "Griffin tilts forward into the hammock, wearing a confused grin, as the Engineers and Rake howl, prompting Miles and Griffin to awkwardly join in, though Griffin tosses Miles a 'these folks are clueless' glare, and Miles grins. Later, Clara and Miles stroll through the forest, munching on pretzels, and upon reaching a boulder, they plop down on the rocks. Clara raises her foot, and after gulping what she's chewing, she unveils her wrist, which is just enormous, leaving Miles mesmerized. Clara tucks it back with a chuckle and rises, then departs while Miles stays on the rock. Clara returns as Griffin struggles to juggle way-too-many umbrellas, while Miles checks his pager and departs. Griffin begins stacking his newspapers up, and a small cat sneaks in, glaring at him before vanishing, leaving Griffin standing slack-jawed. They shuffle toward the merry-go-round, where Miles spins the wheel, landing it in a ten-point basket. Clara picks up a disc, squints to focus, and launches it underhand, causing it to skip off one of the targets and whiz back, making them duck. Miles blinks as Clara giggles, and he ducks again as the disc comes whizzing past his ear, then leaps up and flips the disc in shock, causing it to deflect off the ceiling and crash through the window of an ancient jukebox, while Clara giggles. Later, Griffin flops there, stunned, sets the joystick down, and paces to the painting bench, where Miles begins sketching as Griffin gawks at him, then starts doodling something himself. Griffin sketches a roundabout, finishes sketching, and illustrates according to his monologue. Miles sighs and storms away, with Griffin tailing him. Miles glares at Griffin for an extended beat as Griffin glowers back, then abruptly relaxes and lowers his head, peers into Miles's eyes, and ambles off, while Miles watches him leave and departs. Clara sifts through her salad as she and Miles rest at a counter, then she grabs her backpack, slides off the stool, and heads to the manager's desk with Miles in tow, offering a baffled shrug. Clara signals with a 'hold on' thumb when the manager turns to her, as Miles gazes at her, then forward, twisting the knob to the left to steer the boat to the edge of the river, drops anchor, observing the sky is a bit cloudier now. Miles gazes at Clara, and she gazes back before stepping out of the boat. With the storm now raging, Clara starts meandering up the path, and Miles reaches her, both getting soaked. She sighs thoughtfully and struts away, leaving Miles standing there perplexed before he pivots and heads back to his boat."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

In a diner, Alyssa gestures to Holden as they leave, and he pulls the car over in heavy rain. Alyssa exits, hitching up the road, drenched, while Holden stands confused before returning to his car."
