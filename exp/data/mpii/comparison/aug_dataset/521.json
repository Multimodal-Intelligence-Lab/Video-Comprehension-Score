It uncaps a bottle of honey. The postcard raises a tiny wooden spoon of honey to its snout and inhales it. While the kite begs with it, the postcard places its honey bottle into its satchel.

The spotlight shifts to the arena, uncovering a whimsical jazz ensemble in the heart of their symphony. As the ensemble softly drifts on, the spotlight pans across the enchanted congregation, standing at spacious, breezy, towering balconies, to divulge a gleeful Oliver and a captivated Leslie twirling together at one of them. A nearby participant of the congregation quaffs lemonade from a tumbler. Leslie, swaying to the rhythm and losing herself, takes a chomp of her apple. She peeks at Oliver eagerly.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

          "description": "Mickey experiences a flashback of his date with Holly at a rock club. Punkers and a captivated audience, including Mickey and Holly, watch The 39 Steps perform. Holly, enjoying the music, smokes and becomes impatient with Mickey. Despite his concern, she sniffs cocaine discreetly. As they walk along the sidewalk, they continue to argue, passing lit store windows. In the club, some audience members smile, and couples enjoy the music. Seated at a table, Holly lights a cigarette and fidgets, while Mickey watches her and the offscreen performer, Bobby Short. The scene cuts to Bobby playing piano, as Mickey and Holly leave the hotel, exiting through revolving doors."
