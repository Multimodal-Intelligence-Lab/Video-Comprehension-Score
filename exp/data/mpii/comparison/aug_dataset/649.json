A young boy in a turban, a traditional headwear often worn by Sikh men, spies Jamal as he reaches in through the window and steals a couple of chapatis. The boy nudges his father and points, prompting the father, wearing a traditional kurta, to grab Jamal through the window. Jamal grips onto the window frame for dear life, but the father violently tugs Jamal, causing him to lose his grip and fall from the train, pulling Salim with him. The two brothers tumble down a slope next to the passing train and eventually sit up, breathless. Jamal stares at the horizon, and as the dust clears, the majestic white marbled palace of the Taj Mahal, an iconic symbol of India's rich history and a UNESCO World Heritage site, is revealed in the distance. The boys walk through a set of ground gates, staring agog at the magnificent Mughal architecture, which attracts millions of visitors each year. Jamal notices the hundreds of pairs of shoes left by visiting tourists at the entrance, adhering to the practice of removing footwear before entering sacred spaces, and he and Salim steal a pair of trainers each, looking for better comfort than their worn-out slippers. A sign reads that guided tours visitors are requested to collect receipts, reflecting the organized tourism industry surrounding the site. Jamal stands leaning against the doorway as throngs of tourists, speaking various languages, mill past into the Taj Mahal. A middle-aged couple, probably American based on their accents, approaches Jamal, and the man offers money to him, which Jamal pockets, grateful for the extra income. Outside the Taj Mahal, Jamal takes Polaroid photographs of tourists, an instant camera technology popular for its immediate printed photos, as Salim steals the tourists' shoes while they pose for Jamal. The boys then sell the shoes from a makeshift store, capitalizing on the bustling tourist trade. At night, Jamal and Salim sit smoking a hookah pipe, a traditional Middle Eastern and South Asian waterpipe for smoking, and drinking with friends around a campfire, and Salim wears fancy leather cowboy boots, a testament to his ambition and newfound means. By day, Jamal touts for tourists as a guide while Salim counts wads of cash from their ventures. Jamal photographs an Asian tourist outside the Taj and shows her a famous picture of Princess Diana in the same spot, taken during her 1992 visit, but security guards, vigilant to protect the heritage site, spot the boys and chase them off. Jamal guides the tourist couple to a riverside, part of the scenic Yamuna River nearby, and while they are there, Salim and his gang break into the tourist's Mercedes taxi, a luxurious ride that signifies wealth. Meanwhile, Salim's gang steals the tires off the Mercedes just as Jamal brings the tourists back from the river. The Indian driver, angry and protective of his vehicle, starts hitting and kicking Jamal, and the woman, empathetic to the situation, mouths the word \"money\" to her husband, who then takes out his wallet and hands Jamal a $100 bill, an amount significant enough to make a difference in Jamal's life. Jamal rubs his eye where the driver punched him, feeling the sting, and at night, he kneels before a pool and bathes his black eye, seeking relief. He looks into the night in the direction from where the music, likely part of a local festival, is coming and walks through a forest toward an outdoor stage, where Salim, Jamal, and their gang of urchins, children who live on the streets, scamper across scaffolding supporting rows of seats above. The audience is mesmerized by the performance, perhaps a classical dance or a Bollywood show, and fails to notice the boys stealing handbags and purses from between people's legs, while Jamal is captivated by the singers on stage, dreaming of a different life."

          "description": "Arjun suspends Ravi by his arms over a chimney, where a group inside the hot air balloon is devouring an enormous feast of donuts, pasta, fruits, and muffins. A small girl in a beanie observes Ravi as he reaches through the chimney and snatches a couple of muffins. The girl taps her mother and gestures, causing the mother to seize Ravi through the chimney. Ravi clutches onto the chimney edge for dear safety, but the mother forcefully yanks Ravi, making him lose his hold and tumble from the balloon, dragging Arjun with him. The duo of cousins rolls down a hill beside the stationary balloon and eventually rises, gasping. Ravi gazes at the skyline, and as the mist lifts, the grand blue stucco towers of the Eiffel Tower appear in the distance. The cousins stroll through a pair of iron gates, gawking at the stunning design. Ravi spots the dozens of pairs of slippers left by nearby hikers, and he and Arjun swipe a pair of boots each. A poster indicates that guided visitors are advised to retain tickets. Ravi stands reclining against the archway as crowds of hikers stream past into the Eiffel Tower. An elderly pair approaches Ravi, and the woman hands cash to him, which Ravi stashes. Outside the Eiffel Tower, Ravi snaps digital pictures of hikers as Arjun snatches the hikers' hats while they pose for Ravi. The cousins then peddle the hats from a booth. At twilight, Ravi and Arjun sit puffing a cigar and sipping with strangers around a bonfire, and Arjun dons flashy velvet sandals. By morning, Ravi solicits for hikers as a host while Arjun sorts stacks of coins. Ravi takes a picture of a European hiker outside the Eiffel and shows her an image of Cleopatra in the identical location, but guards spot the cousins and pursue them away. Ravi escorts the hiker pair to a lakeside, and while they linger, Arjun and his crew sneak into the hiker's Jaguar truck. Simultaneously, Arjun's crew removes the doors from the Jaguar just as Ravi returns the hikers from the lake. The Canadian valet begins slapping and shoving Ravi, and the man mimes the word \"gift\" to his wife, who subsequently withdraws her purse and gives Ravi a €50 note. Ravi massages his cheek where the valet slapped him, and by night, he crouches beside a pond and refreshes his swollen cheek. He gazes into the night toward the source of the melody and wanders through a meadow toward an open-air pavilion, where Arjun, Ravi, and their crew of vagabonds scramble over beams supporting rows of benches below. The spectators are enthralled by the exhibition and fail to detect the cousins pilfering hats and scarves from beneath people's feet, while Ravi is entranced by the performers on the platform."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
