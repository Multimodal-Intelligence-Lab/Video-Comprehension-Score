His father is nudged by the boy and prompted to point, prompting Jamal to be grabbed by the father through the window. The window frame is gripped onto by Jamal for dear life, but Jamal is violently tugged by the father, causing his grip to be lost and him to fall from the train, pulling Salim with him. Down a slope next to the passing train, the two brothers are tumbled and eventually sit up, breathless. The horizon is stared at by Jamal, and as the dust clears, the majestic white marbled palace of the Taj Mahal is revealed in the distance. Through a set of ground gates, the boys are walked, staring agog at the magnificent architecture. The hundreds of pairs of shoes left by visiting tourists are noticed by Jamal, and a pair of trainers each is stolen by him and Salim. Guided tours visitors are requested to collect receipts, a sign reads. Against the doorway, Jamal stands leaning as throngs of tourists are milled past into the Taj Mahal. Jamal is approached by a middle-aged couple, and money is offered to him by the man, which is then pocketed by Jamal. Jamal takes Polaroid photographs of tourists outside the Taj Mahal as the tourists' shoes are stolen by Salim while they pose for Jamal. The shoes are then sold by the boys from a store. At night, a hookah pipe is smoked by Jamal and Salim as they sit drinking with friends around a campfire, and fancy leather cowboy boots are worn by Salim.

An Asian tourist is photographed by Jamal outside the Taj, and a picture of Princess Diana in the same spot is shown to her, but the boys are spotted by security guards and chased off. The tourist couple is guided by Jamal to a riverside, and while there, the tourist's Mercedes taxi is broken into by Salim and his gang.

A young boy in a turban, a traditional headwear often worn by Sikh men, spies Jamal as he reaches in through the window and steals a couple of chapatis. The boy nudges his father and points, prompting the father, wearing a traditional kurta, to grab Jamal through the window. Jamal grips onto the window frame for dear life, but the father violently tugs Jamal, causing him to lose his grip and fall from the train, pulling Salim with him. The two brothers tumble down a slope next to the passing train and eventually sit up, breathless. Jamal stares at the horizon, and as the dust clears, the majestic white marbled palace of the Taj Mahal, an iconic symbol of India's rich history and a UNESCO World Heritage site, is revealed in the distance. The boys walk through a set of ground gates, staring agog at the magnificent Mughal architecture, which attracts millions of visitors each year. Jamal notices the hundreds of pairs of shoes left by visiting tourists at the entrance, adhering to the practice of removing footwear before entering sacred spaces, and he and Salim steal a pair of trainers each, looking for better comfort than their worn-out slippers. A sign reads that guided tours visitors are requested to collect receipts, reflecting the organized tourism industry surrounding the site. Jamal stands leaning against the doorway as throngs of tourists, speaking various languages, mill past into the Taj Mahal. A middle-aged couple, probably American based on their accents, approaches Jamal, and the man offers money to him, which Jamal pockets, grateful for the extra income. Outside the Taj Mahal, Jamal takes Polaroid photographs of tourists, an instant camera technology popular for its immediate printed photos, as Salim steals the tourists' shoes while they pose for Jamal. The boys then sell the shoes from a makeshift store, capitalizing on the bustling tourist trade. At night, Jamal and Salim sit smoking a hookah pipe, a traditional Middle Eastern and South Asian waterpipe for smoking, and drinking with friends around a campfire, and Salim wears fancy leather cowboy boots, a testament to his ambition and newfound means. By day, Jamal touts for tourists as a guide while Salim counts wads of cash from their ventures. Jamal photographs an Asian tourist outside the Taj and shows her a famous picture of Princess Diana in the same spot, taken during her 1992 visit, but security guards, vigilant to protect the heritage site, spot the boys and chase them off. Jamal guides the tourist couple to a riverside, part of the scenic Yamuna River nearby, and while they are there, Salim and his gang break into the tourist's Mercedes taxi, a luxurious ride that signifies wealth. Meanwhile, Salim's gang steals the tires off the Mercedes just as Jamal brings the tourists back from the river. The Indian driver, angry and protective of his vehicle, starts hitting and kicking Jamal, and the woman, empathetic to the situation, mouths the word \"money\" to her husband, who then takes out his wallet and hands Jamal a $100 bill, an amount significant enough to make a difference in Jamal's life. Jamal rubs his eye where the driver punched him, feeling the sting, and at night, he kneels before a pool and bathes his black eye, seeking relief. He looks into the night in the direction from where the music, likely part of a local festival, is coming and walks through a forest toward an outdoor stage, where Salim, Jamal, and their gang of urchins, children who live on the streets, scamper across scaffolding supporting rows of seats above. The audience is mesmerized by the performance, perhaps a classical dance or a Bollywood show, and fails to notice the boys stealing handbags and purses from between people's legs, while Jamal is captivated by the singers on stage, dreaming of a different life."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
