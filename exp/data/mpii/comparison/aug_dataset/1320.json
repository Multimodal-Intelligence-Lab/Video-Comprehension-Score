          "description": "A bright bird, soaring and rising up slowly, manifests in the mirage as a bright animal in a pristine lab coat leaps onto the meadow, wings out to increase the glide. After a second, it glides to its perch, rejuvenating from what seems to have been quite a rise. It has delicate scales, a feathered tail, and luminescent eyes. It quickly surveys its environment, seeing nothing but bamboo stalks below it. Then the fog starts to gather in, and Carlos wraps his satchel loose around his wings, leaping toward the peak of the mountain. He reaches the summit just in time to see a convoy of school buses coasting around the bend, horns blaring, rolling his way. He brushes his claw along its ridge. Carlos begins to shrug off his satchel, revealing his covered feet beneath, which are hidden with bright laces. As his satchel lands to the earth, we hover over to the bamboo stalk beside him where we see Carlos's silhouette float above. The fog swirls denser, seemingly as a blessing from the earth. The sparkle of a star rises up slowly, and then noise. Carlos, his face soft with delight, picks his satchel back up, slides out of the mountain, and gazes with curiosity at a bright gallery across the road. POP! Carlos rises up through one of the vents in a flurry of feathers and glides out. He slides a book of poems into the fountain, then his satchel lands on the grass; under the moonlight, we get a clearer view of it. He turns his back to the painting, revealing two spectacularly vivid drawings etched between both elbows. He threads a vine, not with fabric but with spider silk, and begins to weave the drawings together as dew collects on the stone floor around his claws. Satchel and shoes back off, Carlos glides across endless rows of plants, examining for just the right foliage, his every gesture fluid as if he's practiced his entire life for this. Foliage after gentle foliage gets slipped into tote bags. Tote bags stuffed, Carlos glides for the entrance. The space is opened wide, with a glass ceiling over the rear walls and curtains over the paintings. Two wolves, weary from the forest, prowl through the savanna. Dexter gazes out at the jungle's misty inhabitants with a deep longing for the dusk lurking in clearings and the wanderers. He raises his paw like a lantern, guiding it at the creatures they approach, marking them one by one. In the foreground, the clink-clink of chimes is perceived. The animal whistle hums with gentle harmony and few tones blending at once as Carlos lets the tote bags touch the water. Gradually, Carlos places his wings on his heart."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
