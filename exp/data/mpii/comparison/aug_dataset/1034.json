In the vibrant and bustling city of Las Vegas, Alex holds up the figures of Julie and Jim, carefully crafted from cut-outs, positioning them skillfully in front of the iconic and pyramid-shaped Luxor Hotel, a prominent landmark known for its grandeur.

At this moment, Ryan successfully captures the picture, all while Alex intently focuses on the cut-out figures. Ryan's face soon lights up with a genuine smile of delight and satisfaction, and Alex, initially taken aback by surprise, soon reflects his sentiment, rewarding him with a warm, mirroring smile of her own.\n\nIn another location, specifically in Milwaukee, a jet makes a graceful and smooth descent, as it prepares to land with precision. Alex and Ryan navigate their way through the bustling, crowded airport terminal, with Ryan rolling along a sleek, black wheelie case and Alex managing a similar, neatly packed red one with ease. Later on, they find themselves at the Chalet Suites, a hotel known for its charming Swiss lodge theme, where they join a short line of people waiting patiently to check in. Ryan's keen and observant eye spots a second counter that is completely devoid of any queue. As Ryan opens the door to their hotel room, his sister Kara approaches, carrying a basket filled with laundry, her presence adding a familial touch.

Ryan looks out of the window of a jet as it rises into the sky, leaving behind the bustling city of Los Angeles, a major hub for travelers to various destinations. In Las Vegas, famous for its vibrant nightlife and entertainment, Alex holds the cut-out of Julie and Jim in front of the pyramid-shaped Luxor Hotel, a prominent resort known for its striking architecture and entertainment events. Ryan aims the digital camera, a compact device that has revolutionized photography with its easy-to-use technology, and Alex moves the cut-out closer. He takes a picture while Alex stares at the cut-out, perhaps captivated by the seemingly real image against the iconic hotel. Ryan smiles, a gesture of satisfaction, and Alex looks surprised before smiling warmly, a moment of shared enjoyment captured. In Milwaukee, a city known for its brewing traditions and cultural festivals, a jet comes in to land. Alex and Ryan walk through the airport terminal, with him pulling a black wheelie case and her a similar, neat red one, both designed for easy maneuverability. Later, they walk into the Chalet Suites, a Swiss lodge-themed hotel that offers a cozy atmosphere reminiscent of alpine retreats, and join a short queue of people checking in. Ryan notices a second counter with no queue, a strategic observation highlighting his knack for efficiency. As Ryan opens a hotel room door, his sister Kara walks up holding a basket of washing, a mundane task that roots their journey in everyday life. Alex and Ryan walk into their gaudily furnished room, where Ryan picks up a photocopied booklet with a picture of Julie and Jim on the front, a personalized souvenir encapsulating memories of their travels. Julie hugs Ryan, a warm embrace conveying a deep bond, and Jim comes over, reflecting camaraderie. There's a large map of the U.S. on the wall, pinned with several photos of the cut-out of Julie and Jim in front of famous landmarks like the Grand Canyon and the Statue of Liberty. Ryan steps back and looks at the map, covered in photographs, smiles thoughtfully, and goes back to join Alex, Julie, and Jim, pointing at the map as if planning their next adventure. Later, at the bar, a common place for social gatherings, Alex goes back in while Ryan waits outside with Julie and Kara. They smile, and Julie nods and looks down sadly as Kara looks at her, with a box of flower arrangements nearby, suggesting preparations for a significant event. Ryan drives up to his old school with Alex, and they get out of the car, looking at the long, low building, which holds countless memories from his childhood. They tramp across some snow, a reminder of the harsh Midwest winters, and walk up to the entrance. Ryan tries the door, finding it locked, and peers inside to see darkness, much like the closed chapter of his past. He turns to Alex resignedly, but she grins and goes to a window, undoes a catch with a credit card, demonstrating her resourcefulness, and pulls it open. He grabs her foot and heaves her up, and they both clamber into a classroom where they look at old newspaper photos of the basketball team, reflecting a legacy of the school’s sports achievements, and a picture in a trophy case, symbolizing past victories. Outside by a loading bay, they sit on the stairs and kiss, sealing a moment of intimacy. In the gym, where echoes of cheering fans once filled the air, they watch the basketball team practice and grin at each other, their shared enjoyment evident. Kara calls, so Alex drops Ryan off by the church, an architectural landmark in the community. Ryan runs up to the church entrance, opens the door, and runs up some stairs, driven by a sense of urgency. He walks into the church and finds Julie, in white, sitting with her bridesmaids, who wear cerise, crying, a poignant scene at what should be a joyous occasion.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
