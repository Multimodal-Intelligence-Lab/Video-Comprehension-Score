With a graceful and careful movement, he approaches her, lowering himself to one knee with a demeanor that exudes warmth and kindness. Mathison softly gestures towards the bundle of soft sweatshirts clutched in her arms, indicating his desire to assist. Until this very moment, the woman has maintained a somber expression, but now, a long-awaited smile slowly begins to spread across her face. She then entrusts the carefully wrapped child to Mathison. With tender hands, Dr. Mathison tenderly rests the baby on his lap, proceeding with great care to unwrap the multiple layers of fabric encasing the infant. Meanwhile, the woman, unable to have a direct view of her child, keeps her eyes fixed intently on Dr. Mathison, observing as he thoroughly examines her baby with a look of unwavering concentration. After a few tense moments have passed, the doctor, appearing somewhat visibly disturbed, lifts his gaze to meet the woman's eyes, a gesture that sends an unsettling shiver coursing through her body. His eyes then shift towards the trio of saleswomen present in the room, and his intense, scrutinizing stare fills them with a growing sense of discomfort. Recognizing the increasing tension in the room, the older saleswoman decides to break the silence by speaking up. The atmosphere thickens with tension, becoming so still and quiet that it seems as though time itself has momentarily paused. At this crucial moment, the mother appears as if she has completely stopped breathing, while the baby suddenly lets out a piercing, high-pitched scream. The doctor leans in closer and whispers something inaudible into the air, then directs his gaze towards the saleswoman who initially invited him in, before finally turning his attention back towards the mother once more. The woman carefully considers all the options displayed before her, and she points decisively to the Sports Illustrated magazine, which is partially visible, peeking out from the seat pocket in front of her. David, responding promptly, extracts the magazine and extends it to her. With patience, he waits quietly for the opposing train to pass by. As the woman diverts her attention back to the magazine, Kelly, characterized by her striking blue eyes, lifts her gaze from her own copy of Sports Illustrated and fixes her stare on David. In a silent gesture full of meaning, she raises her hand and taps the diamond ring gleaming on her finger, creating an awkward silence that hangs between them. Kelly then stands up, carefully balancing herself against the headrest for support, as the train moves steadily beneath her feet. She proceeds gracefully towards the back of the railcar, leaving David sitting alone, looking as though he is drowning in an unseen, intangible sea of emotions. Feeling a gaze upon him, David looks up to discover a little girl peering at him from the narrow space between the seats. Trying to avoid her inquisitive eyes, he turns towards the window, reaching into his coat pocket to retrieve his wedding band, which he discreetly slips back onto his finger. The rhythmic, gentle vibration of the train starts to lull him into a relaxed, drowsy state, his head gently bobbing against the window's glass. However, the constant, unrelenting shaking of the window prevents him from succumbing entirely to sleep. Suddenly, he sits up with a jolt as he notices the shaking intensifying, and his eyes dart to the window, where the scenery outside blurs rapidly as it rushes past in a whirl of motion. David then shifts his focus to the various passengers around him, observing their reactions as the train picks up speed, the usual bumps of the tracks becoming more pronounced and the speed steadily increasing. He turns his gaze to the seat directly in front of him, realizing that the little girl is no longer watching him. His attention then moves to the passengers seated across from him, noticing how the ground below appears to gradually drop away in the windows behind them. Meanwhile, elsewhere, a ten-year-old boy finds himself perched upside down on the family couch, his perspective of the world inverted as he watches television, his floppy brown hair spreading out in a circle around his reddened, flushed face."

As he does this, the woman, unable to see her baby directly, focuses intently on Dr. Mathison, watching his every move as he examines her child with a concentrated gaze. After a thorough examination, Mathison finally lifts his eyes to meet the woman's, his expression visibly shaken, and their brief eye contact sends a chill through her body.

The woman, whose weary face tells of sleepless nights and anxious days, smiles for the first time and hands him the wrapped child. The doctor, recognized for his expertise in neonatal care, gently lowers the baby to his lap and unwraps him while the woman, her heart racing with anticipation and fear, watches Dr. Mathison as he looks down and examines her child with a practiced eye.

He looks to the three saleswomen in the room, his hard stare unsettling them as if he were challenging them to comprehend the gravity of the moment, and the older saleswoman, whose years of experience in the store have taught her to read the subtlest cues, speaks up. Everyone becomes very still, the mother looks like she stopped breathing, and the baby screams, a piercing sound that echoes in the silent tension of the room. The doctor whispers something we can't hear, his words like a secret carried on a breeze, looks up to the saleswoman who brought him in, and Mathison turns back to the mother. The woman, wearing a coat that has seen better days, looks over the one being offered and then points to the Sports Illustrated peeking out of the seat pocket, a publication known for its iconic sports photography, and David pulls the magazine out and gives it to her. David waits until the opposing train, a high-speed bullet train known for its precision and speed, passes.

She holds up her hand, taps the diamond ring on her finger, a symbol of a recent engagement that still feels new, leading to an awkward silence.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
