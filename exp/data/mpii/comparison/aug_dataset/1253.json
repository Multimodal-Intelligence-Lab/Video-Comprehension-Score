A brown-haired gentleman in his 40s, named Carl, finds himself rejecting a call from an unknown number.

These structures are captured with great clarity in the shiny gold finish of the shield. Following this striking image, a series of intricately designed 3D metallic Vs makes an appearance, with each one nestled carefully within the next, creating a captivating and visually engaging sequence. A brown-haired gentleman, who appears to be in his 40s, and whose name is Carl, finds himself in the situation of rejecting a call from an unknown number. He stares down at his phone with a blank expression, feeling a rush of tension wash over him, before he reaches in his pocket to pull out his phone once more. He hangs up again, only to accidentally answer the call due to his fumbling fingers, and he lets out a sigh of obvious exasperation. Holding the phone up to his ear, he turns toward the window and spots Peter, who is waving at him with enthusiasm. Carl, moving his mouth without any semblance of joy, grumpily hangs up the call, and soon finds himself arriving at the Bigfoot Lodge. Here, a sudden, unexpected ring captures everyone's attention within the room, prompting them to turn their heads and gawk in curiosity. A man affectionately nuzzles her as Carl keeps a watchful eye on Rooney, while Ted and Stephanie direct disapproving frowns in his direction. Carl, caught off guard, unexpectedly collides with a waitress, which causes him to slip and land unceremoniously on the floor amidst a scattered array of drinks from the tray. Rising to his feet, as rigid as a board, he trudges away past the crowd of onlookers who continue to stare in his direction. Later, in the familiar comfort of his own home, Carl puts on a suit jacket and attentively studies his own reflection in the mirror. He places a name badge carefully into his pocket and then flashes a satisfied smile at himself. As he exits his apartment, he is approached by a small, white-haired woman who quietly creeps up behind him, offering him a quiet, friendly smile. Outside a bustling cafe, a man carelessly discards a flyer while Carl positions himself at his computer, noticing a colleague springing energetically from his chair just as Norman hangs up. Carl swallows nervously, contemplating the scene. Outside the bank, Carl dismisses yet another unknown call, opting to sit down on the wall outside, and takes out a leaflet. His frown deepens with concern as Nick leans over him and throws a rock; Carl then finds himself with an open-mouthed expression as two security guards urgently rush out of the building. One of them tackles Nick to the ground while the other leaps dramatically on top of him. Nick makes a daring and agile leap over a wall as Carl remains stationary in his car, rejecting yet another unknown call and winding up his window tightly when a man selling oranges approaches, eventually passing by the man outside the cafe once again. Within the confines of his office space, Carl browses through DVDs at the video store, later finding himself sitting alone on the sofa in his tastefully decorated apartment, where he immerses himself in watching a film. A frown begins to overtake his face as he pauses the film, venturing to the door, peeking through the spyhole, and observing Peter hurrying away and closing his door with a worried expression. Peter and Rooney subsequently make their way into Carl's flat, with Rooney heading to the fridge while Peter approaches the sofa, attentively furrowing his brow and intently examining something.

The scene shifts to a brown-haired man in his 40s, Carl, who is caught in a moment of rejection as he declines a call from an unknown caller. He stares blankly downward, feeling tense and uneasy, and then reaches for his phone again only to hang up once more. His unease is palpable as he fumbles with his phone, accidentally answers the call, and sighs in resignation. Holding the phone to his ear, Carl turns towards the window and catches sight of Peter waving at him. He moves his mouth in a grumpy expression before hanging up the call abruptly. Suddenly, the scene transitions to the lively atmosphere of the Bigfoot Lodge, where the sound of a ring causes everyone in the room to turn and gawk. Carl watches a guy affectionately nuzzle a woman, while he redirects his gaze toward Rooney, observing her with Ted and Stephanie, who are frowning at him. Amidst the crowd, Carl clumsily collides with a waitress, leading to an unfortunate slip that results in him and a tray of drinks sprawled across the floor. Embarrassed, he stands up, stiff as a board, and trudges away, passing by a crowd whose eyes are fixated on him with judgment. Later, at home, Carl meticulously dons a suit jacket and inspects his reflection in the mirror. He carefully pops a name badge into his pocket and, satisfied, smiles at his reflection. As he exits his apartment, he is met by a small white-haired woman who creeps up behind him and beams a smile in his direction. Outside a café, another man discards a flyer into a bin while Carl, seated at his computer, spots a colleague springing out of his chair, and at the same time, Norman hangs up a phone call. Feeling the weight of a decision, Carl swallows hard, and outside a bank, he once again rejects another call from the persistent unknown caller. He sits down on a wall and pulls out a leaflet, deep in thought. As he frowns, Nick leans over him and, with a defiant gesture, lobs a rock, leaving Carl open-mouthed in disbelief as security guards rush out of the building. One tackles Nick to the ground while another leaps on top. In the chaos, Nick manages to leap over a wall, and the scene cuts to Carl in his car, where he promptly rejects another unknown caller and winds up his window when approached by a man selling oranges, who eventually passes by the man stationed outside the café. At his desk, Carl seems lost in contemplation as he browses through DVDs at the video store, then transitions to a solitary scene at home where he sits alone on the sofa of his smart apartment watching a film. The mood shifts as he frowns, pauses the film, and moves toward the door to peep through the spyhole, witnessing Peter hurrying away before shutting his door with a worried expression. The scene evolves as Peter and Rooney enter Carl’s flat; Rooney makes her way to the fridge while Peter approaches the sofa, furrowing his brow as he examines something of concern. Carl, contorted in his position but remaining stiff, experiences a disturbance when a fly lands on his eye, jolting him awake from his nightmare. He sits up with a start on the couch, wide-eyed and seemingly disheveled, staring into space with visible misery. He swallows, frowns, and then engages in a thoughtful gaze down at something on the table, taking it in as he moves toward the rows of seats and settles into one. The narrative concludes with the impactful image of Carl being startled on two screens, where he physically jumps out of his skin in reaction."

Studio in Burbank, are reflected in the shiny gold surface of a shield with the letters WB at its center, followed by a series of 3D metallic Vs, one inside the other. A brown-haired guy in his 40s, Carl, who recently experienced a string of troubling calls, rejects a call from an unknown caller, stares down blankly, tenses, takes the phone out again, hangs up again, then takes his phone out and fumbles, accidentally answering it and sighing. He holds it to his ear, turns to the window, and sees Peter wave from his office across the street. Carl moves his mouth, grumpily hangs up, and is then at the Bigfoot Lodge, a popular lodge-themed bar in Los Angeles, where a ring causes everyone to turn and gawk. The guy nuzzles her as Carl eyes Rooney, a woman he has had a complicated history with, while Ted and Stephanie frown at him. He bashes into a waitress and slips, ending up on the floor with a tray of drinks. He stands up, stiff as a board, and trudges off past a crowd of staring people. At home, in his downtown apartment decorated with minimalist art, Carl dons a suit jacket and studies his reflection in the mirror, pops a name badge into his pocket from his latest conference, then smiles at himself. As he leaves his apartment, a small white-haired woman, his neighbor who occasionally shares homemade cookies, creeps up behind him and smiles. Outside a cafe known for its artisanal espressos, a guy bins a flyer as Carl sits at his computer and spots a colleague springing out of his chair, with Norman from the finance department hanging up. Carl swallows and, outside the bank where his savings account was recently compromised, he rejects another call from an unknown caller, sits down on a wall, and takes out a leaflet about identity theft. Carl frowns as Nick leans over him, lobs the rock into the bank's window, and is open-mouthed as two security guards run out of the building, one taking him down and the other leaping on top in a well-practiced maneuver. Nick leaps over a wall as Carl is in his car rejecting an unknown caller and winds up his window, wary of a guy selling oranges who approaches and then passes the man outside the cafe. At his desk in a corporate office with a sweeping city view, Carl browses DVDs in the video store aisle of his memory, sits alone on the sofa in his smart apartment, and watches a film about espionage and intrigue. He frowns, pauses the film, goes to the door, and peeps through the spyhole as Peter hurries off, likely concerned about Carl’s well-being, shutting his door with a worried expression. Peter and Rooney enter Carl’s flat later in the day, Rooney goes to the fridge looking for a drink, and Peter heads over towards the sofa, furrows his brow, and studies an unusual piece of mail Carl received. Carl is contorted but stiff, a fly lands on his eye, and he wakes from his nightmare and sits up with a start on the couch, wide-eyed and disheveled. He stares into space miserably, swallows, frowns, and thoughtfully gazes down at something on the table, examining it as he makes his way towards the rows of seats in his home theater and sits down. On two screens, Carl jumps out of his skin, startled by the intensity of the scene unfolding before him."

          "description": "Lines of carnival tents are mirrored in the shiny bronze surface of a helmet with the characters XY at its center, followed by a series of 3D wooden Xs, one inside the other. A blond woman in her 30s, Elisa, accepts a message from a mysterious messenger, gazes up cheerfully, relaxes, puts the tablet away again, picks it up again, then puts her tablet away and manages, unexpectedly declining it and chuckling. She places it near her shoulder, glances at the mirror, and sees Jill laugh. Elisa mumbles, cheerfully declines it, and is then at the Dragon's Inn where a horn prompts everyone to swivel and cheer. The woman hugs him as Elisa views Mark, with Sara and Jonathan cheering at her. She crashes into a customer and kneels, ending up on the ceiling with a pile of papers. She gets down, fluid as water, and dances off past a group of blinking animals. At work, Elisa wears a raincoat and forgets her reflection in the window, drops a keychain into her briefcase, then frowns at herself. As she enters her house, a tall blond man stomps up beside her and frowns. Outside a market, a woman drops a package as Elisa stands by her phone and notices a stranger falling out of his hammock, with William accepting it. Elisa blinks and, outside the library, she accepts another message from a mysterious messenger, jumps up on a fence, and pulls out a compass. Elisa smiles as Jake stretches under her, throws the stick, and is wide-eyed as two messengers stroll into the street, one waving to him and the other shouting out loud. Jake slips under a bush as Elisa is on her bike accepting a mysterious messenger and rolls down her visor as a woman buying apples rushes and then greets the child inside the market. At her table, Elisa reads books in the library, stands with friends on the carpet in her cozy attic, and writes a story. She smiles, stops the story, runs to the window, and peeks through the curtain as Jill strolls in, opening her window with a puzzled expression. Jill and Mark leave Elisa’s house, Mark heads to the oven, and Jill skips toward the carpet, digging in her pocket, and examines something. Elisa is relaxed but fluid, a bee buzzes near her ear, and she emerges from her daydream and lies down with a sigh on the floor, smiling and thoughtful. She gazes at the ceiling joyfully, hums, smiles, and gently peers up at anything on the wall, inspecting it as she makes her way away from the group of trees and lies down. On two mirrors, Elisa laughs to her heart's content."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
