Ernie shifts his gaze towards the front door, peering out through the curtain that hangs over the shattered glass, before decisively pulling the door open. As he emerges, his transformation into a homemade butler is evident; he has achieved this look by carefully rolling up his pants and donning an old coachman's hat, which sits slightly askew on his head.

His rent collector, Reineman, speaks animatedly, pointing to maps that are strategically spread out on the desk. The atmosphere is interrupted by the sound of a buzzer, prompting Potter to swiftly engage the dictaphone on his desk. Reineman then exits, leaving Potter to flip the switch on the dictaphone to record his thoughts. In a different scene, George and Mary converse with Sam Wainwright in front of his car, while Sam’s wife, Jane, now stands outside the vehicle. There are handshakes exchanged all around as Sam and Jane settle into their car, which then glides smoothly away, leaving George standing with his arm affectionately draped around Mary, both watching wistfully as the car disappears from view. Together, they meander slowly over to George's aging car, where they pause, casting contemplative glances at each other and the vehicle that remains a steadfast symbol of their past and future."

In an attempt to hide damage, Bert and the man put up travel posters, which feature exotic destinations like Paris and Rome, to cover up the broken windows. Ernie looks out through the curtain covering the broken glass of the front door, then opens the door, revealing himself as a homemade butler, having accomplished this by rolling up his pants and putting on an old coachman's hat, a style reminiscent of those worn by 19th-century carriage drivers.

          "description": "A distant trumpet is noticed as Oliver swings from the ladder, and Ingrid and the woman hang up artwork displays to shield the shattered mirrors. Oliver peeks through the drape covering the fractured screen of the back gate, then unveils the gate, presenting himself as a makeshift sailor, having achieved this by rolling up his sleeves and donning an ancient pirate's eyepatch. Nigel arrives, and they dash into each other's arms and clasp one another in joy, remaining entwined. They wrap up their tune, and Oliver hugs Ingrid gently on the cheek before Ingrid tosses Oliver's eyepatch on his shoulder. Meanwhile, the Rossi crew is relocating, with Rossi and Nigel, helped by three of the Rossi offspring, hauling out the last of the decorations. The clan comprises Rossi, his partner, and four youngsters of various heights, from three to eleven. Nigel and Clara assist the Rossis in relocating, surrounded by about a dozen allies. Clara climbs into the front seat of the wagon with the kitten in her lap, while the household llama crawls in the back seat with the three toddlers. Outside one of the tattered sheds that line the avenue are two transports: Nigel Park's creaky van and an even more creaky bicycle stacked high with kitchenware. The wobbly convoy sets off down the avenue to the applause of the allies. The youngsters burst in with shouts of excitement, amidst new gardens scattered around and young bushes, which promise to transform the vicinity into a charming little suburban neighborhood. Nigel and Clara stand on the steps of the new dwelling with the Rossis aligned before them while Tim Mulligan stands in front of his sleek red sports car, symbolizing a prosperous, emergent entrepreneur. His spouse, a glamorous and cultured individual, is inside the car, glittering with silks and emeralds. Tim observes Nigel across the avenue, while Mrs. Rossi and the Rossis bow, exchanging high-fives all around. Meanwhile, Johnson is seated in his rocking chair at his bureau with his henchman beside him, as his bill collector, Frederick, converses and gestures to schematics sprawled out on the bureau. A bell is noticed, and Johnson flicks on the megaphone on his bureau before Frederick departs. He toggles the lever on the megaphone. Elsewhere, Nigel and Clara converse with Tim Mulligan in front of his car, with Tim's spouse, Lisa, now outside of the car. There is high-fiving all around as Tim and Lisa hop into their car, and the sleek red coupe rolls away, leaving Nigel lingering with his arm around Clara, watching contemplatively after it. They gradually amble over to Nigel's ancient van and gaze at it quietly."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
