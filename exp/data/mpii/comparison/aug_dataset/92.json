Here, Marge and Norm find themselves watching television together in bed. After a prolonged moment of silence, interrupted only by the faint sounds from the TV, Marge murmurs softly while keeping her eyes fixed on the screen. In the darkness, Marge tentatively gropes around, and he takes a seat, retrieving his phone.

In the gentle darkness, Marge tentatively gropes around, and he sits, retrieving his phone with a thoughtful expression. Jerry, meanwhile, sits in a state of bewilderment, angrily snatches up the phone, and then turns his attention back to his awaiting meal.

Meanwhile, in an otherwise empty lot, Marge's prowler sits idly parked, while she herself is perched on one end of an elevated dance platform. She engages in conversation with two young women in the deserted club, which has yet to welcome patrons, as the atmosphere remains quiet and still. In a sudden, dramatic shift, the scene transitions with a final loud bang to an extreme close-up view of an insect heaving a worm. The camera then pulls back, unveiling the setting of Marge’s house, where she and Norm lie comfortably in bed, their eyes fixed on the flickering television screen. After an extended silence, punctuated only by the low hum of the TV, Marge remains focused on the set as she softly murmurs. In the darkness, Marge reaches out, her hand searching aimlessly, as another character, seated nearby, picks up his phone while Jerry, driven by his own emotions, angrily snatches it up before returning to his meal. As the scene unfolds, Gary extends a flimsy document toward her, which Marge accepts with one hand, her eyes glancing over it as the other hand remains suspended with a forkful of food. Norm, who has been consistently eating without pause, shifts his gaze toward Marge with mild curiosity, his eyes lingering for a moment as he completes his chewing, then swallows before speaking. In a differently lit environment, Jerry, Wade, and Stan Grossman are gathered around a kitchen table, the harsh light from an overhead fixture casting stark shadows as they sit amidst the remnants of coffee and a cinnamon filbert ring on the table. At the reception desk, Marge waits as the clerk types into a computer console, all while she manages a conversation on a public phone. The brown Ciera makes its entrance, lazily maneuvering in S-curves around few snow-dusted cars scattered on the lot's rooftop before halting beside a parked car. Carl steps out, conducts a quick survey of the lot, then crouches in the snow at the car's rear and begins the laborious task of unscrewing the license plate. The scene changes as Carl pulls up to the exit, handing his ticket to the attendant, who takes it with a perplexed frown, his silence filled with confusion, while Carl glances back and busies himself with retrieving money, peeling off single dollar bills. In a state of bewilderment, Carl scans his surroundings, raises his voice to inquire of a nearby mechanic over the bustling shop noises, and follows the mechanic's pointed direction. In another setting, Marge and Shep stand facing one another, separated by the glass and clutter of a grimy cubicle, where the silence between them stretches as Shep remains wordless, maintaining his unwavering gaze on her. Elsewhere, Jerry paces anxiously behind his desk, his steps halted as Marge appears at the door and proceeds to drop into the chair opposite him, capturing Jerry's stare as his mouth falls open in surprise. As Marge rises to leave, Jerry's gaze drifts down to the papers on his desk, his expression blank and uncomprehending. Entering yet another venue, Marge surveys the bar, its ambiance subdued and nondescript, serving as a meeting spot for businesspeople. Her attention is drawn to a bald, slightly overweight man of similar age to her, who rises deliberately from a booth located halfway back."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
