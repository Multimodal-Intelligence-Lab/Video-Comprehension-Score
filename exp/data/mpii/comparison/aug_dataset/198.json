Meanwhile, George and Uncle Billy persist with their frantic search inside a shabby, distinctly old-fashioned, gas-lit room. The room itself appears to have been entirely upended and turned utterly inside out in their desperate quest to locate the elusive missing money. In a moment of intense frustration, George abruptly grabs Uncle Billy by the lapels, forcibly jerking him to his feet and shaking him vigorously. Uncle Billy stands there in front of George, bearing a striking resemblance to a criminal who has been thoroughly frisked, with all his pockets sagging outwards and revealing their emptiness. In a fit of anger, George throws Uncle Billy back down into his chair, still shouting at him in a manner that seems almost unhinged.\n\nWith emotions running high, George then turns sharply and heads toward the door, delivering a vicious kick to a wastebasket that happens to be on the floor as he exits, while Uncle Billy remains seated at the table, sobbing uncontrollably, his head buried in his arms. As George enters the hallway, Mary notices him immediately, observing the light dusting of freshly fallen snow that clings to his hair and shoulders, just before he lets out a violent sneeze. Mary, sensing that something is amiss, watches him intently as George collapses into an armchair, lifting Tommy onto his lap in the process. Meanwhile, Mary is assisting Pete with the task of decorating the Christmas tree when she suddenly becomes aware of the gravity of the situation and pauses, just as Janie continues to pound away at the piano keys.\n\nMary then gently guides George toward the kitchen, with young Tommy clinging to his coat-tails, playfully tugging at them as they move along. The camera pans smoothly with their movement as they proceed through the door. Once they have entered the kitchen, Tommy takes his leave, and George, clearly troubled, begins to pace about the room. His mind is filled with worry before he turns and heads toward the doorway once more. Mary watches him go, her expression filled with puzzlement and concern, before she moves over to join Pete. At this moment, the knob on the banister unexpectedly detaches in George’s hand. He considers throwing it into the living room in a moment of exasperation but instead opts to place it back where it belongs before he makes his way up the stairs. As he ascends, he is accompanied by the droning rhythm of Janie’s playing at the piano.

Meanwhile, George and Uncle Billy persist in their frantic search within a shabby, old-fashioned room dimly illuminated by gaslight, where every piece of furniture and possession seems tossed and overturned in the chaotic hunt for the missing money. In a moment of heightened emotion, George fiercely grabs Uncle Billy by the lapels, forcefully pulling him upright and shaking him vigorously, causing Uncle Billy to stand unsteadily like a frisked criminal; his demeanor is one of defeat, evident in the way his empty pockets hang inside out. Overcome with frustration, George hurls Uncle Billy back into his chair with palpable aggression, his voice rising to a near-maniacal shout that fills the room. George then pivots abruptly, heading for the door with brisk, angry strides, landing a vicious kick on a wastebasket that lies innocuously on the floor in his path, while Uncle Billy remains behind, collapsed at the table, his head buried in his arms, sobbing quietly. Entering the hallway, George is met by Mary, who turns to look at him, noticing the slight dusting of snow on his hair and shoulders, just as he succumbs to a violent sneeze. Mary’s gaze lingers on him, acutely aware that something out of the ordinary has transpired, as George wearyingly sinks into an armchair and gently lifts Tommy onto his lap. As Mary assists Pete in decorating the Christmas tree, her attention is caught by the gravity of the situation, prompting her to pause her activity, even as Janie's lively piano playing thumps through the room. Mary takes George by the hand, and with Tommy clinging to his coat-tails and pulling at him persistently, she guides him toward the kitchen, with the camera smoothly panning to follow their path. Once they pass through the doorway into the kitchen, Tommy releases his grip and departs, leaving George to pace the room anxiously, consumed by his worries, before he eventually makes his way toward the doorway. Mary watches him leave, her expression a mix of puzzlement and concern, before she turns her attention back to Pete. As George makes his way up the stairs, the knob on the banister unexpectedly comes loose in his hand, provoking an impulse within him to hurl it into the living room in frustration, yet he resists, choosing instead to replace it carefully before continuing his ascent, accompanied by the monotonous, steady rhythm of Janie’s piano playing echoing through the house. Carefully tiptoeing into Zuzu’s room, he finds her sitting up in bed, a soft glow from the lamp beside her illuminating her small frame as she cradles her prize flower. Noticing she’s awake, he approaches and settles gently on the edge of her bed. She makes a move to get out of bed but quickly decides against it, shaking her head and clutching the flower tightly to her chest as a few delicate petals drift to the bedspread below. With a tender motion, she collects the fallen petals, handing them and the cherished flower over to George, her small gesture filled with trust and fondness."

Oliver pivots and marches to the portal, punting aggressively at a helmet on the deck as he departs, while Aunt Lucy stays giggling at the console, her face in her mittens. Oliver strides into the hangar where Eve pivots and spots him with a delicate dusting of starlight on his ears and elbows, and then he snorts furiously. Eve gapes at him, sensing that something peculiar has transpired, as Oliver collapses into a hammock and hoists Max onto his knee. Eve, who is assisting Sam in calibrating the telescope, deduces that something is gravely amiss and pauses as Lily taps away at the synthesizer. Eve guides Oliver, with Max clinging to his belt-loops and tugging at him, toward the cafeteria, and as they move, the lens follows them. After they pass through the aperture, Max exits, and Oliver rambles about the cafeteria, anxious, before heading toward the entryway. Eve gazes after him, perplexed and worried, then moves over to Sam. The dial on the control panel detaches in Oliver's grasp, and he has a whim to fling it into the cockpit but instead reattaches it before advancing up the elevator, hearing the relentless beat of Lily at the synthesizer. He creeps in to find Luna, aged eight, lounging in her hammock with the torch glowing beside her, clutching her cherished circuit board. Realizing she's awake, he approaches and perches on the corner of her hammock. She begins to spring out of the hammock but retracts her intention, clutching the circuit board tightly as a few components dislodge, which she retrieves before presenting the loose components and the circuit board to Oliver."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

          "description": "George and Uncle Billy desperately search for missing money in a disheveled, gas-lit room. George manically shakes Uncle Billy, whose pockets are empty, then storms out, leaving Uncle Billy sobbing. Covered in snow, George encounters Mary, who senses something is wrong as she decorates with Pete. George retreats to the kitchen, pacing anxiously. He climbs the stairs and visits Zuzu, who sits awake in bed, clutching a flower. As some petals fall, she picks them up and hands them, along with the flower, to George."
