Astounded, Mozart begins to perform the Rondo again. The hound howls more loudly. He bows to them and exits the chamber. Both men hug.

Instantly, a loud howl erupts from one of the dogs. Startled, Mozart halts his playing. Mozart halts his playing. Amazed and a bit taken aback, Mozart begins to play the Rondo once more.

Constanze rises from her seated position, her face a canvas of bewilderment and utter confusion. Overwhelmed with joy, she comes to an abrupt halt in her steps and gently kisses his hand with affection. He delicately lifts her from where she was positioned and then awkwardly draws her into an embrace, holding her close. They gaze intently into one another's eyes: Constanze is in complete disbelief, grappling to comprehend the unfolding situation. Meanwhile, he continues to stare at her with intense focus.

Suddenly, the girl rises from her seat. Mozart beams a radiant smile at the parents, who in turn, smile back at him somewhat nervously.

          "description": "He stands, his body trembling with intensity as his eyes dart about wildly, conveying a deep sense of agitation. Constanze rises from her place, a look of perplexity etched across her features as she tries to make sense of the situation before her. Overcome with joy, she halts her motion and, almost as if driven by an impulse, bends down to plant a kiss upon his hand. In response to her gesture, he gently lifts her upright and, with a certain awkwardness, draws her tightly into his embrace. Their eyes lock, and they become lost in a moment of shared astonishment: Constanze's gaze is filled with disbelief at the turn of events, while his is intense and piercing. Meanwhile, Salieri, seated at his desk, finds himself engrossed in contemplation as he directs a long, unwavering stare towards the cross. After a moment, he seems to awaken from this reverie. A servant enters the scene, her eyes reflecting a silent inquiry as she approaches. Without a word, she lets the portfolio slip from her grasp, and it falls to the floor, causing pages of music to spill out in a disorganized, cascading flow. As these pages scatter, a grand and heavy sound fills the air, providing a backdrop as Constanze begins to undress, her actions under the watchful, horrified eyes of Salieri. A sense of distress ripples through him, and his mouth opens in a silent expression of inner turmoil. The candle's flame flickers over Constanze, casting a dance of shadows as she continues to disrobe, preparing herself for the anticipated embrace. A close-up captures the fireplace, wherein the olivewood figure of Christ, nailed to the cross, is engulfed in flames, burning away. In another space, Mozart chuckles with glee, while Salieri offers him a glass, filled with sweet white dessert wine, accompanied by a spoon. Mozart, absorbed in his own thoughts, accepts the offering absentmindedly and continues his conversation uninterrupted. A cacophony of hysterical barking and howling erupts, revealing a hall teeming with at least five dogs, each leaping and rushing about, creating a fantastic uproar. Mozart enters the scene, dressed with care in a new coat and a hat adorned with a plume, ready for his role as a teacher in the household of Michael Schlumberg, a prosperous merchant. With an air of friendly coarseness, Michael Schlumberg stands in the midst of the canine chaos, welcoming Mozart with a broad grin. Abruptly, a young girl rises from her seat, capturing Mozart's attention. He turns to the parents, offering them a warm smile, which they return, albeit with a touch of nervousness. Mozart moves gracefully along the bench, positioning himself before the keyboard, where he lifts his hands and begins to lightly play a prelude. The instant the music begins, a dog interrupts with a loud howl, causing Mozart to pause in surprise. He remains still for a moment, bewildered, before he attempts to restart the Rondo. This time, the dog responds with an even more emphatic howl, prompting Mozart to make the decision to bow graciously to those present and make his exit from the room. The two men meet again and share a heartfelt embrace. The scene shifts to a cramped, low-ceilinged room, neglected and untidy over time, scattered with the remnants of empty wine bottles, a variety of musical instruments—including a mandolin, a viola, and a forte-piano distinctive for its reversed black and white keys—as well as books and plates of food left untouched. In this cluttered space, Mozart stands with his father, clasping Leopold's arms in a gesture of affection. Leopold, appearing as an older man now, his face marked with lines of age and his attire worn and in need of repair, carries an air of weariness and declining health. He maneuvers a bag across the room with deliberate care. Meanwhile, Constanze lies in bed, and as the door creaks open, she sits up suddenly, her expression immediately shifting to one of surprise. Leopold stands framed in the doorway, locking eyes with Constanze, who looks back at him with a fatigued and unwell countenance. After a brief pause, he closes the door silently. Shifting his attention elsewhere, he picks up some pages of a manuscript, and those gathered around, especially the children, burst into laughter as they engage with the sheets, passing them from hand to hand with amusement. Amidst this jovial scene, an actress succeeds in firmly placing Constanze's wig onto Leopold's head, evoking a delighted applause from the onlookers. With the applause continuing, all eyes remain fixed on the unfolding scenario. In a sudden, jarring transition, Salieri’s masked face emerges, sharply turning to fix its gaze upon her. The scene quickly revisits the image of Mozart at the forte-piano, his head adorned with Constanze's wig, as he lets out a piercing, high-pitched giggle."

Overjoyed, she stops and kisses his hand, a gesture of both relief and gratitude. He raises her, embracing her clumsily in the manner of someone who has not known joy for some time. They stare at one another: Constanze in total disbelief, her eyes questioning his newfound intensity. He glares at her, an emotion too complex to name flickering across his face. Salieri sits at his desk, staring up at the cross, a symbol of faith and burden. Salieri stares at the cross, contemplating his own conflicted belief. Salieri stirs himself, breaking free from his introspection. A servant appears, dressed in the livery of a wealthy household, looking at him inquiringly, and drops the portfolio on the floor; pages of music, the lifeblood of the household, pour out of it. To its grand and weighty sound, Constanze begins to undress, watched by the horrified Salieri who struggles between duty and desire. He opens his mouth in distress, caught in a moral quandary. The candle flickers over her, casting shadows that dance across the room, as she removes her clothes and prepares for his embrace. CU, the fireplace. In it lies the olivewood Christ on the cross, burning as if consumed by a sacrilegious fire. Mozart chuckles delightedly, his laughter punctuating the tension in the room. Salieri offers him a glass of white dessert wine, a sweet reprieve from the bitterness around them, and a spoon. Mozart takes it absently, lost in his own thoughts, and goes on talking. Hysterical barking and howling fill the air. The hall is full of dogs, at least five, all jumping up and dashing about, creating a cacophony synonymous with chaos. Mozart, dandified in a new coat and a plumed hat befitting his artistic flair, has arrived to teach at the house of a prosperous merchant, Michael Schlumberg, whose wealth affords him such extravagance. Bluff, friendly and coarse-looking, he stands in his hall amidst the leaping and barking animals, greeting Mozart with the enthusiasm of one whose status allows indulgence in extravagance. Suddenly the girl rises, interrupting the scene. Mozart smiles at the parents, who stand as patrons of the arts with nervous pride. They smile nervously back, aware of the genius before them. Mozart slides along the bench, raises his hands, and preludes over the keys of the forte-piano, a precursor to modern pianos with distinctively reversed keys. Instantly, a dog howls loudly, startling him and interrupting the melody. Startled, Mozart stops, his composure rattled. Mozart stops, assessing the discord in the air. Amazed, Mozart starts to play the Rondo again, a composition known for its lively character. The dog howls louder, adding unwelcome accompaniment. He bows to them, acknowledging the humor of the moment, and leaves the room. Both men embrace, a gesture of shared artistic respect and personal camaraderie. A cramped, low-ceilinged little room that has not been tidied for ages, speaks of creative chaos. Also, there are many empty wine bottles; musical instruments - among them a mandolin, a viola, a forte-piano with the black and white keys reversed - books and abandoned plates of food bear witness to the life of an artist. Mozart clasps his father's arms, a rare moment of familial affection. Leopold is now seen as an aging, travel-stained man, his clothes worn from years of journeying to support his family’s ambitions, in clothes that need repair. His face is lined, testifying to a life of struggle and dedication, and he is obviously not in perfect health. He carries the bag, heavy with the weight of responsibility, across the room. Constanze lies in bed, her frailty evident in her appearance. She sits up, startled, as if awakening from a dream. He opens the door of the bedroom. Constanze, who looks ill and tired, her face a mask of fatigue, stares at Leopold. Leopold stares back from the doorway, his expression a mixture of concern and regret. He closes the door again, shutting out the turbulence of the outside world. He picks up some pages of manuscript, the essence of musical genius. Laughingly, the bystanders take it up, especially the children, whose innocence contrasts with the gravity of the work. As Leopold glares furiously about him, the actress succeeds in getting Constanze's wig firmly onto his head, a farcical moment amidst the serious undertones. Everybody bursts into applause, a tribute to the shared joy of music. Applause. All the bystanders are watching, captivated by the spectacle. SMASH CUT: Salieri's masked face whips around and looks at her, a visage of secrecy and hidden motives. A repetition of the shot of Mozart at the forte-piano, wearing Constanze's wig and emitting a shrill giggle, the scene becomes a surreal blend of genius and madness."

          "description": "The cat wobbles trembling, peering frantically. Penelope springs down, baffled. Ecstatic, she pauses and licks the sheep's hoof. The cat elevates her and then hugs her awkwardly. They gawk at one another: Penelope in sheer amazement. The cat scowls at her. Fenton perches on his chair, gazing up at the shade. Fenton gapes at the shade. Fenton rouses himself. A baker materializes. He peers at him curiously and flings the sculpture on the carpet; sheets of poetry spill out of it. To its grand and hefty melody, Penelope begins to paint, observed by the terrified Fenton. The cat opens its eyes in anguish. The lantern wavers over her as she sheds her garments and readies for its cuddle. CU, the bookshelf. In it rests the mahogany angel on the gargoyle, sizzling. Beethoven giggles merrily. Fenton hands him a mug of red soup and a fork. Beethoven grasps it carelessly and continues chatting. Maniacal chirping and cawing. The garden is packed with birds, at least seven, all soaring up and flitting around and producing a tremendous commotion. Beethoven, adorned in a fresh cloak and a feathered cape for the event, has arrived to orchestrate at the residence of an affluent blacksmith, Gerald Landshire. Jolly, amicable, and rough-looking, he lingers in his garden amidst the soaring and chirping creatures, welcoming Beethoven. Suddenly the youth ascends. Beethoven beams at the companions. They grin uneasily back. Beethoven drifts across the mat, lifts his paws, and preludes over the strings. Instantly, a parrot squawks loudly. Shocked, Beethoven halts. Beethoven halts. Astonished, Beethoven recommences to strum the Sonata once more. The parrot squawks louder. He nods to them and exits the space. Both rabbits embrace. A narrow, high-floored cavern which everyone has ignored for centuries. Also, there are numerous empty cider jugs; artistic tools - among them a chisel, a palette, a grand-guitar with the red and yellow frets reversed - scrolls and forsaken cups of broth. Beethoven grips his mother's legs. Clara is now viewed as a seasoned, sun-kissed woman in attire that demands mending. Her visage is creased, and she is evidently not in robust condition. She hauls the trunk across the cavern. Penelope lounges on the couch. She leaps, amazed. She unlatches the window of the lounge. Penelope, who appears robust and worn, peers at Clara. Clara gazes back from the portal. She bolts the window shut. She seizes some leaves of novella. Giggling, the spectators lift it high, especially the youth. As Clara glares angrily around her, the performer triumphs in affixing Penelope's bonnet securely onto his feet. Everyone erupts into cheers. Cheers. All the spectators are observing. SMASH TRANSITION: Fenton's hooded visage swivels around and examines her. A duplication of the frame of Beethoven at the grand-guitar, sporting Penelope's bonnet and releasing a high-pitched chuckle."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Horrified, Salieri watches Constanze undress, lit by flickering candlelight. Meanwhile, Mozart, amused, arrives at Michael Schlumberg's home to teach, welcomed amidst chaos and barking dogs. As he plays the piano, a dog howls, surprising him. Later, in a cluttered room filled with musical instruments and empty wine bottles, Mozart embraces his father Leopold, who appears aged and unwell. Constanze, looking ill, encounters Leopold, and they share a tense moment. Applause ensues as bystanders watch an actress place Constanze's wig onto Mozart, who emits a shrill giggle at the piano, observed by a masked Salieri."
