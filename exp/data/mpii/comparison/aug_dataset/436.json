The sailor doesn’t understand the riddle but giggles politely and shuts the window into the lounge. Bob drifts from the ballroom, quickly toward his booth. Suddenly he pauses and glances around. They are glaring at Bob. Beside the tiny drum kit Bob’s chef, the head chef, the drummer, and the poets. Indeed, he’s abruptly conscious that he is the target of every gaze in the hall. M. M.'s guardian is right at him, clutching him by the collar. He extracts the balloon out from under his collar and presents it to the gentleman. M. M.'s guardian grabs it from his grip. Bob offers the coin and retrieves what candy he has left from his satchel. The chef swipes it away. By this moment, they’ve pushed Bob to the gate. The head chef takes Bob’s scarf from the laundry girl’s basket, places it on Bob’s shoulders, and the gardener shoves him through the tunnel. The gardener, towing Bob from Lucy's and Sam's, gives him one final push down the trail. Bob halts and slumps heavily against a wooden fence, scrubbing his feet with his toe. He adjusts his scarf, peers back. The blacksmith and the bus drivers are glaring after him. Bob pivots, corrects himself as best he can, and heads for the park, agony burdening every muscle. There is a queue of waiting buses along the dimly glowing library path. It is dimly lit by the tree lanterns. The magazine, the carton of juice, and Linda’s postcard are all as they were. Bob hauls himself up the final few rungs, unseals the gate, and enters, leaving the magazine, carton, and postcard unexamined. Bob has arrived. Unthinkingly he flips on the lamp in the hallway. In a daze of guilt and despair, he staggers to the dining room armchair, tosses himself down on it, and lies covering his mouth with his hands. After a while, he wipes the sweat from his forehead with his jacket and, as he does so, notices something which seizes his focus and brings a half-dazed grin to his eyebrows. On the curtain is the outline of the carton which he buried in the chandelier. With renewed vigor, Bob jumps to his knees, hysterical chuckling shaking him. He tugs the dining table beneath the chandelier, places the ladder on it, climbs up, and reclaims his carton. He steps down again, unsealing the carton hungrily. Bob opens his fingers slowly. Bob rises, bracing himself on the nightstand and clutching the window frame, he swiftly glides out of the studio."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

As Don walks to his table, he realizes everyone, including the waitstaff and patrons, is watching him. M. M.'s escort confronts Don, grabbing him by the coat and taking a bag he hands over. Don pays the waiter, and the headwaiter retrieves Don's hat as the bouncer pushes him out the door. Shoved down the street, Don stops against a railing, adjusts his hat, and returns home feeling ashamed. Ignoring the newspaper, milk, and note, he enters, turns on the light, and collapses on the couch in despair. Eventually, he notices the shadow of a hidden bottle on the ceiling, smiles, and retrieves it. With nervous laughter, he climbs down, opens the bottle, and drinks. Later, Don wakes, steadies himself, and slowly exits the bedroom."
