Tommy abruptly lunges at a Teen Punk, who is at least a foot taller than he is, and lands a barrage of punches before the Teen Punk can protect himself, frequently taking opportunities to glare at Evan.

With a swift, unanticipated motion, Tommy finds himself falling hard onto the floor, much to the delight of the crowd, who burst into loud, mocking laughter at his expense. Slowly and deliberately, Tommy rises from the ground, his eyes locking intensely with Evan's gaze. Evan's expression is tinged with guilt, and he weakly, almost imperceptibly, shakes his head, as if silently insisting that the situation is not what Tommy might be assuming. In a sudden burst of action, Tommy hurls himself at a Teen Punk, who towers over him by a good foot, and unleashes a rapid succession of punches before the startled Teen Punk can even begin to defend himself. Throughout this confrontation, Tommy frequently glances over at Evan. Helplessly watching the unfolding scene, Evan, Kayleigh, and the punk's friends can do nothing but observe when, swiftly and decisively, two security guards step in to seize Tommy. As he is being forcibly dragged away, Tommy turns back toward Evan, a sickly grin playing across his lips, while Evan and Kayleigh return his gaze, utterly speechless at what has transpired. \n\nMeanwhile, Andrea navigates the winding and twisting roads, her eyes filled with torment and her expression revealing that she is driving Evan and Kayleigh home. Evan sits in the front passenger seat, while Kayleigh is positioned behind them, and the car's interior is enveloped in a heavy, oppressive silence. Clad in her nurse uniform, Andrea quietly exits the house and makes her way to the car, observed discreetly by Evan through the window. Simultaneously, Kayleigh and Evan walk down toward the house. As a large station wagon approaches, rolling slowly up the street, Evan and Kayleigh quickly duck into the thick cover of nearby bushes, remaining hidden until the station wagon eventually turns into the driveway. Lenny pauses to glance back at the meticulously crafted model airplane as he, along with Evan and Kayleigh, strolls past a disorganized junk pile amid the dense woods. Evan and Kayleigh, absorbing the scene in a shared silence, notice a dense column of smoke rising ominously on the distant horizon. The two spring into action, sprinting toward the ominous smoke, with Lenny trailing nervously behind them. Emerging breathlessly from the woods, they come upon a shocking sight: Tommy has cruelly confined a dog inside a gunny sack, which he recklessly douses with lighter fluid beside a crackling campfire. \n\nEvan and Kayleigh dash urgently toward the defenseless, trapped animal, but Tommy, ever vigilant and prepared, is ready for them. He discards the bottle of lighter fluid, seizes a stout wooden plank, and swings it menacingly at Evan, who narrowly avoids the blow by ducking back at the very last moment. However, this action results in a tragic mistake as Tommy unintentionally strikes Kayleigh on the head, rendering her unconscious. Enraged by the turn of events, Tommy feigns a high swing, then viciously targets Evan's kneecap, delivering a painful strike that sends Evan collapsing in agony to the ground, clutching his injured knee. Undeterred, Tommy moves swiftly toward the fire, where the dog, Crockett, writhes within the confines of the bag. Tommy then picks up the discarded lighter fluid. From his prone position, Evan painfully lifts his gaze, his eyes darting anxiously between the sight of Kayleigh, who lies unconscious, and Crockett, who is trapped inside the tightly tied gunny sack. In a moment of cruel anticipation, Tommy squeezes the bottle hard, creating a deadly, flaming fuse from the campfire to the fluid-soaked sack containing the dog. As the flames inch perilously closer to Crockett, Evan, driven by seething rage, struggles to his feet with clenched fists and charges at Tommy with all the speed he can muster. Despite his best efforts, his body contorts awkwardly, like a fish out of water, and he falls face down onto the unforgiving ground. Slowly regaining his composure, Evan sits up with great difficulty, his face markedly bruised, and he gingerly clutches his battered, aching ribs."

In a sudden burst of aggression, Tommy charges at a Teen Punk, who towers over him by at least a foot, unleashing a rapid succession of punches before the punk can muster any form of defense, while intermittently casting glances at Evan. Evan, Kayleigh, and the punk's friends watch the scene unfold with helpless expressions as two security guards intervene, taking hold of Tommy. As the guards drag him away, Tommy turns back to Evan, flashing a sickly grin, leaving Evan and Kayleigh in stunned silence. Meanwhile, Andrea navigates the twisting roads with eyes that betray her inner turmoil, as she drives Evan and Kayleigh home. Evan sits in the front, while Kayleigh sits silently behind, the atmosphere weighted with unspoken tension. Andrea, clad in her nurse uniform, emerges from the house to her car, unaware that Evan discreetly observes her from the window.

Exiting the woods, they are confronted with the sight of Tommy shoving a dog into a gunny sack, which he then douses in lighter fluid next to a roaring campfire. With urgency, Evan and Kayleigh rush to save the trapped, defenseless dog, but Tommy is well-prepared for their approach. Dropping the bottle of lighter fluid, he swiftly grabs a wooden plank and swings it at Evan, who manages to duck just in time, resulting in Tommy inadvertently striking Kayleigh on the head and rendering her unconscious. Overcome with fury, Tommy feigns a high swing, quickly shifting to strike Evan's kneecap, causing Evan to crumple in agony, clutching his knee as he falls to the ground. Tommy turns his attention back to the fire where Crockett, the dog, wriggles within the confines of the tied sack, and picks up the lighter fluid once more. Evan, writhing in pain on the ground, looks up to see Kayleigh lying motionless and Crockett in grave danger. Tommy squeezes the lighter fluid bottle forcefully, creating a burning trail from the campfire toward the fluid-soaked sack. As the flames inch closer to Crockett, Evan, fueled by rage, forces himself to his feet, fists clenched, and charges at Tommy with all his might. However, his momentum is cut short as he collapses, his body convulsing erratically like a fish out of water, before lying face down in the dirt. Struggling to recover, Evan painfully sits up, his face battered and bruised, tenderly cradling his injured ribs as he assesses the grim scene around him."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
