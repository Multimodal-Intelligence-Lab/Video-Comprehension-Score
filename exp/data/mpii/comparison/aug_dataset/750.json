Minnie heeds silently to Celia's proposal. At the Phelans', everybody is heeding to Walter Cronkite on the monochrome TV. Stuart pecks Skeeter on the brow, and they're both attired in black. She swivels her moist eyes back to the TV, where a hue image of John F. Kennedy suspends next to a image of Aibileen's offspring. Minnie's eyes glide, and she recalls to her visit to Hilly's. Hilly, reclining at a varnished mahogany dining table, takes a mouthful of Minnie's tart and luxuriates in its delectableness as Minnie observes her with a expression of a contented bullfrog. Hilly takes another forkful, and Mrs. Walters stomps in with a vacant glass and decants a whiskey. Hilly thrusts the plate at Minnie, gestures her away, and takes another forkful. Minnie crashes down the plate as the final forkful enters Hilly's mouth. Hilly ascends to her feet, and Minnie fixes her with a expression of barely-concealed mirth, while Minnie's round black eyes denote the tart. Mrs. Walters dissolves into titters, and Minnie elevates her eyes from the chocolate-colored tart to fix them on Hilly, who heaves. Minnie lifts the residual tart and escapes as Skeeter shakes her head, and Minnie, wrapping her sweater around her, storms out. A white-only Jackson City taxi transports Mrs. Walters to the Junior League charity dinner, where she joins the other stylishly-attired invitees ascending the steps towards the fairy-lit locale. The Footes arrive elbow in elbow, seizing a glass of champagne from a companion's tray. Sugar, Minnie, and Aibileen are on service in black costumes with white collars and full white aprons, while Minnie nudge Aibileen to gaze at Celia's body-hugging pink gown. Draining her glass, Celia waves at Hilly, whose automatic grin stagnates as she slaps her spouse's cheek for glancing. Charlotte and her spouse are among the invitees taking to the black and white checkered dance floor, next to Skeeter and Stuart who are dancing cheek to cheek. Celia, standing by the buffet table with another glass of bubbles, inscribes something down. Mr. Blackly executes a jig followed by a cartwheel on the dance floor, causing the maids to double over with mirth. Celia ambles unsteadily into the powder room, where Elizabeth, Jolene, and Mary Beth stand in a antagonistic row in front of the mantle piece. Celia inclines forward to reapply her lipstick, turning her perfectly formed rear in their direction. In the ballroom, Hilly is at the microphone and extends out her hand towards the dozen or more staff standing in a line. Skeeter's visage constricts."

Celia suggests something to Minnie, who listens mutely. At the Phelans', Walter Cronkite is being listened to by everyone on the black and white TV. Skeeter’s forehead is kissed by Stuart, and black is worn by them both. Her teary eyes are turned back to the TV by her, where a color photograph of John F. Kennedy is hanging next to a photograph of Aibileen's son. Minnie's eyes shift, and her visit to Hilly's is flashed back to by her. A bite of Minnie's pie is taken by Hilly, sitting at a polished mahogany dining table, and its deliciousness is luxuriated in by her as Minnie watches her with a look of a satisfied bullfrog. Another forkful is taken by Hilly, and Mrs. Walters stomps in with an empty glass and pours a whiskey. The plate is shoved at Minnie by Hilly, who waves her away and takes another forkful. The plate is slammed down by Minnie as the last forkful is entered into Hilly's mouth. Hilly rises to her feet, and she is fixed with a look of barely-disguised amusement by Minnie, while the pie is indicated by Minnie's round black eyes. Giggles dissolve Mrs. Walters, and Hilly is fixed upon by Minnie raising her eyes from the chocolate-colored pie, she retches. The remaining pie is picked up by Minnie, who flees as her head is shaken by Skeeter, and wrapping her cardigan around her, the house is stormed out of by Minnie. Mrs. Walters is brought by a white-only Jackson City cab to the Junior League benefit dinner, where the other elegantly-dressed guests are joined by her climbing the steps towards the fairy-lit venue. Arm in arm, the Footes arrive, and they grab a glass of champagne from a mate's tray. Duty is carried out by Sugar, Minnie, and Aibileen in black uniforms with white collars and full white aprons, while Aibileen is nudged by Minnie to look at Celia's body-hugging pink dress. Her glass is polished off by Celia, who waves at Hilly, whose automatic smile is frozen as a slap is given to her husband's cheek by her for looking. Among the guests taking to the black and white checkered dance floor are Charlotte and her husband, next to Skeeter and Stuart, who dance cheek to cheek. Standing by the buffet table with another glass of bubbles, Celia writes something down. A jig followed by a cartwheel is performed by Mr. Blackly on the dance floor, causing the maids to double up with laughter. Celia wanders unsteadily into the powder room, where Elizabeth, Jolene, and Mary Beth stand in a hostile line in front of the mantlepiece. To reapply her lipstick, Celia leans forward, turning her perfectly formed behind in their direction.

Minnie listens mutely to Celia's suggestion, knowing that advice from Celia, who is new to the social intricacies of their town, might bring fresh perspective or unforeseen trouble. At the Phelans', everyone is listening to Walter Cronkite, the trusted CBS News anchor known for his solemn and authoritative broadcasts, on the black and white TV. Stuart kisses Skeeter on the forehead, and they're both wearing black, mourning the recent assassination of President John F. Kennedy. She turns her teary eyes back to the TV, where a color photograph of John F. Kennedy, the nation's fallen leader, hangs next to a photograph of Aibileen's son, whose tragic death left a lasting impact on the community. Minnie's eyes shift, and she flashes back to her visit to Hilly's. Hilly, sitting at a polished mahogany dining table that reflects her family's social standing, takes a bite of Minnie's pie and luxuriates in its deliciousness, oblivious to its secret ingredient, as Minnie watches her with a look of a satisfied bullfrog. Hilly takes another forkful, and Mrs. Walters stomps in with an empty glass and pours a whiskey, the Southern staple drink that often accompanies social gatherings. Hilly shoves the plate at Minnie, waves her away, and takes another forkful. Minnie slams down the plate as the last forkful enters Hilly's mouth.

The Footes arrive arm in arm, grabbing a glass of champagne from a mate's tray, savoring the luxury that marked their societal stature. Sugar, Minnie, and Aibileen are on duty in black uniforms with white collars and full white aprons, echoing the strict dress codes for domestic staff, while Minnie nudges Aibileen to look at Celia's body-hugging pink dress, which defies the conservative fashion norms of their southern town. Polishing off her glass, Celia waves at Hilly, whose automatic smile freezes as she slaps her husband's cheek for looking, an action that underscores her insecurities and jealousy. Charlotte and her husband are among the guests taking to the black and white checkered dance floor, reminiscent of old Southern ballrooms, next to Skeeter and Stuart who are dancing cheek to cheek, lost in their own world. Celia, standing by the buffet table with another glass of bubbles, writes something down, perhaps an observation of the evening's events. Mr. Blackly performs a jig followed by a cartwheel on the dance floor, causing the maids to double up with laughter, a rare moment of levity in their demanding roles.

It rotates its moist eyes back to the radio, where a black and white drawing of Theodore Roosevelt dangles next to a drawing of Beth's cousin. Larry's ears swivel, and it drifts back to its trip to Rita's. Rita, leaning at a rough oak coffee table, nibbles a slice of Larry's cake and wallows in its tastiness as Larry observes it with the expression of a merry lizard. Rita nibbles another spoonful, and Ms. Jewel barges in with a full bowl and empties a juice. Rita slides the bowl at Larry, shoos it off, and forks another piece.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

At the Phelans', everyone watches Walter Cronkite on TV, with Skeeter and Stuart wearing black and looking at a photo of John F. Kennedy alongside one of Aibileen's son. Minnie recalls visiting Hilly, watching her relish Minnie's pie. Minnie slams the plate as Hilly eats, hinting at something amiss. Mrs. Walters giggles, Hilly retches, and Minnie leaves with the pie. At a Junior League benefit, Mrs. Walters arrives in a cab, and the Footes enjoy champagne. Minnie, Sugar, and Aibileen work in uniforms; Minnie notes Celia's dress, which catches Hilly's frozen smile. Charlotte, Skeeter, and Stuart dance, while Celia drinks and writes something. Mr. Blackly entertains with a jig, making maids laugh. Celia applies lipstick in the powder room, ignoring Elizabeth, Jolene, and Mary Beth's hostility. In the ballroom, Hilly invites staff forward, and Skeeter's face tightens."
