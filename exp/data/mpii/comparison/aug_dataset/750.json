Minnie heeds silently to Celia's proposal. At the Phelans', everybody is heeding to Walter Cronkite on the monochrome TV. Stuart pecks Skeeter on the brow, and they're both attired in black. She swivels her moist eyes back to the TV, where a hue image of John F. Kennedy suspends next to a image of Aibileen's offspring. Minnie's eyes glide, and she recalls to her visit to Hilly's. Hilly, reclining at a varnished mahogany dining table, takes a mouthful of Minnie's tart and luxuriates in its delectableness as Minnie observes her with a expression of a contented bullfrog. Hilly takes another forkful, and Mrs. Walters stomps in with a vacant glass and decants a whiskey. Hilly thrusts the plate at Minnie, gestures her away, and takes another forkful. Minnie crashes down the plate as the final forkful enters Hilly's mouth. Hilly ascends to her feet, and Minnie fixes her with a expression of barely-concealed mirth, while Minnie's round black eyes denote the tart. Mrs. Walters dissolves into titters, and Minnie elevates her eyes from the chocolate-colored tart to fix them on Hilly, who heaves. Minnie lifts the residual tart and escapes as Skeeter shakes her head, and Minnie, wrapping her sweater around her, storms out. A white-only Jackson City taxi transports Mrs. Walters to the Junior League charity dinner, where she joins the other stylishly-attired invitees ascending the steps towards the fairy-lit locale. The Footes arrive elbow in elbow, seizing a glass of champagne from a companion's tray. Sugar, Minnie, and Aibileen are on service in black costumes with white collars and full white aprons, while Minnie nudge Aibileen to gaze at Celia's body-hugging pink gown. Draining her glass, Celia waves at Hilly, whose automatic grin stagnates as she slaps her spouse's cheek for glancing. Charlotte and her spouse are among the invitees taking to the black and white checkered dance floor, next to Skeeter and Stuart who are dancing cheek to cheek. Celia, standing by the buffet table with another glass of bubbles, inscribes something down. Mr. Blackly executes a jig followed by a cartwheel on the dance floor, causing the maids to double over with mirth. Celia ambles unsteadily into the powder room, where Elizabeth, Jolene, and Mary Beth stand in a antagonistic row in front of the mantle piece. Celia inclines forward to reapply her lipstick, turning her perfectly formed rear in their direction. In the ballroom, Hilly is at the microphone and extends out her hand towards the dozen or more staff standing in a line. Skeeter's visage constricts."

Celia suggests something to Minnie, who listens mutely. At the Phelans', Walter Cronkite is being listened to by everyone on the black and white TV. Skeeter’s forehead is kissed by Stuart, and black is worn by them both. Her teary eyes are turned back to the TV by her, where a color photograph of John F. Kennedy is hanging next to a photograph of Aibileen's son. Minnie's eyes shift, and her visit to Hilly's is flashed back to by her. A bite of Minnie's pie is taken by Hilly, sitting at a polished mahogany dining table, and its deliciousness is luxuriated in by her as Minnie watches her with a look of a satisfied bullfrog. Another forkful is taken by Hilly, and Mrs. Walters stomps in with an empty glass and pours a whiskey. The plate is shoved at Minnie by Hilly, who waves her away and takes another forkful. The plate is slammed down by Minnie as the last forkful is entered into Hilly's mouth. Hilly rises to her feet, and she is fixed with a look of barely-disguised amusement by Minnie, while the pie is indicated by Minnie's round black eyes. Giggles dissolve Mrs. Walters, and Hilly is fixed upon by Minnie raising her eyes from the chocolate-colored pie, she retches. The remaining pie is picked up by Minnie, who flees as her head is shaken by Skeeter, and wrapping her cardigan around her, the house is stormed out of by Minnie. Mrs. Walters is brought by a white-only Jackson City cab to the Junior League benefit dinner, where the other elegantly-dressed guests are joined by her climbing the steps towards the fairy-lit venue. Arm in arm, the Footes arrive, and they grab a glass of champagne from a mate's tray. Duty is carried out by Sugar, Minnie, and Aibileen in black uniforms with white collars and full white aprons, while Aibileen is nudged by Minnie to look at Celia's body-hugging pink dress. Her glass is polished off by Celia, who waves at Hilly, whose automatic smile is frozen as a slap is given to her husband's cheek by her for looking. Among the guests taking to the black and white checkered dance floor are Charlotte and her husband, next to Skeeter and Stuart, who dance cheek to cheek. Standing by the buffet table with another glass of bubbles, Celia writes something down. A jig followed by a cartwheel is performed by Mr. Blackly on the dance floor, causing the maids to double up with laughter. Celia wanders unsteadily into the powder room, where Elizabeth, Jolene, and Mary Beth stand in a hostile line in front of the mantlepiece.

          "description": "Jackie sprawls across the ottoman that Marco has wheeled in for her with a chuckle, as Marco briskly cleans the scrape on Jackie’s knee with a sponge. Jackie hums silently to Marco's proposal. At the Gardners', everyone is staring at Alfred Hitchcock on the color radio. Gary pecks Tara on the shoulder, and they're both wearing blue. She swivels her joyful gaze back to the radio, where a black and white portrait of Albert Einstein hangs next to a snapshot of Felix's cat. Jackie's eyes dart, and she recalls her trip to Lila's. Lila, reclining at a glass pine coffee table, takes a sip of Jackie's tea and revels in its bitterness as Jackie observes her with a look of a curious turtle. Lila takes another gulp, and Mrs. Thompson barges in with a full mug and brews a latte. Lila slides the mug at Jackie, shoos her away, and takes another gulp. Jackie yanks up the mug as the final gulp pours into Lila’s throat. Lila leaps to her toes, and Jackie fixes her with a look of barely-hidden delight, while Jackie's large gray eyes nod at the tea. Mrs. Thompson erupts into hiccups, and Jackie lowers her sights from the vanilla-colored tea to settle them on Lila, who burps. Jackie snatches up the leftover tea and bolts as Tara shrugs her shoulders, and Jackie, tugging her jacket around her, marches out. A members-only Tallahassee City bus delivers Mrs. Thompson to the County Fair charity lunch, where she merges with the other extravagantly-clothed attendees climbing the steps towards the lantern-lit hall. The Smiths appear hand in hand, seizing a glass of port from a waiter’s cart. Honey, Jackie, and Felix are on task in blue outfits with red neckties and full green vests, while Jackie elbows Felix to glance at Marco's sparkling silver scarf. Downing her tumbler, Marco salutes Lila, whose mechanical grin pauses as she taps her brother’s shoulder for watching. Victoria and her partner are among the attendees gliding to the red and green striped skating rink, next to Tara and Gary who are gliding toe to toe. Marco, lingering by the dessert station with another mug of cider, scribbles something down. Mr. Greenly performs a waltz followed by a somersault on the skating rink, causing the custodians to collapse with snickers. Marco meanders unsteadily into the closet, where Patricia, Jolene, and Mary Beth line up in a friendly circle near the planter stand. Marco leans backward to refresh her mascara, angling her awkwardly bent elbow in their direction. In the function room, Lila grabs the horn and stretches out her foot towards the two dozen or more chefs standing in a knot. Tara's smile widens."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
