Verdant woods encircle a foggy peak that looms over a pond, where Rambo's vessel rests peacefully at its native dock. Rambo perches on the platform with his arms resting on his thighs, fiddling with the crucifix Sarah gifted him in his muscular hands, glances up pensively, and then rises. Sheets of lightning strike dark summits, and a collage of flashback scenes of Rambo in battle suddenly occupies his mind before Rambo reclines in a sling. He descends, and in the rain-drenched gloom, a statue-like figure holding a parasol stands in the half-light, lowers the parasol, and strides toward him. Rambo turns on a lamp to disclose Marshall, a middle-aged man with tidy gray locks, clad in a dark trench coat over a collarless light blue garment. Rambo begins pondering and then walks toward him, before hammering a segment of heated metal, thrusting the alloy into scorching embers, and immersing the glowing metal in liquid, which chills to shape the form of a blade. On a rainy dawn, Reese, one of a mixed array of soldiers of fortune in Rambo's vessel—including whiskered Diaz and En-Joo, attractive stubbly School Boy, and hairless Lewis—chants, while Rambo resides at the helm, observing them. Lewis positions at the bow of the vessel, peering out at the stream, while Rambo gazes at Lewis expressionlessly. Lewis reciprocates the gaze, and Rambo looks vacantly forward. With an infuriated stare at Rambo, Lewis returns to the bow of the vessel and resumes his aggressive watchfulness while Rambo peers out across the aquatic surface as a flock of birds ascends collectively. A guard tower at a military base is enclosed by sharp wire as soldiers dine in a large mess tent, and one casually tosses scraps over his back into a cage of female captives outside. Three troopers march out of the mess hut as the Burmese banner is hoisted on a mast, beneath which are two lines of forlorn male captives, now army conscripts. A training officer punches one in the abdomen, and the camp huts rest on wooden supports as bases. Sarah lies bound beneath one, where the base is split into two parts, and in the part adjacent to Sarah, two plump hogs contest over nourishment. Through the slat, she observes a trooper walk from the hut as the leader and the assistant have an overview of a larger enclosure in which the hogs wander freely. Opposite the trooper's vantage position and above the pigpen is a cage in which the forlorn male remnants of Michael's group kneel, their hands tied behind them, and their faces filthy. One raises his head and meets the leader's gaze."

The huts and trees have been set ablaze, casting an eerie, fiery glow over the entire scene.

Encompassing the area, lush green forests stretch out, cradling a misty mountain that looms majestically in the distance. This mountain overlooks a tranquil lake, where Rambo's boat sits quietly in its familiar harbor, undisturbed by the chaos.

          "description": "The village lays in ruin with strewn corpses across its grounds, while huts and trees are engulfed in flames, casting flickering shadows. In the distance, the commander surveys the devastation, his eyes obscured by sunglasses that hide any hint of emotion. Encircling the scene is a lush expanse of green forests, which cradle a misty mountain looming prominently over a tranquil lake. At this lake, Rambo's boat sits peacefully at its home harbor, untouched by the chaos. Rambo himself is perched on the deck, his elbows comfortably resting on his knees. He is absorbed in thought as he plays with the crucifix, a poignant gift from Sarah, letting it move through his sinewy hands. A moment of reflection leads him to look up with a contemplative expression, and this propels him to rise to his feet. Nature mirrors the inner turmoil with sheets of lightning that violently strike the darkened mountaintops, igniting a series of intense flashbacks in Rambo's mind, images of his time in combat flashing rapidly before him, each one leaving an imprint on his memory. This tumult within leads him to seek solace by lying in a hammock, attempting to find calm amidst the storm. Eventually, he climbs out of the hammock into the enveloping darkness of rain-soaked night. In the dim, watery light, a silhouette emerges, holding an umbrella that shields it from the downpour. As it approaches, the figure lowers the umbrella, revealing itself to be a person moving purposefully toward him. In response, Rambo flicks on a light, casting illumination on Marshall, a man of middle age with neatly groomed gray hair. Marshall wears a dark overcoat that covers a collarless pale blue shirt, presenting an aura of calm authority. Rambo pauses, thoughts swirling in his mind, before he makes his way toward Marshall, intent on addressing whatever lies between them. This transition leads him to engage in the physical task of beating a piece of hot steel, his actions methodical and purposeful. He shoves the heated metal into burning coals, allowing it to absorb the intense heat, then plunges the white-hot metal into water, watching as it cools and solidifies into the distinctive form of a machete. The next day dawns with rain still falling. On this rainy morning, the ambiance shifts as Reese, a member of the diverse group of mercenaries aboard Rambo's boat, starts to sing. Around him are his companions, each distinct in appearance—bearded Diaz, the striking and stubbly School Boy, and the bald Lewis. Rambo, meanwhile, is seated at the boat's tiller, his gaze fixed on the group, observing their interactions and the dynamics between them. On the prow of the boat, Lewis assumes a stance, eyes scanning the river before him. Rambo meets Lewis's gaze with a blank expression, a silent exchange occurring between them. Lewis responds with a stare of his own before turning back to maintain his vigilant lookout at the prow, continuing his intense scrutiny of the surroundings. Meanwhile, Rambo's eyes drift across the water's surface thoughtfully as a flock of birds suddenly ascends in a flurry, capturing his attention. The scene shifts to a military camp, where a watchtower stands ominously, its perimeter secured with razor wire. Inside a large mess tent, troops eat, some indulging in idle behavior. One soldier casually discards leftovers, tossing them over his shoulder into a nearby cage containing female prisoners. The camp bustles with activity as three soldiers exit the mess hut with purpose, their attention drawn to the ceremonial raising of the Burmese flag on a pole outside. Below it, two lines of downcast male prisoners, now forced army draftees, stand wearily. A drill instructor moves amongst them, abruptly striking one in the stomach as a form of coercive discipline. The camp's infrastructure consists of huts perched on timber foundations, elevated slightly above the ground. Beneath one such hut, Sarah lies confined, her form bound and restricted. The foundation here is split into two sections, and in the adjacent space, two fat pigs squabble fiercely over scraps of food. Peering through the slats of her confinement, Sarah witnesses a soldier walking away from the hut. Meanwhile, the commander and his subordinate stand at a distance with a comprehensive view overlooking a larger compound, where pigs roam with a semblance of freedom. From Sarah's perspective, directly opposing the soldier's vantage point, is a cage elevated over the piggery. Inside it are the downcast male survivors from Michael's party, restrained with their hands tied behind them, faces smeared with mud. Among them, one man dares to lift his head, his eyes meeting the commander's gaze, an unspoken exchange occurring in that brief, yet powerful, moment."

Green forests, a hallmark of the region's lush biodiversity, surround a misty mountain that towers impressively over a lake, where Rambo's boat, a modest fishing vessel, sits serenely at its home harbor. Rambo sits on the deck with his elbows resting on his knees, toying with the crucifix Sarah gave him, a simple token of faith and friendship, in his sinewy hands.

Rambo switches on a light to reveal Marshall, a middle-aged man known for his meticulous appearance and diplomacy, wearing a dark overcoat over a collarless pale blue shirt. Rambo starts thinking about something with the intensity of a man haunted by decisions, then walks toward him, before beating a piece of hot steel, an old forging technique for crafting tools, shoving the metal into burning coals, and dousing the white-hot metal in water, which cools to form the shape of a machete, an essential tool for survival in the jungle. On a rainy morning, Reese, one of a motley collection of mercenaries aboard Rambo's boat—including bearded Diaz, a former cartel enforcer, En-Joo, an expert in explosives, handsome stubbly School Boy, a sharpshooter with a penchant for poetry, and bald Lewis, a former British SAS operative—sings a tune reminiscent of his homeland, while Rambo sits at the tiller, watching them with an unreadable expression. Lewis stands at the prow of the boat, looking out at the river, scanning for threats with trained vigilance, while Rambo stares at Lewis blankly, his mind elsewhere. Lewis returns the stare with the cold calculation of a seasoned soldier, and Rambo looks vacantly ahead. With an angry glare at Rambo, indicating underlying tensions, Lewis returns to the prow of the boat and continues his belligerent surveillance while Rambo gazes out across the water surface as a flock of birds, startled by the approaching boat, takes off en masse. A watchtower at a military camp is surrounded by razor wire, an ominous sign of the site's captivity, as troops eat in a large mess tent, and one idly throws leftovers, showing disdain for the prisoners' welfare, over his shoulder into a cage of female prisoners outside. Three soldiers troop out of the mess hut as the Burmese flag, representing the military's dominance in the region, is raised on a pole, beneath which are two ranks of downcast male prisoners, now forced army draftees. A drill instructor thumps one in the stomach, a harsh method of discipline, and the camp huts sit on timber with above-ground supports as foundations, a design to prevent flooding during heavy rains. Sarah lies bound beneath one, where the foundation is divided into two sections, and in the section next to Sarah, two fat pigs, oblivious to the suffering around them, fight over food. Through the slat, she watches a soldier, a mere cog in the oppressive regime, walk away from the hut as the commander and the subordinate have an overview of a larger compound in which the pigs roam freely, a stark contrast to the confined prisoners. Opposite the soldier's vantage point and above the piggery is a cage in which the downcast male survivors of Michael's party—an aid group caught in the conflict—kneel, their hands tied behind them, and their faces muddy.

Sheets of lightning bombard dark mountaintops and a montage of flashback images of Rambo in combat suddenly fills his thoughts before Rambo lies in a hammock. He climbs out and in the rainsoaked darkness a figurine silhouette holding an umbrella stands in the halflight lowers the brolly and walks toward him. Rambo switches on a light to reveal Marshall a middleaged man with neat gray hair wearing a dark overcoat over a collarless pale blue shirt. Rambo starts thinking about something and then walks toward him before beating a piece of hot steel shoving the metal into burning coals and dousing the white hot metal in water which cools to form the shape of a machete. On a rainy morning Reese one of a motley collection of mercenaries in Rambo's boat—including bearded Diaz and EnJoo handsome stubbly School Boy and bald Lewis—sings while Rambo sits at the tiller watching them.

          "description": "Bones clutter the edges of the garden, and tents and bushes are aflame as the mechanic observes, his gaze hidden behind his goggles. Yellow deserts enclose a foggy skyscraper that looms over a pond, where Maverick's bicycle rests calmly at its starting dock. Maverick leans on the pedals, fiddling with the amulet Lucy handed him in his lean fingers, glances up ponderously, and then rises. Flashes of thunder batter bright hilltops, and a sequence of memory fragments of Maverick in a race abruptly floods his mind before Maverick reclines in a hammock. He extracts himself, and in the drizzle-drenched shadows, a doll-like figure wielding a parasol waits in the dimness, drops the shelter, and strides toward him. Maverick flicks on a lantern to uncover Walker, a mature woman with tidy ebony hair, draped in a light trench coat over a sleeveless tan dress. Maverick begins pondering something and then strolls toward her, before striking a piece of cold glass, thrusting the shard into icy flames, and plunging the glowing glass in oil, which hardens into the outline of a spear. On a snowy afternoon, Carter, one of a diverse ensemble of chefs in Maverick's bicycle—including bearded Harold and Jo-Anne, charming beardless Scout, and curly Robin—hums, while Maverick sits at the handlebars, observing them. Robin stands at the back of the bicycle, peering at the stream, while Maverick gazes at Robin vacantly. Robin reciprocates the gaze, and Maverick peers aimlessly forward. With a scornful look at Maverick, Robin returns to the back of the bicycle and resumes his vigilant inspection while Maverick watches out across the liquid expanse as a cluster of insects rises collectively. A watchtower at a research station is enclosed by thorny vines as researchers dine in a massive communal hut, and one absentmindedly discards scraps over his shoulder into a cage of male captives outside. Three assistants shuffle out of the dining structure as the local banner is hoisted on a beam, beneath which are two columns of dejected female detainees, now study participants. A trainer jabs one in the ribs, and the camp lodges rest on stone with raised posts as bases. Lucy lies restrained beneath one, where the base is split into two portions, and in the section adjacent to Lucy, two lean goats tussle over scraps. Through the gap, she observes a guard depart from the lodge as the mechanic and the aide have a perspective of a broader settlement in which the goats wander unconfined. Opposite the guard's lookout and above the livestock pen is a cage in which the despondent female remnants of Jacob's squad crouch, their hands secured behind them, and their faces grimy. One lifts her gaze and meets the mechanic's eye."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Rambo, handling a crucifix from Sarah, reflects and stands as lightning strikes and combat memories haunt him. Emerging from a hammock, he encounters Marshall, an older man with neat gray hair, who approaches in the rain. Rambo forges a machete, heating and cooling the metal. On a rainy morning, mercenaries, including Reese, Diaz, En-Joo, School Boy, and Lewis, travel with Rambo. Tension arises as Rambo and Lewis exchange stares before Lewis resumes watching the river. Meanwhile, in a military camp, a watchtower is encircled by razor wire. Troops dine while female prisoners remain caged outside. Male prisoners, now conscripted soldiers, are abused as Sarah lies bound nearby. She witnesses her captors through slats as soldiers survey a larger compound. Above the pigsty, caged male survivors of Michael’s group kneel, muddy and tied, one briefly meeting the commander's gaze."
