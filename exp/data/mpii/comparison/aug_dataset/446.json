Nat, who was calmly preparing the meal, brought over a plate filled with ham and eggs to Don, poured a jiggerful of liquor, which Don promptly downed with urgency. Nat refilled the glass again and then sat down to enjoy his own serving of ham and eggs, taking a moment to drink his jiggerful of alcohol, tapping his glass on the bar as a signal. \n\nFrom the bustling street outside, Gloria made her entrance, adorned in a simple shirtwaist and skirt ensemble, complemented by a peculiar little hat perched atop her head, and wearing high-heeled shoes accented with decorative bows.

However, he seemed to change his mind, turning around with a Guide of New York protruding from his pocket, before walking out again in a state of bewilderment.

This unexpected outburst cast the entire bar into a profound and deafening silence, which was only occasionally interrupted by the sizzling sound of eggs and ham cooking on the grill. Nat, who was peacefully and methodically preparing the meal, brought over a heaping plate filled with ham and eggs to Don, then poured a jiggerful of liquor, which Don quickly and urgently downed. Without delay, Nat refilled the glass once more and then took a seat to relish his own serving of ham and eggs, taking a moment to savor his own jiggerful of alcohol, tapping his glass on the bar as a subtle signal to himself.\n\nFrom the lively and bustling street outside, Gloria made her entrance.

          "description": "As dusk settles in and the electric lights flicker on to illuminate the surroundings, Don suddenly slams his fist on the bar, causing an eruption of noise before plunging the space into silence, with only the sizzling sound of eggs and ham breaking the stillness. Nat approaches the bar, carefully balancing a plate of ham and eggs, and pours a jiggerful of drink, which Don swiftly consumes. Responding to Don's eagerness, Nat refills the glass, proceeds to engage with his own serving of ham and eggs, sips his jiggerful with a sense of satisfaction, and then lightly taps the empty glass on the bar to signal his completion. As this scene unfolds, Gloria enters from the street adorned in a shirtwaist and skirt, topped with a whimsical little hat and high-heeled shoes accented by bows. Meanwhile, another drink is poured as a round-faced, middle-aged man, distinguished by his pince-nez, steps into the bar. Nat subtly uses his thumb to indicate Gloria's presence to the man, who momentarily contemplates the direction of the door before pivoting around, with a Guide of New York conspicuously protruding from his pocket, and exits in a state of bewilderment. As the man departs, Don finishes another jigger of rye, prompting Nat to falter briefly before pouring yet another drink. Now removing his hat and shaking off the rain, he methodically peels off his raincoat to reveal a bowler hat and a straight raincoat beneath. A crowd begins to fill the building, energetically engaging in business-like exchanges while attending to the checking of dripping umbrellas and outerwear. With an adept and swift movement, he transfers a bottle into the pocket of his raincoat, which he then rolls up carefully as if handling precious swaddling clothes. He carries a pint of liquor discreetly tucked away in the side pocket of his suit. Amidst this crowd is Don Birnam, who, with a sense of ritual, hands his coat to an attendant while his eyes linger with a tender sweetness on the pocket, before he turns determinedly towards the auditorium door. Spotting an open space in the line at the cloak room counter, he steps into it, eventually settling himself in a seat about five places from the aisle, finding himself flanked by an elderly daughter and her age-old mother on one side, and a middle-aged couple on the other, briefly scanning through the program as the rising curtain alters the lighting over the gathered audience. Don directs his gaze upward, thirst evident in his eyes, then consciously shifts his focus away from the stage, striving to concentrate on the grandeur of the Metropolitan's ceiling as powdered footmen elegantly pour wine into the glasses of the exuberantly animated guests. On stage, Alfred and Violetta engage in a lively exchange of the drinking song, while the chorus, glasses in hand, stands in rhythmic swaying motion, echoing each couplet with enthusiasm. Driven by his imagination working at an intense pace, Don feels the first beads of sweat form on his forehead, prompting him to retrieve a handkerchief from his pocket to gently dab it away. In a moment of visual transformation, the swaying group of choristers gradually dissolves in his mind into an image of raincoats, much like his own, hanging from hangers and swaying to the rhythm of Verdi's composition, as Don’s eyes remain fixated on the spectacle before him."

Nat fills it again, sits down to his ham and eggs, a comforting meal in the dimly lit room, drinks his jiggerful, and taps the glass on the bar.

Don's imagination works at top speed as the first drops of sweat gather on his forehead and he takes a handkerchief from his pocket to wipe it. The swaying echelon of choristers slowly dissolves to a row of raincoats like the one Don wore hanging from hangers and swaying to Verdi's rhythm as his eyes remain glued to the stage."

          "description": "At twilight, the neon lanterns are glowing when suddenly Max slams the table and implodes, leaving the room silent except for the crackling noise of the bacon and biscuits. Lee carries over a platter of biscuits and bacon, empties a ladleful, and Max gulps it. Lee refills it, reclines to his bacon and biscuits, sips his ladleful, and clinks the cup on the table. From the courtyard, Angela strides in wearing a blouse and trousers, a silly little cap, and platform sandals with laces. He fills another cup as a jolly, youthful woman with aviators enters the room. With his finger, Lee nods to Angela, and the woman takes a few strides towards the exit, then swivels with a Map of Chicago peeking from her bag and strolls out, confused. She gulps the ladle of cola, and Lee cracks up and empties a mug. She takes off her cap, flicks the dust from it, sheds her windbreaker, and is wearing a fedora and a sleek parka. A mob of creatures rushes into the space, conducting a bustling trade, depositing soaked parasols and garments. With a swift motion, she slips a flask into the compartment of her parka and bundles the parka up like a picnic blanket. In her jacket's inside slot is a quart of gin. Amid the throng is Max Miller, who hands his jacket to a helper, his glance resting on its slot with a certain affection before he pivots and advances towards the gallery entrance. Spotting a gap in the queue at the coat check counter, he slides into it and places himself about five chairs from the walkway between an elder son and his ancient father, and a youthful woman and husband, skimming through the booklet as the drape ascends, altering the glow on the gathering. Max glances up, yearning in his face, averts his gaze from the platform, and attempts to focus on the Grand Theater's ceiling, while feathered servants pour juice into the flutes of the over-excitable patrons. Curtis and Olivia volley the toasting tune back and forth as the ensemble, goblets in grasp, stands rocking, repeating each refrain. Max's fancy races at full tilt as the first beads of perspiration form on his temple, and he retrieves a napkin from his pocket to dab it. The rocking troop of singers gradually transforms to a line of parkas like the one Max donned, dangling from racks and swaying to Mozart's beat, as his gaze remains fixed on the stage."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

          "description": "At dusk, Don pounds the bar, leaving it silent except for the sizzling eggs and ham. Nat serves him ham, eggs, and a drink, which Don quickly downs. Gloria enters in a shirtwaist and skirt, while Nat gestures towards her to a puzzled, middle-aged man who leaves. Nat, breaking down, has a drink himself. A crowd streams into the building, checking umbrellas and coats. A man sneaks a bottle into his raincoat, while Don Birnam lingers on his coat’s pocket before heading to the auditorium. Inside, he sits near others, trying to focus on the performance as the curtain rises. Thirsty, Don struggles to concentrate amidst the lively scene. The chorus sways to Verdi’s rhythm, and Don, sweating, wipes his forehead, imagining choristers as raincoats hanging and swaying, his eyes fixed on the stage."
