As Graham and Officer Paski gradually approach the scene, they notice that Morgan is crying, tears streaming down his face. It becomes apparent why as they look at the dog, lying on its side with a barbecue fork protruding painfully from its neck. Meanwhile, Bo is perched on top of the jungle gym, curled up tightly in a ball, visibly distressed. They fix their gaze on Morgan as he slowly retrieves an inhaler from his pocket, bringing it to his lips to take a calming breath of the asthma spray. Once he has inhaled, he lowers the inhaler to speak. Graham, looking intently at his ten-year-old son, begins to cry, overcome with emotion. He gently picks up Morgan in his arms, his heart heavy, and reaches up for Bo, who is covered in dirt and tears staining her face. She gingerly climbs down, and Graham holds Bo tenderly as she sobs in his arms, comforting her as he starts to walk purposefully towards the house.

As Graham and Officer Paski approach, they notice tears streaming down Morgan's face, indicating his distress. Their eyes then fall upon the sight of the dog lying on its side with a barbecue fork gruesomely embedded in its neck. Nearby, Bo is perched atop the jungle gym, tightly curled up into a ball, conveying her own sense of fear or sadness. Morgan becomes the focus of their attention as he painstakingly retrieves an inhaler from his pocket, bringing it up to his lips with a deliberate motion. He inhales deeply, allowing the asthma spray to work, then lowers the inhaler, preparing himself to speak. Graham observes his son, only ten years old, and is overcome with emotion, tears beginning to well up as he watches him. In a gesture of comfort, Graham lifts Morgan into his arms, drawing him close. He extends his arms upwards, reaching for Bo, who hesitates but then slowly descends from her spot, her face marked with dirt and streaked with tears. As Bo reaches the ground, Graham gathers her into his embrace, holding both children securely as she cries into his shoulder. With a heavy heart, he begins to make his way toward the house. Meanwhile, Merrill emerges from the backyard, clutching a bowl of potato salad, only to freeze in place as he surveys the scene. Graham arrives at the porch, pulling open the screen door to usher the children inside. They watch intently over their father's shoulder as Merrill hastens toward their other German Shepherd, sitting quietly by the house. With urgency, Merrill leads the dog by its collar across the yard toward the shed. In a harrowing moment, Officer Paski resolutely extracts the barbecue fork from their dead dog's neck. Later, Graham lies in bed, resting his cheek against the pillow, solitude enveloping him. Slowly, he rises from the bed, reaches out to take his daughter's hand, and together they exit the room. They settle into a shared silence, the weight of the moment sinking in. Graham, with eyes wide in surprise, shifts his gaze toward the bedroom window and sees the silhouette of a large figure. Instinctively, he stands as Merrill opens the front door, revealing the pitch-black outside. Merrill turns to Graham, gesturing with his fingers in a closing motion. Both men peer into the darkness, trying to discern what might be lurking beyond. Without warning, Graham bolts into the night, rounding the first corner of the house, while Merrill follows, his arms waving as he turns the corner at full speed. The large figure becomes visible as Merrill's eyes trail upwards, catching sight of it. Graham exits the kitchen, where Bo sits absorbed in her cartoons. The broadcast suddenly changes, displaying a special report news icon on the screen. Morgan, feeling the tension rise, fishes out his asthma inhaler once more, taking a deep, calming breath. Graham and Edgar make their way down the driveway toward Edgar's patrol car. Graham reaches out, turning the car off, while Morgan acknowledges with a nod before slumping back into the backseat. In downtown Bucks County, a quaint array of small stores lines the quiet street. The Hess family station wagon maneuvers into position, parking neatly in front of an available meter. Graham steps out from the driver's side, scanning his surroundings as Merrill approaches the meter and deposits some change. Morgan approaches Graham with Bo by his side, extending his hand in a request for money. Graham obliges, handing Morgan some cash, after which Morgan takes Bo's hand and the two siblings stroll leisurely down the sidewalk."

As Graham and Officer Paski, a local law enforcement officer known for his dedication to the community, get closer, they see Morgan is crying. Then they see the dog is laying on its side and has a barbecue fork, a common outdoor cooking utensil, in its neck. Bo is on top of the jungle gym, a playground structure made for climbing, curled up in a ball. They stare at Morgan as he slowly pulls an inhaler from his pocket, a device commonly used to treat asthma, and brings it to his mouth. He inhales the asthma spray, which delivers a quick burst of relief for breathing difficulties, and lowers the inhaler so he can speak. Graham stares at his ten-year-old son and starts crying, overwhelmed by the tragic scene. Graham picks him up in his arms and reaches up for Bo, who has dirt from the jungle gym and tears on her face. She slowly climbs down, and Graham carries Bo as she cries in his arms, a comforting gesture. He starts towards the house, a modest, two-story home with a wide porch. Merrill walks out from the back holding a bowl of potato salad, a staple at family gatherings, and stands still in shock. Graham reaches the porch of his house and opens the screen door, a common feature in homes to keep insects out while allowing fresh air in. The children watch over their father's shoulder as Merrill runs to their other German Shepherd, a breed known for its loyalty and strength, sitting quietly near the house and leads her by her collar across the yard to the shed for safety. Officer Paski is pulling the barbecue fork out of their dead dog's neck with care, as he prepares to investigate what happened. Graham lies in bed, resting his cheek against the pillow as he lies by himself, reflecting on the day's tragic events. He slowly gets up from the bed, takes his daughter's hand with a reassuring grip, and starts out of the room. They both sit quietly for a moment in the comforting presence of each other. He looks to his daughter with startled eyes, and Graham's eyes drift to the bedroom window. A large silhouetted figure, indistinct in the night, is seen. Graham stands as Merrill opens the front door. It's pitch black outside, a typical rural night away from city lights, and Merrill turns to Graham and gestures with his fingers, bringing them together at the end of the gesture as a signal of caution. Merrill and Graham look out into the darkness, tense with anticipation. Graham runs through the darkness around the first corner of the house, his heart racing with adrenaline, and Merrill waves his arms and turns a corner full speed, driven by instinct to protect. The large figure has come into view as Merrill's eyes drift above them, revealing its ominous nature. Graham starts out of the kitchen, while Bo watches cartoons, her distraction from the fear outside. Bo's cartoon is replaced by a special report news icon, signaling an urgent broadcast. Morgan takes the asthma inhaler from his pocket and breathes in deeply, managing his breathing under stress. Graham and Edgar walk down the driveway to Edgar's patrol car, a vital tool in his police work, and Graham turns the car off as Morgan nods and then plops back into the backseat, seeking comfort in familiarity. Downtown Bucks County, a picturesque area known for its quaint charm, is a group of small stores along a quiet street.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
