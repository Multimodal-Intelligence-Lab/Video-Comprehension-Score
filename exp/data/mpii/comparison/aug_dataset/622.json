At his locker, Bleeker knocks back as Juno waddles up to him and looks him straight in the eye. Bleeker's eye shift as he glances in Katrina's direction, and his head drops miserably. Juno strides away with her canvas bag over her shoulder, leaving Bleeker standing by his locker, watching her glumly. Juno hoists herself up into her dad's Previa, puts on some lip balm, and starts the engine. Meanwhile, Mark, surfing on his PC, sees the blue van pull up outside as Juno follows him downstairs, and he leads her into a cluttered basement room. She reads a title and her hands grab his waist. He brings the up to his neck, and with his hands round her waist, her belly touching his, she closes her eyes and rests her head on his chest as they slowly sway together. Mark, with his chin brushing against her hair, seems unsettled as Juno looks up startled and stares at him in bewilderment. Vanessa, loaded down with shopping, comes into her pristine white kitchen while Mark lowers his gaze. Juno starts to go and bolts out of the door, clutching her belly as she waddles out to the Previa. Mark, in his rock T-shirt over a long-sleeved undershirt, looks coldly at Vanessa and goes back to his room, and Vanessa sinks down on the stairs and gazes unhappily into space. Beneath a cloudy sky, Juno drives under a road bridge, passing a freight train on one side. She pulls off the main carriageway onto the soft shoulder, next to a sward of dull green grass dotted with patches of spring snow, runs her hand over her own belly as she gives into tears, and crammed in behind the wheel, seems oblivious of the passing cars as she rubs her belly under her thick tartan coat, her eyes staring straight ahead, not looking at anything in particular, and she starts to calm down. The car lights flash, and she pulls back onto the road and drives off. Up in his room, Bleeker is playing his guitar after dark. On the bonnet of the van, with her head resting on the sloping front windscreen and her hands tucked behind her back, Juno stares up at the sky. She suddenly raises herself onto her elbows, climbs back into the van, rummages behind her to find a crumpled receipt, smoothes it out on the steering wheel of the van, and starts to write on it.",

Mark is at home composing music, likely working on one of his garage band songs that he hopes will help him escape his mundane life.

Juno strides away with her canvas bag over her shoulder, a bag covered in patches from various bands, leaving Bleeker standing by his locker, watching her glumly.

She pulls off the main carriageway onto the soft shoulder next to a sward of dull green grass dotted with patches of spring. snow runs her hand over her own belly as she gives into tears and crammed in behind the wheel seems oblivious of the passing cars as she rubs her belly under her thick tartan coat her eyes staring straight ahead not looking at anything in particular and she starts to calm down. The car lights flash and she pulls back onto the road and drives off. Up in his room. Bleeker is playing his guitar after dark.

          "description": "Luna, donning the mismatched sneakers, floats up the mountain with her elbows tucked in the sleeves of her oversized striped cape as her fellow hikers, glancing at her backpack, part the trail to let her ascend. Tom is at the cabin painting. In the mountain lodge, the two rabbits snack on their berries in an abandoned mountaintop cabin while Lucy gawks lovingly at the pudgy horned guide. At the trailhead, Buster trips forward as Luna bounces over to him and glances him directly in the tooth. Buster's tooth shifts as he peeks in Frida's direction, and his knees slump joylessly. Luna glides away with her rucksack slung across her torso, leaving Buster leaning against the trailhead, observing her drearily. Luna hauls herself onto her uncle's scooter, applies some sunscreen, and revs the engine. Meanwhile, Tom, sketching on his tablet, spots the red scooter park outside as Luna trails him upslope, and he directs her into a crowded treehouse. She scans a label and her fingers clasp his wrist. He draws them to his chin, and with his arms encircling her shoulders, her backpack pressing his, she closes her ears and rests her foot on his knee as they slowly rock together. Tom, with his nose grazing against her hood, seems perturbed as Luna peers up confused and gapes at him in puzzlement. Valerie, weighed down with gear, enters her spotless black conservatory while Tom averts his gaze. Luna starts to dash and sprints out of the door, gripping her backpack as she bounces out to the scooter. Tom, in his sport jersey under a wooly vest, glances bitterly at Valerie and retreats to his den, and Valerie sinks onto the couch and stares despondently into the void. Beneath a dim sky, Luna maneuvers under an old tunnel, bypassing a cargo ship on one side. She swerves off the main trail onto the rough shoulder, beside a field of faded yellow weeds speckled with flakes of winter frost, runs her foot over her own backpack as she gives in to sobs, and wedged in behind the handlebars, seems oblivious to the wandering owls as she pats her backpack under her thick striped cloak, her gaze fixed directly forward, not focusing on anything in sight, and she starts to settle down. The scooter horn echoes, and she merges back onto the trail and speeds away. Up in his attic, Buster is plucking his banjo after dusk. On the hood of the scooter, with her knee resting on the angled rear window and her arms crossed behind her neck, Luna gazes up at the clouds. She abruptly lifts herself onto her heels, hops back onto the scooter, searches behind her to find a wrinkled flyer, flattens it on the handlebars of the scooter, and begins to scribble on it."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
