Hermione, her face etched with anxiety, turns to Ron, who immediately crouches down beside Harry, offering silent support. Harry, his expression filled with worry, watches as Hermione squats down next to him, her concern palpable. In an attempt to calm himself, Harry closes his eyes tightly and takes a deep, steadying breath, his jaw remaining tense as he breathes through his mouth. Elsewhere, Nagini is coiled up in a boat house, where Lucius Malfoy stands in the presence of Voldemort, who is intently examining the skin on his own forearm, lost in thought. When Harry finally opens his eyes, he finds Hermione and Ron staring at him with anxious expressions, their concern mirrored by the chaos unfolding around them as Death Eaters sweep over the school grounds. Amidst the turmoil, a student swoops in on a broomstick, narrowly avoiding a giant who swings a massive scythe, while others engage in fierce battles on the stairs. Hermione, with quick reflexes, dashes through a door, narrowly dodging a bolt of magic, as Harry pounds on another door and manages to shoot a Death Eater with precision. Suddenly, a giant wielding two-pronged weapons spots the trio, prompting them to sprint away, seeking refuge inside a massive bell lying on its side, just as the giant's weapon strikes it with a resounding clang.

As Aberforth and his allies turn back to engage in battle, the trio seizes the opportunity to sprint away, making their way onto a raised walkway and down the steps towards the boat house, where lights flicker and Snape stands with Voldemort. Voldemort fixes his gaze on Snape, who maintains a composed smile, his eyes never leaving Voldemort as he circles him. With a swift, slicing motion of the Elder Wand, Snape is sent crashing against a glass-paneled wall, with Harry watching helplessly from the other side. As Snape's mouth falls open in shock, the snake lunges at him repeatedly, each impact thumping him against the lead-paneled glass, which shudders but holds firm, while Harry and the others can only watch helplessly from outside. Snape's bloodied hand slides down the window, leaving a crimson trail, before he collapses limply to the floor. Harry and the others rush into the boat house, finding Snape still clinging to life. As Snape's lower jaw trembles, Harry moves towards him, kneels down, and leans forward to apply pressure to the wound on Snape's neck in a desperate attempt to staunch the bleeding. The dying Snape turns his head to meet Harry's gaze, their eyes locking in a moment of profound connection, as a single tear rolls down Snape's cheek. Meanwhile, Hermione rummages frantically through her bag, eventually pulling out a small phial, her hands shaking with urgency."

Harry continues to shiver as disheveled and dirty from their recent escape through the Forbidden Forest, Hermione and Ron approach him. Hermione, known for her quick thinking in dangerous situations, turns anxiously to Ron, and he crouches down beside Harry. Harry looks worried as Hermione squats down. Harry closes his eyes and takes a deep breath while his jaw remains tense, breathing through his mouth, a technique he learned to calm himself during high-stress situations. Meanwhile, Nagini is curled up in a boat house where Lucius Malfoy, a former influential Death Eater, is present with Voldemort, who examines the skin on his own forearm where the Dark Mark, his symbol, fades. When Harry opens his eyes, the others stare at him anxiously as the Death Eaters, Voldemort's followers, sweep over Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. A student flies in on a broomstick, reminiscent of those used in the wizarding sport Quidditch, as a giant swings a scythe, and the others fight on the stairs. Hermione runs through a door, narrowly avoiding a bolt of magical energy, as Harry beats on a door and shoots a Death Eater, a member of Voldemort's inner circle. A giant with two-pronged weapons, similar to ancient tridents, spots the trio, and they run, hiding inside a huge bell lying on its side as the giant's weapon strikes it, producing a deafening sound. Colossal spiders, descendants of Aragog's brood in the Forbidden Forest, appear scrambling over the rubble, causing them to retreat. Hermione runs between the giants, and they fend off attacks with their wands to reach a quieter area. They stop when they spot a Death Eater leaning over a girl's body, as a werewolf, Fenrir Greyback known for his savagery, glances up. Hermione casts a spell, knocking Fenrir Greyback through a window. They run through a closed-end walkway with the giants keeping pace, smashing the walls. Racing to the front of the school, they see Dementors, soul-sucking creatures that guard Azkaban prison, flying towards them, when suddenly a shimmering barrier is thrown by Aberforth Dumbledore, Albus Dumbledore's brother and owner of the Hog's Head Inn, holding a wand in his outstretched hand. As Aberforth and his allies turn back to fight, the trio sprints away, running onto a raised walkway and down steps towards the boat house lights where Severus Snape, the former Potions Master, is with Voldemort. Voldemort stares at him as Snape perfects a smile, hiding his true loyalties, circling him with his eyes fixed on Voldemort. With a slicing move with the Elder Wand, a legendary wand said to be unbeatable, Snape falls against a glass-paneled wall with Harry on the other side. Mouth agape, the snake lunges repeatedly at Snape, thumping him against the lead-paneled glass, which shakes but doesn't give way, as Harry and the others grab helplessly outside. Snape's bloody hand slides down a window and falls limply to the floor as Harry and the others enter the boat house to find Snape still alive. His lower jaw trembles as Harry moves towards him, kneels down, and leans forward to staunch a wound on Snape's neck, trying to save the man who had protected him for years. The dying Snape turns his head to look at Harry, who gazes deeply into his eyes, seeking understanding, as a tear rolls down Snape's cheek, while Hermione rummages in her bag and pulls out a small phial, hoping to preserve Snape's last memories."

Penelope dashes through a gateway, narrowly evading an arrow, as Jasper pounds on a hatch and strikes a Shadow Walker. A behemoth with three-pronged sticks spots the group, and they flee, hiding inside a massive drum lying on its rim as the behemoth's tool bashes it. Gigantic beetles appear crawling over the debris, prompting them to withdraw. Penelope dashes between the behemoths, and they defend against onslaughts with their staffs to reach a calmer spot.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
