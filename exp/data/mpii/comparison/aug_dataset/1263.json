Hermione, her face etched with anxiety, turns to Ron, who immediately crouches down beside Harry, offering silent support.

When Harry finally opens his eyes, he finds Hermione and Ron staring at him with anxious expressions, their concern mirrored by the chaos unfolding around them as Death Eaters sweep over the school grounds.

Hermione, with quick reflexes, dashes through a door, narrowly dodging a bolt of magic, as Harry pounds on another door and manages to shoot a Death Eater with precision. Suddenly, a giant wielding two-pronged weapons spots the trio, prompting them to sprint away, seeking refuge inside a massive bell lying on its side, just as the giant's weapon strikes it with a resounding clang.

Voldemort fixes his gaze on Snape, who maintains a composed smile, his eyes never leaving Voldemort as he circles him. With a swift, slicing motion of the Elder Wand, Snape is sent crashing against a glass-paneled wall, with Harry watching helplessly from the other side. As Snape's mouth falls open in shock, the snake lunges at him repeatedly, each impact thumping him against the lead-paneled glass, which shudders but holds firm, while Harry and the others can only watch helplessly from outside. Snape's bloodied hand slides down the window, leaving a crimson trail, before he collapses limply to the floor. Harry and the others rush into the boat house, finding Snape still clinging to life. As Snape's lower jaw trembles, Harry moves towards him, kneels down, and leans forward to apply pressure to the wound on Snape's neck in a desperate attempt to staunch the bleeding. The dying Snape turns his head to meet Harry's gaze, their eyes locking in a moment of profound connection, as a single tear rolls down Snape's cheek.

A giant with two-pronged weapons, similar to ancient tridents, spots the trio, and they run, hiding inside a huge bell lying on its side as the giant's weapon strikes it, producing a deafening sound. Colossal spiders, descendants of Aragog's brood in the Forbidden Forest, appear scrambling over the rubble, causing them to retreat.

With a slicing move with the Elder Wand, a legendary wand said to be unbeatable, Snape falls against a glass-paneled wall with Harry on the other side.

          "description": "Balthazar peers at the raven, and they teleport. Jasper continues to wobble as messy and grimy, Penelope and Edgar drift towards him. Penelope spins worriedly to Edgar, and he hunches down beside Jasper. Jasper appears anxious as Penelope crouches down. Jasper shuts his eyes and exhales deeply while his lips remain tight, inhaling through his nose. Igor is coiled up in a lighthouse where Draco Blackwood is present with Balthazar, who inspects the tattoo on his own ankle. When Jasper opens his eyes, the others gaze at him nervously as the Shadow Walkers surge over the fortress. A scholar glides in on a kite as a colossus wields a trident, and the others battle on the ladders. Penelope dashes through a gateway, narrowly evading an arrow, as Jasper pounds on a hatch and strikes a Shadow Walker. A behemoth with three-pronged sticks spots the group, and they flee, hiding inside a massive drum lying on its rim as the behemoth's tool bashes it. Gigantic beetles appear crawling over the debris, prompting them to withdraw. Penelope dashes between the behemoths, and they defend against onslaughts with their staffs to reach a calmer spot. They pause when they notice a Shadow Walker stooping over a boy's figure, as a gorgon peeks up. Penelope conjures a charm, flinging Randall Greyfang through a portal. They scamper through a dead-end corridor with the behemoths trailing closely, smashing the ceilings. Dashing to the entrance of the fortress, they notice Phantoms soaring toward them, when suddenly a glittering barricade is hurled by Alistair Everwood, holding a staff in his extended grip. As Alistair and his comrades pivot back to combat, the group dashes away, sprinting onto a suspended bridge and down ramps towards the lighthouse glimmers where Orion is with Balthazar. Balthazar glares at him as Orion perfects a grin, orbiting him with his gaze fixed on Balthazar. With a slashing gesture with the Ancient Staff, Orion collapses against a crystal-paneled barrier with Jasper on the opposite side. Jaw slack, the raven dives repeatedly at Orion, pounding him against the leaded crystal, which trembles but doesn't shatter, as Jasper and the others clutch helplessly outdoors. Orion's crimson hand slips down a screen and drops weakly to the ground as Jasper and the others enter the lighthouse to find Orion still conscious. His lower lip quivers as Jasper moves towards him, bends down, and leans forward to tend to a scratch on Orion's shoulder. The fading Orion tilts his head to gaze at Jasper, who peers intently into his eyes as a droplet slides down Orion's face, while Penelope digs in her pouch and extracts a tiny bottle."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
