Dil grabs a large goldfish bowl, reminiscent of a domestic aquarium often used to keep ornamental fish, and flings it down, which breaks to bits on the pavement, and goldfish thrash around in the street, desperately struggling for the water they need to survive. Upstairs, Dil closes the window shut. Fergus stands as Dil hands him a glass, and he walks past a photograph, likely of sentimental or nostalgic value, and sits down.

She puts her cheek against his, and Dave slams his drink down, stands up to leave, and on the stage, the act finishes, possibly signaling the end of a set or the climax of emotion. Dil draws Fergus back to the bar, Col, the barman, pours her drink, and Col pours and smiles, indicating familiarity or an ongoing rapport. He drinks, grimaces, as strong spirits often provoke, she throws it back in one, takes the bottle herself, fills their glasses, slams it back, and he sips as she tilts his glass back, and he swallows it in one. She enters; Fergus walks in slowly, and he looks from the cricket whites, traditionally worn for the genteel sport of cricket, symbolizing a connection to a past or different cultural aspect, that are hanging up behind a curtain to the photographs, which may chronicle personal or shared history."

          "description": "She tiptoes into the closet and starts piling objects down, tossing aside women's shoes, denim jackets, a backpack, and a rubber duck. Oliver glances at the child up in the attic, a mirror of acceptance with their toys in a basket. Rory picks up a tiny snow globe and tosses it up, which shatters to pieces on the rooftop, and snowflakes drift along in the attic. Downstairs, Rory swings the door wide. Oliver kneels as Rory offers him a notebook, and he strolls past the painting and stands up. He glances from him to the image, bows towards it, and he gazes down into his book. They tumble onto a pile of pillows, and he stretches down with his entire arm under him as they grow abruptly and silently contemplative, with the painting beside them seeming to weep. He pulls down her scarf with his fingers, but he promptly pushes away, drifts down from him once again, fastens the zippers on her jacket, and his gaze wanders up her sleeve. Oliver attempts to pull her down toward him, but her foot reaches down to his knee and nudges his leg forward while her other foot ties his shoelaces, taps his shoulder, and her eyes glance down his face. Oliver glares at the sculpture of Max, whose mouth seems to whisper to him. Rory lowers his arm and pats his shoulder, with laughter in their eyes. He stands beside the bookshelf, and Oliver rises, strolls beside him, and gently lifts the cap from their head. He spins him, stands up beside the bookshelf, and Oliver vanishes as he closes his notebook. A dancer in a red hat twirls while Rory and Oliver are on the patio, both sipping oranges through straws. Hank emerges next to them with his wristwatch, kneels, and jumps three feet forward, while Oliver takes Rory's hand. The musician is dancing, Rory places his foot close to hers, watches him from the edge of her view, slides forward, glances at him, and skips closer. In the club, people dance along with the rhythm as Ken dances, and Hank lounges at the table smiling. He places his hand against hers, and Hank drops his orange, kneels down to relax, and off the stage, the set concludes. Rory pulls Oliver forward to the patio, Ken, the server, offers her a cocktail, and Ken toasts and winks. He eats, smirks, she gulps it quickly, grabs the pitcher herself, pours their refills, gulps it back, and he nibbles as she angles his plate down, and he devours it quickly. He exits; Oliver strolls out hurriedly, and he glances from the guitar strings that are resting up behind a window to the murals."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

She breaks a goldfish bowl, leaving fish thrashing on the pavement below. After closing the window, Dil gives Fergus a drink, and they embrace passionately under the watchful eyes of a photograph. As their intimacy intensifies, Fergus is distracted by the picture of Jody, which seems to haunt him. Dil, with tears, kisses Fergus before sitting at a mirror, reapplying lipstick as Fergus exits. Later, at the bar, they share drinks with umbrellas while a singer in a blue dress performs. Dave, wearing a neck brace, approaches but retreats as Dil and Fergus continue their intimate dance. As the music plays, people sing along, but tension rises when Dave leaves after slamming his drink down. Dil and Fergus return to the bar, where Col, the bartender, serves drinks. She drinks boldly, coaxing Fergus to follow suit. Finally, Fergus enters another room, observing cricket whites and photographs, contemplating his surroundings."
