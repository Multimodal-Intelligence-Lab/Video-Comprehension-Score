Despite his father's disapproval, Harry continues his ascent, his demeanor sullen and questioning. As he reaches the top, he looks at his father with a mix of curiosity and hurt. Norman steps down to meet him, closing the distance between them, and envelops Harry in a warm embrace. Overwhelmed by emotion, Harry closes his eyes, feeling tears begin to form.

In a futuristic space station orbiting a distant planet an intrepid crew confronts bizarre alien phenomena and an enigmatic interstellar threat pushing the limits of human endurance. Way below her traffic moves across the Queensboro Bridge as she stands on one of the towers of the steel structure. The Green Goblin approaches and glides over the ducking MJ who watches him move towards a cable car filled with children and adults. The Green Goblin shoots a missile destroying the cablecar station and motor cars on the bridge collide. From a nearby rooftop SpiderMan observes the chaos as a massive metal wheel flies into the air. a cable whips free and the Roosevelt Island cable car begins to fall. The Green Goblin grabs the cable stabilizing the car as SpiderMan standing on a thick strand of web tied between two flagpoles launches himself into the air by walking down a building. He shoots webs maneuvering along the steel girders until he lands on a metal strut. Above him the Goblin holds MJ in one hand and the cablecar cable in the other lifting MJ as her slippers slip off. The cable car swings in the wind suspended solely by the Goblin's grip. The Goblin releases both MJ and the cable simultaneously. In the reflections of the large spider eyes on SpiderMan's mask one shows MJ falling and the other the cable car full of screaming frightened children. SpiderMan runs along the girder leaps to catch MJ and then swings beneath the span to ensnare the cable car in his web."

          "description": "As the portal swings open, Zoe wanders in, juggling a cluster of balloons, and Casey swiftly pushes her chair away from Alex's. Zoe gawks at them with a puzzled expression on her face, and the trio exudes discomfort. That night, Zoe strides into the dimly lit, vaulted Everton lounge. Hearing laughter, she drifts towards the hallway and scales the spiral staircase. Her mother, Lisa, emerges on the landing that encircles the space. Zoe flings her arms wide as Lisa leans on the iron railing, peering down and clucking her tongue at her daughter, who ascends the stairs morosely. Zoe peers at her mother inquisitively, and Lisa steps down to her, then enfolds her in a hug. Zoe shuts her eyes as sobs well up in them. Alex leans his cheek on his uncle's couch, appearing sly and reflective before jolting away in concern as he stands at a vending machine in the parking lot. His eyes widen upon seeing Casey asleep, a gentle gust teasing her scarf and jacket, which awakens her. Casey rises on a wooden balcony high above the city skyline, steps back to the edge, and steadies herself. Far below her, pedestrians saunter across the Brooklyn Bridge as she perches on one of the arches of the concrete structure. The Cyan Phantom approaches and floats over the crouching Casey, who observes him veer towards a tram filled with tourists and families. The Cyan Phantom fires a laser, obliterating the tram depot, and bicycles on the bridge tumble. From a distant watchtower, Night Owl witnesses the pandemonium as a giant wooden beam catapults into the sky, a rope snaps loose, and the Liberty Island tram begins to lurch. The Cyan Phantom clutches the rope, steadying the tram, as Night Owl, perched on a hefty coil of wire strung between two chimneys, propels himself into the void by jogging down a skyscraper. He hurls cables, maneuvering along the concrete supports until he plants himself on a wooden beam. Above him, the Phantom seizes Casey in one hand and the tram rope in the other, hoisting Casey as her sandals tip over. The tram sways in the gust, hanging solely by the Phantom's grasp. The Phantom lets go of both Casey and the tram abruptly. In the reflections of the oversized owl eyes on Night Owl's cowl, one reflects Casey plummeting and the other the tram packed with shrieking, terrified tourists. Night Owl dashes along the beam, vaults to snatch Casey, and then swings beneath the bridge to entangle the tram in his cord."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby cafÃ©, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
