The goldfish gazes at them with a perplexed look on its face, and the three of them seem uneasy. That evening, the goldfish paddles into the dimly lit, round Osborne kitchen. Hearing melodies, it glides towards the pantry and ascends the high ladder. Its sibling, Norman, emerges on the countertop which overlooks the room. The goldfish spreads its fins wide as Norman perches on the marble edge, peering down and nodding at its sibling, who continues up the ladder grumpily. The goldfish glances at its sibling curiously, and Norman slides down to it, then engulfs it in its fins. The goldfish closes its eyes as water accumulates in them. The blender rests its plug on its cousin's chair, appearing sheepish and contemplative before bouncing away in surprise as it dangles from a chandelier in the hospital. Its sockets widen upon seeing the toaster dormant, a gentle gust fluttering its cord and toast cover, which stirs it. The toaster bounces to its feet on a metal beam high above the city lights, hops back to the ledge, and endeavors to maintain its poise. Far beneath it, bicycles drift across the Brooklyn Bridge as it perches on one of the towers of the iron formation. The Purple Dragon approaches and drifts over the crouching toaster, which observes it drift towards a tram filled with passengers. The Purple Dragon hurls a fireball, obliterating the tram depot, and bicycles on the bridge scatter. From a nearby office, Cat-Man watches the disarray as a giant rubber ball soars through the sky, a cable snaps loose, and the Roosevelt Island tramcar starts to plummet. The Purple Dragon clutches the cable, steadying the tram, as Cat-Man, standing on a wide strand of yarn stretched between two antennas, propels himself into the air by strolling down a skyscraper. He flings yarns, navigating along the iron beams until he lands on a metal platform. Above him, the Dragon holds the toaster in one claw and the tram cable in the other, lifting the toaster as its bread slices slide off. The tramcar sways in the breeze, suspended solely by the Dragon's grip. The Dragon releases both the toaster and the tram at the same moment. In the reflections of the large cat eyes on Cat-Man's helmet, one shows the toaster plummeting and the other the tramcar full of yelling, terrified passengers. Cat-Man dashes along the beam, vaults to catch the toaster, and then swings beneath the framework to ensnare the tramcar in his yarn."

Harry gazes at them with a puzzled expression on his face, and the three of them feel uneasy. That evening, Harry saunters into the brightly lit, circular Osborne dining room. Hearing laughter, he drifts towards the kitchen and descends the narrow ladder. His father, Norman, appears near the counter that borders the room. Harry raises his arms high as Norman leans on the marble-topped island, peering down and nodding his head at his son, who continues down the ladder cheerfully. Harry looks at his father curiously, and Norman steps closer to him, then envelops him in his arms. Harry opens his eyes as a smile spreads across his face. Peter rests his head on his aunt's armchair, looking pensive and distant before jumping up in surprise as he sits at a computer in the library. His eyes narrow upon seeing MJ awake, a gentle rain dampening her hair and nightclothes, which makes her shiver. MJ climbs to her feet on a wooden dock over the calm water, steps forward to the edge, and succeeds in keeping her composure. Way above her, birds glide across the Brooklyn Bridge as she stands on one of the pillars of the concrete structure. The Green Goblin approaches and floats beneath the crouching MJ, who watches him glide towards a ferry filled with tourists and commuters. The Green Goblin throws a net, disassembling the ferry terminal, and bicycles on the bridge fall over. From a nearby warehouse, Spider-Man witnesses the disorder as a large wooden crate soars into the sky, a rope snaps loose, and the Staten Island ferry begins to drift. The Green Goblin seizes the rope, steadying the ferry, as Spider-Man, standing on a strong beam tied between two antennas, propels himself into the sky by rolling down a chimney. He flings webs, weaving along the wooden beams until he lands on a wooden plank. Above him, the Goblin holds MJ in one hand and the ferry rope in the other, elevating MJ as her sandals drop off.

Zoe gawks at them with a puzzled expression on her face, and the trio exudes discomfort. That night, Zoe strides into the dimly lit, vaulted Everton lounge. Hearing laughter, she drifts towards the hallway and scales the spiral staircase. Her mother, Lisa, emerges on the landing that encircles the space. Zoe flings her arms wide as Lisa leans on the iron railing, peering down and clucking her tongue at her daughter, who ascends the stairs morosely. Zoe peers at her mother inquisitively, and Lisa steps down to her, then enfolds her in a hug. Zoe shuts her eyes as sobs well up in them. Alex leans his cheek on his uncle's couch, appearing sly and reflective before jolting away in concern as he stands at a vending machine in the parking lot. His eyes widen upon seeing Casey asleep, a gentle gust teasing her scarf and jacket, which awakens her. Casey rises on a wooden balcony high above the city skyline, steps back to the edge, and steadies herself. Far below her, pedestrians saunter across the Brooklyn Bridge as she perches on one of the arches of the concrete structure. The Cyan Phantom approaches and floats over the crouching Casey, who observes him veer towards a tram filled with tourists and families. The Cyan Phantom fires a laser, obliterating the tram depot, and bicycles on the bridge tumble. From a distant watchtower, Night Owl witnesses the pandemonium as a giant wooden beam catapults into the sky, a rope snaps loose, and the Liberty Island tram begins to lurch. The Cyan Phantom clutches the rope, steadying the tram, as Night Owl, perched on a hefty coil of wire strung between two chimneys, propels himself into the void by jogging down a skyscraper. He hurls cables, maneuvering along the concrete supports until he plants himself on a wooden beam. Above him, the Phantom seizes Casey in one hand and the tram rope in the other, hoisting Casey as her sandals tip over. The tram sways in the gust, hanging solely by the Phantom's grasp. The Phantom lets go of both Casey and the tram abruptly. In the reflections of the oversized owl eyes on Night Owl's cowl, one reflects Casey plummeting and the other the tram packed with shrieking, terrified tourists. Night Owl dashes along the beam, vaults to snatch Casey, and then swings beneath the bridge to entangle the tram in his cord."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
