          "description": "With careful precision, Harry firmly presses one hand against Snape's neck, attempting to halt the flow of blood, while simultaneously holding a phial close to Snape's cheek with the other hand, meticulously catching each tear that falls. Once the phial has collected the tears, Harry removes it from Snape's cheek and grips it securely, feeling the weight of the collected memories, as Snape takes a moment to study Harry's face intently. Meanwhile, Harry's lips begin to tremble slightly with emotion as Snape's eyes gradually glaze over, signaling the loss of consciousness, and his head lolls weakly to one side. Observing this, Hermione briefly exchanges a glance with Ron, then directs her gaze downward, focusing on the floor with a somber expression. At this moment, Harry continues to stare at Snape's lifeless form, his attention momentarily diverted as the surface of the nearby water starts to ripple gently, indicating a disturbance, and the building surrounding them trembles subtly. To steady himself amidst the trembling, Harry places a steadying hand against the glass wall while Ron braces himself against the door for support, and Hermione clasps her hands tightly over her ears to muffle the surrounding noise. In the chaos, Fred Weasley is injured, and Hermione and Ron, visibly distressed, stand a short distance behind Harry, grappling with the unfolding tragedy. The scene remains blanketed in darkness, with pockets of fire casting intermittent glows throughout the school and the surrounding grounds, as the three friends start their journey back up the path leading to the courtyard. As they approach the entrance, Ron pushes open the heavy doors of the Great Hall, and the trio is immediately confronted by a staggering sight of piles of rubble strewn across the space. As they venture further inside, they observe a somber gathering of students and staff; amidst them, two students can be seen carrying an injured comrade out on a stretcher. Suddenly, Ron notices something that catches his attention, prompting him to hurry forward with determination, with Hermione closely following in his footsteps, while Harry remains momentarily frozen in the doorway, surveying the scene. Nearby, Slughorn is diligently tending to the wounded Filch, but he turns toward the newcomers upon noticing their presence. As Harry walks through the scene, he passes by a long line of people receiving treatment, taking note of Professor Trelawney and Padma Patil in the midst of their solemn task of pulling a blanket over a deceased individual. His attention then shifts to the Weasley family situated up ahead; he witnesses George weeping openly, clinging to his father in a moment of shared grief, and desperately embracing Ron for comfort. Meanwhile, Fleur stands by offering solace to Bill, and Molly, overwhelmed with sorrow, kneels beside the lifeless body of Fred, gently stroking his hair. Ron joins his mother at Fred's side, overcome with helpless sobs, while Hermione stands a short distance away, quietly observing the family's grief. As Harry watches this poignant scene, he glances to his left and is met with the heart-wrenching sight of the bodies of Nymphadora and Remus lying side by side on stretchers, Remus' little finger resting tenderly on hers, signifying their eternal bond. At that moment, Professor McGonagall approaches limping toward Harry, but he, preoccupied with his thoughts, does not notice her presence and instead turns decisively, striding out of the Great Hall with a purposeful gait. He soon arrives at Dumbledore's old, undamaged office, and as he steps further inside, covered doors to his right slowly open of their own accord, revealing a stone pedestal that slides out smoothly. Without hesitation, Harry crosses the room to the pedestal, carefully lifts out a shallow silver basin, and with a gentle flick, sends it spinning gracefully through the air. He follows the spinning Pensieve as it moves towards the desk situated at the far side of the room, where it eventually lands lightly and comes to rest. Holding the phial that contains Snape's valuable tears, Harry methodically removes the stopper and pours the entire contents into the basin, watching intently as misty black swirls begin to form within the Pensieve. As the swirling black transforms, Harry leans forward and submerges his face into the bowl, becoming immersed in the memories, which gradually clear to reveal a serene meadow where two young girls, Lily and her sister Petunia, stand facing each other. Within this vivid memory, Lily opens her palm to reveal a small daisy magically growing in it, and from the distance, an equally young Severus Snape emerges cautiously from a large tree trunk, observing the scene, while Petunia, startled, runs off, leaving Lily and Severus behind in the idyllic landscape."

          "description": "With one paw, Max blocks the trickle of honey from Oliver's paw and presses the jug to Oliver's paw, gathering droplets in it. Max pulls the jug from Oliver's paw, clutches it, as Oliver studies Max's face. Max's toes twitch, Oliver's nose fogs over, and his head droops to one side. Grace briefly peers at Leo, then peers down at the carpet. Max gazes at the silent Oliver as the top of the pond starts to ripple and the tower shudders. Max braces against the brick pillar, while Leo clutches the window and Grace covers her eyes with her hands. George Thompson is limping as Grace and Leo, flustered, stand a little way behind Max. It's still dawn, and patches of smoke hover throughout the village and fields as the three companions make their way back up the path to the square. Leo swings open the gates of the Sanctuary, and the three are faced by mounds of stones. Further inside, they notice villagers and elders; two villagers pull someone off on a cart. Leo notices something and scurries forward with Grace trailing, while Max remains fixed in the entrance. Nelson is caring for the exhausted Kyle and swivels. Max moves along a lengthy queue of people receiving attention, observing Miss Stitch and Violet Groom drag a cloth over a silent figure. He observes the Thompsons ahead, with Frank sobbing, gripping his uncle, and desperately embracing Leo. Sophie consoles Jim, and Martha, forlorn, kneels beside George’s figure, brushing his fur. Leo approaches her, crying hopelessly while Grace stands at a distance. Max observes the mourning group and glances to his left, noticing the forms of Luna and Hector lying side by side on carts, Hector's thumb resting on hers. Doctor Brighton shuffles towards Max, who, without noticing her, swivels and paces out of the Sanctuary. He steps into Merlin's former, untouched lounge; as he moves further inside, wooden panels to his right shift of their own will and a marble column glides out. Max approaches the column, draws out a shallow gold dish, and tenderly rotates it through the room. It drifts towards the table at the far edge of the chamber, and he trails the rotating Panorama to the table where it settles gently. Holding the jug containing Oliver's droplets, Max removes the lid and empties the substance into the dish, causing misty white spirals to form in the Panorama. Max dips his brow into the dish, and the twisting white fades to display a field with two small kittens, Emily and her sister Daisy, facing each other. Emily opens her claw to show a tulip growing in it, and an equally young Oliver Creeper appears from a towering bush as Daisy scampers away."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
