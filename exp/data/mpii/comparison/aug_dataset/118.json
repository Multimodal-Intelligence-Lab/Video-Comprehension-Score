After the customer passes, Phyllis draws close again and takes Neff's arm, forgetting where she is, but he pulls away.

Neff stops, looks towards the cigar counter, and moves toward Keyes, who is buying cigars and stuffing them into his pockets.

Outside, the distinct sound of the LaSalle's brakes screeches to a halt in front of the market. Phyllis emerges gracefully from the vehicle with a purposeful air, stepping into the market and scanning her surroundings with a discerning gaze. Meanwhile, Neff navigates the aisles with deliberate slowness, striving to maintain an air of outward calm despite the nervous energy simmering beneath the surface. As Phyllis approaches from a distance, her figure gradually comes into focus until she halts a couple of feet away from him. She edges closer to Neff, throwing him a sharp, sidelong glance heavy with unspoken intent. Their moment is interrupted by the presence of another customer entering the aisle, prompting them to subtly drift apart to maintain the guise of casual shoppers. Once the customer departs, Phyllis instinctively drifts closer again and, in a moment of forgetfulness, clasps Neff's arm, only for him to pull away cautiously. She then removes her dark glasses for the first time, revealing eyes that are cold and piercing, while Neff's face reflects his internal monologue as he watches her leave. Later, under a starlit sky with the evocative strains of Cesar Franck's D Minor Symphony emanating from the Bowl, Neff and Lola climb over a low hill in the foreground. As Neff assists Lola in navigating the incline, the camera pans to capture the expansive view of the Bowl below, vibrant with a packed audience and an orchestra under the illuminated shell. They settle on the grass, with Neff positioning himself close enough to converse yet maintaining a respectful distance, their silhouettes outlined against the shell's lights. Neff deftly places a cigarette between his lips and strikes a match, casting a brief glance at Lola just as she begins to cry softly. After a brief pause, she succumbs to her tears once more, while Neff's expression reveals his internal reflection, influenced by the music's poignant commentary. As the clock nears or slightly surpasses 5:00 P.M., a steady flow of office workers emerges from the elevator and into the lobby, Neff among them, distinct in his hat and briefcase. The camera smoothly leads him toward the entrance doors until he is halted by Keyes' voice emanating from a nearby location. He stops, swivels his head towards the cigar counter, and strides over to Keyes, who is occupied with purchasing cigars and stuffing them into his various pockets. With practiced ease, Keyes bites the end off a cigar, positions it in his mouth, and pats his pockets in search of a match. Neff, anticipating this familiar ritual, strikes a match for him, offering it to Keyes, who then heads towards the street, exiting the scene. Neff retraces his steps into the lobby, the camera trailing his movement, and upon reaching the elevator, he glances back to confirm Keyes' departure before stepping inside. He halts the machine, sinks into a seat, the horn still clutched in his hand, and with a profound sense of emotion, he stares blankly at the wall, lost in thought."

The LaSalle, a luxury automobile produced by General Motors from 1927 to 1940, stops in front of the market, and Phyllis steps out, entering the market known for its abundant fresh produce, and looking around. Neff moves slowly along the shelves, outwardly calm but with his nerves on edge, much like a character in a film noir, as Phyllis approaches from beyond him, stopping beside him a couple of feet away. Phyllis, who is often seen in such dramatic settings, moves close to him and looks at him sharply, sideways, but as a customer comes along the aisle toward them, they move apart to maintain their anonymity. After the customer passes, Phyllis draws close again and takes Neff's arm, forgetting where she is in a moment of vulnerability, but he pulls away. Phyllis takes off her dark glasses for the first time, a common gesture indicating a reveal of true intentions, and looks at him with cold, hard eyes, as over Neff's face, as he looks after her, comes the inner commentary typical of a troubled protagonist. Neff and Lola then climb over a low hill in the foreground under a starlit sky, with music from the Hollywood Bowl, an iconic Los Angeles concert venue, playing Cesar Franck's D Minor Symphony, a piece often associated with passionate intensity. As he helps her climb up, the camera pans with them to show the expanse of the Bowl below, filled with a packed audience and the orchestra on the lighted shell, creating a romantic yet tense atmosphere. They sit down on the grass, with Neff sitting near but not too close to her, silhouetted against the shell lights reminiscent of classic romance scenes. Neff puts a cigarette in his mouth and strikes a match, glancing at her as she begins to cry, a moment underscored by the poignancy of the setting. A pause follows before she starts crying again, while over Neff's face, as he listens to the music, comes the somber commentary. Around 5:00 P.M. or a little later, a stream of office employees comes out of an elevator into the grand lobby typical of corporate America, among them Neff, wearing his brimmed hat and carrying his leather briefcase. As the camera precedes him walking toward the entrance doors, he is stopped by Keyes' voice off to one side, a familiar interruption in their routine. Neff stops, looks towards the cigar counter, a common sight in office building lobbies of the time, and moves toward Keyes, who is buying cigars, a habit illustrating his meticulous nature, and stuffing them into his pockets. Keyes bites off the end of the cigar, puts it into his mouth, and starts tapping his pockets for a match, as usual, a ritualistic action. Neff strikes a match for him, a subtle gesture of camaraderie, before Keyes goes toward the street and out of the scene. Neff moves back into the lobby, followed by the camera, and as he reaches the elevator, he looks back over his shoulder to ensure Keyes is gone, then steps into the empty elevator, stops the machine, and sits down slowly, still holding the horn, a symbolic object adding to the gravity of the moment. Deeply moved by the day's events, Neff sits, staring blankly at the wall, lost in intense contemplation."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
