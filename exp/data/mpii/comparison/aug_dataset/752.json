The nearer of the two is walked to by the man, not badly damaged at the back. As up at the length of it, it is looked by him, however, it is seen that the sides have been smashed open. The little remaining glass is cracked and shattered, and seats drunkenly lean, having been torn from their mountings, their upholstery charred and blackened. Light catches the man's face as the wrecked carriage is stared up at by him. Quite still he stands, looking up, grim-faced, for a long time, ignoring drops of water that fall from his hood. In the dark, on a force, a man crouches. He is risen onto his knees. As up comes his head, the face of David, aged about 20, is illuminated by light. He looks around, and from a burning car, upside down behind him, the light comes. Towards it he staggers, stumbling on his knees, crawling. In the burning car, a young woman is lying unconscious. Very still lies Audrey. The edge of the car door is grasped by David with both hands and pulled. The door catch, which doesn't move, is checked by him as he bends down. Audrey's arm hangs out of the window. The edge of the door is seized by David again and it is heaved. Beyond him, flames are seen rising up into the night sky. From its hinges, he rips the door, bends down, and releases Audrey's seat belt. From the car, Audrey is dragged by David, cradled in his arms, and gently laid down some yards away. His shoulder is looked over by him and slowly the lights of a pickup truck are seen coming around the bend. Frantically, he waves. When back he looks, Audrey's eyes are open. Her head is held tenderly by him. To them, the truck driver runs. Into the man's concerned face, David looks, and back at Audrey. Very slowly, his head is lifted by him, the flames still flickering behind him. A thoughtful expression is on his face and the man's eyes are not met by him. Along a darkened corridor, Elijah rolls his wheelchair, his right leg still protruding straight out with its two long rows of shiny bolts protruding from the metal frame around it.

To his left, just beyond a set of narrow stairs, two massive, looming shapes gradually come into focus, revealing themselves to be the ends of two train carriages, each slightly bent and twisted in a haunting manner. The man strides purposefully toward the nearer of the two carriages, which appears to be less severely damaged at the rear.

However, as he gazes up along its length, he notices with concern that the sides have been violently smashed open.

He looks around as silver-grey light from the rows of small windows, reminiscent of industrial factory designs from the early 20th century, glows on strange objects. To his left, beyond a set of stairs covered in years of accumulated dust, two looming shapes appear and become recognizable as the ends of two train carriages, slightly bent and twisted from a past collision. The man walks to the nearer of the two, which, despite its apparent wear, is not badly damaged at the back. As he looks up at the length of it, however, he sees that the sides have been smashed open, likely from looters scavenging for scrap. The little remaining glass is cracked and shattered, reminiscent of the shrapnel spread during its last journey, and seats lean drunkenly, having been torn from their mountings, their upholstery charred and blackened from what seems to have been a fire. Light catches the man's face as he stares up at the wrecked carriage. He stands quite still, looking up, grim-faced, for a long time, ignoring drops of water falling from his hood during the constant rain that plagues the area. In the dark, a man is crouching on a force, a police term for an unseen surveillance operation. He rises onto his knees, revealing years of physical training in his poised movements. As his head comes up, light falls on the face of David, aged about 20, his youthful features set with determination and resolve. He looks around, and the light is coming from a burning car, an old model Ford, upside down behind him, its engine still hissing. He staggers towards it, stumbling on his knees, crawling. A young woman lies in the burning car, unconscious. Audrey, a medical student known for her resilience, is lying very still. David grasps the edge of the car door with both hands and pulls. He bends down and checks the door catch, which doesn't move, likely jammed from the impact. Audrey's arm is hanging out of the window, her medical bracelet glinting in the firelight. David grabs the edge of the door again and heaves. Beyond him, flames rise up into the night sky, dancing shadows on the nearby trees. He rips the door from its hinges, bends down, and releases Audrey's seat belt, carefully avoiding the still-hot metal. David drags Audrey from the car, cradles her in his arms, and lays her down gently some yards away, away from the choking smoke. He looks over his shoulder and sees the lights of a pickup truck coming slowly around the bend, its headlights cutting through the smoke. He waves frantically. When he looks back, Audrey's eyes are open, her relief evident. He holds her head, tenderly, whispering reassurances. The truck driver runs to them, a volunteer firefighter by the look of his gear. David looks into the man's concerned face, and back at Audrey. Very slowly, he lifts his head, the flames still flickering behind him, a chaotic halo. He has a thoughtful expression on his face and doesn't meet the man's eyes, pondering the miraculous escape. Elijah, known for his vast knowledge of the obscure and the forgotten, rolls his wheelchair along a darkened corridor, his right leg still sticking straight out with its two long rows of shiny bolts protruding from the metal frame around it, a testament to his recent accident.

David is standing at the top of the stairs above the concourse of Philadelphia Train Station, a historic hub known as the third busiest rail terminal in the United States.

          "description": "A wide gate creaks ajar, and a masked creature lounges in the doorway of a library. She peers around as golden-blue shadows from the line of large lanterns flicker on peculiar shapes. To her right, beside a row of ladders, two towering figures emerge and transform into the tops of two giant books, slightly creased and folded. The girl skips to the farther of the two, not heavily scratched at the top. As she gazes down the breadth of it, however, she notices that the covers have been ripped apart. The remaining paper is torn and shredded, and pages lean haphazardly, having been ripped from their bindings, their margins scorched and yellowed. Shadows fall on the girl's eyes as she gazes down at the broken tome. She stays quite motionless, gazing down, solemnly, for a while, dismissing threads of dust swirling from her cape. In the dimness, a woman is huddling on a platform. She flips onto her side. As her hands rise, shadows fall on the face of Emily, aged about 42. She glances upward, and the shadows are coming from a flickering torch, dangling above her. She creeps toward it, sliding on her side, crouching. An old man stands by the flickering torch, dazed. Jerry is standing quite still. Emily clutches the bottom of the lamp with trembling fingers and shakes. She reaches up and adjusts the lamp chain, which doesn't budge. Jerry's cloak is billowing out of the nook. Emily clutches the bottom of the lamp again and yanks. Overhead, shadows bounce up into the dusk. She tears the chain from its socket, reaches up, and douses Jerry's robe. Emily hauls Jerry from the torch, embraces him in her limbs, and props him down gently several paces away. She peers over her elbow and notices the shadows of a bicycle gliding quickly around the bend. She signals desperately. As she peers back, Jerry's eyes are closed. She lifts his arm, gently. The cyclist rushes toward them. Emily peers into the woman's worried gaze and back at Jerry. Gradually, she bows her gaze, the shadows still dancing around her. She has a puzzled demeanor on her gaze and ignores the woman's concern. Sarah maneuvers her scooter along a brightly lit walkway, her left arm still jutting straight out with its two short rows of golden pins extending from the wooden band around it. She hangs up the lantern. Sarah peers straight ahead, toward the line of banners, showcasing a tiny array of trinkets. Emily is situated at the bottom of the ladders below the balconies of Paris Opera House. Beside her, short modern brick columns."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby cafÃ©, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Water drips from his hood as he grimly assesses the wreck. Nearby, David, about 20, rises near a burning, overturned car. Seeing Audrey unconscious inside, he struggles with the car door, finally tearing it off. He frees and cradles Audrey away from the flames. Spotting a truck, he waves frantically, relief washing over as Audrey regains consciousness. Meanwhile, Elijah, in a wheelchair with a metal-framed leg, picks up a phone in a corridor lined with comics. David stands beneath stone pillars at Philadelphia Train Station."
