Gandhi and the parade of demonstrators and ashram residents march down the arid path toward them, escorted by a newsreel vehicle and crew riding along approximately two-thirds of the way back, trailed by an automobile of photographers and journalists at the rear. Gandhi gazes at Walker, strolling a few strides behind him at the flank of the procession, wiping perspiration from his visage. Gandhi beams, turns back, shakes his head, and grins as he passes by the constables and into the acclaim of the crowd. As the parade trails into the hamlet, several villagers with backpacks or bundles slung over their shoulders dash around the police and join the rear of the procession. Gandhi stands in the core of the wildly cheering crowd as the camera pulls back and back, and the shot transforms into monochrome while we hear the music of Movietone News. With that, we see the Movietone Music tag, and as the film fades, the lights rise on a pair of civil servants moving about to raise the window shades while Lord Irwin gazes at the blank screen set up in his office, surrounded by the general, the brigadier, the senior police officer, Irwin's aide-de-camp, and the principal secretary. The two men who operated the projector silently disassemble it. Finally, Irwin turns to the senior police officer, who fidgets but responds to the implied inquiries, as Irwin sighs and nods. For the first time, Irwin is truly irate, and his face falls. Meanwhile, men, women, and children are making small paper packets of salt from heaps piled along lengthy tables. A squad of policemen barges into the room, toppling tables, salt, and paper in every direction with their lathis, and seize some of the volunteers for arrest. In the turmoil, an elderly man calmly picks up a piece of paper from the floor, a handful of salt, and folds another packet. Nehru is on the rear of a large open truck that is stationary in the street, loaded with boxes containing salt packets, and he and eight or nine others are vending them to the people who gather about the truck. The sound of hooves is heard, and Nehru raises his head as mounted Indian police come down each side of the street, a wave of foot police sprinting forward down the center. Some of the people flee, while others intentionally stand firm as the mounted police converge on the truck. Nehru is seized and thrown so that he half falls, half leaps to the street, and one of the men with him is knocked along the ground by a constable."

Gandhi and the orderly procession of marchers and ashramites stride purposefully down the dusty road towards them, all the while being accompanied by a newsreel truck and its dedicated crew, who are strategically positioned about two-thirds of the way back, followed closely by a car packed with attentive cameramen and reporters bringing up the rear. Gandhi turns his attention towards Walker, who is walking a few paces behind him, slightly to the side of the procession, and takes a moment to wipe the sweat from his face.

This newfound energy fills the air as the gathered crowd quickly jumps up, eager to catch a glimpse of the unfolding events before them. At the same time, beautiful flower petals gently start to float and drift through the bright sky. Amidst this lively scene, Gandhi and the orderly procession of marchers and ashramites stride purposefully down the dusty road heading towards them. They are accompanied by a dedicated newsreel truck and its crew, strategically positioned about two-thirds of the way back in the procession. Following closely behind is a car packed with attentive cameramen and reporters, bringing up the rear of the formation. Gandhi momentarily diverts his attention towards Walker, who is walking a few paces behind him, slightly to the side of the bustling procession. During this brief pause, Gandhi takes a moment to wipe the sweat from his face with a calm demeanor. He then smiles softly, turns back around, shakes his head gently, and grins as he gracefully passes by the policemen, fully immersing himself in the welcoming cheers of the enthusiastic crowd. As the procession continues to trail gradually into the village, several curious villagers with knapsacks or bundles slung over their shoulders eagerly find ways to run around the police, hoping to join the tail end of the procession.

In the sky above, an enchanting shower of flower petals begins its descent, dancing gracefully on the breeze. Down the dusty road, Gandhi leads a dignified procession of marchers and ashramites, their steps measured and purposeful. A newsreel truck hums along, nearly two-thirds of the way back in the line, its crew diligently capturing the moment, followed closely by a car teeming with eager cameramen and reporters, diligently documenting the historic march. As they proceed, Gandhi turns slightly, catching a glimpse of Walker, a few paces behind, perspiration glistening on his brow, and in a rare moment of levity, Gandhi offers Walker a reassuring smile, turns his head back to the front, shakes his head slightly, and allows a wide grin to spread across his face as they pass the watchful eyes of policemen, their presence dwarfed by the jubilant cheers of the welcoming crowd. The procession continues on its course, trailing into a village where the atmosphere is electric with excitement. A number of villagers, burdened with knapsacks or bundles slung over their shoulders, dart around the police cordon and seamlessly blend into the back of the procession, eager to join the cause. Gandhi, a beacon amidst the wildly cheering mass, stands firm as the camera slowly pulls away, the vibrant scene transitioning to a black-and-white frame, while the melodious strains of Movietone News underscore the moment. In a sudden shift, the Movietone Music tag appears, the scene dissolving as lights gradually illuminate a room where a couple of civil servants methodically move about, raising the window shades to let in the light. Lord Irwin, seated in his office, is surrounded by a cadre of authority figures—the general, the brigadier, the senior police officer, his aide-de-camp, and the principal secretary—all fixated on the now-blank screen. Meanwhile, the two men who managed the projector silently begin to dismantle the equipment. Irwin, visibly nettled, turns his attention to the senior police officer, who shifts uncomfortably and responds to Irwin's unspoken questions. Irwin exhales deeply, acknowledges the answers with a nod, yet for the first time, his demeanor fractures, revealing a flash of genuine anger as his composure falters. Concurrently, in another locale, men, women, and children diligently fashion small paper packets of salt, heaping piles laid out on long tables serving as their resource. Their labor is interrupted when a phalanx of policemen bursts into the room, their lathis swinging with abandon, upending tables, and scattering salt and paper in chaotic disarray as they seize several volunteers for arrest. Amidst the turmoil, an elderly man maintains a serene calm, stooping to retrieve a piece of scattered paper, scooping up a handful of salt, and folding yet another packet with care. Not far away, Nehru perches on the back of a large open truck, parked statically on a bustling street. This vehicle is laden with boxes brimming with salt packets, and amid this scene, Nehru, accompanied by eight or nine others, energetically sells these packets to the thronging masses that gather around the truck with eager energy. The clip-clop of horses' hooves suddenly punctuates the air, prompting Nehru to lift his gaze as mounted Indian police materialize on either side of the street, a coordinated wave of foot police surging forward down the center. Some among the crowd scatter in haste, while others stand their ground defiantly as the mounted police converge inexorably upon the truck. Amidst the ensuing commotion, Nehru is grabbed forcefully, his body jolting as he half falls, half leaps onto the street below, while one of his comrades finds himself knocked to the ground by a relentless policeman."

          "description": "A little band of drummers and flute players, reminiscent of traditional Indian music ensembles known for their rhythmic and melodic harmonies, suddenly begins to play as the crowd starts to jump up to see, and the flower petals begin to float in the sky, a traditional gesture of welcome and celebration. Gandhi and the procession of marchers and ashramites, individuals who live in spiritual communities called ashrams, stride down the dusty road toward them, accompanied by a newsreel truck and crew, which was a common method for creating news documentaries in the early 20th century, riding along about two-thirds of the way back, followed by a car of cameramen and reporters at the end. Gandhi, known globally for his philosophy of nonviolent resistance, looks at Walker, who is walking a few paces behind him at the side of the procession, wiping sweat from his face. Gandhi smiles, turns back, shakes his head, and grins as he passes by the policemen, who are stationed to maintain order but often serve oppressive colonial interests, and into the cheers of the crowd. As the procession trails into the village, several villagers with knapsacks or bundles strung over their shoulders, indicative of their participation in the Salt March, a key event in India's independence movement, run around the police and join the end of the procession. Gandhi stands in the center of the wildly cheering crowd as the camera pulls back and back, and the shot becomes black and white while we hear the music of Movietone News, a prominent newsreel series of the era that brought international events to theater audiences. With that, we see the Movietone Music tag, and as the film fades, the lights go up on a couple of civil servants moving about to raise the window shades while Lord Irwin, the British Viceroy of India during this tumultuous period, stares at the blank screen set up in his office, surrounded by the general, the brigadier, the senior police officer, Irwin's ADC, and the principal secretary. The two men who ran the projector, part of the staff responsible for briefing the Viceroy, quietly dismantle it. Finally, Irwin turns to the senior police officer, who fidgets but answers the implied questions, as Irwin sighs and nods. For the first time, Irwin is truly angry, and his face falls, reflecting the growing frustration of the British administration with the Indian independence movement. Meanwhile, men, women, and children are making little paper packets of salt from piles heaped along long tables, symbolizing defiance against the British salt tax. A group of policemen barge into the room, their lathis, or long wooden sticks used by colonial police forces, knocking tables, salt, and paper in every direction, and seize some of the volunteers for arrest. In the chaos, an old man, embodying the spirit of peaceful protest, calmly picks up a piece of paper from the floor, a handful of salt, and folds another packet. Nehru, a prominent leader in the Indian National Congress and future Prime Minister of India, is on the back of a big open truck that is stationary in the street, loaded with boxes containing salt packets, and he and eight or nine others are selling them to the people who flock about the truck. The sound of horses is heard, and Nehru lifts his head as mounted Indian police, often employed to suppress mass gatherings, come down either side of the street, a wave of foot police running forward down the center. Some of the people run, while others deliberately stand fast as the mounted police converge on the truck, a testament to their resolve in the face of oppression. Nehru is grabbed and hurled so that he half falls, half leaps to the street, and one of the men with him is knocked along the ground by a policeman, illustrating the violent responses often faced by peaceful protestors."

          "description": "A tiny troupe of jugglers and harmonica enthusiasts suddenly decides to dance as the mob begins to sit down to listen, and the confetti begins to drift through the ocean. Einstein and the gathering of cyclers and hikers gallop up the grassy slope towards them, shadowed by an ice cream cart and vendors sliding nearby three-quarters of the way forward, trailed by a wagon of bakers and chefs at the start. Einstein gazes at Johnson, skipping several steps ahead of him at the edge of the gathering, waving a fan at his feet. Einstein chuckles, turns around, nods his head, and giggles as he glides past the firemen and into the roars of the mob. As the gathering slips into the forest, numerous travelers with luggage or baskets hung around their waists dance beside the firefighters and attach themselves to the start of the gathering. Einstein twirls in the middle of the wildly laughing mob as the telescope zooms forward and forward, and the image turns purple and blue while we hear the sounds of Quicksand Tunes. With that, we notice the Quicksand Tunes label, and as the picture vanishes, the candles dim on a pair of chefs scurrying around to lower the curtain shades while Duke Wellington glares at the empty canvas set up in his garden, encircled by the gardener, the architect, the junior firefighter, Wellington's butler, and the school principal. The two women who fixed the slide quietly assemble it. Eventually, Wellington turns to the junior firefighter, who doodles but responds to the suggested riddles, as Wellington groans and shakes his head. For the first occasion, Wellington is genuinely ecstatic, and his expression brightens. Meanwhile, pirates, ghosts, and elves are crafting tiny wooden spoons of sugar from mounds stacked across short counters. A squad of gardeners burst into the stadium, toppling counters, sugar, and wood in every direction with their hoses, and nab some of the players for dancing. In the frenzy, a young woman peacefully picks up a ribbon from the ceiling, a basket of sugar, and ties another spoon. Tesla is on the roof of a small closed carriage that is zooming in the park, loaded with jars containing sugar spoons, and she and two or three others are distributing them to the animals that parade around the carriage. The noise of planes is detected, and Tesla lowers her gaze as flying Russian firefighters glide over either side of the park, a surge of paw firefighters crawling backwards along the edges. Some of the animals crawl, while others accidentally stroll away as the flying firefighters hover over the carriage. Tesla is snatched and lifted so that she half climbs, half jumps into the park, and one of the women with her is carried across the air by a firefighter."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
