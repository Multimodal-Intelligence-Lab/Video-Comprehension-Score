Michal comes up behind Szpilman, makes for the door, nods, and goes. The sound of the padlock closing. Szpilman takes in the room, sees the piano, is still for a moment, then goes to it. He sits on the piano stool, adjusts its height, opens the lid, removes a cloth covering the keys, gazes lovingly at the keyboard, and flexes his fingers. Then, without touching the keys, his fingers floating just above them, he plays passionately. Snow falling. Szpilman alert, hearing the padlock being unlocked and then opened. The door opens and Michal enters, accompanied by a man, aged about thirty, Szalas, confident, a little brash. In whispers, Szalas and Szpilman shake hands. Szalas produces a quarter bottle of vodka, thumps the back of the bottle so that the cork flies out. He finds glasses and pours, gives the others their vodka. Szalas shrugs, finds the vodka, pours two glasses, unwraps the package to reveal sausage and bread, takes a bite of sausage, chewing deliberately, slowly. Szalas goes to the window, looks out. Szpilman thinks for a moment, then takes off his wristwatch, hands it to Szalas. Szalas pockets the watch, makes for the door, stops, grins, downs Szpilman's vodka, gives a mock salute and goes.

Dorota, no longer pregnant, and Michal enter, come to the bed. In whispers, Szpilman barely has strength to open his eyes and focus on them. He mutters incoherently. She starts for the door, and he leaves. The padlock sound. Dorota goes to the kitchen, wets a towel, comes back to the bed, kneels it, places the towel on Szpilman's brow. He focuses on her, smiles, then suddenly winces with pain. She looks at him, barely audible. The Doctor and Michal leave his line of vision. Szpilman looking down from the fourth-floor window. Peaceful. A few pedestrians. An everyday atmosphere. At the far end, at the T-junction with a main road, a tram rumbles down the street and comes to a halt, disgorging passengers on the far side and so out of sight.

There are vistas of the metropolis, but in the avenue beneath, opposite, is a clinic and, on the corner, an edifice displaying a Nazi banner and overseen by a guard, positioned at his sentry-box. Michal approaches behind Szpilman, heads for the door, nods, and departs. The noise of the padlock fastening. Szpilman surveys the chamber, observes the piano, remains motionless for a moment, then advances to it. He perches on the piano stool, modifies its height, lifts the lid, takes off a fabric concealing the keys, stares fondly at the keyboard, and stretches his fingers. Then, without contacting the keys, his fingers hovering just above them, he plays fervently. Snow descending. Szpilman attentive, hearing the padlock being unfastened and then opened. The door opens and Michal enters, accompanied by a gentleman, aged about thirty, Szalas, self-assured, somewhat bold. In murmurs, Szalas and Szpilman clasp hands. Szalas reveals a quarter bottle of vodka, knocks the back of the bottle so that the cork ejects. He locates glasses and pours, hands the others their vodka. Szalas shrugs, locates the vodka, pours two glasses, unwraps the parcel to disclose sausage and bread, takes a nibble of sausage, chewing intently, slowly. Szalas proceeds to the window, peers out. Szpilman contemplates for a moment, then removes his wristwatch, hands it to Szalas. Szalas pockets the watch, heads for the door, halts, grins, consumes Szpilman's vodka, gives a mock salute and departs. The padlock is secured on the other side. Sunshine inundates through the windows. Szpilman lies motionless on the bed, feeble, famished, ill. The sound of the padlock. Dorota, no longer expecting, and Michal come in, approach the bed. In murmurs, Szpilman scarcely has power to open his eyes and concentrate on them. He mutters incoherently. She moves for the door, and he departs. The padlock noise. Dorota goes to the kitchen, moistens a towel, returns to the bed, kneels it, places the towel on Szpilman's forehead. He concentrates on her, smiles, then abruptly grimaces with agony. She gazes at him, barely audible. The Doctor and Michal exit his line of sight. Szpilman gazing down from the fourth-floor window. Serene. A few walkers. An ordinary ambiance. At the distant extremity, at the T-intersection with a main road, a tram clatters down the avenue and comes to a stop, discharging commuters on the distant side and so out of view. The tram continues on its route, now unveiling the few commuters who descended—women, an elderly man with a cane."

Views of the city are present, but a hospital is in the street below, opposite, and a building flying a Nazi flag is on the corner, guarded by a sentry who stands at his sentry-box. Szpilman is approached from behind by Michal, who then makes for the door, nods, and leaves. The padlock is heard being closed. The room is taken in by Szpilman, the piano is seen by him, and he is still for a moment, then it is approached by him. He sits on the piano stool, its height is adjusted by him, the lid is opened, a cloth covering the keys is removed, and the keyboard is gazed at lovingly by him as he flexes his fingers. Then, his fingers floating just above them, the keys are touched by him passionately, though not physically played. Snow is falling. The padlock being unlocked and opened is heard by Szpilman, who is alert. The door opens and Michal enters, bringing with him a man, aged about thirty, Szalas, confident, a little brash. In whispers, hands are shaken by Szalas and Szpilman. A quarter bottle of vodka is produced by Szalas, the back of the bottle is thumped by him, causing the cork to fly out. Glasses are found, and vodka is poured by him, given to the others. The vodka is found by Szalas, two glasses are poured by him, a package is unwrapped to reveal sausage and bread, a bite of sausage is taken by him, and it is chewed deliberately, slowly. The window is approached by Szalas, and he looks out. After thinking for a moment, Szpilman takes off his wristwatch and hands it to Szalas. The watch is pocketed by Szalas, who makes for the door, stops, grins, consumes Szpilman's vodka, gives a mock salute, and leaves. The padlock is locked from the other side. Sunshine floods in through the windows. The bed is laid upon, inert, by Szpilman, who is weak, starving, and ill. The padlock is heard. Dorota, no longer pregnant, and Michal enter, approach the bed. In whispers, Szpilman barely musters the strength to open his eyes and focus on them. Incoherent mutters are made by him. The door is started for by her, and he leaves. The sound of the padlock. The kitchen is approached by Dorota, who wets a towel, then returns to the bed, kneels on it, and places the towel on Szpilman's brow. Her focus is on him, and he smiles, then suddenly winces with pain. She looks at him, her voice barely audible. The Doctor and Michal leave his line of vision. The fourth-floor window is looked down from by Szpilman. Peaceful. A few pedestrians. An everyday atmosphere. At the far end, at the T-junction with a main road, a tram rumbles down the street and halts, disgorging passengers on the far side and then out of sight. The tram moves on, now revealing the few passengers who alighted—women, an old man with a stick."

The window offers expansive views of the city, but in the street below, immediately opposite the building, stands a hospital. Nearby, on the street corner, a building is noticeable for its prominently displayed Nazi flag, guarded vigilantly by a sentry, who stands at attention next to his designated sentry-box.\n\nMichal approaches Szpilman from behind, quietly signaling his intention to leave as he makes his way towards the door. He gives a nod of acknowledgment, then exits. The distinct sound of a padlock being closed fills the room. Szpilman takes a moment to absorb his surroundings within the room, his eyes catching sight of the piano. He pauses momentarily, contemplative, before approaching the instrument. Settling onto the piano stool, he adjusts its height to his liking, opens the lid with care, and removes the protective cloth that covers the keys. His gaze lingers lovingly on the keyboard as he flexes his fingers in preparation. Then, with his fingers hovering just above the keys, he begins to play passionately, though without producing any sound.\n\nMeanwhile, snow gently falls outside. Szpilman becomes alert at the familiar sound of the padlock being unlocked and opened. The door swings open, and Michal re-enters, now accompanied by Szalas, a man of about thirty, who exudes confidence and carries himself with a slightly brash demeanor. In whispered tones, Szalas and Szpilman exchange greetings with a handshake. Szalas produces a quarter bottle of vodka, skillfully thumping the back of the bottle until the cork pops out energetically. He finds glasses, pours the vodka generously, and offers it to the others. With a casual shrug, Szalas uncovers more provisions, pouring two glasses of vodka, unwrapping a package to reveal sausage and bread. He takes a deliberate bite of the sausage, chewing in a slow, thoughtful manner. Szalas then moves towards the window and glances out thoughtfully. Szpilman, after a brief moment of contemplation, removes his wristwatch and hands it over to Szalas. Szalas pockets the watch, heads towards the door but pauses, grins mischievously, downs Szpilman's vodka in one go, gives a mock salute, and departs.

She gazes at him with concern, her words barely audible. The Doctor and Michal quietly leave his line of sight.\n\nFrom a window on the fourth floor, Szpilman gazes downwards, observing a landscape of peace. A few pedestrians meander below, contributing to an everyday atmosphere.

This particular window offers expansive, panoramic views of the cityscape, but in the street below, directly across from the building, stands a hospital.

There are views of the city, which has been ravaged by conflict, but in the street below, opposite, is a hospital treated as a rare sanctuary among devastation, and, on the corner, a building flying a Nazi flag and guarded by a sentry, standing at his sentry-box as a constant reminder of occupation. Michal comes up behind Szpilman, makes for the door, nods, and goes. The sound of the padlock closing, a measure both for security and containment. Szpilman takes in the room, sees the piano, a symbol of his former life and career interrupted by war, is still for a moment, then goes to it. He sits on the piano stool, adjusts its height, opens the lid, removes a cloth covering the keys, gazes lovingly at the keyboard, and flexes his fingers, once renowned for their skill. Then, without touching the keys, his fingers floating just above them, he plays passionately in his mind, a silent symphony echoing his lost freedom. Snow falling, a quiet but persistent reminder of the harsh winter outside. Szpilman alert, hearing the padlock being unlocked and then opened. The door opens and Michal enters, accompanied by a man, aged about thirty, Szalas, confident, a little brash, likely representing the black market traders thriving amidst shortages. In whispers, Szalas and Szpilman shake hands. Szalas produces a quarter bottle of vodka, a scarce luxury, thumps the back of the bottle so that the cork flies out. He finds glasses and pours, gives the others their vodka, a brief respite from their troubles. Szalas shrugs, finds the vodka, pours two glasses, unwraps the package to reveal sausage and bread, a simple but vital meal, takes a bite of sausage, chewing deliberately, slowly to savor each morsel. Szalas goes to the window, looks out. Szpilman thinks for a moment, then takes off his wristwatch, a valuable barter item in such times, hands it to Szalas. Szalas pockets the watch, makes for the door, stops, grins, downs Szpilman's vodka, gives a mock salute and goes. The padlock is locked on the other side, a reminder of the constant threat outside. Sunshine floods in through the windows, temporarily warming the cold room. Szpilman lies inert on the bed, weak, starving, ill, symptoms of the relentless privations he faces. The sound of the padlock, the daily ritual of precarious comings and goings. Dorota, no longer pregnant, and Michal enter, come to the bed. In whispers, Szpilman barely has strength to open his eyes and focus on them. He mutters incoherently, his mind clouded by fever and hunger. She starts for the door, and he leaves. The padlock sound signals yet another moment of vulnerability. Dorota goes to the kitchen, wets a towel, comes back to the bed, kneels, places the towel on Szpilman's brow, a small gesture of care and comfort. He focuses on her, smiles, then suddenly winces with pain, a sharp reminder of his frail condition. She looks at him, barely audible, her eyes full of concern. The Doctor and Michal leave his line of vision, moving out of sight but not out of mind. Szpilman looking down from the fourth-floor window, sees a world that carries on despite his suffering. Peaceful. A few pedestrians, brave souls venturing out. An everyday atmosphere, yet tinged with the constant undercurrent of tension.

          "description": "Carla hauls a basket of gadgets and sets them on a bench while Norton rushes directly to the mirror and peers in. There are glimpses of the countryside, but in the lane below, across, is a tavern and, at the intersection, a barn flying a pirate flag and watched by a watchman, lounging at his post. Carla sneaks up behind Norton, heads for the exit, winks, and departs. The echo of the latch fastening. Norton surveys the chamber, finds the harp, pauses briefly, then approaches it. He perches on the stool, modifies its angle, lifts the cover, discards a sheet draping the strings, stares fondly at the instrument, and flexes his hands. Then, without plucking the strings, his hands hovering just above them, he performs fervently. Leaves drifting. Norton alert, sensing the latch being unfastened and then swung open. The portal swings and Carla strides in, joined by a woman, aged about thirty, Rona, self-assured, somewhat bold. In murmurs, Rona and Norton clasp hands. Rona reveals a small flask of cider, taps the base of the flask so the stopper pops out. She locates mugs and fills, offers the others their cider. Rona shrugs, locates the cider, fills two mugs, unwraps the bundle to display cheese and crackers, takes a bite of cheese, munching thoughtfully, leisurely. Rona approaches the mirror, gazes out. Norton ponders momentarily, then removes his necklace, hands it to Rona. Rona pockets the necklace, heads for the exit, pauses, beams, gulps Norton's cider, gives a playful wave and departs. The latch is latched from the outside. Moonlight floods in through the openings. Norton sprawls motionless on the couch, frail, hungry, ailing. The echo of the latch. Grace, no longer sleepy, and Carla arrive, walk to the couch. In murmurs, Norton scarcely musters strength to open his eyes and center on them. He mumbles incoherently. She strides for the exit, and he exits. The latch sound. Grace walks to the pantry, dampens a rag, returns to the couch, bends it, places the rag on Norton's forehead. He centers on her, grins, then suddenly grimaces with discomfort. She peers at him, barely audible. The Baker and Carla drift from his line of sight. Norton gazing down from the third-floor terrace. Serene. A couple of cyclists. A mundane air. At the far corner, at the crossroads with a major avenue, a carriage rolls down the path and stops, unloading riders on the far side and thus out of view. The carriage proceeds on its course, now uncovering the few riders who disembarked—men, a young girl with a balloon."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Szpilman, captivated by a piano, lovingly prepares to play but stops just above the keys. Later, Michal returns with Szalas, bringing vodka and food. Szpilman trades his watch with Szalas, who locks the door as he leaves. Szpilman lies weak and starving in bed until Dorota and Michal visit. Dorota comforts him, placing a wet towel on his brow as Szpilman winces in pain. Peace returns outside with trams rumbling and pedestrians walking quietly, contrasting with Szpilman’s struggles inside."
