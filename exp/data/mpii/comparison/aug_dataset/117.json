Neff advances alongside Lola and guides her toward his office, with the camera tailing them. He unlocks the door of his office and holds it for her, and she enters.

Neff, with his hat on and no briefcase, is strolling toward Keyes' office. As he approaches near to the door, he halts with a surprised expression on his face. On a chair beside the door sits a recognizable figure. He is Jackson, the man from the observation deck of the train. He is wearing his Stetson hat and puffing on a cigar, examining something in the file folder. Neff identifies him instantly, but Jackson does not glance up. Neff regulates his expression and continues to open the door to Keyes' office. Neff is just securing the door from the interior. Keyes, with his jacket off, is reclining on his office sofa, gnawing on a cigar, as usual. Keyes springs off the sofa like a rubber ball and points a finger at him. Keyes proceeds to the door and opens it, and Jackson enters with the file folder. Jackson indicates the cigar he himself is puffing and the file folder he is holding. Keyes recalls he neglected to introduce Jackson and picks up the telephone on his desk and speaks into it. Meanwhile, Jackson crosses over to Neff, and during the ensuing conversation between him and Neff, we hear Keyes' low voice on the phone in the background. Keyes rejoins them at this juncture and has opened the door for Jackson, who exits. Keyes places a cigar in his mouth and begins tapping his pockets for matches."

          "description": "Several people come out, among them Neff, a seasoned insurance salesman known for his meticulous attention to detail, carrying his briefcase. Lola, a young woman with a troubled past involving family disputes, sees him and stands up, and as he is about to pass through the anteroom, a reception area often bustling with clients, without recognizing her, she stops him. Neff looks at her, a little startled, recalling their previous tense encounter over an unresolved insurance claim. He pushes the swing door open, a feature typical of mid-century office design for ease of movement, and holds it for her. As she passes in front of him, his eyes narrow in uneasy speculation, reflecting his suspicion about her motives. Neff comes up level with Lola and leads her towards his office, where important decisions and negotiations often occur, with the camera following them. He opens the door of his office, a space cluttered with files and paperwork emblematic of the insurance industry, and holds it for her, and she enters. Lou Schwartz, one of the other salesmen, known for his expertise in life insurance policies, is working at his desk, but Lola enters, with Neff following after her. Lou, noticing the tension, gets up and goes out. Neff stares at her tensely, aware of the emotional weight she carries, and she turns again to the window, an escape from reality, so he won't see that she is crying. Neff gets up and goes to her, his empathy overshadowed by professional caution. In the foreground, Neff and Lola are having dinner, surrounded by the lively, colorful ambiance of Olvera Street—an iconic Los Angeles destination known for its Mexican marketplace atmosphere—with sidewalk peddlers, guitar players, etc., in the background. Neff and Lola are driving along the beach near Santa Monica, a picturesque area famous for its vibrant boardwalk and sunny weather. Neff is wearing a light summer suit, appropriate for the coastal climate, in contrast to Lola's mourning, reflecting her recent personal loss. Apparently, she is telling him a story, perhaps about her recent struggles, and now and then she laughs, but there is no sound, leaving her words a mystery. There is a close shot of Neff behind the steering wheel, and he is only half listening to Lola, preoccupied with his own thoughts. Neff, with his hat on, a common accessory for the times, and no briefcase this time, is walking toward Keyes' office, the hub for top-level insurance decisions. As he comes up close to the door, he stops with a startled expression on his face. On a chair beside the door sits a familiar figure. He is Jackson, the man from the observation platform of the train, a crucial eyewitness whose testimony could be pivotal. He is wearing his Stetson hat, giving him a distinctive presence, and smoking a cigar, studying something in the file folder, likely containing critical evidence. Neff recognizes him immediately, but Jackson does not look up, engrossed in his task. Neff controls his expression, masking his anxiety, and goes on to open the door to Keyes' office. Neff is just closing the door from the inside. Keyes, with his coat off, is lying on his office couch, chewing on a cigar, as usual, a habit that underscores his gruff, no-nonsense demeanor. Keyes bounces off the couch like a rubber ball, his energy always surprising given his age, and levels a finger at him, expressing his keen suspicion. Keyes goes to the door and opens it, and Jackson enters with the file folder, his expression unreadable. Jackson indicates the cigar he himself is smoking and the file folder he is holding, a gesture full of unspoken communication. Keyes remembers he forgot to introduce Jackson, a lapse in his otherwise sharp protocol, and picks up the telephone on his desk and speaks into it, perhaps arranging for further investigation. Meanwhile, Jackson crosses over to Neff, and during the ensuing dialogue between him and Neff, we hear Keyes' low voice on the phone in the background, a quiet reminder of the ongoing puzzle they are part of. Keyes rejoins them at this point and has opened the door for Jackson, who goes out, leaving behind an air of unresolved tension. Keyes puts a cigar in his mouth, a comforting ritual, and starts tapping his pockets for matches, his mind seemingly never at rest."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

          "description": "Several people exit a building, including Neff with his briefcase. Lola spots Neff and stops him; he looks at her, startled, and holds the door as they proceed to his office. Once inside, Neff observes Lola crying at the window, and he approaches. Later, Neff and Lola have dinner amid the activity of Olvera Street and then drive along a beach. Lola, in mourning attire, shares a story, but Neff only half-listens. Neff walks to Keyes' office and is surprised to see Jackson, a familiar figure from the train, seated nearby. Inside, Keyes points at Neff upon seeing him, then opens the door for Jackson, who enters with a file. Keyes introduces Jackson, who exchanges words with Neff, while Keyes is briefly on the phone. After a brief dialogue, Jackson exits, and Keyes lights a cigar, searching for matches."
