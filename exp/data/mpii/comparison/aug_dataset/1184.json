The glass bowl flies over and over in the air as Harry steers his broom, soaring towards a high stone tower. Upstairs in her study, Professor McGonagall sees Harry hackling towards her window, and just in time, he turns a neat somersault and catches the Remembrall, then tosses it victoriously into the air. Professor McGonagall steps to the window and looks down into the courtyard as Harry rejoins the cheering first-years, while Malfoy and his cronies snigger. Still carrying his broomstick, Harry trails after Professor McGonagall, who walks toward them, purposefully, and stops outside a classroom. The twins are there, and Hermione shows Harry a name on a Gryffindor Trophy. They go upstairs, and the staircase swings into a different position on the opposite wall. Harry opens the door at the top of the stairs, and they see a statue covered in cobwebs. A torch flares, and the caretaker's scary red-eyed cat watches them run down a torch-lit corridor. Harry struggles with the latch, and taking out her wand, the door opens and they rush through. Filch, the caretaker, holds up a lantern and peers around suspiciously, while in the middle of the room is a gigantic dog with three enormous heads and three sets of sharp, glistening teeth. The children rush for the door, and one of the slobbering heads is so enormous, it completely fills the doorway, but they slam the door shut. Daylight comes, and Oliver and Harry carry a trunk out into the school grounds. They set the trunk on the grass, and Oliver takes out a large, red ball. Chained down, two brown balls struggle to escape. Oliver gives Harry a wooden bat and then unchains one of the brown balls, which shoots straight up, above their heads, almost out of sight. Harry swings the bat and knocks the ball high into the air, flying over the head of a statue on the battlements before the ball returns. Oliver catches it, but the brown ball knocks him to the ground. He struggles with it and with great difficulty, forces it back into the trunk and fastens it down with a strong chain. He gives Harry a tiny, golden ball with delicate, golden wings that spring out of the snitch, and it flutters above Harry's head. Ron flicks his wand, and Hermione flicks her wand. A white feather rises from the desk and floats across the room towards tiny Professor Flitwick, who is standing on a pile of books. Seamus' face is smudged with soot, and a smoldering feather sinks onto the desk. Crossing the courtyard, Hermione hurries past, while the Great Hall is lit with flaming torches, and candles flicker and glow from the mouths of grinning pumpkins, which float above the heads of the students.",

Hereâ€™s the text with synonyms for each non-stop word:\n\nHarry attempts a snatch but Malfoy whirls out of range, and Malfoy hurls the Remembrall away with all his strength. The glass sphere soars over and over in the sky as Harry directs his broomstick, gliding towards a tall stone turret. Upstairs in her office, Professor McGonagall observes Harry hackling towards her window, and just in time, he executes a neat flip and seizes the Remembrall, then flings it triumphantly into the air. Professor McGonagall steps to the window and gazes down into the courtyard as Harry rejoins the applauding first-years, while Malfoy and his followers giggle. Still bearing his broomstick, Harry trails after Professor McGonagall, who strides toward them, purposefully, and halts outside a classroom. The twins are present, and Hermione indicates Harry a label on a Gryffindor Award. They ascend, and the staircase pivots into a different position on the opposite wall. Harry opens the portal at the top of the stairs, and they observe a sculpture enveloped in cobwebs. A torch blazes, and the caretaker's frightening crimson-eyed cat observes them dash down a torch-lit passageway. Harry struggles with the latch, and extracting her wand, the portal opens and they hurry through. Filch, the caretaker, holds up a lantern and scrutinizes around suspiciously, while in the center of the chamber is a gigantic canine with three enormous heads and three sets of sharp, shimmering fangs. The children rush for the exit, and one of the slobbering heads is so immense, it completely fills the doorway, but they slam the door shut. Daylight arrives, and Oliver and Harry carry a chest out into the school grounds. They place the chest on the grass, and Oliver extracts a large, crimson sphere. Chained down, two brown spheres struggle to escape. Oliver grants Harry a wooden club and then unchains one of the brown spheres, which shoots straight up, above their heads, almost out of view. Harry swings the club and hits the sphere high into the sky, flying over the head of a sculpture on the battlements before the sphere returns. Oliver catches it, but the brown sphere knocks him to the earth. He struggles with it and with great difficulty, forces it back into the chest and fastens it down with a strong chain. He gives Harry a tiny, golden sphere with delicate, golden wings that spring out of the snitch, and it flutters above Harry's head. Ron flicks his wand, and Hermione flicks her wand. A white plume rises from the desk and floats across the chamber towards tiny Professor Flitwick, who is standing on a stack of books. Seamus' face is smeared with soot, and a smoldering plume sinks onto the desk. Crossing the courtyard, Hermione hurries past, while the Great Hall is lit with blazing torches, and candles flicker and glow from the mouths of grinning gourds, which float above the heads of the students."

As daylight breaks over the horizon, Oliver and Harry are seen carrying a large and cumbersome trunk out into the expansive and picturesque school grounds. They set the heavy trunk down on the soft grass, and Oliver retrieves a large, vibrant red ball. Two brown balls, which are securely chained down, seem eager and ready to break free. Oliver hands Harry a sturdy wooden bat and then unchains one of the brown balls, which shoots straight up into the air, ascending far above their heads, almost disappearing from view.

With a forceful motion, Malfoy hurls the Remembrall away, his arm swinging widely to send the glass sphere spinning through the air. As the Remembrall arches and twirls above, Harry navigates his broom with precision, skillfully guiding it to ascend rapidly towards a towering stone structure. Meanwhile, within her study high up in the building, Professor McGonagall catches sight of Harry approaching her window, his figure growing larger as he draws near. At the last moment, Harry executes a flawless somersault in mid-air, skillfully recalibrating his position to align with the flying object. With a deft motion, he extends his hand and captures the Remembrall securely, then, in a triumphant gesture, he tosses it back into the air. Professor McGonagall approaches the window, gazing down into the courtyard where Harry is reunited with the group of cheering first-year students, their joyful exclamations echoing, while nearby, Malfoy and his friends exchange mocking laughter. Still holding his broomstick, Harry follows closely behind Professor McGonagall as she strides purposefully towards them, the group halting outside a classroom door. The twins are present, and Hermione directs Harry's attention to a name displayed on a Gryffindor Trophy, inviting him to take a closer look. As they ascend the stairs, the staircase pivots unexpectedly, delivering them to a new position on the opposite wall. At the top of the stairs, Harry reaches out and pushes the door open, revealing a statue shrouded in cobwebs within the dimly lit space. At that moment, a torch flares to life, casting a flickering glow that illuminates the caretaker's ominous red-eyed cat, which watches them intently as they hurry down the torch-lit corridor. Harry struggles momentarily with the door latch, his fingers fumbling, until Hermione produces her wand, skillfully unlocking the door and allowing them to rush through the opening. Filch, the caretaker, raises a lantern, its light casting eerie shadows as he peers around with a suspicious gaze, while in the center of the room, a massive dog looms, its three heads each sporting a set of sharp, glistening teeth. The children sprint back to the door in a panicked frenzy, and one of the dog's enormous, drooling heads fills the doorway completely, but they manage to slam the door shut just in time. As daylight breaks, Oliver and Harry carry a large trunk out onto the school grounds, setting it down on the grass with a determined thud. Oliver retrieves a large, red ball from the trunk, and Harry watches as two brown balls, restrained by chains, struggle against their bindings. Handing Harry a wooden bat, Oliver releases one of the brown balls, which rockets skyward, soaring far beyond their heads until it is nearly out of view. Harry, seizing the opportunity, swings the bat with calculated force, sending the ball sailing high above a statue on the battlements before it returns towards them. Oliver catches the returning ball, but its impact knocks him to the ground. Wrestling with the ball, he eventually manages to overpower it, securing it back into the trunk and fastening it firmly with a robust chain. Turning his attention to Harry, Oliver presents him with a small, golden ball, its intricate golden wings unfurling as it flutters just above Harry's head. Meanwhile, in another setting, Ron and Hermione each flick their wands with a precise swish, causing a white feather to rise from the desk and float gracefully across the room towards the diminutive Professor Flitwick, who stands precariously on a pile of books to observe their progress. Elsewhere, Seamus's face is marred with black soot, a smoldering feather sinking onto the desk before him. Crossing the courtyard, Hermione moves swiftly, her pace brisk, while the Great Hall presents a captivating scene, illuminated by the warm glow of flaming torches. Overhead, candles flicker and emit a soft light from within grinning pumpkins that hover above the heads of the students."

The glass bowl, designed to remind its owner of something forgotten by turning red, flies over and over in the air as Harry steers his Nimbus 2000 broom, a top-of-the-line racing broom known for its speed and agility, soaring towards a high stone tower at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Upstairs in her study, Professor McGonagall, the strict yet fair Head of Gryffindor House and Transfiguration teacher, sees Harry hackling towards her window, and just in time, he turns a neat somersault and catches the Remembrall, then tosses it victoriously into the air. Professor McGonagall steps to the window and looks down into the courtyard as Harry rejoins the cheering first-years, while Malfoy and his cronies, well-known troublemakers in Slytherin, snigger. Still carrying his broomstick, Harry trails after Professor McGonagall, who walks toward them purposefully, and stops outside a classroom where students eagerly await their lessons. The twins, Fred and George Weasley, are there, and Hermione shows Harry a name on a Gryffindor Trophy, which commemorates the house's many achievements in the school. They go upstairs, and the staircase, one of many magical staircases at Hogwarts that can shift positions unpredictably, swings into a different position on the opposite wall. Harry opens the door at the top of the stairs, and they see a statue covered in cobwebs, likely depicting one of the past founders or notable figures of the school. A torch flares, illuminating the dim corridor, and the caretaker's scary red-eyed cat, Mrs. Norris, known for her ability to detect students out of bed, watches them run down a torch-lit corridor. Harry struggles with the latch, and taking out her wand, Hermione, skilled in spells from her extensive reading, opens the door and they rush through. Filch, the caretaker, holds up a lantern and peers around suspiciously, while in the middle of the room is a gigantic dog with three enormous heads, known as Fluffy, who guards the trapdoor leading to a valuable secret. The children rush for the door, and one of the slobbering heads is so enormous, it completely fills the doorway, but they slam the door shut. Daylight comes, and Oliver Wood, captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch team, and Harry carry a trunk out into the school grounds. They set the trunk on the grass, and Oliver takes out a large, red ball, the Quaffle used in the wizarding sport Quidditch. Chained down, two brown balls known as Bludgers, which are enchanted to try and knock players off their brooms, struggle to escape. Oliver gives Harry a wooden bat, typically used by Beaters to defend their teammates from the Bludgers, and then unchains one of the brown balls, which shoots straight up, above their heads, almost out of sight. Harry swings the bat and knocks the ball high into the air, flying over the head of a statue, possibly of a former Hogwarts Headmaster, on the battlements before the ball returns. Oliver catches it, but the brown ball knocks him to the ground. He struggles with it and with great difficulty, forces it back into the trunk and fastens it down with a strong chain. He gives Harry a tiny, golden ball, the Golden Snitch, crucial to winning a Quidditch match by granting 150 points to the team whose Seeker catches it, with delicate, golden wings that spring out of the snitch, and it flutters above Harry's head. Ron, known for his strategic mind often tested in chess, flicks his wand, and Hermione, already adept in many spells from her incessant studying, flicks her wand. A white feather rises from the desk and floats across the room towards tiny Professor Flitwick, the Charms Master who is standing on a pile of books to see over his desk. Seamus' face is smudged with soot, the result of a spell gone wrong, and a smoldering feather sinks onto the desk. Crossing the courtyard, Hermione hurries past, while the Great Hall is lit with flaming torches, typical for the grand dining room during feasts, and candles flicker and glow from the mouths of grinning pumpkins, charmed to hover above the heads of the students, capturing the spirit of the Halloween festivities."

Downstairs in his workshop, Mr. Filch observes George sneaking towards his doorway, and just in time, he executes a perfect backflip and retrieves the Remembrall, then swings it triumphantly into the sky. Mr. Filch saunters to the doorway and peers down into the garden as George reunites with the applauding second-years, while Neville and his pals chuckle. Still gripping his skateboard, George ambles after Mr. Filch, who strides toward them, determinedly, and halts outside a library. The triplets are there, and Luna shows George a title on a Hufflepuff Plaque. They descend downstairs, and the stairwell swivels into another position on the adjacent wall. George pushes the door at the base of the stairs, and they spot a painting draped in dust. A lantern blazes, and the gardener's eerie green-eyed owl scrutinizes them trot down a lantern-lit hallway. George battles with the knob, and taking out his broom, the gate opens and they dash through. Madam Hooch, the gardener, raises a flashlight and scans around warily, while in the center of the chamber is a massive cat with three colossal heads and three sets of fierce, gleaming eyes. The teenagers bolt for the gate, and one of the drooling heads is so gigantic, it entirely fills the entrance, but they latch the gate closed. Nightfall descends, and Percy and George hoist a suitcase out into the school park. They place the suitcase on the soil, and Percy extracts a large, green ball. Tethered firmly, two gray balls wrestle to break free. Percy hands George a metal racket and then unleashes one of the gray balls, which zooms straight down, beneath their feet, nearly below sight. George swings the racket and propels the ball low into the earth, skidding past the ankle of a sculpture on the ramparts before the ball rebounds. Percy snatches it, but the gray ball shoves him to the ground. He grapples with it and with substantial effort, locks it back into the suitcase and secures it down with a heavy cord. He hands George a small, silver cube with slender, silver chains that spring out of the snitch, and it dances around George's feet. Ginny snaps her fingers, and Luna snaps her fingers.

Oliver grabs it, but the green cube tips him to the ceiling. He wrestles with it and with much effort, maneuvers it back into the suitcase and seals it with a slender rope. He hands Harry a tiny, silver cube with delicate, silver strings that spring out of the trinket, and it flutters above Harry's feet. Ron taps his pen, and Hermione taps her pen. A black newspaper rises from the shelf and drifts across the chamber towards tiny Professor Flitwick, who is standing on a stack of cushions. Seamus' hair is spattered with dust, and a smoldering newspaper rests onto the shelf. Crossing the park, Hermione hurries past, while the Dining Room is lit with flickering lamps, and lanterns flicker and shimmer from the tails of laughing witches, which hover above the hands of the guests."

          "description": "Georgina attempts a dive but Carl swerves out of vicinity, and Carl lobs the maraca aside with all his strength. The ceramic vase tumbles over and over in the breeze as Georgina maneuvers her skateboard, gliding towards a towering metal chimney. Downstairs in his lab, Dr. Johansson spots Georgina cackling towards his porthole, and just in time, she spins a graceful pirouette and snags the maraca, then hurls it triumphantly into the atmosphere. Dr. Johansson strides to the porthole and peers up into the orchard as Georgina rejoins the applauding second-graders, while Carl and his buddies guffaw. Still grasping her scooter, Georgina drifts after Dr. Johansson, who marches towards them, determinedly, and halts beside a library. The siblings are there, and Eleanor points Georgina to a title on a Hufflepuff Plaque. They descend downstairs, and the escalator revolves into a separate position on the adjacent ceiling. Georgina closes the hatch at the foot of the ladder, and they glimpse a mural blanketed in moss. A lantern flickers, and the janitor's eerie green-eyed owl watches them sprint down a lantern-lit hallway. Georgina wrestles with the hinge, and lifting out his staff, the wall swings open and they dash through. Sam, the janitor, holds up a flashlight and gazes around cautiously, while in the center of the chamber is a colossal bird with three gigantic wings and three rows of blunt, dazzling beaks. The youngsters dash for the window, and one of the squawking wings is so huge, it entirely blocks the entrance, but they bolt the window closed. Nighttime descends, and Liam and Georgina lug a suitcase across the courtyard. They position the suitcase on the concrete, and Liam extracts a massive, blue box. Anchored down, two green boxes yearn to flee. Liam hands Georgina a metal stick and then unhooks one of the green boxes, which rockets straight down, below their feet, almost out of reach. Georgina hurls the stick and smacks the box deep into the ocean, swimming under the foot of a painting on the gallery before the box rebounds. Liam snatches it, but the green box topples him to the ceiling. He grapples with it and with tremendous effort, confines it back into the suitcase and locks it up with a weak rope. He hands Georgina a large, bronze coin with tiny, bronze strings that pop out of the penny, and it flits beneath Georgina's feet. George taps his pencil, and Eleanor taps her pencil. A red scarf lifts from the floor and drifts over the yard towards large Professor Vickers, who is sitting in a stack of scrolls. Neil's shirt is stained with paint, and a scorching scarf drops onto the floor. Hovering in the hallway, Eleanor races forward, while the Cafeteria is illuminated with shimmering lamps, and fireworks twinkle and glisten from the eyes of scowling dragons, which soar beneath the feet of the teachers."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby cafÃ©, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

          "description": "Harry tries to catch the Remembrall, but Malfoy snatches it and throws it. Chasing after it on his broom, Harry catches it near Professor McGonagall's window, impressing her. Harry later follows her inside, where Hermione shows him a Gryffindor trophy. They explore a shifting staircase and discover a statue covered in cobwebs, only to be watched by a caretakerâ€™s eerie cat. They rush through a door, encountering a giant three-headed dog, barely escaping. Oliver trains Harry with a flying ball and wooden bat, leading to a practice session with a golden snitch. In class, Hermione levitates a feather successfully with her wand, while Seamus struggles and causes an explosion. Outside, Hermione hurries past, and the Great Hall is decorated with floating pumpkins and candles."
