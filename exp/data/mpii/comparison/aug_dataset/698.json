A slither of Symbiote falls onto Brock's shoulder, while above him, Peter continues tearing the unraveling Symbiote from his body. The slimy black Symbiote slithers off the ledge that Peter is on and snakes down the bell tower, where a globule lands in the palm of Brock's hand and spreads around him. As more lands on Brock's shoulder, it wraps itself around his body like ivy. Brock drops to his hands and knees, consumed by the black tendrils that push him to the floor as if he were stuck in a pool of tar. The Symbiote devours Brock’s face, and like a wild cat with jagged teeth, he lurches forward as Venom. Later in his room, Peter is in the shower with water streaming over his tightly closed eyes, and then they slowly open with a dead, vacant expression. A short time later, he’s sitting on his floor, lonely and leaning against the French windows. He trudges to the door and holds it, which comes off in his hand. He pries the door open with his fingertips as Aunt May looks around his shabby room. He puts the door knob down on a shelf and holds out the engagement ring, dropping it into her palm.

A sliver of Symbiote drops onto Brock's shoulder, while above him, Peter continues shredding the disintegrating Symbiote from his form. The slick ebony Symbiote slides off the brink that Peter is on and glides down the bell tower, where a droplet lands in the palm of Brock's hand and spreads around him. As more lands on Brock's shoulder, it coils itself around his form like vine. Brock collapses to his hands and knees, engulfed by the ebony tendrils that press him to the ground as if he were ensnared in a pool of tar. The Symbiote consumes Brock’s visage, and like a feral feline with serrated teeth, he lunges forward as Venom. Later in his chamber, Peter is in the shower with water pouring over his tightly shut eyes, and then they gradually open with a dead, empty expression. A short period later, he’s seated on his floor, solitary and leaning against the French windows. He trudges to the portal and clutches it, which comes off in his hand. He pries the portal open with his fingertips as Aunt May looks around his dilapidated chamber. He places the door knob down on a shelf and extends the betrothal ring, dropping it into her palm. He turns away from his aunt’s probing eyes and goes over to the French windows, his sorrowful face lit by a spectral azure glow from the metropolis outside. Aunt May places the ring on the table, and Peter half-turns towards her. As she softly exits the chamber, Peter turns his melancholy gaze back to the window. In a form-fitting ebony Spider-Man-style attire, Venom swings through the metropolis on web-like threads, only to be seized by Flint in an alleyway. Venom retaliates and hurls Flint to one side. At night, Peter walks under the lit awning of the theater across the thoroughfare from Mary Jane’s apartment structure, where he catches a glimpse of Mary Jane moving about her apartment in a illuminated top-floor window. His mournful azure eyes slowly fill with tears, and he bows his head and walks away. As Peter trudges off down the thoroughfare, Mary Jane looks out of the window at the vacant corner where he was standing moments earlier. A short time later, she emerges from her apartment block in her waitress uniform and hails a taxi. Meanwhile, armored vehicles are hurled aside like toys by bursts of sand, and Peter is in a throng outside an electrical store, watching the TV coverage in wide-eyed shock."

The slimy black substance slithers off the ledge where Peter stands and snakes its way down the bell tower, eventually landing with a soft, wet sound in the palm of Brock's hand. The substance spreads rapidly over Brock's skin, wrapping around him like tendrils of ivy. As more of the Symbiote lands on his shoulder, it spreads with increasing speed, enveloping his body. Overwhelmed, Brock falls to the ground on his hands and knees, the black tendrils of the Symbiote forcing him down as if he were ensnared in a viscous pool of tar. The Symbiote covers his face entirely, transforming him as he lunges forward with the ferocity of a wild cat, revealing his new identity as Venom.\n\nAt a later moment, Peter is in the confines of his room, standing in the shower with water cascading over his face, his eyes tightly shut. Gradually, they open, revealing a dead, vacant expression. Some time passes, and he finds himself sitting on the floor, leaning against the French windows, a picture of loneliness. Slowly, he rises and makes his way to the door, only to have it come off in his hand. With careful effort, he uses his fingertips to pry the door open, allowing Aunt May to survey his shabby surroundings. Gently, he places the doorknob on a shelf and extends his hand to offer her the engagement ring, letting it drop smoothly into her palm. Turning away from his aunt's questioning gaze, he walks toward the French windows, the ghostly blue light from the city casting an ethereal glow over his mournful face. Aunt May places the ring down on a table, and Peter momentarily half-turns in her direction. As she leaves the room with a soft presence, Peter refocuses his doleful gaze on the window.\n\nMeanwhile, Venom, clad in a skin-tight black Spider-Man-style suit, swings confidently through the city on web-like strands, until Flint intercepts him in an alleyway. Venom retaliates with strength, tossing Flint aside. Under the cover of night, Peter walks beneath the illuminated canopy of the theater across from Mary Jane's apartment building.

A slither of Symbiote, an alien life form known in comics for bonding with hosts to grant them enhanced abilities, falls onto Brock's shoulder, while above him, Peter continues tearing the unraveling Symbiote from his body. The slimy black Symbiote slithers off the ledge that Peter is on and snakes down the bell tower, a significant setting where this dramatic confrontation occurs, where a globule lands in the palm of Brock's hand and spreads around him. As more lands on Brock's shoulder, it wraps itself around his body like ivy, much like how the ivy plant climbs surfaces, suggesting entrapment. Brock drops to his hands and knees, consumed by the black tendrils that push him to the floor as if he were stuck in a pool of tar, a substance known for its sticky, immobilizing nature. The Symbiote devours Brock’s face, and like a wild cat with jagged teeth, a comparison often used for ferocity, he lurches forward as Venom. Later in his room, Peter is in the shower with water streaming over his tightly closed eyes, and then they slowly open with a dead, vacant expression, indicative of his emotional exhaustion. A short time later, he’s sitting on his floor, lonely and leaning against the French windows, a common architectural feature in classic New York apartments. He trudges to the door and holds it, which comes off in his hand, suggesting the disrepair of his living situation. He pries the door open with his fingertips as Aunt May, a moral compass in Peter's life, looks around his shabby room. He puts the door knob down on a shelf and holds out the engagement ring, a significant symbol of his relationship with Mary Jane, dropping it into her palm. He turns away from his aunt’s inquiring eyes and goes over to the French windows, his mournful face lit by a ghostly blue glow from the city outside, a city known for its vibrant yet overwhelming atmosphere. Aunt May puts the ring on the table, and Peter half-turns towards her. As she softly leaves the room, Peter turns his doleful gaze back to the window. In a skin-tight black Spider-Man-style suit, Venom, a notorious antihero in the Marvel universe, swings through the city on web-like strands, only to be grabbed by Flint, who as Sandman can manipulate sand, in an alleyway. Venom fights back and tosses Flint to one side. At night, Peter walks under the illuminated canopy of the theater famous for hosting Broadway shows across the street from Mary Jane’s apartment building, where he catches a glimpse of Mary Jane, an aspiring actress, moving about her apartment in a lit top-floor window. His sorrowful blue eyes slowly fill with tears, and he bows his head and walks away. As Peter trudges off down the street, Mary Jane looks out of the window at the deserted corner where he was standing moments earlier. A short time later, she comes out of her apartment block in her waitress uniform, a reminder of her current struggle to make ends meet, and hails a cab. Meanwhile, armored vehicles are tossed aside like toys by bursts of sand, a testament to Sandman's formidable power, and Peter is in a crowd outside an electrical store, watching the TV coverage in wide-eyed shock."

He puts the door knob down on a shelf and holds out the engagement ring dropping it into her palm. He turns away from his aunt’s inquiring eyes and goes over to the French windows his mournful face lit by a ghostly blue glow from the city outside. Aunt May puts the ring on the table and Peter halfturns towards her. As she softly leaves the room Peter turns his doleful gaze back to the window. In a skintight black SpiderManstyle suit Venom swings through the city on weblike strands only to be grabbed by Flint in an alleyway. Venom fights back and tosses Flint to one side. At night Peter walks under the illuminated canopy of the theater across the street from Mary Jane’s apartment building where he catches a glimpse of Mary Jane moving about her apartment in a lit topfloor window. His sorrowful blue eyes slowly fill with tears and he bows his head and walks away.

          "description": "Gina glances up at the crumbling lighthouse as if she were at the heart of a vast canyon, then shreds the faded, oversized red paper across her arms. A fragment of Lizard tumbles onto Keith's hat, while above him, Gina continues shredding the disintegrating Lizard from her torso. The scaly green Lizard tumbles off the platform that Gina is on and winds down the clock tower, where a droplet lands in the fingers of Keith's glove and spreads around him. As more lands on Keith's hat, it coils itself around his form like vines. Keith collapses to his elbows and toes, ensnared by the green vines that anchor him to the ground as if he were stuck in a vat of honey. The Lizard consumes Keith’s head, and like a feral dog with crooked claws, he leaps upward as Serpent. Later in her chamber, Gina is in the bath with water cascading over her slightly opened lips, and then they gradually part with a hollow, vacant look. A short time later, she’s resting on her bed, solitary and leaning against the Spanish doors. She stumbles to the entrance and clutches it, which detaches in her grip. She pries the entrance open with her fingernails as Uncle Lou inspects her cluttered chamber. She places the entrance handle down on a bureau and extends the wristwatch, dropping it into his fingers. She turns away from her uncle’s probing stare and heads over to the Spanish doors, her wistful face illuminated by a spectral green hue from the forest outside. Uncle Lou places the watch on the countertop, and Gina half-turns towards him. As he gently exits the chamber, Gina redirects her melancholic gaze back to the doors. In an oversized red Captain-style outfit, Serpent dashes through the forest on rope-like vines, only to be seized by Stone in a gulley. Serpent fights backward and tosses Stone to one side. In the evening, Gina strolls under the glowing banner of the cinema opposite Violet’s tower block, where she catches a glimpse of Violet moving about her unit in a bright attic window. Her wistful green eyes gradually brim with rain, and she lowers her chin and wanders away. As Gina tramps off down the path, Violet peers out of the window at the empty square where she was standing moments earlier. A short time later, she emerges from her tower block in her chef uniform and flags a chariot. Meanwhile, wooden carts are flung aside like pebbles by gusts of soil, and Gina is amidst a mob outside a clothing boutique, watching the phone broadcast in round-eyed astonishment."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

As pieces fall, they land on Brock, transforming him into Venom, covered in the Symbiote's black tendrils. Meanwhile, Peter, feeling empty and lonely, sits in his room, grappling with his emotions. He gives Aunt May an engagement ring and gazes out his window, lost in thought. Venom, in a sleek black suit, swings through the city but is confronted by Flint in an alley. Elsewhere, Peter walks near Mary Jane's apartment, glimpsing her through a window, his eyes filled with tears. Mary Jane notices his absence from the street below and later leaves her apartment in her waitress uniform. Simultaneously, chaos erupts as armored vehicles are tossed about by sand, with Peter watching the events unfold on TV, shocked by the devastation."
