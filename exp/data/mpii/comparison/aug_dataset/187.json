He instinctively retreats a little, casting another glance back at the lifeless creature. They exchange a meaningful look, a silent communication passing between them, before Brackett simply turns away, leaving the space by exiting the bedroom. Loomis, on the other hand, moves thoughtfully over to the very spot where the sister had been seated earlier, then he turns his attention toward the window.

Suddenly, Laurie moves to answer a ringing sound, picking up the receiver in the den, while Tommy quickly rushes out of the room. Tommy dashes toward the front window, curiously peering out just in time to see a mysterious figure passing under the glow of a streetlight.

The shadowy figure stands close, intently observing as Annie goes about her task, starting to pour melted butter over the popcorn but clumsily spilling it all over herself. Annie quickly ends her call, hurriedly removing her butter-stained blouse and blue jeans, leaving herself clad only in her panties in the kitchen. She fetches a box of cornstarch from the closet and hastily sprinkles it over the greasy stains.

Both men fix their concentrated attention downward on something unseen off the edge of the screen—a still and motionless animal—that provokes a strong reaction in Brackett, leading him to display a look of sheer and utter disgust. He instinctively retreats a little, stepping back as he casts another glance at the lifeless creature.

Both men then simultaneously lower their eyes offscreen to take in the sight of the animal lying there, prompting Brackett to form a disgusted expression as he takes a step back, unable to look away from the deceased creature. They cast brief glances at one another, and Brackett fixes his eyes on Loomis for a moment before decisively turning his back and exiting the bedroom. Meanwhile, Loomis approaches the spot where the sister had been seated, pivots, and lets his eyes fall upon the window. He comes to a halt by the window and focuses intently on the rain gutter adorning the broken window, as the camera gradually zooms in on the window, emphasizing its importance in the scene. In another location, Brackett draws his firearm, and with a sense of caution, both men proceed to enter an interior space. Concurrently, Laurie is seated comfortably on the couch alongside Tommy Doyle, engrossed in narrating a story to him, while Tommy, adorned in his Halloween costume, has a sizable bag of candy resting on the floor beside him. With a burst of excitement, Tommy retrieves a stack of comic books hidden beneath the couch, and Laurie takes a moment to glance through the collection.

As she does, Tommy excitedly dashes out of the den, running to the front window and peering outside just as a figure passes under a streetlight, casting an ominous presence. Tommy quickly moves to the window in the den, pointing animatedly, prompting Laurie to approach with the phone in hand to see for herself. The enigmatic shape shifts its attention to peer through the window of the Wallaces' house, where Annie stands by the kitchen stove preoccupied with making popcorn. The shape stands eerily close to the camera, fixated on Annie as she begins to pour butter over the popcorn, only to accidentally drench herself instead. Reacting swiftly, Annie hangs up the phone and hurriedly strips off her butter-stained blouse and blue jeans, leaving her clad only in her panties in the kitchen. She reaches into the closet, pulls out a box of cornstarch, and hastily sprinkles it over the butter stains.

From the shadows of the backyard, Lester, a formidable German shepherd with a menacing demeanor, suddenly leaps forward, snarling and barking fiercely at the intruder.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
