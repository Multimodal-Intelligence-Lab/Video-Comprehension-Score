The keyboard composition concludes and the movie is hushed. The silence persists as the film slices to a close-up of a large, circular CAT-scan apparatus in a sterile infirmary chamber. A gradually gliding litter, carrying Mickey's strapped supine figure, starts to penetrate the circular aperture of the apparatus. As the camera withdraws from Mickey, his secured cranium beneath the scan, two operators can be viewed through the pane separating the scanner from the control space.

Once more, Mickey is seen exiting the structure, but this instance he bounds down the steps, leaping for delight. He runs whirling down the street, clapping his hands, elated with relief. Several automobiles pass as Mickey gleefully runs. Abruptly he pauses, his hand to his mouth, contemplating. Gail sits in a chair in front of a bookshelf. Mickey, standing behind his desk, his back to the camera, his coat still on, gazes out at the Manhattan skyline. Gail rises from her chair. She strolls past Mickey to a nearby cabinet.

This silence lingers in the air as the film transitions to a close-up shot that reveals a large, circular CAT-scan module within a sterile, antiseptic hospital room. A stretcher, moving ever so slowly, carries Mickey’s strapped, prone body towards the round opening of the module. As the camera gradually pulls back, revealing Mickey with his head securely taped under the scanning device, two technicians are visible through the expansive window that separates the scanner from the adjacent control room. One of the technicians, seated comfortably, diligently taps information into a computer while the other technician stands close by, glancing back and forth from Mickey to the glowing computer screen. The film then briefly cuts away to the computer screen itself, which displays an image of Mickey’s skull. Scan lines rhythmically bleep over the image of the skull. The camera gracefully moves upward from the screen, bringing Mickey back into view, framed through the window, lying silent and serious beneath the imposing CAT-scan module. From this view of Mickey's motionless form, the film shifts back to the two technicians on the other side of the window, engaged in examining the computer screen and quietly conversing with one another. One of the men, nodding in agreement, continues to input more data into the computer.

As she stands there, the camera smoothly transitions its focus to a nearby group of wooden pilings, the water rhythmically lapping against them, creating a serene image. Meanwhile, the melancholy piano piece playing in the background softly concludes, leaving the film enveloped in a profound silence. This quietude persists as the scene seamlessly shifts to a close-up of a large, circular CAT-scan module situated in the sterile environment of a hospital room. A stretcher moves slowly and deliberately, carrying Mickey's securely strapped body as it begins to enter the circular opening of the module. As the camera gradually pulls back, it reveals Mickey's head, carefully taped and positioned under the scan, and through the window separating the scanning area from the control room, two technicians come into view. One technician, comfortably seated, taps methodically on a computer keyboard, inputting data, while the other technician, standing attentively, shifts his gaze between Mickey and the computer screen. The film momentarily cuts to the computer screen, where a detailed image of Mickey's skull is displayed, with scan lines bleeping rhythmically over it. The camera then lifts from the screen, revisiting Mickey through the window, his expression silent and serious under the imposing CAT-scan module. From this solemn scene, attention shifts back to the two technicians through the separating window. They intently study the computer screen, exchanging indistinct words. One of them, nodding in understanding, inputs additional data into the computer. While they analyze the CAT-scan image, the camera cuts to a rear view of Mickey under the module, enhancing the scene's science-fiction aura as though he lies at the heart of a vast, white, futuristic circle. The stretcher, still bearing Mickey, slowly retreats from the module’s embrace. Dr. Brooks then appears, clutching Mickey's X-rays, making his way past rows of bookshelves to a light panel where he carefully props up the X-rays for examination. He turns to address Mickey, who is offscreen, prompting a swift cut to a close-up of Mickey's face, now twisted with total despair. Overcome with emotion, he tightly closes his eyes and covers his face with his hand. In a contrasting scene, Mickey is suddenly seen leaving the building, energetically bounding down the steps, bursting into joyous leaps. He exuberantly runs down the street, hands clapping in celebration and relief, with several cars driving by, underscoring his joyful energy. But unexpectedly, he halts, his hand rising to his mouth as he lapses into a moment of reflection. Meanwhile, Gail sits comfortably in a chair set before a tall bookshelf. Mickey, standing firmly behind his desk with his back to the camera and coat still on, directs his gaze out towards the impressive Manhattan skyline. Gail, rising from her chair, walks leisurely past Mickey towards a nearby cabinet. With purposeful motion, she opens a drawer and begins searching inside. The camera follows her movements, briefly leaving Mickey out of frame. As Mickey's voice continues to resonate offscreen, Gail shuts the cabinet drawer and moves to a file cabinet positioned behind Mickey's desk. She opens it and retrieves a pack of gum, completing her task with quiet satisfaction."

He runs swirling down the street, clapping his hands, happy with relief from what must have been good news. Several cars pass, their drivers perhaps curious about his exuberance, as Mickey joyfully runs.

He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
