          "description": "Five automobiles trail the bikers along a dark avenue, and in Dillinger's automobile, the felon gazes off morosely before grinning out the pane. Scores of citizens border the avenue, applauding, and the mob chief lifts his manacled hands to salute. A youthful male dashes toward the pane as Dillinger's eyes sparkle while other admirers salute eagerly, and he offers a sly, partial-grin. Later, the procession travels onto a span, crossing a series of elevated roadblocks. In the courthouse, a bailiff pushes through a throng of reporters toward a counter, where a simply attired lady strides in an office. She walks out to the throng, and as incoming officers escort Dillinger inside, cameras flare and the thief doubtfully wrinkles his forehead. An officer unfastens Dillinger's wrist shackles, and a plump attorney places an arm around Dillinger, who rests his elbow on the man's shoulder. The female sheriff glowers as Dillinger raises his brows and struts off, accompanied by bailiffs. Later, a sentinel unfastens a cellblock gate and a bailiff directs a stout attorney inside. The attorney casually trails a second sentinel farther ahead. A massive ebony convict strides past a line of cells into a common area where Dillinger peruses a periodical. The massive man leans to Dillinger's ear, and Dillinger grimaces toward his cell, then moves over as the massive convict situates himself just outside and signals to two inmates. Dillinger confronts the bars at the rear of his cell, with the attorney, Piquett, seated in a passage on the opposite side. Piquett leans back and emits a misty exhale in the chilly atmosphere. In a courtroom, Piquett sits at a counsel table as a bailiff accompanies Dillinger in shackles. Piquett faces the bailiff while the magistrate folds his hands pensively, and Bob turns away with a mirthless expression. As the assembly rises, Dillinger winks at Piquett, who steps away, and as the bailiff nears, Dillinger lowers his gaze. Later, outside the penitentiary, a gathering of National Guardsmen stands watch by a waist-high barrier of sandbags, while inside, inmates mill about the common area. As a few bailiffs and sentinels function in a front office, a custodian enters. Later, he hangs up his coat, and a sentinel unfastens a barred gate, lifting his billy club to a second metallic gate just inside. The sentinel gazes through a peephole and unfastens the gate for the custodian, who carries a mop and pail, crosses a hallway, and waits for another sentinel to open another barred gate. In the common area, Dillinger tilts his head and clenches his jaw as the custodian enters and the sentinel closes the gate behind him. Dillinger calmly glances over his shoulder, the custodian sets down his provisions and moves over, and Dillinger seizes Cahoon by the back of his coat, aiming an unusual, waxy firearm at his cranium."

          "description": "Five cars follow the motorcyclists along a dim street in Chicago, where notorious bank robber John Dillinger, a figure from the Great Depression era, stares off glumly before smiling out the window. Dozens of civilians, aware of his infamous crime spree and subsequent status as Public Enemy No. 1, line the street, cheering, and the gang leader raises his shackled hands to wave. A young man rushes toward the window as Dillinger's eyes, known for their intense gaze, gleam while other fans wave excitedly, and he gives a coy, half-smile. Later, the convoy drives onto a bridge that leads the way to the county jail, passing a set of raised barricades used for heightened security. In the courthouse, a deputy shoves through a crowd of journalists eager for a story toward a counter, where a plainly dressed woman, possibly a stenographer or assistant, paces in an office. She strides out to the crowd, and as arriving lawmen lead Dillinger inside, cameras flash capturing every moment and the robber skeptically furrows his brow. An officer, part of the security team, unlocks Dillinger's wrist restraints, and a chubby lawyer, likely partner to the defense, puts an arm around Dillinger, who rests his elbow on the man's shoulder. The female sheriff, who earned her position in a male-dominated field, glowers as Dillinger shrugs his brows and swaggers off, escorted by deputies. Later, a guard unlocks a cellblock door and a deputy guides a portly lawyer, named Louis Piquett, inside. The lawyer nonchalantly follows a second guard farther ahead. A hulking black inmate, perhaps a fellow gang member or a criminal associate, strides past a row of cells into a common room where Dillinger reads a newspaper, scanning for news about his own trial. The hulking man leans to Dillinger's ear, and Dillinger scowls toward his cell, then heads over as the hulking inmate positions himself just outside and waves to two prisoners, likely allies in some upcoming plan. Dillinger faces the bars at the back of his cell, with the lawyer, Piquett, sitting in a corridor on the other side, plotting the next legal moves. Piquett sits back and heaves a misty sigh in the cold air, indicative of the facility's lack of heating. In a courtroom, Piquett sits at a counsel bench as a deputy escorts Dillinger in shackles, a visible sign of his high-risk status. Piquett faces the deputy while the judge, presiding over one of the most high-profile cases of the time, folds his hands thoughtfully, and Bob, another lawyer or associate, turns away with a humorless look. As the crowd, eager to witness the proceedings, rises, Dillinger winks at Piquett, who steps away, and as the deputy approaches, Dillinger lowers his gaze, maintaining his rebellious demeanor. Later, outside the jail, a cluster of National Guardsmen stands watch by a waist-high wall of sandbags, a measure for preventing escape attempts, while inside, prisoners mill about the common room under the watchful eyes of guards. As a few deputies and guards work in a front office, a janitor, possibly an undercover accomplice, enters. Later, he hangs up his coat, and a guard unlocks a barred door, raising his baton to a second metal door just inside, ensuring no breach in security. The guard looks through a peephole, a standard security measure, and unlocks the door for the janitor, who carries a mop and bucket, crosses a hallway, and waits for another guard to open another barred door, keeping the facility secured. In the common room, Dillinger tilts his head and clenches his jaw, a tactic to maintain composure, as the janitor enters and the guard shuts the door behind him. Dillinger coolly glances over his shoulder, the janitor sets down his supplies and heads over, and Dillinger grabs Cahoon, possibly a guard or rival, by the back of his jacket, pointing an odd, waxy gun fashioned from soap or another material at his head, a bold move in his plan to escape."

Piquett faces the deputy while the judge folds his hands thoughtfully and Bob turns away with a humorless look.

Dillinger coolly glances over his shoulder. the janitor sets down his supplies and heads over and Dillinger grabs Cahoon by the back of his jacket pointing an odd waxy gun at his head."

          "description": "Five flamingos shadow the cyclists along a bustling river, and in Baxter's canoe, the baker gazes up cheerfully before singing to the horizon. Scores of tourists float the river, applauding, and the troupe leader lowers his bound wings to dance. A young fish darts toward the horizon as Baxter's fins shimmer while other creatures leap joyfully, and he gives a sly, three-quarter smirk. Later, the flotilla sails onto a gorge, crossing a line of lifted ramps. In the aquarium, a sailor squeezes through a swarm of bloggers toward a podium, where a brightly dressed dolphin spins in a chamber. She glides out to the swarm, and as arriving fishmongers pull Baxter outside, trumpets blare and the sailor curiously squints his nose. A caretaker unfastens Baxter's fin cuffs, and a slender pianist wraps a fin around Baxter, who rests his snout on the dolphin's tail. The male lifeguard beams as Baxter narrows his eyes and waddles off, accompanied by sailors. Later, a lookout unfastens a cave gate and a sailor steers a lanky pianist outside. The pianist leisurely shadows a third lookout farther back. A giant gray walrus paddles past a row of tanks into a lounge where Baxter sketches a blueprint. The giant walrus whispers to Baxter's fin, and Baxter grimaces toward his tank, then rolls over as the giant walrus poses himself just outside and plays to two dolphins. Baxter faces the bars at the top of his tank, with the pianist, Ortega, hovering in a hallway on the opposite side. Ortega hovers back and releases a loud laugh in the warm breeze. In a theater, Ortega hovers at a performance stage as a sailor guides Baxter in cuffs. Ortega faces the sailor while the maestro snaps his fingers rhythmically, and Charlie sighs away with a joyful grin. As the swarm rises, Baxter chuckles at Ortega, who drifts away, and as the sailor approaches, Baxter raises his fins. Later, under the cliff, a parade of Forest Rangers dances watch by a chest-high stack of logs, while inside, dolphins mingle around the lounge. As a handful of sailors and lookouts cook in a busy kitchen, a baker enters. Later, he tosses off his apron, and a lookout unfastens a wooden gate, lifting his spoon to a third wooden gate just inside. The lookout peers through a window and unfastens the gate for the baker, who drags a broom and net, crosses a hallway, and pauses for a third lookout to unlatch a third wooden gate. In the lounge, Baxter nods his fins and tightens his lips as the baker enters and the lookout closes the gate behind him. Baxter smoothly peers over his wing, the baker drops his tools and rolls over, and Baxter snatches Cahoon by the back of his vest, aiming an unusual, rubbery feather at his beak."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby cafÃ©, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

He raises his shackled hands to wave, and a young man approaches as Dillinger's grin grows coy. The convoy reaches a bridge past barricades. In the courthouse, a female sheriff watches lawmen escort Dillinger inside amid flashing cameras. Unshackled, Dillinger rests on a hefty lawyer's shoulder, shrugging as the sheriff glares. A guard unlocks a cellblock where a hulking inmate whispers to Dillinger, who then confers with his lawyer, Piquett, through the bars. In court, Piquett represents Dillinger, who winks at him before lowering his gaze as deputies approach. Outside the jail, National Guardsmen stand watch, while inside, prisoners roam and deputies work. A janitor enters, leads Dillinger to seize Cahoon, and Dillinger threatens him with a waxy gun."
