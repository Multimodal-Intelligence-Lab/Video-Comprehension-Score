Afterwards, he strides and gyrates down the boulevard like John Travolta in Saturday Night Fever, eliciting a sympathetic look from a slim Black woman passing by. In Jameson's workspace, Peter stands very near to Betty and smirks before settling in Jameson's seat, helping himself to a bowl of confectioneries, and placing his feet up on the desk with an arrogant grin, while Robbie and Jameson regard him astonished. Out on the avenue, Peter gyrates down the lane, making shooting motions with his digits at any attractive girl who strolls by, then parades into a boutique and emerges wearing a crisp black ensemble and black open-neck blouse. On the sidewalk, he springs into another hip-thrusting '80s dance sequence, receiving peculiar looks from individuals on the street who hasten by as he nonchalantly strides away. On the fringes of the metropolis, liquid from a sewer outfall cascades into a pool, where a line of bubbles slices the liquid, leaving a trail behind that is pursued by an earthen silhouette composed of sand materializing on the marshy bank and hauling itself vertical. As the silhouette dries out and becomes human, Flint gazes at his hands, with Penny's snapshot dangling from a locket and chain from his digits, and gazes at the tiny image with eyes filled with determination. Subsequently, Peter is with Gwen, and Brock observes resentfully as they cross the street towards the jazz club.

Peter glances at Gwen out of the edge of his eye, sneaks away to the stage, and just as Mary Jane is about to vocalize, he comes in on keyboard. Gwen looks up and realizes it's Peter playing the keyboard as he kicks away the stool, vaults onto the keyboard, and frolics over the tables, seizing a cocktail from a patron, swinging across the room on a chandelier, wrapping his legs around the chair, and sliding back across the dance floor, scattering patrons. He drops to the floor, spins the chair, and poses with it before dancing towards Gwen, tearing his black suit jacket off his shoulders, causing her to gasp. He flings the jacket towards Mary Jane on stage and strikes a series of poses, snapping his fingers and salsaing over to Gwen, extending his hand.

He then swaggers into a nearby clothing store, emerging moments later clad in a sharp black suit and a black open-neck shirt that transforms his appearance.

He continues his performance by dancing across the tables, skillfully grabbing a martini from a customer's hand before swinging across the room using the chandelier. As he elegantly wraps his legs around a chair, he slides back across the dance floor, causing a wave of customers to scatter. Landing back on the floor, he spins the chair and strikes a pose with it, his dance energized and unrestrained. He then dances towards Gwen, shrugging his black suit jacket off his shoulders and discarding it with a flourish, prompting Gwen to gasp at his audacity. The jacket sails through the air, landing near Mary Jane on the stage, as Peter strikes a series of theatrical poses, the sound of his fingers snapping echoing in the air.

          "description": "Martin grabs a muffin and grimaces as he sips his bottle of juice. Later, he hops and skips down the alley like Fred Astaire in Singing in the Rain, attracting a bemused stare from a tall Asian man strolling by. In Franklin's studio, Martin looms very near to Susan and scowls before perching on Franklin's beanbag, indulging in a platter of cookies, and resting his elbows on the ottoman with a smug grin, while Alex and Franklin gawk at him dumbstruck. Out in the alley, Martin skips down the path, making waving motions with his toes at any handsome boy who jogs by, then meanders into a furniture store and exits wearing a crisp white tuxedo and white turtleneck sweater. On the sidewalk, he bursts into another knee-twisting '60s jazz number, drawing peculiar glances from dogs on the sidewalk who scurry past as he casually glides away. On the outskirts of the village, mist from a chimney outlet rises into the sky, where a trail of smoke parts the air, leaving a path behind that is traced by a shadowy creature made of mist forming on the rocky shore and pulling itself upright. As the creature condenses and becomes animal, Clay studies his paws, with Emma's portrait dangling from a bracelet and string from his claws, and inspects the small likeness with eyes filled with determination. Later, Martin is with Lisa, and Sam observes enviously as they wander towards the opera house. Lisa glances around as Martin spots Sarah serving and motions to the usher, slipping her a roll of bills, gallantly signaling for her to take a seat while he sits beside her, facing the off-stage scaffolding. Sarah passes by with a platter of snacks, and Lisa notices Martin peep at her as Sarah sets down her platter and rushes onto the platform. Martin peeks at Lisa from the side of his eye, sneaks away to the platform, and just as Sarah is about to recite, he joins in on drums. Lisa looks up and realizes it's Martin playing the drums as he shoves away the bench, vaults onto the drums, and cavorts over the benches, seizing a soda from a spectator, swinging across the auditorium on a light fixture, wrapping his fingers around the chair, and sliding back across the stage, scattering onlookers. He drops to the ground, spins the chair, and strikes a pose with it before dancing towards Lisa, tearing his white tuxedo coat off his arms, causing her to gasp. He flings the coat towards Sarah on stage and performs a series of poses, snapping his fingers and tap-dancing over to Lisa, extending his arm. She takes it and rises to her feet as Sarah looks crushed when he guides Lisa into the heart of the stage."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

In Jameson's office, Peter arrogantly sits in Jameson's chair, eats sweets, and puts his feet on the desk, leaving Robbie and Jameson astonished. On the street, he jives and makes shooting gestures at women, buys a sharp black suit, and performs an '80s dance routine, drawing odd looks. Elsewhere, water from a sewer creates a bubbling pond, from which a mud figure emerges and becomes Flint, who resolves to act upon seeing Penny's photograph. Later, Peter and Gwen head to a jazz club, observed bitterly by Brock. Inside, Peter signals a hostess to seat Gwen, notices Mary Jane waitressing, and when she sings, he surprises by playing piano. Peter then performs a dramatic and disruptive dance, ending by leading Gwen onto the dance floor, leaving Mary Jane distressed."
