After a moment, he removes the sunglasses. Meanwhile, in a dimly lit exhibition hall, a team of workers goes about their task, rolling a storage crate carefully across the floor. Upon opening it, they reveal a precisely crafted replica of Leonardo da Vinci’s famous painting, the Mona Lisa. This deft creation is used to replace the original masterpiece. One man shines a bright torchlight on the hanging replica, specifically illuminating the enigmatic smile of Mona Lisa.

He quickly rushes into his bathroom, multitasking by cleaning his teeth, then answers the phone in a flurry as he heads out. He silently curses as he passes his car on his way into the garage, and then he climbs into a stretch limousine with darkly tinted windows, driving off.

Once inside, he methodically makes his way to a luxurious chair opposite a Saudi prince. The prince, holding an electronic document, exhibits a composed demeanor while wearing a pair of sunglasses, inside the lenses of which the tech is subtly reflected. The prince then thoughtfully removes his sunglasses. Meanwhile, elsewhere, a group of workers collectively exerts effort to roll a large storage crate through the dimly lit exhibition hall. With careful precision, they open the crate to unveil a convincing replica of Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa. Coordinating together, they efficiently manage to replace the original painting with the replica. A focused man then directs a torch's beam onto the replica, skillfully highlighting the Mona Lisa's enigmatic mouth. In another scene, a TV broadcast showcases the majestic structure of a Mayan temple, a visual that prompts Jackson, a strikingly handsome, dark-haired man in his 30s, to leap energetically off his couch. With urgency, he rushes into his bathroom, vigorously scrubbing his teeth, all the while multitasking as the phone rings. He answers it mid-stride, and as he silently curses his seemingly troublesome car, he briskly walks out of the garage. With determination, he climbs into a stretch limo with dark tinted windows and smoothly drives away, attentive enough to notice a jagged crack marring the road's surface where children are exuberantly jumping over it. Jackson's journey brings him to his ex-wife Kay's house, while, in parallel, at San Francisco Harbor, passengers on a ship are forced to adjust as the vessel lists dramatically up and down. During this commotion, the ship's hull makes a resounding crunch against the docks, causing passengers to stumble, and the diligent ship stewards promptly offer assistance to help them regain their balance. Meanwhile, Harry and his friend Terry focus intently on their surroundings, scanning with concerned expressions. In a different setting, Laura awakens slowly in bed and reaches over to answer her ringing phone. Concurrently, in a separate locale, Roland is in the midst of driving when suddenly, a catastrophic explosion occurs at the car's rear, violently flipping it forward and engulfing it in flames. Back with Jackson, his limo expertly rounds a corner en route to Yellowstone National Park. Inside the Oval Office, President Wilson gazes across at Anheuser as Laura enters carrying a newspaper featuring a headline about Roland's untimely death. She switches on the TV without acknowledging Adrian's presence, causing Wilson to shift his gaze towards Anheuser, who then rises to leave. Adrian chooses to follow but later sinks heavily onto a sofa, feeling the weight of the situation. President Wilson then gently places his hand over hers in a gesture of comfort. Meanwhile, at Yellowstone Park, Jackson accidentally drops his young daughter Lily's hat over a fence, prompting him to climb over after it. Lily and her brother Noah eagerly follow him along a sparse trail that leads them to an open clearing, revealing a parched lake basin. The group cautiously approaches the cordoned-off, bubbly, marshy basin, which is surrounded by imposing tripods, and they are taken aback by the sight of a dead, rotting stag. As they take in this unsettling scene, someone discreetly hidden amongst the trees on a hillside observes them intently through binoculars. The observer, identified as a man named Charlie Frost, watches as steam ominously rises from the lake bed around Jackson, who firmly holds his children's hands as a convoy arrives purposefully in front of them."

President Wilson sits in front of her putting his hand over hers. At Yellowstone Park Jackson drops his daughter Lily's hat over a fence and climbs after it followed by Lily and her brother Noah along a sparse trail to a clearing with a parched lake basin. They head down to the cordonedoff bubbly marshy basin surrounded by big tripods and approach a dead rotting stag. Someone amongst the trees on a hillside watches them through binoculars with steam rising from the lake bed around Jackson as he takes his kids' hands and a convoy arrives in front of him. The watcher in the trees is a man named Charlie Frost."

          "description": "Benny hesitates for a health check, and inside the rustic cabin, he lounges across from an Irish king who wields a vintage map and wears a pair of spectacles, with the scenery mirrored in them, before discarding them. Meanwhile, a band of chefs slide a pastry cart through a dimmed library, unlocking it to reveal a sculpture of Michelangelo’s David which they utilize to swap with the duplicate. A woman flickers a lantern on the suspended sculpture, accentuating David’s hands. A radio broadcast highlights an Egyptian pyramid as Walter, a charming, blonde-haired woman in her 40s, tumbles off her recliner, sprints into her kitchen to wash her hands, answers the bell on her way in, silently mocks her bicycle, and strolls out of the workshop. She hops onto a tandem bike with clear basket and pedals away past the field, observing a deep crater in the path as ducks waddle over it. Walter reaches her ex-husband Dan's apartment, while in New York Bay, tourists on a raft sway left and right gently. As boaters trip when the craft’s side scrapes against the piers, porters lift them while Mary and her cousin Jerry survey the vicinity, grinning. Paula dozes off in a hammock, answers her pager, and in a separate town, Martin is bicycling when the rear of his van detonates, turning it around and showering it in confetti. Walter’s bike rounds a bend on the way to Grand Canyon Park. Inside a meeting room, Henry glances across at Miller as Paula arrives with a magazine featuring an article about Martin’s accident. She switches on the radio, dismissing Arthur, while Henry observes Miller who rises to depart, and Arthur trails behind before collapsing onto a bench. Governor Henry stands next to her, placing his foot beside hers. At Grand Canyon Park, Walter tosses her son Jack's scarf over a barrier and scrambles after it, trailed by Jack and his cousin Mia along a crowded path to an overlook with an arid river bed. They venture down to the fenced-off, steamy, muddy puddle surrounded by tall cranes, and approach a live, chirping frog. Somebody amongst the branches on a hill observes them through opera glasses, with fog rising from the river bed around Walter as she grasps her children’s shoulders and a parade arrives behind her. The observer in the branches is a woman named Gina Frost."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
