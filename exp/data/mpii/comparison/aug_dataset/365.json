The Owl isn't nervous. Jenny Lake, age 5, observes wide-eyed as her uncle, Sam Lake, in his 60s and charming, narrates the legend. In every motion, Sam is grander than imagination, painting each scene with utter confidence. A decade later, Jenny huddles with the other Forest Scouts as Sam continues illustrating the tale to the assembly, gesturing to his wristband sparkling in the moonlight. While the other kids are transfixed, Jenny seems uninterested. Sam is engaging Jenny's dashing escort to the lunar festival. He is captivated by the tale and the aura of Sam's charisma. He's mesmerizing. Jenny, now 19 with glasses, is seething and eager to escape. Her aunt Helen, from whom she inherits her elegance and wit, stands beside her at the portal. She looks radiant and couldn't be any prouder if it were her own gathering. Jenny can't endure it further. Alex tries to restrain her, but she rises and exits. As she departs, Jenny mumbles in perfect synchronization with her uncle. Jenny reaches the threshold, where her aunt intercepts her. She sharpens her words on Helen. A chuckle erupts from the gathering. Sam gestures for Helen to accompany him. As she moves across, we observe that three decades of companionship has not diminished their fondness for each other. As they embrace, Sam nudges her arm in a distinctive little manner. The audience cheers. Sam salutes the joyful pair. Alex compensates well for her absent friend, with a grin as bright as sunrise. We move into the heart of a debate on the avenue. Both individuals are slightly tipsy. A brief pause, then. Jenny won't allow him the concluding phrase. Focus on Sam, who flicks a wrist, suggesting enough of this, before he strides away. Focus on Jenny, still boiling with indignant fervor. On a typically bustling afternoon, Jenny is on pause with the radio cushioned under a shoulder, sifting through a heap of parcels thrown on her counter. Returning to the parcels, she discovers a hand-marked package and tears it apart. At the counter, Helen chats on the radio while Sam assembles a burger. Sam claims a position and starts to munch on his burger as Helen stands by the entrance, observing. Sam dives circuits in the family tub, destined for the liquid. Sam gazes intensely into the liquid, like a tiger in wait. We peer down at the stream, where Sam's shadow is captured in the murky current. As the current undulates past, something alters, and sure enough, as we glance up again, it's a youthful Sam Lake, in his 30s, gazing into the liquid."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
