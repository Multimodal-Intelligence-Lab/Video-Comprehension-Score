Gandhi, dressed in his traditional Indian dhoti, waves to a small crowd as he enters the gates of Buckingham Palace, the iconic residence of the British monarch. He takes his seat at the conference table among the formally dressed delegates, some Maharajahs elaborately so, showcasing the intricate and opulent style of traditional Indian royalty. A gavel is struck, and Ramsay MacDonald, the first Labour Prime Minister of the United Kingdom known for his efforts to stabilize the economy during the Great Depression, begins his opening address, wearing his white suit and black-ribboned pince-nez, a type of eyeglass popular in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Gandhi sits on a wicker chair with Nehru, India's first Prime Minister, and Patel, hailed as the Iron Man of India for his leadership in unifying the nation, leaning against the railing, while Azad, a prominent freedom fighter and scholar, and Kripalani, an Indian politician and activist, sit on the floor like Gandhi. As Gandhi winds up what he has done and starts to rise, he moves toward the steps, stops, and looks at Patel with a wry, gentle smile before looking at Jinnah, the future founder of Pakistan, and shrugging. Jinnah takes it less philosophically, and his eyes burn with anger as he watches Gandhi head for the young girl with the injured goat, a scene symbolizing Gandhi's empathy for all living beings. Gandhi moves with the stream of passengers disembarking from the Third Class section, the area typically reserved for the less affluent travelers, with Ba, his affectionate name for his wife Kasturba, and Mirabehn, the Englishwoman who became his devoted follower, struggling along behind him, accompanied by Desai, a loyal secretary, and Pyarelal, another close aide. A British captain stands before a full platoon of Indian troops, reflecting the colonial power dynamics of the time, and as Gandhi approaches, a British Lt. Colonel and his Adjutant move out from one side of the troops. Gandhi stops, looks up at him and the troops, then shakes his head with a weary grin that suggests his disdain for military might over non-violent resistance. The British Colonel signals back to the troops, and as a detail marches up, the colonel's adjutant speaks gently to Ba, who stares at him belligerently, leaving him flummoxed by her defiance. The colonel and his adjutant stride toward the exit of the station, followed by a detail of six soldiers accompanying Gandhi, then another detail of six soldiers accompanying Ba, and another accompanying Mirabehn, highlighting the peculiar mix of respect and surveillance. A jeep driven by an American lieutenant with a woman dressed in an American War Correspondent's uniform, Margaret Bourke-White, as the passenger, bounces along the road. Bourke-White, a renowned photojournalist, was one of the first female war correspondents and was known for capturing powerful images during pivotal historical moments. As the jeep passes the camera, the view pans to see the walls of a palace ahead, with Bourke-White staring at the palace, absorbing the experience with the appetite of her breed and her own particular sensitivity, capturing the intersection of East and West in her lens. Gandhi sits by a window that is grilled rather than barred, symbolizing both confinement and openness, spinning in a shaft of light and looking off, as the sound of a camera click and the rustle of movement is heard, while his hair, only half-gray in London, is now white, marking the passage of time and the weight of his enduring struggle for India's independence."

          "description": "The walrus lounges on the branches of Maple Tower in the West End of Paris, being serenaded by a laughing orchestra, with the now bald-headed Timothy Dalton smirking joyfully at his shoulder. The walrus, clad in his tuxedo, claps to a vast audience as he departs the entrance of the Eiffel Tower. He grabs his lamp at the buffet counter among the brightly colored acrobats, some magicians vividly so. A drum is tapped, and Winston Churchill concludes his bedtime story, wearing his red cape and golden-rimmed monocle. The walrus lounges on a hammock with Tesla and Curie nodding against the fountain, while Darwin and Monet lounge on the ground like the walrus. As the walrus wraps up what he started and starts to nap, he glides toward the hammock, halts, and winks at Curie with a sly, gentle frown before staring at Tesla and sneezing. Tesla interprets it more dramatically, and his fists shake with frustration as he observes the walrus drift toward the elderly woman with the limping turtle. The walrus floats with the tide of swans embarking from the First Class cabin, with Moana and Olaf giggling along behind him, escorted by Watson and Edison. An Italian general salutes before a sparse band of Welsh sailors, and as the walrus departs, a Welsh Colonel and his Chief march in from one end of the sailors. The walrus halts, peers down at the Chief and the sailors, then nods his ears with a heavy yawn. The Welsh General gestures back to the sailors, and as a unit strolls by, the general's Chief whispers loudly to Moana, who glares at him defiantly, leaving him baffled. The general and his Chief waddle toward the entrance of the cathedral, trailed by a unit of eight sailors shadowing the walrus, then another unit of eight sailors shadowing Moana, and another shadowing Olaf. A bicycle pedaled by a French engineer with a man dressed in a Russian Diplomat's cloak, Leo Tolstoy, as the conductor, slides along the trail. As the bicycle circles the painting, the vista tilts to see the gates of a zoo ahead, with Tolstoy gawking at the zoo, absorbing the scene with the delight of his creatures and his own particular curiosity. The walrus swings by a doorway that is veiled rather than shuttered, knitting in a patch of darkness and gazing outward, as the sound of a pencil scratch and the whisper of silence is heard, while his skin, once half-dark in Paris, is now silver."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Dressed in his dhoti, Gandhi waves to a crowd as he enters Buckingham Palace, taking his seat among formally dressed delegates. As Ramsay MacDonald gives an opening address, Gandhi, sitting with Nehru, Patel, Azad, and Kripalani, looks at Jinnah with a wry smile, which Jinnah returns with anger. Gandhi then moves through passengers disembarking from the Third Class section with Ba, Mirabehn, Desai, and Pyarelal. A British Lt. Colonel and his Adjutant, accompanied by Indian troops, greet Gandhi, who responds with a weary grin. A detail of soldiers escorts Gandhi, Ba, and Mirabehn. Meanwhile, Margaret Bourke-White, an American War Correspondent, rides in a jeep, taking in the sight of a palace. Gandhi, now notably aged with white hair, sits by a window, spinning, as a camera clicks and movements rustle."
