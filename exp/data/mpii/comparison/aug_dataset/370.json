Her heart skips a beat when a sleek, black car suddenly pulls up to the curb. Two imposing army officers step out, delivering news that causes Sandra to cry out in anguish. Later, with heavy emotions lingering, Sandra takes to hanging sheets out to dry, forming a long, billowing tunnel of crisp white fabric. As she reaches into the basket to pull out a dress, she glances upwards and notices a mysterious, shadowy ripple crossing the fabric's surface. She freezes momentarily, her mind rejecting the impossible thought—it cannot be Edward, for he is no longer alive. Resolutely, she turns away but continues her task, hanging the dress and reaching for another garment. When she looks up again, Edward himself appears before her eyes, a ghostly figure that seems too real to believe. She gasps, caught in disbelief, but his hand's solid warmth is undeniable, and so, without any hesitation, she kisses him passionately.\n\nElsewhere, beneath the soft covers, a man's hand gently traces the delicate curves of a woman's back. She stirs and turns over in bed, waking up to find Will watching her with tender affection. Edward is shocked as both women hurriedly start gathering plates, a flurry of activity that doesn't go unnoticed. Will and Edward exchange smiles, understanding that the women desire this moment to unfold in its entirety. However, Edward’s expression shifts to one of anger and disbelief as he averts his gaze. Meanwhile, Will is busy cleaning leaves from the pool, whose surface is now overgrown with a layer of algae and slime. A sudden, unexpected ripple under the water startles him, causing him to drop the pole with a splash. He looks around quickly, relieved that no one witnessed his moment of clumsiness.\n\nInside, the scene transitions as the doors swing open to reveal Sandra, Will, and Josephine, all standing in front of a cluttered storeroom. It is packed with unfinished projects, remnants of old products that Edward once sold, and pieces of furniture like a roll-top desk accompanied by metal file cabinets. Sandra lets out a nostalgic sound as she sifts through a pile of old files, eventually handing Will a yellowed telegram that stuns him into silence. As Sandra stands, Josephine tenderly kisses Will before following Sandra out. Will, still reeling from the shock, re-reads the telegram, his expression full of disbelief. Searching for a suitable place to set it down, he opts to tuck it into a mechanical hand perched on the desk, which unexpectedly clamps down on the paper.

          "description": "As Sandra steps outside to check the mail, she feels a flutter of hope, eagerly anticipating a letter from Edward. Her heart races when she spots a black car slowly pulling up to her driveway. She watches intently as two army officers step out, their somber expressions sending a wave of dread crashing over her. The moment she hears them deliver the tragic news, a cry escapes her lips, her emotions overwhelming her. Later, in a bid to distract herself, Sandra methodically hangs sheets on the line to dry, creating a tunnel-like pathway through the soft, billowing fabric. Each sheet is carefully secured, and as she bends down to pull a dress from the basket, a flicker of movement catches her eye. She pauses, peering up to see a shadow gently rippling across the pristine white cloth. Her heart skips a beat and she is momentarily paralyzed, the implications clear in her mind—it cannot possibly be him, for she knows Edward is gone. With a heavy heart, she turns away, yet her resolve strengthens as she resumes her task, deliberately hanging the dress and reaching for another item. When she glances up again, her breath catches in her throat—there stands Edward, seemingly alive and whole before her. Her mind reels in disbelief, but his hand reaches out, solid and real. Overcome with a rush of emotion, she doesn't hesitate to kiss him, accepting the impossible reality. In the intimacy of their bed, a man's hand tenderly traces the curves of a woman's back, moments before she rolls over, awakening to find Will gazing at her. Meanwhile, Edward is taken aback as the two women, acting with urgency, skillfully gather plates. A shared understanding passes between Will and Edward, their smiles betraying their contentment with this moment. However, a flicker of anger and disbelief clouds Edward's expression as he diverts his gaze, observing Will as he diligently attempts to clear leaves from the pool, which has become a dense, green quagmire of algae and slime. As Will maneuvers the pole with care, a sudden ripple beneath the water surface startles him, causing the pole to slip from his grasp and splash into the water. He quickly looks around, relieved to find no witnesses to his blunder. Moments later, the doors swing open, revealing Sandra, Will, and Josephine as they peer into a storeroom teeming with the remnants of Edward's past ventures—unfinished projects piled haphazardly, forgotten products he once sold, a roll-top desk reigning over the clutter, and metal file cabinets standing guard. As Sandra rifles through a file, a sound of recognition escapes her, sparking a memory. She passes a yellowed telegram to Will, whose eyes widen in shock upon reading its contents. Rising from her seat, Sandra moves gracefully as Josephine leans in to kiss Will before trailing after her mother. Will remains, his mind racing as he rereads the telegram, unable to fully grasp its implications. Searching for a suitable place to set it, he opts to tuck it into the grip of a mechanical hand on the desk, which clamps down with finality. The camera tightens its focus on the telegram just as Edward's voice emerges from the past, his presence vivid in memory. On a platform, Edward confidently pitches a new product to an attentive crowd, turning to kiss his pregnant wife goodbye, their love still shining brightly."

Later, Luna strings lights to flicker, creating a corridor of illumination, and as she pulls a scarf from the crate, she glances up and notices a bird flitting across the blue sky. She pauses, knowing it can't be Rex—he's missing—and pivots away, but with resolve, she strings the scarf and gathers another. Looking up once more, she sees Derek himself standing near her, and gasps in astonishment, but his smile is tangible, so she embraces him without delay. Beneath the blankets, a cat’s tail sways over a child's foot, then he turns over on the rug, waking up to Molly cheering him. Derek is puzzled as both children hurriedly arrange toys, and Molly and Derek laugh, understanding the children invited this. Derek glances aside, frustrated and perplexed, as Molly collects feathers from the fountain, but the fountain is cluttered with petals and dust. A sudden surface shimmer surprises Molly, who drops the net into the fountain and peers around, relieved no one noticed. The windows swing open to present Luna, Molly, and Benjamin gazing into a workshop, filled with incomplete inventions, old tools Derek crafted, a sewing machine, and wooden storage boxes. Luna makes a sound of recognition while handling a journal and hands Molly a crumpled postcard, which amazes her. Luna rises and Benjamin hugs Molly before tailing her, while she re-reads the postcard in uncertainty. Searching for a spot to place it, she slides it into a robotic claw on the table, which grips it tightly. The lens zooms in on the postcard as Derek's voice begins as a recollection, where on a stage Derek demonstrates an old gadget to an audience and hugs his expectant partner goodbye, still adoring."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

          "description": "Sandra anxiously awaits a letter from Edward when two army officers deliver distressing news, causing her to cry. Later, as Sandra hangs laundry, she sees a shadow she assumes can't be Edward, but then he appears, and she embraces him. In bed, she wakes to find Will beside her, sharing a smile with Edward, who appears upset while cleaning the overgrown pool. A ripple startles Will, but he regains composure. Sandra and Josephine show Will a storeroom with Edward's unfinished projects. Sandra hands Will a shocking telegram, leaving him in disbelief. He places it in a mechanical hand, which clamps down on it, while Edward's voice recalls pitching a product and kissing his pregnant wife goodbye."
