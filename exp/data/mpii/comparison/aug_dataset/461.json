The boat and Fezzik, with Buttercup being deposited on the deck. Inigo points behind them. Vizzini ties Buttercup's hands. The boat at dawn is being followed closely by the black sailboat, which we can see for the first time is being sailed by a Man in Black, and his boat almost seems to be flying. And once he's said the name, they rise straight up, sheer from the water, impossibly high, in a wild race for the Cliffs, and the Man in Black is closing faster than ever, but not fast enough, the lead was too great to overcome, and as Inigo sails with great precision straight at the Cliffs, Fezzik reaches up along the cliff face, grabs a jutting rock, reaches behind it. Suddenly there is a thick rope in his hands. He drops back to the boat, gives the rope a freeing swing, and the rope goes all the way to the top. He straps a harness to him, then lifts Buttercup and Vizzini in the harness. Finally, he himself gets in the harness. All three are strapped to Fezzik like papooses, and he starts to ascend the rope, carrying them all along with him as he goes. The Man in Black is sailing in toward the Cliffs of Insanity, watching as Fezzik rises swiftly through the first moments of dawn. Fezzik's group is only faintly visible far below. This is the first time we've gotten the real vertigo feeling, and it's a gasper. Fezzik climbing on. Buttercup is almost out of her mind with fear. Fezzik is moving right along; however high they are, he's already over a third of the way done. The Man in Black leaps from his ship to the rope, starting to climb. He's impossibly far behind, but the way he goes you'd think he didn't know that because he is flying up the rope, hand over hand like lightning. He prods Fezzik, who nods, and increases his pace. The Man in Black is roaring up the rope, cutting deeply into Fezzik's lead, and his arms begin moving much more slowly. Vizzini and the others are getting too close now. The Man in Black is less than a hundred feet behind them. Vizzini leaps off, takes out a knife, and begins to cut the rope, which is tied around a great rock, while Inigo helps the Princess to her feet and Fezzik just stands around, waiting for someone to tell him to do something.",

We're back in the vessel. Buttercup is paddling water. And we're back where we were at the final moment we observed her, Buttercup immobilized, the Screeching Eel, jaws open, about to bite down as we see a colossal limb pummeling the Eel insensible in one motion, then effortlessly elevating Buttercup. The vessel and Fezzik, with Buttercup being placed on the deck. Inigo indicates behind them. Vizzini binds Buttercup's hands. The ship at dawn is being pursued closely by the dark yacht, which we can perceive for the initial time is being navigated by a Man in Black, and his craft almost seems to be gliding. And once he's uttered the designation, they elevate straight up, steep from the water, impossibly elevated, in a frantic race for the Cliffs, and the Man in Black is approaching quicker than ever, but not swift enough, the advantage was too vast to surmount, and as Inigo navigates with great accuracy straight at the Cliffs, Fezzik reaches up along the precipice face, grabs a projecting stone, reaches behind it. Unexpectedly there is a thick cord in his hands. He descends back to the vessel, gives the cord a liberating swing, and the cord extends all the way to the summit. He fastens a harness to him, then lifts Buttercup and Vizzini in the harness. Finally, he himself gets in the harness. All three are fastened to Fezzik like infants, and he begins to ascend the cord, conveying them all along with him as he proceeds. The Man in Black is navigating toward the Cliffs of Insanity, observing as Fezzik elevates rapidly through the initial moments of dawn. Fezzik's group is only faintly visible far beneath. This is the initial time we've gotten the genuine dizziness sensation, and it's a breath-taker. Fezzik climbing on. Buttercup is almost out of her senses with terror. Fezzik is progressing right along; however elevated they are, he's already over a third of the way finished. The Man in Black jumps from his vessel to the cord, commencing to climb. He's impossibly far behind, but the way he proceeds you'd think he didn't know that because he is soaring up the cord, hand over hand like lightning. He urges Fezzik, who nods, and quickens his tempo. The Man in Black is roaring up the cord, carving deeply into Fezzik's lead, and his arms begin progressing much more gradually. Vizzini and the others are getting too near now. The Man in Black is less than a hundred feet behind them. Vizzini leaps off, takes out a dagger, and begins to sever the cord, which is fastened around a great stone, while Inigo assists the Princess to her feet and Fezzik just stands around, awaiting someone to tell him to do something."

And we're back where we were at the last moment we saw her, Buttercup frozen, the Shrieking Eel, jaws wide, about to clamp down as a giant arm is seen pounding the Eel unconscious in one move, then Buttercup is easily lifted. The boat and Fezzik deposit Buttercup on the deck. Behind them, Inigo points. Buttercup's hands are tied by Vizzini. At dawn, the boat closely follows the black sailboat, which we can see for the first time a Man in Black sails, and it almost seems as though his boat is flying. And once the name is said by him, they rise straight up, sheer from the water, impossibly high, in a wild race for the Cliffs, and faster than ever the Man in Black closes, but not fast enough; too great was the lead to overcome, and as Inigo sails with great precision straight at the Cliffs, a jutting rock is grabbed by Fezzik along the cliff face, reaching behind it. Suddenly, a thick rope is in his hands. Back to the boat he drops, and a freeing swing is given to the rope by him, and all the way to the top it goes. A harness is strapped to him, then Buttercup and Vizzini are lifted in the harness by him. Finally, he himself climbs in the harness. All three are strapped to Fezzik like papooses, and up the rope he starts to ascend, carrying them all along with him as he goes. Toward the Cliffs of Insanity, the Man in Black is sailing, watching as Fezzik swiftly rises through the first moments of dawn. Only faintly visible far below is Fezzik's group. This is the first time the real vertigo feeling has been gotten by us, and it's a gasper. Climbing on, Fezzik is. Buttercup is almost out of her mind with fear. Right along, Fezzik is moving; however high they are, already over a third of the way he is done. From his ship, the Man in Black leaps to the rope, starting to climb. Impossibly far behind he is, but the way he goes you'd think he didn't know that because the rope is being flown up by him, hand over hand like lightning. Fezzik is prodded by him, who nods and increases his pace. Up the rope the Man in Black is roaring, deeply cutting into Fezzik's lead, and much more slowly his arms begin moving. Too close now, Vizzini and the others are getting. Less than a hundred feet behind them, the Man in Black is. Off, Vizzini leaps, takes out a knife, and begins to cut the rope, which he ties around a great rock, while the Princess is helped to her feet by Inigo and Fezzik just stands around, waiting for someone to tell him to do something."

Suddenly, we witness a massive arm delivering a powerful, well-aimed blow, rendering the Eel unconscious in a single, decisive move, and then effortlessly lifting Buttercup from the water. The boat and Fezzik are present, with Buttercup being gently placed upon the deck by the giant. Inigo points behind them, indicating something of great importance. Vizzini proceeds to tie Buttercup's hands securely with rope.

His Grandfather remains silent, simply waiting in the room. The scene shifts back to the boat, where Buttercup is treading water, her movements steady yet anxious. We return to the exact moment we last saw her, with Buttercup frozen in fear as the Shrieking Eel, its jaws wide open, prepares to strike. Suddenly, a giant arm comes crashing down, delivering a powerful blow that renders the Eel unconscious in a single, decisive move. With ease, the arm lifts Buttercup from the water and deposits her safely onto the deck of the boat. Fezzik stands there, having completed the rescue, while Inigo points behind them, drawing attention to the approaching threat. Vizzini quickly ties Buttercup's hands, securing her as the boat sails on. As dawn breaks, the black sailboat follows closely behind, and for the first time, we see that it is being sailed by a mysterious Man in Black. His boat seems to defy gravity, almost flying across the water. As he utters a name, the boat rises sharply from the water, soaring impossibly high in a wild race toward the Cliffs. The Man in Black closes the distance with remarkable speed, but the lead is too great to overcome. Inigo expertly navigates the boat straight at the Cliffs, while Fezzik reaches up along the cliff face, his hand finding a jutting rock. He reaches behind it and suddenly has a thick rope in his grasp. Dropping back to the boat, he swings the rope with a freeing motion, sending it all the way to the top of the cliff. He then straps a harness to himself, lifts Buttercup and Vizzini into the harness, and finally secures himself. All three are now strapped to Fezzik like papooses, and he begins to ascend the rope, carrying them upward with each powerful movement. Meanwhile, the Man in Black sails toward the Cliffs of Insanity, his eyes fixed on Fezzik's group, which is barely visible far below. This is the first time the true vertigo of the climb is felt, a breathtaking moment as Fezzik continues his ascent. Buttercup is nearly out of her mind with fear, but Fezzik moves steadily, already over a third of the way up. The Man in Black leaps from his ship to the rope, beginning his climb with astonishing speed. Despite being impossibly far behind, he climbs as if unaware of the distance, his hands moving up the rope with lightning speed. He prods Fezzik, who acknowledges the prompt with a nod and quickens his pace. The Man in Black races up the rope, rapidly closing the gap, but Fezzik's arms begin to slow as the strain takes its toll. Vizzini and the others are now perilously close to the top. The Man in Black is less than a hundred feet behind them when Vizzini leaps off, draws a knife, and starts cutting the rope tied around a great rock.

The boat at dawn is being followed closely by the black sailboat which we can see for the first time is being sailed by a Man in Black and his boat almost seems to be flying. And once he is said the name they rise straight up sheer from the water impossibly high in a wild race for the Cliffs and the Man in Black is closing faster than ever but not fast enough. the lead was too great to overcome and as Inigo sails with great precision straight at the Cliffs Fezzik reaches up along the cliff face grabs a jutting rock reaches behind it. Suddenly there is a thick rope in his hands. He drops back to the boat gives the rope a freeing swing and the rope goes all the way to the top.

This is the first time we have gotten the real vertigo feeling and it is a gasper. Fezzik climbing on Buttercup is almost out of her mind with fear. Fezzik is moving right along however high they are. he is already over a third of the way done. The Man in Black leaps from his ship to the rope starting to climb. He is impossibly far behind but the way he goes you would think he did not know that because he is flying up the rope hand over hand like lightning. He prods Fezzik who nods and increases his pace.

We're back on the train. Daffodil is paddling air. And we're back where we were at the last instant we glimpsed her, Daffodil frozen, the Howling Whale, mouth closed, about to chomp down as we observe a massive wing swatting the Whale asleep in one motion, then effortlessly hoisting Daffodil. The train and Hector, with Daffodil being placed on the platform. Eduardo gestures in front of them. Lorenzo wraps Daffodil's ankles. The train at midnight is being chased lazily by the white submarine, which we can perceive for the first time is being piloted by a Tiger in Blue, and his submarine almost seems to be drifting. And once he's whispered the word, they dive straight down, smooth into the clouds, surprisingly deep, in a calm sprint for the Caves, and the Tiger in Blue is lagging slower than ever, but not slow enough, the gap was too small to widen, and as Eduardo drifts with little accuracy straight at the Caves, Hector reaches down along the cave wall, catches a hanging vine, reaches in front of it. Abruptly there is a thin ladder in his paws. He springs forward to the train, tosses the ladder a tangled toss, and the ladder stretches all the way to the base. He belts a pouch to him, then raises Daffodil and Lorenzo in the pouch. Finally, he himself squeezes in the pouch. All three are clasped to Hector like backpacks, and he begins to descend the ladder, hauling them all along with him as he descends. The Tiger in Blue is drifting in away from the Caves of Lunacy, observing as Hector descends slowly through the last moments of midnight. Hector's team is only vaguely visible far above. This is the last time we've had the false excitement sensation, and it's a sleeper. Hector descending away. Daffodil is almost calm with calmness. Hector is pausing right here; however low they are, he's hardly over half of the journey complete. The Tiger in Blue dives from his plane to the ladder, pausing to slide. He's surprisingly close ahead, but the way he rests you'd think he didn't notice that because he is swimming down the ladder, foot under foot like thunder. He taps Hector, who waves, and decreases his speed. The Tiger in Blue is whispering down the ladder, adding slightly to Hector's gap, and his feet begin resting much more quickly. Lorenzo and the others are getting too distant now. The Tiger in Blue is more than two hundred yards ahead of them. Lorenzo pauses on, puts away a fork, and pauses to break the ladder, which is wrapped around a tiny tree, while Eduardo hinders the Turtle to his head and Hector simply sits down, ignoring everyone to tell him to ignore something."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

On the boat, Buttercup treads water as a Shrieking Eel approaches, but Fezzik knocks it unconscious and lifts her aboard. Inigo points as Vizzini ties Buttercup's hands. As dawn breaks, they're pursued by a Man in Black on a fast black sailboat. Inigo expertly sails towards the Cliffs of Insanity. Fezzik uses a rope to ascend the cliffs with Buttercup and Vizzini strapped to him. The Man in Black, undeterred, leaps from his boat and rapidly climbs the rope, quickly narrowing the gap. Vizzini attempts to cut the rope as Inigo assists Buttercup, while Fezzik waits for instructions."
