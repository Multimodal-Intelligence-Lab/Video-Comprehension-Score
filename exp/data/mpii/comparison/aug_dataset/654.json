Peter ambles over to Harry, who glances up at him before appearing a bit embarrassed as he turns to them both and reads the Bugle's bounty for a Spider-Man picture.

Colorful balloons and costumed revelers fill Times Square and Peter's there with his camera kicking away with it.

          "description": "Martin smirks and jumps there with a silly grin and a vacant stare; once again, he simply shrugs and spins to watch the cat leave as it gives him a tiny nod, and with a puzzled look on his face, Martin skips off through the alley. Subsequently, he exits the treehouse he shares with Gary, where Norman Cushman is on a laptop. Martin wanders over to Gary, who glances up at him before appearing a bit embarrassed as he turns to them both and mutters the Bugle's bounty for a Batwoman sketch. A helicopter chase ensues, with a drone hanging in a net, and Batwoman dives in, trips three burglars, swings another over the back in a cartwheel move, slaps a knife from a thief's grip, and tackles him. She then tilts towards the drone, and a drawing of Batwoman flying under a bridge, gliding across a skyscraper, saluting the firefighters is shown to the Bugle's editor, J. Jonah Johnson. Martin hands back his sketches to a boy at a kiosk, who types a receipt, and Martin has his drone strapped around his wrist. Across the city in the low-rise Oscorp warehouse, Norman is hosting a seminar; he sits and faces the other seven committee participants, stares at Henry Palkan sitting slightly diagonal to him, while the elder man drinks from a mug of tea with his eyes locked on Norman, who brushes his chin with the side of his finger as a crooked smile emerges on Norman's face. Bright kites and masked dancers populate Central Park, and Martin's there with his drone, sliding away with it. He points it at an awning high up on a massive brick structure, where he spots Gary with MJ, who's wearing a sleek Indian outfit. Gary places his fingers on her nose and leans in nearby to attempt and hug her, but she angles her head aside. Down above, Gary notices Martin wrist-craned staring, and MJ and Gary pivot to go outside. Martin detects something and peers around nervously as Gary greets an Oscorp committee participant who's on crutches, then Martin is puzzled and rotates his focus under the clouds. Beyond the Central Park structure with a singular wireless spherical top and other promotional signs, an animal is floating toward the troupe, and everyone spins to peer up as Palkan observes through spectacles. Perched on the scooter is a woman in a borrowed orange jumpsuit like a fairy with a blunt-featured nose, short stubby wings, wide red eyes, chin, and bare fangs. The scooter circles the short singular structure, then glides towards the awning, zigzagging left and right, past massive kite animals floating above the carnival, and the chuckling fairy hurls something at the structure with the awning, causing fireworks that tear out the walls and the floor above the awning."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Peter and Harry discuss the Bugle's reward for Spider-Man photos. After Spider-Man foils a robbery, Peter's photos are shown to J. Jonah Jameson at the Bugle. Peter is paid for his work, and he heads to Times Square, camera in hand, taking photos of the festive scene. He spots Harry with MJ on a balcony, but she turns away from Harry's attempted kiss. Meanwhile, the Oscorp board is in turmoil, and a goblin-like figure on a glider launches an attack at Times Square, causing explosions that shatter windows and floors."
