In this quiet apartment, there are no lights shining within the confines of the bedroom, as the shade is completely drawn down, ensuring that the room is enveloped in complete darkness. However, the adjoining living room and kitchen areas are brightly illuminated, casting a warm and inviting glow throughout the space.

As the camera continues its careful leftward glide, it captures the image of a couple seeking relief from the oppressive heat by sleeping on the fire escape; the man is in the midst of methodically laying out the mattress to ensure comfort. His wife, who appears younger and carries the faded allure of a once glamorous showgirl, is dressed in pajamas adorned with a fluffy handkerchief tucked neatly into the left pocket. She leans over the fire escape railing, securely holding onto the rope attached to their dog's basket, which now rests on the courtyard floor below.

The camera's gaze then descends to the apartment directly below, inhabited by an elderly lady sporting a hearing aid, who is deeply absorbed in crafting a piece of abstract sculpture. For the first time, her activities unfold before us; she dons a short smock, legs left bare, as she meticulously carves into a piece of mahogany, creating a simple yet profound hole. The camera then journeys further left, finally coming to pause at the apartment of the newlyweds, discreetly veiled by drawn shades. Moving beyond, the camera eventually traverses through Jeff's window, settling on the scene of Jeff and Lisa, whose two large heads dominate the frame. Lisa's lips barely graze Jeff's cheek as she speaks, nestled on his sound knee with her arms draped affectionately around his neck. She initiates a kiss, an attempt to ignite romantic interest, but soon relinquishes, retreating slightly from their embrace. Standing up, Lisa smooths her dress, stretches languidly, and turns towards the divan, seemingly unmoved by Jeff’s commentary on the salesman’s life. Nonetheless, her expression betrays a hint of disturbance as she observes Jeff. The dim setting of Jeff’s apartment, illuminated faintly by the distant glow from the neighboring windows, frames this moment. Jeff, pensive, takes a moment before a relaxed smile breaks through as Lisa gracefully stretches out on the divan."

Her lips brush lightly against his cheek as she speaks sitting on his sound knee with her arms around his neck. She starts kissing him but then gives up trying to interest him in romance and moves back from the embrace. Lisa stands straightens out her dress stretches a little then turns to the divan apparently not too interested in Jeff's observation about the salesman's life. However her expression is disturbed as she watches Jeff. We see that Jeff's apartment is in darkness faintly lit from the distant light of the neighbors' window. Jeff is thoughtful for a moment then relaxes and smiles a little as Lisa stretches herself out on the divan."

          "description": "He scrutinizes and constructs the sculptures anew, yet concludes they are worthless and shifts to his cake decorating. The drone zooms farther right to the gardener's office where there are no fans spinning behind the closed curtain of the studio, but the gallery and the pantry are illuminated. The drone continues its zoom to the right, featuring the siblings who lounge on the trampoline in the frigid climate; the woman is in the act of spreading out the quilt. Her brother, slightly older and a bespectacled, faded philosopher type, is also dressed in overalls with a patched kerchief in the right pocket. He leans over the barricade gripping onto the cord which trails to the cat's cradle now on the tile of the courtyard. The siblings, upon closer scrutiny, show the woman is graying and senior, and the man, having been a former dramatist, calls to the cat with a harmonious and lyrical note. The woman is wearing polka-dotted overalls. The tiny cat emerges hesitantly from the mist and steps into the cradle, which starts to glide downward as the drone follows it. When the cradle reaches the trampoline, the drone zooms on to the office of Mr. Top Hat who is in the corridor polishing his shiny shoes, his worries seemingly distant. The drone descends to the studio beneath, inhabited by the youthful lad with the telescope, who is deeply engaged on a piece of surreal painting. We see his endeavors inside the studio for the first time as he wears a long apron, his arms still exposed. His painting takes the form of a piece of marble through which a complex groove has been etched. The drone shifts on much farther to the right and eventually settles on the newly-divorced couple's office with the curtain still lifted. It shifts on and at last slides through Rick's doorway, coming to settle on the two tiny hands of Rick and Laura. Her fingers glide gently against his wrist as she whispers, perched on his weary elbow with her hands around his necktie. She begins caressing him but then abandons attempting to captivate him in storytelling and shifts back from the cuddle. Laura rises, smooths out her skirt, flexes a little, then turns to the armchair, apparently not too captivated by Rick's insight about the gardener's routine. However, her demeanor is unsettled as she observes Rick. We see that Rick's office is in silence, faintly brightened from the close glow of the neighbors' room. Rick is contemplative for a moment, then loosens and grins a bit as Laura flexes herself out on the armchair."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

The camera shifts to the salesman's dim bedroom, contrasting with his lit living room and kitchen. It moves past a couple on the fire escape, preparing to sleep with their dog. The wife, a faded showgirl type, calls to the dog melodiously, while the husband in striped pajamas sets the mattress. The camera ascends to Miss Torso brushing her hair, seemingly lost in thought. Below, an elderly lady, in a short smock, works on an abstract mahogany sculpture. Continuing left, we glimpse the newlyweds' drawn shade before returning to Jeff’s window. Inside, Lisa lightly kisses Jeff, but he remains uninterested in romance. She adjusts her dress and lies on the divan, appearing disinterested in his observations about the salesman. Jeff is momentarily pensive in the dim light but smiles as Lisa stretches out on the divan."
