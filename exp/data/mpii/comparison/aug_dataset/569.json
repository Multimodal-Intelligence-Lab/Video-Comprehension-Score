Edwards merely gazes, captivated, but Kay seizes him by the limb and rushes him onward. Within, there are heaps of advanced-appearing gadgets arrayed on ledges and countertops. Edwards selects a tiny amber orb from one of the ledges. They exit the chamber. On the main level, they stride swiftly across the space, approaching a vast display on the distant partition. The display exhibits a chart of the planet on which innumerable minuscule lights flicker in all regions of the earth, log strings of statistics flickering adjacent to them. On the displays, we observe real-time visuals of extraterrestrials. Angular digits. Edwards, astonished, glances at Kay as 4-Eyes propels her onto the display: Severe visage, feline spectacles. Zed, who was standing near to the display, proceeds over to Edwards, appraising him. Zed's voice echoes over. Edwards extends outward and unseals a pale storage unit, disclosing a dark attire suspended from a hook in the center. On the base, a set of gleaming black footwear. Kay is at a computing station. On display are Edwards's birth record, driving permit, social security identification, library identification, everything. Zed's voice resumes. Edwards stands in a confined white cubicle. He holds both his hands on a ten-digit keypad, pressing down firmly. The pad glows crimson, a scorching noise emanates from his hands, and he winces as more lasers promptly and (not at all) painlessly modify his fingerprints. One by one, Kay erases Edwards's identity identifications. On the computing display is Edwards' complete name -- James Darrel Edwards III. Kay taps a couple keys, and the cursor begins to traverse from right to left, commencing to obliterate the rightmost letters of Edwards's name. More letters are obliterated from his appellation. A necktie shoved upward. Appearing sleek and attractive in his exceedingly sharp attire, James D Edwards III -- or, rather, Jay -- steps into the portal from the storage area. He slips on the shades. The elder gentleman (Rosenberg) is bearing a feline and an elaborate rosewood trinket container. Delicately, he places the container down and affectionately positions the feline atop it while he secures all five bolts on the portal to his unique shop. A fold of epidermis, now becoming gray and crusty with age, suspends from Edgar's throat as he sits in the front of his Orkin vehicle. Across the thoroughfare, Edgar notices a diminutive, older gentleman emerge from one of the trinket shops on Thirty-Fifth Street. That completed, he lifts the feline, then the container, then waddles off down the thoroughfare, one under each limb."

Edwards finds himself captivated by the scene, perhaps caught in the novelty or complexity of the exchange, but his moment of wonder is abruptly cut short as Kay firmly grasps his arm, prompting him to move forward with urgency. Inside the headquarters, they traverse a space cluttered with shelves and tabletops that hold an array of advanced and seemingly complex devices, each exuding an air of sophistication. Within this environment, Edwards reaches out and selects a small yellow ball from one of the shelves, examining it briefly before they proceed to exit the room. Once they reach the main floor, Edwards and Kay maintain a quick pace as they traverse the expanse of the room, their steps purposeful as they make their way towards a towering screen affixed to the far wall. This screen commands attention by displaying a detailed map of the world, with countless minuscule lights blinking persistently across various global locations, accompanied by rapid streams of data. Amidst these visuals, live images of aliens with bony fingers are visible, capturing Edwards's stunned attention as he turns to Kay for understanding. At the same time, 4-Eyes projects her formidable visage, complete with mean expression and distinctive cat glasses, onto the screen. Zed, having been positioned near the screen, approaches Edwards, assessing him with a discerning eye, while his voice echoes in the room. Edwards, responding to an implied or direct instruction, extends his hand to open a white locker, uncovering a meticulously hung black suit and a pair of glossy black shoes beneath it. Meanwhile, Kay is stationed at a computer terminal where the screen displays Edwards's complete array of identity documents, including his birth certificate, driver's license, social security card, and library card, as Zed's narrative continues. Moments later, Edwards finds himself standing in a confined white booth, where he places his hands firmly onto a ten-fingered keypad. He applies pressure as the pad illuminates in red, accompanied by a sharp sound that seems to emanate from his hands, and he winces as lasers swiftly and efficiently alter his fingerprints in a manner that is discomforting, yet devoid of pain. At the computer terminal, Kay systematically deletes each of Edwards's identity cards, while the monitor prominently displays his full name—James Darrel Edwards III. With decisive keystrokes, Kay initiates a process where the cursor methodically erases the letters of Edwards's name from right to left, until the name is progressively reduced. Following this transformation, he adjusts his tie, ensuring it is perfectly aligned to complement his newly acquired, sharply tailored suit, and thereby establishing his fresh identity as Jay. He proceeds confidently from the locker room, completing his look with a pair of sunglasses, which he slides into place. Meanwhile, an older man identified as Rosenberg is depicted carrying both a cat and an ornate rosewood jewelry box. With care and attention, he places the box down and gently positions the cat on top of it, while simultaneously securing his distinctive shop by engaging all five locks on the door. Across the street, Edgar, seated in the front of his Orkin van, is characterized by a flap of skin on his neck, now showing signs of age as it becomes gray and crusty. Edgar's attention is captured by the sight of a short, older man emerging from one of the jewelry shops on Thirty-Fifth Street. Once the man completes his task, he gathers the cat first, followed by the jewelry box, and then waddles down the street, balancing each item under his arms."

Marcus grabs a tiny green cube from one of the benches. They exit the structure. In the front yard, they stroll leisurely across the grass, approaching a massive fountain on the distant edge. The fountain features a mural of the cosmos on which millions of glowing stars twinkle in all corners of the universe, streams of code scrolling above them. On the mural, we see real-time scenes of creatures. Feathered claws. Marcus, amazed, turns to Leo as Bright-Eyes transports him onto the mural: Stern gaze, dog monocle. Yana, who was seated far from the mural, strides over to Marcus, evaluating him. Yana's whisper floats over. Marcus extends an arm and unseals a silver cabinet, uncovering a gray robe hanging from a peg in the center. Below, a set of glossy red boots. Leo is at a hologram console. Displayed are Marcus's graduation diploma, pilot's badge, guild membership card, club pass, everything. Yana's whisper persists. Marcus waits in a tight silver booth. She rests both her feet on a thirteen-toed panel, stomping firmly. The panel glows blue, a humming sound resonates from her feet, and she winces as beams of light quickly and (entirely) comfortably modify her footprints. Gradually, Leo annihilates Marcus's certification papers. In the hologram view is Marcus's complete moniker -- Jonathan George Marcus IV. Leo taps a series of buttons, and the icon begins to glide from left to right, commencing to remove the leftmost letters of Marcus's identity. Additional letters vanish from her identity. A hat tilted down. Appearing sharp and dashing in her incredibly sleek robe, Jonathan G Marcus IV -- or, notably, Elle -- strides into the corridor from the cabinet area. She dons the monocle. The younger woman (Sullivan) is holding a rabbit and a delicate teak music box. Gently, she positions the box down and tenderly places the rabbit atop it while she secures all seven bolts on the door to her peculiar gallery.

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to.

Kay hurriedly guides him through the sophisticated equipment. On the main floor, they reach a giant screen displaying global activity and live alien images. Zed evaluates Edwards and presents him with a black suit. At a computer terminal, Kay deletes Edwards's identity, turning him into \"Jay,\" while he undergoes a painless fingerprint alteration in a booth. Now slick in his suit, Jay puts on his sunglasses. Meanwhile, an older man named Rosenberg, carrying a cat and a rosewood jewelry box, secures his shop before leaving. Across the street, Edgar, in his Orkin van, observes Rosenberg exiting the shop with the cat and box under each arm."
