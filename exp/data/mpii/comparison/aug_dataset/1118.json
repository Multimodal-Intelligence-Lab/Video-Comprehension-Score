Meanwhile, Ron, in a fit of frantic determination, waves his wand with all the desperation he can muster, only to have it snap in two, tragically rendering it useless. The vehicle, inexorably, heads straight towards an ancient willow tree, a towering, majestic presence that stands with authority within the expansive school grounds, and soon crashes into the topmost branches with alarming and frightening speed. Perched precariously high up in the sturdy tree, the car rocks dangerously, teetering at a perilously unstable angle, and eventually tumbles backwards, becoming lodged insecurely partway down. Ron helplessly holds up his now broken wand as the thick, powerful branches of the willow savagely assault the car, causing it to sway chaotically from side to side while the windshield shatters dramatically. A large branch smashes forcefully through the rear window, and branches assault them relentlessly from every direction, showering them with harsh shards of broken glass. Suddenly, the car tips forward unexpectedly, bouncing erratically from one branch to the next in a wild descent, and plummets towards the ground below, finally landing with a dull thud on the grass. Ron instinctively presses the accelerator pedal with urgency, and the car zooms away in a frantic retreat. The tree lunges after them with its grasping, vengeful branches, but they miraculously manage to evade its fierce clutches. As soon as they clear the menacing reach of the furious willow, the two boys breathe a huge sigh of relief. Out of nowhere, the car doors fling open violently, and they are thrown unceremoniously down onto the grass. The boot of the car pops open with a sudden jolt, ejecting their trunks and assorted luggage onto the ground in a scattered heap. Harry swiftly catches Hedwig's cage just in time, and Ron anxiously checks on the well-being of his pet rat. Without any warning, the car starts itself up again, the doors slamming shut with finality, and the battered vehicle drives away independently, navigating across the grass towards a nearby stone archway. Both Harry and Ron sprint after it in a vain attempt to catch up, but the car rolls confidently down a cobbled passageway, zooming off into the distance towards the forest, leaving them far behind. Later on, they laboriously haul their scattered luggage all the way into the grand school and abandon it temporarily on the landing before hurriedly dashing upstairs. At the top of the stairs, they unexpectedly encounter Filch, the ever-vigilant caretaker, who stands firmly with his ever-present, watchful cat, Mrs. Norris.

The root resembles an ugly, squalling baby as the students quickly cover their ears in anticipation. A boy faints dramatically as they pull out the obnoxiously screaming roots. Showing off recklessly, Draco Malfoy pokes his finger carelessly into his Mandrake's mouth, which promptly bites him; infuriated, he hurls it into a pot with annoyance. Later on, in the bustling corridor, the dignified ghost of Sir Nicolas floats serenely and effortlessly into the magnificent Great Hall, where students are seated at long wooden tables, while Ron is engaged in a futile attempt to mend his broken wand using sticky tape.

Amidst the chaos, Ron frantically waves his wand, attempting to cast a spell, but to his horror, the wand snaps in two. The car, now uncontrollable, speeds directly towards an ancient willow tree that looms ominously in the school grounds. With a sudden jolt, the car crashes into the top branches of the towering tree. High above the ground, the vehicle sways dangerously and begins to tilt backward, ultimately getting stuck precariously halfway down the tree. As the car rocks, Ron holds up his broken wand in disbelief while the thick branches of the willow furiously attack the car, causing it to shudder violently. The onslaught is relentless, and a massive branch smashes through the back window, sending shards of glass raining down upon them. The branches continue their assault from every side, further showering the interior with broken glass. Without warning, the car jerks forward, slipping off the branches, and bounces from branch to branch until it finally plummets toward the ground, landing with a thud on the grass. Reacting quickly, Ron slams his foot on the accelerator, and the car speeds away, narrowly escaping the grasping branches of the infuriated willow. Now clear of the tree's reach, the boys exhale in relief. But their respite is short-lived, as the car doors suddenly burst open and they are violently ejected onto the grass. The boot pops open, expelling their trunks and luggage in a flurry. Amidst the chaos, Harry manages to catch Hedwig's cage, while Ron gazes anxiously at his pet rat. Almost as if alive, the car starts up again, snapping its doors shut with determination, and drives itself purposefully across the grass, heading toward a stone archway.

Clad in a brown smock and a matching tall, pointed hat, she dons a pair of earmuffs, signaling an intriguing lesson ahead. Unveiling a peculiar plant, the root reveals itself to resemble a grotesque baby, prompting everyone to cover their ears in anticipation. As they extract the wailing roots, a boy succumbs to the overwhelming sound and collapses. Meanwhile, Draco Malfoy, seeking to impress, recklessly prods his Mandrake's mouth, only to be bitten savagely. Infuriated, he hurls the creature back into its pot with disdain. Later, in the corridor, the ghost of Sir Nicolas glides elegantly into the Great Hall, where students dine at long tables. Ron, oblivious to the commotion, struggles to repair his broken wand using sticky tape. Suddenly, a tatty gray owl swoops into the room, diving low over the tables and colliding with a bowl, sending crisps scattering in all directions. As Draco and his cronies laugh mockingly, Ron retrieves a red envelope from Errol's beak, his face flushed with apprehension. With trembling hands, Ron breaks the seal on the red envelope, and to his mortification, it erupts into a loud, scolding screech."

The car heads towards an ancient willow tree known as the Whomping Willow, a notoriously aggressive plant standing in the school grounds, and plunges onto the top branches. High in the tree, which was planted to guard a secret passage, the car rocks precariously and falls backwards, getting stuck halfway down. Ron holds up his broken wand as hefty willow branches, which move with a mind of their own, attack the car, causing the vehicle to rock and the windscreen to shatter. A branch smashes through the back window, and branches attack from all angles, showering them with broken glass. The car suddenly tips forward, bounces from branch to branch, and falls towards the ground, landing on the grass in the expansive grounds of Hogwarts. Ron presses the accelerator and the car zooms away, its enchantments still intact. The tree lunges after them, but they escape its clutching branches. Clear of the angry willow which continues to thrash wildly, the boys breathe a sigh of relief. Suddenly, the car doors fly open and they are hurled out onto the grass. The boot opens, throwing out their trunks and luggage, which are filled with wizarding robes and other magical supplies. Harry, whose full name is Harry Potter and is famous in the wizarding world for surviving an attack by the dark wizard Voldemort as a baby, catches Hedwig's cage, and Ron peers anxiously at his pet rat, Scabbers, who hides nervously in his pocket.

Harry and Ron race after it as it rolls down a cobbled passageway and zooms away towards the Forbidden Forest, leaving Ron and Harry far behind to watch it disappear among the dense, enchanted trees. Later, they haul their luggage into Hogwarts School, famous for its seven floors and numerous hidden passages, and leave it on the landing before running upstairs. Filch, the caretaker known for his dislike of students, with his cat Mrs. Norris, who is remarkably perceptive, is standing at the top of the stairs. Hogwarts School is housed in a handsome castle surrounded by stone outbuildings and long Victorian greenhouses where students learn Herbology. In one of these, a class of students stands waiting around a long bench filled with rows of potted plants as a short, plump woman with curly, gray hair, Professor Sprout, the Herbology teacher, enters wearing a pair of earmuffs. The root, a Mandrake used for its restorative properties, looks like an ugly baby as they cover their ears to protect from its fatal cry. A boy collapses as they pull out the screaming roots. Showing off, Draco Malfoy, the son of a wealthy and influential family, pokes his finger into his Mandrake's mouth and it bites him; furious, he throws it into a pot. Later, in the corridor, the ghost of Sir Nicolas, who is also known as Nearly Headless Nick due to his partially severed neck, floats into the Great Hall where the students are sitting at long tables while Ron is trying unsuccessfully to mend his broken wand with sticky tape, which is not effective for magical repairs. A boy takes a photograph as a tatty gray owl flies down into the room, swooping low over the table towards Ron but colliding with a bowl and scattering crisps everywhere. Draco and his cronies, members of Slytherin House known for their rivalry with Ron's house, Gryffindor, snigger as Ron takes a red envelope known as a Howler from Errol's beak.

          "description": "The bicycle glides directly towards the ocean as they both juggle with the paintbrush and Tim tosses his shoe frantically, but it crumbles. The bicycle glides towards an ancient mushroom standing in the park and plunges onto the upper petals. High on the mushroom, the bicycle sways precariously and tumbles backward, getting snagged midway down. Tim holds up his ruined shoe as hefty mushroom caps pummel the bicycle, causing the vehicle to sway and the headlight to shatter. A cap smashes through the rear window, and caps assault from all directions, showering them with glass fragments. The bicycle suddenly flips forward, bounces from petal to petal, and descends towards the ocean, landing on the sand. Tim taps the bell and the bicycle zooms away. The mushroom lunges after them, but they dodge its grasping caps. Free from the furious mushroom, the kids breathe a sigh of relief. Abruptly, the bicycle seats eject, and they are tossed onto the sand. The basket opens, ejecting their bags and backpacks. Jack catches Snowball's kennel, and Tim examines worriedly at his pet hamster. The bicycle ignites, the seats recline, and the dented bicycle rides itself across the sand towards a wooden gazebo. Jack and Tim sprint after it as it rolls down a brick walkway and zooms away towards the grove, leaving Tim and Jack far behind. Later, they drag their backpacks into class and leave them on the desk before sprinting upstairs. Smudge, the janitor, with his parrot Mrs. Polly, is perching at the top of the ladder. Oakwoods School is situated in a majestic mansion surrounded by wooden sheds and long Victorian gardens. In one of these, a bunch of pickpockets stands waiting around a long table filled with rows of potted berries as a tall, skinny gentleman with curly, black hair in a yellow overcoat and a matching tiny, square hat enters wearing a pair of spectacles. The fruit looks like a strange toddler as they cover their eyes. A girl faints as they yank out the shrieking fruit. Boasting, Connor Maloney pokes his elbow into his Parsnip's mouth and it licks him; angry, he drops it into a jar. Later, in the alley, the spirit of Lady Caroline drifts into the Dining Hall where the pickpockets are seated at long counters while Tim is attempting unsuccessfully to fix his ruined shoe with duct tape. A girl captures a snapshot as a scruffy white bat swoops down into the hall, gliding low over the counter toward Tim but knocking into a cup and scattering candies everywhere. Connor and his lackeys giggle as Tim takes a blue package from Zeke's claw. Tim cautiously opens the seal on the blue package, and to his shame, it commences to yell at him."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Crashing into an ancient willow tree, the car precariously rocks, then gets stuck and attacked by branches, shattering the windscreen. As it tips forward, the car bounces from branch to branch before landing on the grass.

Later, they drag their belongings into Hogwarts, encountering Filch and Mrs. Norris. At a greenhouse, students gather around potted plants led by a short, plump woman in earmuffs, handling roots resembling ugly babies. Draco Malfoy toys with a Mandrake, getting bitten. In the Great Hall, Ron tries to fix his wand. A tatty owl crashes, scattering crisps, and delivers a red envelope. Ron nervously opens it, and it screams at him, drawing Draco and his friends' mockery."
