Then a wild look hits Inigo. Yellin enters and kneels, showing the key dangling from a chain around his neck. Just at that moment, Buttercup enters, and the Prince looks at her blankly for a moment. Buttercup stares at Humperdinck. With that, he whirls, turns on The Machine, and shoves the lever all the way up. There has never been such pain. A few children pale and bolt toward their parents. The Albino appears wheeling a barrow as Inigo's sword pushes at his chest.

Then a wild expression hits Inigo. Yellin enters and kneels, displaying the key hanging from a chain around his neck. Just at that instant, Buttercup enters, and the Prince gazes at her blankly for a moment. Buttercup stares at Humperdinck. With that, he spins, activates The Machine, and pushes the lever entirely upward. There has never been such agony. A few children blanch and dash toward their parents. The Albino appears wheeling a cart as Inigo's blade presses at his torso. The Albino shakes his head, says nothing, and Fezzik smashes the Albino on the top of the head as if he had a mallet and was driving in a peg. The Albino collapses without a sound. Inigo kneels, the blade held tight between his hands, eyes shut, facing the grove of trees, beginning to speak with a low and peculiar voice.

Then Inigo is hit by a wild look. Yellin enters, kneeling and showing the key dangling from a chain around his neck. Just at that moment, Buttercup enters, and a blank look is given to her by the Prince for a moment. Humperdinck is stared at by Buttercup. With that, he whirls, turns on The Machine, and the lever is shoved all the way up by him. Such pain has never been felt. A few children pale and bolt toward their parents. Inigo's sword pushes at the Albino's chest as he appears wheeling a barrow. His head is shaken by the Albino, and nothing is said by him, so the Albino is crunched on the top of the head by Fezzik as if he had a hammer and was driving in a nail. Without a sound, the Albino drops. The sword is held tight between his hands by Inigo as he kneels, eyes closed, facing the grove of trees, and a low and strange voice is used by him to start talking. Now he rises, eyes still closed, as he walks forward, holding the great sword in his hands. Close behind follows Fezzik, frightened, walking blind through the grove of trees. The Secret Knot is moved to by Inigo, he hesitates, then past it moves, then stops. He stands frozen for a long moment, then suddenly whirls, eyes still closed, driving the sword dead center into a knot, and nothing happens. He has failed. In utter despair, a collapse against the tree occurs from him, against a knot in the tree, against the knot in the tree, which slides away, revealing the staircase. A look is exchanged between Fezzik and Inigo, then they start down to Westley, who is dead by The Machine. Over him, Fezzik leans, listening for a heartbeat, then looking at Inigo and shaking his head. Just sagging for a moment, terribly excited, he looks stronger than they've yet seen him, desperately fighting for control. In despair is Inigo, in the Pit, as before. The door is approached and knocked on by them. If Mel Brooks' 2000 Year Old Man was really old, this guy would resemble him. Again, the window is shut as Inigo pounds. On the door, they rap.

Shortly thereafter, he places him back into the cold water before promptly submerging him into the hot once more. Suddenly, a wild expression emerges on Inigo’s face.

Nearby, two large tubs sit side by side, one filled with steaming hot water, the other with icy cold water. Fezzik, without uttering a single word, takes hold of Inigo's head and thrusts it into the tub of icy water. He keeps it submerged for what he deems a reasonable amount of time before extracting Inigo's head, allowing him a brief moment to catch his breath. Then, Fezzik quickly plunges Inigo's head into the steaming hot water. After allowing another short interval of time to pass, he retrieves Inigo's head from the hot water and submerges it once again into the icy cold. He repeats this alternating process, moving Inigo's head back into the hot water. Suddenly, a wild look overtakes Inigo's features. At this pivotal moment, Yellin enters the scene, kneeling down and revealing a key that dangles conspicuously from a chain around his neck. Just then, Buttercup enters, and the Prince momentarily gazes at her with a blank expression. Buttercup locks her gaze on Humperdinck. In an abrupt and decisive motion, Humperdinck whirls around, activating The Machine and thrusting the lever all the way up to its maximum setting. The excruciating pain that follows is unparalleled, causing a few children present to turn pale and rush toward their parents for comfort. The Albino then appears, methodically wheeling a barrow forward as Inigo's sword presses threateningly against his chest. The Albino, with a subdued gesture, shakes his head silently, causing Fezzik to respond by delivering a swift and forceful blow to the top of the Albino's head, resembling the action of a hammer driving a nail. The Albino topples to the ground without uttering a sound. Inigo then lowers himself to his knees, grasping the sword tightly between his hands, his eyes closed, as he faces a grove of trees and begins to speak in a low, strange voice. He rises to his feet, maintaining his closed eyes, and walks forward, holding the great sword steadily in his hands. Fezzik, filled with fear, follows closely behind, moving blindly through the grove of trees. Inigo approaches the Secret Knot, hesitates momentarily, and moves past it, then comes to an abrupt stop. He stands motionless for a prolonged moment, then suddenly whirls around, still with eyes closed, and strikes the sword dead center into the knot, yet nothing occurs, signaling his failure. Overcome with despair, he collapses against a tree, resting against a knot in the tree, inadvertently causing the knot to slide away and reveal a hidden staircase. Exchanging glances, Fezzik and Inigo begin their descent down the staircase to Westley, lying dead by The Machine. Fezzik leans over Westley's still form, straining to detect any sign of a heartbeat. Finding none, he turns to Inigo, shaking his head in silent confirmation of Westley's demise. Despite being overwhelmed with excitement, Fezzik struggles for composure, appearing stronger than ever before. Inigo, plunged into despair, remains in the Pit, as he had been before. Together, they approach a door and knock. The resemblance of the man inside to Mel Brooks' 2000 Year Old Man is uncanny, as though he were truly ancient. Inigo pounds on the door once more, but the window remains shut in response. Persisting, they rap on the door again. When it finally opens, Inigo and Fezzik hurry into the space, with Fezzik carefully carrying Westley, whose body is beginning to show early signs of stiffening."

Two large tubs are present, one filled with steaming water heated over an open flame, the other with icy water freshly drawn from a mountain spring. Without a word, Fezzik, who is a giant with a gentle heart despite his imposing appearance, stuffs Inigo's head into the icy water, then, after a reasonable amount of time to ensure Inigo is thoroughly shocked awake, pulls him out, ducks him into the steaming stuff, and, a short time after that, puts him back in the cold again, then back in the hot. Then, a wild look that denotes a sudden clarity or madness hits Inigo. Yellin, once the Chief of All Enforcement in the kingdom, enters and kneels, showing the key which is in charge of the castle's inner sanctum, dangling from a chain around his neck. Just at that moment, Buttercup, who is known throughout the land for her unparalleled beauty and is betrothed under duress to the Prince, enters, and the Prince, whose name is Humperdinck and who is known for his cunning but ruthless nature, looks at her blankly for a moment. Buttercup stares at Humperdinck with a mixture of fear and defiance. With that, he whirls, turns on The Machine, a torturous device designed to drain the life from its victim, and shoves the lever all the way up. There has never been such pain, reminiscent of ancient accounts of torture chambers in medieval times. A few children witnessing this pale and bolt toward their parents in terror. The Albino, a mute servant of the Prince, appears wheeling a barrow as Inigo's sword pushes at his chest. The Albino shakes his head, says nothing, and Fezzik, with his brute strength, crunches the Albino on the top of the head as if he had a hammer and was driving in a nail. The Albino drops without a sound. Inigo kneels, the sword held tight between his hands, eyes closed, facing the grove of trees known for its mystical and ancient presence, starting to talk with a low and strange voice as if invoking spirits. Now he rises, eyes still closed, as he walks forward, the great sword held in his hands, reminiscent of tales of warriors guided by intuition alone. Fezzik, frightened by this transformation, follows close behind, walking blind through the grove of trees. Inigo moves to the Secret Knot, a legendary spot among locals believed to hide great secrets, hesitates, then moves past it, then stops. For a long moment, he stands frozen, suddenly whirls, eyes still closed, and the sword strikes home dead center into a knot, and nothing happens. He has failed in his quest driven by personal vendetta. In utter despair, he collapses against the tree, against a knot in the tree, against the knot in the tree, which slides away, revealing the staircase rumored to lead to hidden chambers. Fezzik and Inigo look at each other, then start down to Westley, who lies apparently dead by The Machine's cruel efficiency. Fezzik leans over him, listening for a heartbeat, then he looks at Inigo and shakes his head solemnly. For a moment, he just sags, terribly excited, and looks stronger than they've yet seen him, desperately fighting for control over his emotions. Inigo, in despair, in the Pit, as before, recalls the legends of miraculous revivals. They approach the door and knock. If Mel Brooks' 2000 Year Old Man, a fictional character known for humorous yet insightful tales, was really old, he'd resemble this guy known as Miracle Max. Inigo pounds again, and the window is shut, a sign of caution and secrecy within. They rap on the door louder this time.

          "description": "The Wanderer Goblin absorbs the entire impact of the gust right on the whiskers. Two enormous crates are present, one filled with bubbling oil, the other with frosty soup. Without a peep, Gimli plunges Faramir's feet into the frosty soup, then, after a reasonable stretch of time, hauls him out, submerges him into the bubbling liquid, and, a short while later, plunges him back into the chilly again, then back into the boiling. Then a wild smirk hits Faramir. Meriadoc enters and bows, flaunting the bell jingling from a string around his wrist. Just at that instant, Eowyn enters, and the King gawks at her dully for a second. Eowyn glances at Théoden. With that, he spins, switches on The Contraption, and cranks the dial all the way up. There has never been such torment. A few cats blanch and dash toward their offspring. The Butcher emerges wheeling a cart as Faramir's spear nudges at his foot. The Butcher nods his head, utters nothing, and Gimli thumps the Butcher on the back of the heel as if he had a club and was nailing in a peg. The Butcher drops without a peep. Faramir kneels, the spear grasped tightly between his fingers, eyes shut, facing the meadow of bushes, beginning to chant with a soft and peculiar tone. Now he rises, eyes still shut, as he shuffles forward, the huge spear held in his grip. Gimli, anxious, trails close behind, wandering aimlessly through the meadow of bushes. Faramir slides to the Hidden Switch, pauses, then slides past it, then halts. For a lengthy instant, he stands rigid, suddenly spins, eyes still shut, and the spear pierces home dead center into a switch, and nothing happens. He has flopped. In sheer hopelessness, he collapses against the shrub, against a switch on the shrub, against the switch on the shrub, which swivels away, revealing the tunnel. Gimli and Faramir gaze at one another, then descend toward Boromir, silent by The Contraption. Gimli leans over him, straining for a pulse, then he glances at Faramir and nods his head. For a second, he merely slumps, overwhelmingly jubilant, and appears more formidable than they've ever observed him, determinedly battling for composure. Faramir, in hopelessness, in the Hollow, as before. They approach the gateway and tap. If Steve Martin's 1000-Year-Old Elf was truly ancient, he'd mirror this fellow. Faramir pounds once more, and the hatch is secured. They knock on the entrance. Faramir and Gimli rush inside, with Gimli toting Boromir who is just commencing to tense up a tad."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

The Albino appears, and Fezzik knocks him out. Inigo, eyes closed, walks with his sword, supported by a frightened Fezzik. Inigo, thinking he failed, despairingly leans against a tree knot, which reveals a staircase to Westley, dead from The Machine. Fezzik listens for Westley's heartbeat, shakes his head, and looks stronger, trying to control his emotions. In despair in the Pit, Inigo and Fezzik knock on a door, entering with Westley, who starts to stiffen."
