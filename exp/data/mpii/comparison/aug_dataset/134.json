We observe an English minister from the Second Class carriages, dipping a toe cautiously into the water, offspring of some British enlisted servicemen wading, splashing, faces aglow with amusement. Across the river down from the Third Class carriages, a small cluster of Indian women is crouched by the river's brink, laundering garments. Some carry infants on their backs, and some small youngsters stand near them. Their ritual of laundering persists, but they are all observing the travelers of the train. Gandhi stands with Ba and Charlie among the Third Class travelers. Charlie, his trousers rolled up, engages in a tentative splashing pastime with a skinny little Indian lad. Gandhi is grasping a large white head cloth which he is immersing in the water, but his eyes have been captivated by the sight of the women across the river. Their bodies are skin and bone. The garments they wear, which appeared ordinary from the distance, are tatters - literally, shredded tatters, one hung on another. Gandhi gazes for a moment, a prolonged pause. Climbing verdant hills - a completely different landscape - and again we intercut, this time the train ascending: a lad and buffalo operating a huge, crude milling wheel, train ascending; farmers in terraced fields, train ascending quicker and quicker. Gandhi is leaning out of a pane in a Third Class carriage. Ahead of him, other travelers are observing too; some have leaped down. As they come clear, they can perceive that a military locomotive of an engine and two cars has been derailed ahead of them. A small troop of cavalry is approaching slowly along the line of Gandhi's train toward them. They are British, and their troop leader is fiercely irate. Nehru takes an iced beverage from a servant, and Nehru shakes his head wistfully. The train traverses the camera to the Third Class section, which seems besieged by humanity. People cling to the exterior of each door and many more are seated on the central wooden planks on the roofs of the two carriages. Gandhi and Charlie are riding on the exterior of the carriage, gripping through the door, and both enjoying it enormously. Ba, inside the jammed carriage, finds it very unfunny. She has a grip on one of Gandhi's arms. The camera has been moving in; now it leaps to Jinnah in close shot and intercuts with the impact of his fervent delivery on the audience.

Gandhi soaks a white head cloth in the river, but his gaze is fixed on the women. They are emaciated, their clothes mere rags. He stares, deeply affected. The scene shifts to green hills and a train climbing: a boy and buffalo run a crude grinding wheel; farmers work terraced fields; the train speeds upward. Gandhi leans from a Third Class window. Others peer ahead or have jumped off. A derailed military train lies ahead. British cavalry approaches; their leader is furious. Nehru sips an iced drink and shakes his head wistfully. The train rolls past, Third Class packed—people cling to doors and sit atop coaches. Gandhi and Charlie hang outside, enjoying it, while Ba, inside, grips Gandhi’s arm, unimpressed.

The sun, positioned high above in the vast sky, casts its generous, warm light upon the scene below. The train finds itself coming to a halt right by the tranquil riverbank. From the open windows of the Second Class coaches, we observe the figure of an English clergyman, who is cautiously dipping his toe into the cool water, as children of some British enlisted soldiers happily wade and splash around, their faces illuminated with expressions of pure joy and unrestrained fun.\n\nA little downstream, on the opposite side of the river from the Third Class coaches, there is a small group of Indian women. They are squatted by the river's edge, engrossed in the rhythmic task of washing clothes. Some of these diligent women are seen carrying infants securely on their backs, while a few small children stand nearby, watching with curiosity. Although their methodical ritual of washing continues, their attention intermittently shifts to the intriguing sight of the passengers alighting from the train. Among these Third Class passengers, we see Gandhi standing with Ba and Charlie. Charlie, with his trousers playfully rolled up, is engaged in a tentative splashing game with a skinny little Indian boy. Gandhi, on the other hand, is holding a large white head cloth, soaking it in the water, though his eyes are captivated by the sight of the women across the river. Their bodies appear emaciated, mere skin and bone. The clothes they wear, which seemed quite normal from a distance, reveal themselves to be mere rags—literally, tattered shreds layered one over another. Gandhi finds himself staring for a moment, lost in a long, contemplative beat of reflection.\n\nThe scene transitions to a completely different and vibrant landscape of climbing green hills, and once again, the perspective intercuts with the train now laboriously climbing: a boy alongside a buffalo is running a massive, crude grinding wheel, and the train steadily climbs; farmers are diligently working in terraced fields, the train accelerates, climbing faster and faster. Gandhi leans out of a window in a Third Class coach, curiosity piqued. Ahead of him, other passengers are also peering out; some have even jumped down to get a better look. As the train progresses into view, it becomes clear that a military train, consisting of an engine and two cars, has been derailed just ahead of them. A small troop of cavalry is seen slowly making its way along the line of Gandhi’s train toward them. Clearly identifiable as British, their troop leader is visibly and viciously angry, his demeanor fierce.\n\nNehru takes an iced drink from a servant, and with a wistful shake of his head, observes the unfolding events. As the train passes by the camera, the vantage moves to the Third Class section, which appears to be besieged by a multitude of humanity. People cling desperately to the outside of each door, and many more are seated precariously on the central wooden planks atop the roofs of the two coaches. Gandhi and Charlie are among those riding on the exterior of the coach, hanging on bravely through the door, and they are visibly thrilled by the exhilarating experience. Ba, however, within the jam-packed coach, finds no amusement in the situation. She maintains a firm and unwavering grip on one of Gandhi’s arms, ensuring his safety. The camera, which has been steadily moving in, now jumps to focus closely on Jinnah, capturing his fervent delivery and the palpable impact it has upon the audience. The response from the audience is enthusiastic, erupting with cheers. Around the platform, newspaper cameramen are crowded, eagerly photographing him. From the back of the platform, Patel comes forward, clapping with earnest enthusiasm."

Across the river, near the Third Class coaches, a small group of Indian women squats by the river's edge, engaged in the task of washing clothes. Some of these women carry infants on their backs, while small children stand nearby, observing. Despite their ongoing washing ritual, their attention is drawn to the passengers of the train. Among the Third Class passengers, Gandhi stands with Ba and Charlie. Charlie, with his trousers rolled up, engages in a tentative splashing game with a skinny little Indian boy. Meanwhile, Gandhi holds a large white head cloth, soaking it in the water, but his gaze is captivated by the sight of the women across the river. He notices their emaciated bodies and the clothes they wear, which, upon closer inspection, are nothing more than shredded rags layered upon each other. Gandhi stares at them for a prolonged moment, absorbing the scene. The landscape shifts to climbing green hills, a stark contrast to the previous terrain, and the scene intercuts with the train ascending these hills: a boy and a buffalo operate a massive, crude grinding wheel, and farmers work in terraced fields as the train climbs faster and faster. Gandhi leans out of a window in a Third Class coach, joining other passengers who are also looking ahead; some have even jumped down from the train. As they clear the view, they see a military train consisting of an engine and two cars derailed ahead of them. A small troop of cavalry approaches slowly along the line of Gandhi's train. The cavalry is British, and their troop leader is visibly and viciously angry. Meanwhile, Nehru accepts an iced drink from a servant and shakes his head wistfully. The train continues past the camera to the Third Class section, which appears overwhelmed by the sheer number of people. Passengers cling to the outside of each door, and many more are seated on the central wooden planks on the roofs of the two coaches. Gandhi and Charlie are among those riding on the outside of the coach, holding onto the door and thoroughly enjoying the experience. Inside the cramped coach, Ba finds the situation far from amusing as she maintains a firm grip on one of Gandhi's arms. The camera, having been moving in, now cuts to a close shot of Jinnah, intercutting with the fervent impact of his delivery on the audience, who respond with enthusiastic cheers.

The sun is high, indicating midday, and the train is stopped by the river, which in this area is known for its fast-flowing current. We see an English clergyman, representative of the British presence in colonial India during the early 20th century, from the Second Class coaches, dipping a toe cautiously into the water, children of some British enlisted soldiers wading, splashing, their faces alight with fun. Across the river, down from the Third Class coaches, where spaces were far less comfortable and more crowded, a small group of Indian women is squatted by the river's edge, washing clothes in a traditional manner. Some carry infants on their backs, showcasing the multitasking nature of their daily lives, and some small children stand near them. Their ritual of washing goes on, but they are all watching the passengers of the train. Gandhi, a key figure in India's struggle for independence, stands with Ba and Charlie among the Third Class passengers. Charlie, his trousers rolled up, plays a tentative splashing game with a skinny little Indian boy. Gandhi is holding a large white head cloth, a piece of clothing commonly used for sun protection, which he is soaking in the water, but his eyes have been arrested by the sight of the women across the river. Their bodies are skin and bone, indicative of the widespread poverty that afflicted many Indians under colonial rule. The clothes they wear, which looked normal from a distance, are rags - literally, shredded rags, one hung on another. Gandhi stares for a moment, a long beat. Climbing green hills, indicative of the diverse geography of India, and again we intercut, this time the train climbing: a boy and buffalo running a huge, crude grinding wheel, illustrating traditional agricultural practices; train climbing; farmers in terraced fields, highlighting the ingenuity in dealing with hilly terrain, train climbing faster and faster. Gandhi is leaning out of a window in a Third Class coach. Ahead of him, other passengers are looking too; some have jumped down. As they come clear, they can see that a military train of an engine and two cars has been derailed ahead of them, a frequent occurrence due to the old and poorly maintained tracks during that era. A small troop of cavalry is coming slowly along the line of Gandhi's train toward them. They are British, a common sight as colonial powers maintained heavy military presence, and their troop leader is viciously angry. Nehru, a future Prime Minister of India and a prominent figure in the Indian National Movement, takes an iced drink from a servant, and Nehru shakes his head wistfully, reflecting on the situation. The train passes the camera to the Third Class section, which seems besieged by humanity, an indication of how overcrowded trains were. People cling to the outside of each door and many more are seated on the central wooden planks on the roofs of the two coaches. Gandhi and Charlie are riding on the outside of the coach, hanging on through the door, both enjoying it immensely as it symbolizes freedom despite the circumstances. Ba, inside the jammed coach, finds it very unfunny, worried for their safety. She has a grip on one of Gandhi's arms for reassurance. The camera has been moving in; now it jumps to Jinnah, a leader who played a pivotal role in the creation of Pakistan, in close shot and intercuts with the impact of his fervid delivery on the audience, who were clearly moved by his words. And the audience cheers him, their enthusiasm palpable. Newspaper cameramen, essential for documenting these historic events, crowded around the platform to photograph him. Patel, another influential figure in Indian politics, comes forward from the back of the platform, clapping in support."

Some carry tools in their pockets, and some small animals stand near them. Their chore of arranging continues, but they are all observing the crew of the boat. Lincoln stands with Marilyn and Sherlock among the Fourth Class travelers. Sherlock, his sleeves rolled up, engages in a cautious jumping game with a tiny little Chinese girl. Lincoln is holding a large blue bandana which he is plunging in the paint, but his gaze has been captivated by the sight of the men across the canyon. Their figures are slender and frail. The garments they wear, which seemed typical from afar, are tatters - indeed, frayed tatters, one layered on another. Lincoln gazes for a moment, a prolonged pause. Ascending yellow valleys - an entirely new landscape - and again we intercut, this time the boat ascending: a girl and donkey operating a massive, primitive milling stone, boat ascending; gardeners in stepped orchards, boat ascending swiftly and swiftly.

Lincoln and Sherlock are perched on the exterior of the cabin, gripping through the hatch, and both relishing it deeply. Marilyn, inside the cramped cabin, finds it highly disagreeable. She has a clutch on one of Lincoln's legs. The kite has been soaring nearby; now it swoops to Churchill in close view and intercuts with the impact of his zealous presentation on the spectators.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
