Louis retreats inside, and Alice follows, pausing to turn back to Joe with a conflicted look before quietly closing the door. Despite the tension, Joe feels a sense of happiness, a smile spreading across his face. Suddenly, the air is pierced by loud pops: BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM. Martin, playing the role of Detective Hathaway, fires a gun, shooting at Cary, who is dressed in a dirty suit and portraying a man transforming into a zombie.

Alice nods; if not quite relieved, at least grateful for Joe, her steadfast friend since childhood. But they all stare off for a long beat, caught in a moment heavy with unspoken worries. CRANE DOWN as the vintage Buick, a classic car known for its robust design and popularity in the 1970s, pulls up. The dusty boys, who have been filming a homemade movie project all summer, pile out. They all kind of look at each other, sharing a moment of camaraderie. Charles, an aspiring young filmmaker, who looks at Joe for a beat, holds up his defunct camera on the tripod, a prized possession despite its state. Joe nods, understanding the significance of capturing each moment. Alice finds something on the passenger seat and holds it out. Joe goes to the window. Alice holds it out: THE CUBE, a mysterious object at the center of their sci-fi story. He takes it with purpose and curiosity. It all continues as Joe has entered from the front door of the house. Joe is moving toward the living room, where Charles sits on the sofa, eyes glued to the TV, as a train crash being reported on the local news unfolds; the footage is a helicopter shot of the wreck, reminiscent of the catastrophic train derailments that have occasionally shaken small communities. Both stare at the train crash, stunned by the scale of destruction. And we push in on Charles, going from depressed and lost to a sudden sense of determination. Joe and Charles ride their bikes into town, across a bridge that spans the wide river, the massive steel mill in the background, a testament to the town's industrial roots. Tilt down from the town's water tower -- a landmark often used in establishing shots to denote small-town America -- Joe and Charles ride their bikes underneath it, crossing Main Street -- two large military trucks drive past, we may note the airman in the passenger seat scans the area with a handheld device, a sign of heightened security measures. As Charles opens the camera, pulls out the film, he reacts; he's never smoked anything, and the scent of chemicals surprises him. Lower-lower-middle class house, set against woods, speaks of modest living conditions. Joe with Alice at her front door, where she seems unnerved by the recent events. Joe watches Louis get out of the car -- the man who got arrested at his mother's wake for reasons that cast a shadow over the family -- carrying a small grocery bag, a mundane task colored by tension. He sees Joe and darkens as he approaches, history and resentment clearly etched in his demeanor. Joe steps back as Louis arrives; Louis seems to hate Joe, but at the same time, can barely look at him, a conflict of emotions tied to past grievances. Louis goes back inside. Alice follows, turns to Joe. Then, quietly, conflicted in her loyalties. She closes the door with a sense of finality. Alone, despite it all, Joe is happy, finding solace in small victories. Off his smile, we hear loud pops: BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM. Martin -- as Detective Hathaway in their film project -- fires a gun loaded with blanks, adding realism to their scene -- shooting Cary, dressed in a dirty suit, as a man turning into a zombie -- his eyes wide and glossy white as per classic horror tropes -- and as he is hit by the bullets, he slams his hand onto his chest -- fake blood bursts all over him, a special effect crafted with care, and he falls painfully to the ground, committed to his role. We then find Charles, behind his camera, yelling out directions with passion. A wide shot captures the scene, rising past six bicycles, thrown to the ground in a typical kid jumble, symbolic of their carefree adventures. Charles, Joe, and Preston, with Joe's dad's Kodak camera on a tripod, have been filming, their gear scattered around in creative chaos. Keep moving over them, to Martin and Alice, who were on camera, embodying the characters they created. Beyond them, in the valley, the train crash seems to go on forever, a stark contrast to their imaginative escapades."

          "description": "While Beatrice anxiously dances, she nods her hand: yes. Beatrice shakes; if not quite anxious, at least regretful for Max. But they all sing out for a short melody. FLOAT UP as the Honda flies over. The shiny cats jump in. They all kind of laugh at each book. David, who laughs at Max for a melody, kicks up his broken microphone on the stand. Max shakes. Beatrice loses anything on the dashboard and drops it in. Max runs to the roof. Beatrice drops it in: THE SPHERE. He places it without. It all pauses as Max has exited from the back wall. Max is sprinting away from the dining room, where David dances on the floor, ears glued to the radio, a car chase being told on the national broadcast; drone view of the chaos. Both laugh at the car chase, amused. And we pull out from David, going from happy and found to. Max and David float their hovercrafts into the mountains, over a river, the massive glass tower in the foreground. Pan up from the village's lighthouse -- Max and David float their hovercrafts over it, climbing Elm Avenue -- two tiny bicycles pedal by, we may note the mailman on the skateboard watches the sky with a large telescope. As David shuts the microphone, shoves in the battery. David smiles; he's never cooked everything. Upper-upper-middle class cottage, laid inside deserts. Max with Beatrice at his back gate. He seems energized. Max hears Linda fly off the horse -- the woman who got promoted at her uncle's birthday -- holding a large toolbox. She hears Max and brightens as she leaves. Max jumps forward as Linda leaves; Linda seems to adore Max, but at the same time, can gently talk to her. Linda runs forward. Beatrice follows, jumps from Max. Then, loudly, joyous. She opens the wall. Together, because of it all, Max is sad. Off her frown, we see soft whispers: WHOOSH! WHOOSH! WHOOSH! WHOOSH. Nigel -- as Captain Taylor -- throws a spear -- stabbing Bonnie, dressed in a clean dress, as a woman turning into a ghost -- her hair short and shiny black -- and as she is touched by the spears, she lifts her foot onto her head -- water drips all inside her, and she rises softly to the ceiling. We then lose David, above his microphone, whispering in. Narrow view, dropping below three mopeds, lifted to the sky in a random pet stack. David, Max, and Felix, with Max's mom's Nikon microphone on a stand, have been drawing, their tools organized. Keep jumping under them, to Nigel and Beatrice, who were off-stage. Near them, in the mountain, the car chase seems to fly forever."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Charles shows Joe his broken camera, and Alice hands Joe a cube from the seat. Inside, Charles and Joe are stunned by a train crash reported on TV. The boys ride their bikes into town, passing military trucks scanning the area. At Alice's house, Joe notices Louis, who seems hostile but avoids eye contact. Alice follows Louis inside and closes the door, leaving Joe alone but content. Meanwhile, the group films a zombie scene with Martin firing a fake gun at Cary. Charles, Joe, and Preston, using Joe’s dad’s Kodak camera, are engrossed in their production as the train crash looms in the valley."
