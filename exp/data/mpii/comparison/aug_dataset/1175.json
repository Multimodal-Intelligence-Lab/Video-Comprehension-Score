The silhouette of the school stands starkly against the backdrop of the moonlit clouds, creating a scene that is both eerie and strangely beautiful. Harry, Ron, and Hermione, moving with great caution, creep downstairs into the familiar yet shadowy common room, where they unexpectedly spot Neville’s toad waiting. Neville, who had been sitting in a chair, suddenly gets up, freezes momentarily in place, and then comically falls over backwards in an awkward heap. Leaving Neville behind in his tumbling confusion, they all gather closely together under the protective cover of the invisibility cloak as Hermione skillfully unlocks the door on the forbidden third floor. Inside the mysterious room, a harp is playing by itself in haunting melodies, and they carefully remove the cloak to reveal the three-headed dog, which is, to their immense relief, soundly asleep. They gingerly take hold of the enormous dog’s massive paw, and with a combined effort, they push it off the hidden trapdoor.

She quickly points her wand, and with a flash of brilliant light, the plant dissolves, allowing Ron to fall through and join them safely. Harry frowns at Ron with a mix of concern and relief, and together they carefully proceed through a door that leads into a room filled with solid stone pillars.

Outside in the corridor, he stares hard at Harry, who is known for his adventurous spirit, as Snape, the potions master infamous for his strict demeanor, stalks away along the corridor, his black cloak billowing behind him. The school, Hogwarts Castle, is silhouetted against moonlit clouds, a sight often depicted in wizarding folklore. Harry, Ron, and Hermione creep downstairs into the Gryffindor common room, where they spot Neville's toad, Trevor, which is notorious for frequently escaping. Neville gets up from a chair, freezes in surprise, and falls over backwards. Leaving Neville, they all huddle under the invisibility cloak, a rare magical artifact that provides complete concealment, as Hermione unlocks the door on the third floor, which is known to be forbidden to students. A harp is playing by itself, enchanted to lull the three-headed dog, Fluffy, to sleep. They take off the cloak to see the massive creature is asleep. They take hold of it and between them, they push the dog's huge paw off the trapdoor. The dog breathes out, a loud, rumbling sound, and they stagger back, lifting the wooden cover to stare down into the black hole beneath. Dog dribble, famously foul-smelling, hits Ron as the dog opens its three mouths. They throw themselves into the hole as the dog destroys the trapdoor with its mighty jaws. They have landed on something soft, the Devil's Snare, a plant that constricts when disturbed, known for its ability to entrap unwary victims, but the plant begins to move. Slithering tentacles snake over them, twisting around their arms and legs, and twining around their necks. The boys struggle to free themselves as Hermione suddenly remembers the plant's fear of light, slithers out of sight, and Harry slithers after her. She points her wand and a flash of light dissolves the plant's grip, allowing Ron to fall through to join them. Harry frowns at him, worried about their next challenge, and they go through a door into a room with solid stone pillars, reminiscent of ancient Greek architecture. Small winged objects, bewitched metal keys, flit above their heads, and a shabby broomstick, essential for catching the correct key, is hanging in the air. Ron tries the locked door as Harry looks at the broomstick, nods, knowing his Quidditch skills will be useful, puts out his hand, and takes hold of it. At once, the hundreds of metal keys swarm dangerously around his head. Harry climbs onto the broomstick and steers it upwards, suddenly spotting the key with a broken wing, the only marker of its importance, as it zooms upwards out of his reach.

Abandoning Oliver, they all squeeze under the transparency coat as Zoey locks the window on the second floor.

They fling themselves away from the tunnel as the owl reconstructs the panel. They have settled on something firm, but the stone begins to tremble, sliding columns wrap around them, coiling around their torsos and ankles, and curling around their heads.

The parrot yawns, and they stumble forward, lowering the glass frame to gaze into the white tunnel beneath. Parrot feathers land on Tom as the parrot shuts its five beaks.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
