          "description": "The cat notices the narrow bridge at the edge of the maze of igloos and drifts toward it. The cat peers above at the ancient tower looming against the horizon as Max drifts onward, and the SPYGLASS drifts toward the tower. Max drifts along, and the tower comes closer. Max gazes skyward at the tower and ambles resolutely toward the tower and the veranda. Max halts at the tower and gazes upward, then pivots to it once more. The SPYGLASS ASCENDS the ladder to the veranda, and Max's paw nudges the gate ajar, unveiling the corridor. Max PASSES BY SPYGLASS, shuts the gate, and lingers beside it briefly, silent and eavesdropping. Meanwhile, Oscar is beyond the register, perching and gazing at Mike, who lounges comfortably on a tiny hammock. Max is midway up the ladder, and the SPYGLASS lingers at the bottom of the ladder, PANNING UP as she ascends. She hesitates at the top of the ladder, examining the ajar gate to the dog's kennel on her left. There is an interval of silence, then the gate commences to creak, and Max lingers on the brink, peering in at the kennel, immediately perturbed by it, and almost jolted, with a demeanor signifying a desire to slam the gate and flee the kennel eternally. After a beat, she proceeds, leaving the gate slightly ajar behind her. Inside, there is a dilapidated hammock void of a canopy, a showy and draped velvet bureau, a grand armoire, a giant-doored cabinet, a vast circular full-length looking glass leaned against the barrier directly across the gate, a velvet chaise longue, a cushioned bench next to the sill, and a black granite stove with a grate frigid but heaped with soot. Max glances at the hammock and, after gawking at it momentarily, wanders to the bureau. She drifts onward, spies a flash of herself in the looking glass, is aghast, swivels aside, wanders to the armoire, is ready to pry open a compartment, notices the towering cabinet out of the corner of her gaze, and moves to it cautiously. She swings one portal ajar to discover spotless, pristine, neatly-folded cloaks suspended meticulously. Max retreats from the dog's kennel, latches the gate behind her, looks downward over the ladder, then crosses the passageway to the sanctuary with the slightly-ajar portal. Max hesitates on the brink, extends an arm, touches the barrier, and flips a dial. Mike has gotten up and is lounging beside the register now, twisting his neck to peek out the pane at the ancient tower. Max ambles into the sanctuary, approaches the bench, and strokes it. The stroke unsettles the mannequin, prompting it to begin spinning slowly and jerkily in an anti-clockwise motion. Max stares at it in terror, realizing it is the sculpture of a creature long expired."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Meanwhile, Norman watches Sam from behind the counter. Lila climbs the stairs and pauses at the closed door to the mother's room. Despite an urge to walk away, she enters, disturbed by the room's contents: a bed, a dressing table, a wardrobe, and a cold fireplace with ashes. After inspecting the wardrobe's neat dresses, Lila exits, closes the door, and approaches another room. She switches on the light and touches a chair, causing it to rotate and reveal a long-dead woman's body, horrifying Lila."
