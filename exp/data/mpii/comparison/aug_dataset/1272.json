  "ground_truth": "The three friends hang onto the dragon's horny spikes, with Hermione on one side and Ron and Harry on the other as it takes flight, clumsily buffeting rooftops and chimneypots before soaring into the air with the Thames winding far below. The wind ruffles their hair as the dragon flies off, heading west along the river. They soar through clouds towards it, with the dragon's outstretched wings barely moving as the currents of air carry it along. They fly low over the river, and as they plunge deep into the water, Harry sees an image of Voldemort. The dark lord attacks a bank guard, and a finger recoils from a glowing ring, Tom Riddle's scorched diary, and the Horcrux locket as Voldemort spins and Harry surfaces. More images of Ron destroying the locket with the Sword of Gryffindor follow, prompting the dark lord to roar. Harry sees Hogwarts School, a dark-haired woman, and a banner with the eagle of the House of Ravenclaw, followed by the two-handled gold cup as Voldemort frowns, eyes staring, then turns uneasily. After surfacing again, Harry swims towards the shore and all three clamber out of the water onto a rocky outcrop, where they put on dry clothes. Meanwhile, Voldemort stalks amongst dead bodies in Gringotts Bank and speaks to his snake while the Malfoys stand nearby. Eyes wide with horror, Narcissa watches Voldemort and the snake as Griphook lies dead, still clutching the Sword of Gryffindor, which glows and slowly vanishes. Night falls in snowy Hogsmeade as Hermione, Ron, and Harry apparate nearby. The three friends run off while Death Eaters scour the village; two search a covered market, looking under stalls and lifting covers while the three fugitives crouch down, out of sight. Hearing the call, the two Death Eaters race from the market, and the trio runs up a set of narrow steps to reach a locked, barred gate. Beckoned by a shadowy figure, Harry moves to a doorway and enters, with the others following him down a staircase. They enter a stone-walled room lit by a solitary oil lamp, where Ron looks puzzled as Hermione and Ron see a painting on the wall—a moving portrait of a thin-faced girl with long, brown hair. Next to it, Hermione spots a mirror and sees Harry's face reflected back at her, noticing the bottom corner of the mirror has a piece missing. She looks surprised and turns to Harry, who inspects his own piece of mirror, which shows the back of Hermione's head. As Harry compares his shard with the missing section of the broken mirror, a bearded man comes in and sets down food and drink. Harry glares at Aberforth, who stares at Harry, then addresses the portrait. The girl in the portrait nods, turns, and walks away into the painting past trees and bushes as Hermione steps towards Harry, her eyes fixed on the painting.",

          "description": "Sure, here is the transformed text:\n\nThe trio comrades cling onto the dragon's spiked projections, with Hermione on one flank and Ron and Harry on the opposite as it ascends, awkwardly battering rooftops and chimneypots before climbing into the atmosphere with the Thames meandering far beneath. The breeze tousles their locks as the dragon soars off, steering west along the river. They glide through clouds towards it, with the dragon's extended wings scarcely shifting as the currents of air convey it along. They glide low over the river, and as they dive deep into the water, Harry perceives a vision of Voldemort. The dark overlord assaults a bank sentinel, and a digit recoils from a radiant circle, Tom Riddle's charred journal, and the Horcrux locket as Voldemort twirls and Harry emerges. Further visions of Ron smashing the locket with the Sword of Gryffindor follow, inciting the dark overlord to bellow. Harry observes Hogwarts School, a dark-haired woman, and a pennant with the eagle of the House of Ravenclaw, succeeded by the two-handled golden cup as Voldemort scowls, eyes glaring, then swivels uneasily. After resurfacing again, Harry swims towards the coastline and all three scramble out of the water onto a craggy ledge, where they don dry garments. Meanwhile, Voldemort prowls amidst deceased figures in Gringotts Bank and converses to his serpent while the Malfoys stand nearby. Eyes wide with terror, Narcissa observes Voldemort and the serpent as Griphook lies expired, still gripping the Sword of Gryffindor, which glimmers and gradually disappears. Night descends in snowy Hogsmeade as Hermione, Ron, and Harry apparate nearby. The trio comrades dash off while Death Eaters scour the hamlet; two search a sheltered market, peeking under stalls and lifting coverings while the trio escapers crouch down, concealed. Hearing the cry, the two Death Eaters sprint from the market, and the trio ascends a set of narrow steps to reach a secured, barred portal. Summoned by a shadowy figure, Harry moves to an entrance and enters, with the others following him down a stairway. They enter a stone-walled chamber illuminated by a single oil lamp, where Ron appears bewildered as Hermione and Ron see a canvas on the wall—a moving depiction of a slender-faced girl with long, brown hair. Beside it, Hermione notices a mirror and sees Harry's visage reflected back at her, noticing the bottom corner of the mirror has a fragment missing. She looks astonished and turns to Harry, who examines his own piece of mirror, which reveals the back of Hermione's head. As Harry compares his shard with the missing segment of the broken mirror, a bearded man enters and sets down sustenance and beverage. Harry scowls at Aberforth, who gazes at Harry, then addresses the depiction. The girl in the depiction nods, turns, and strolls away into the canvas past trees and shrubs as Hermione steps towards Harry, her eyes fixated on the depiction."

Their hair is ruffled by the wind as the dragon is flown off with, heading west along the river. It is soared through clouds towards by them, with the currents of air carrying it along while the dragon's outstretched wings are barely moved by it. The river is flown low over by them, and as deep into the water they plunge, an image of Voldemort is seen by Harry. A bank guard is attacked by the dark lord, and a finger recoils from a glowing ring, Tom Riddle's scorched diary, and the Horcrux locket as the dark lord spins and Harry surfaces. More images of Ron destroying the locket with the Sword of Gryffindor follow, prompting a roar from the dark lord. Hogwarts School is seen by Harry, a dark-haired woman, and a banner with the eagle of the House of Ravenclaw, followed by the two-handled gold cup as a frown comes to Voldemort, eyes staring, then uneasy turns occur. After being surfaced again, the shore is swum towards by Harry and dry clothes are put on by all three after they clamber out of the water onto a rocky outcrop. Meanwhile, dead bodies in Gringotts Bank are stalked among by Voldemort and his snake is spoken to while the Malfoys stand nearby. Eyes wide with horror, Narcissa watches Voldemort and the snake while Griphook lies dead, still clutching the Sword of Gryffindor, which glows and slowly vanishes. Snowy Hogsmeade falls into night as Hermione, Ron, and Harry apparate nearby. While the village is scoured by Death Eaters, the three friends run off; a covered market is searched by two who look under stalls and lift covers while the three fugitives crouch down, out of sight. Hearing the call, the market is raced from by the two Death Eaters, and a set of narrow steps is run up by the trio to reach a locked, barred gate. A shadowy figure beckons, and Harry is moved to a doorway and entered by him, with a staircase followed by the others. A stone-walled room lit by a solitary oil lamp is entered, where Ron is puzzled as a painting on the wall is seen by Hermione and Ron—a moving portrait of a thin-faced girl with long, brown hair.

She is surprised and turns to Harry, who inspects his own piece of mirror, which shows the back of Hermione’s head. As his shard is compared with the missing section of the broken mirror by Harry, food and drink are set down by a bearded man who comes in. A glare is shot at Aberforth by Harry, who stares at Harry, then the portrait is addressed by him. The girl in the portrait nods, turns, and walks away into the painting past trees and bushes as steps are taken towards Harry by Hermione, her eyes fixed on the painting."

Hermione is positioned on one side while Ron and Harry are on the opposite side as the dragon begins its flight. In its initial attempts at takeoff, it clumsily buffets against the rooftops and chimneypots, finally managing to soar majestically into the open sky, with the winding ribbon of the Thames River stretching far below them. The powerful gusts of wind tousle their hair as the dragon continues to fly, heading in a westerly direction alongside the river’s course. They ascend through the cloud-filled sky toward their destination, with the dragon's vast wings unfurled but hardly needing to flap, as it gracefully glides along on the natural currents of air. Flying at a low altitude over the river, they suddenly plunge deep into the water, and within this moment, Harry sees a vivid image of Voldemort. The dark lord launches a violent attack on a bank guard, and as a finger recoils from a glowing ring, the image of Tom Riddle's charred diary and the ominous Horcrux locket comes to mind as Voldemort spins, and Harry quickly surfaces. More visions flood in, depicting Ron as he courageously destroys the Horcrux locket using the powerful Sword of Gryffindor, prompting an enraged roar from the dark lord. Harry then sees the towering Hogwarts School, a dark-haired woman, and a banner emblazoned with the emblematic eagle of the House of Ravenclaw, followed by the sight of the two-handled golden cup. Voldemort's expression is a tense frown, his eyes fixated and then shifting with unease. Upon surfacing once more, Harry swims determinedly toward the shore, where he and his two companions clamber out of the water onto a rocky outcrop. There, they eagerly change into dry clothes. Meanwhile, in the dark, ominous confines of Gringotts Bank, Voldemort prowls among lifeless bodies, conversing with his snake, while the Malfoys stand in tense proximity. Narcissa’s eyes are wide with horror as she watches Voldemort and the snake; Griphook lies dead, gripping the Sword of Gryffindor, which emits a faint glow as it slowly disappears from sight. As nighttime descends over a snowy Hogsmeade, Hermione, Ron, and Harry apparate into the vicinity. In stealthy movement, the three friends dash away while the vigilant Death Eaters thoroughly scour the village; two of them meticulously search a covered market, peering under stalls and lifting covers, while the trio remains crouched low, keeping out of sight.

She turns in surprise to Harry, who carefully inspects his own shard of the mirror, revealing the back of Hermione's head.

Hermione finds herself positioned securely on one side of the beast, while Ron and Harry are precariously situated on the opposite side as the dragon begins the daunting process of launching into flight. In the dragon's initial, hesitant attempts to take off, it clumsily buffets against the rooftops and chimneypots, yet eventually manages to soar majestically into the vast open sky. Below them, the Thames River stretches out like a winding ribbon, unfurling far into the distance. The powerful gusts of wind fiercely tousle their hair as the dragon continues its flight, heading determinedly in a westerly direction, following along the river’s serpentine course. They ascend through the cloud-filled sky toward their intended destination, with the dragon's vast wings unfurled but scarcely needing to flap, instead using the natural currents of air to glide gracefully. As they fly at a low altitude over the expanse of the river, they suddenly plunge deep into the swirling water, and in a startling moment, Harry sees a vivid image of Voldemort. The dark lord is depicted as he launches a violent attack on an unsuspecting bank guard, and as a finger recoils from a glowing ring, the vivid image of Tom Riddle's charred diary and the ominous Horcrux locket comes to mind as Voldemort spins, and Harry quickly comes to the surface for air. More intense visions flood Harry’s mind, revealing Ron as he bravely destroys the malevolent Horcrux locket using the powerful, legendary Sword of Gryffindor, prompting an enraged roar from the dark lord. Harry then envisions the towering silhouette of the Hogwarts School, a dark-haired woman, and a banner emblazoned with the emblematic eagle of the House of Ravenclaw, closely followed by the sight of the two-handled golden cup. Voldemort's expression is one of tense consternation, his eyes fixated and then shifting with an unmistakable unease. As Harry surfaces once more, he swims with determination toward the distant shore, where he and his two companions eagerly clamber out of the water onto a rocky outcrop. There, they waste no time in changing into dry clothes to rid themselves of the chill. Meanwhile, in the dark, ominous confines of Gringotts Bank, Voldemort prowls restlessly among lifeless bodies, engaged in hushed conversation with his snake, while the Malfoys stand nearby, tension radiating from them. Narcissa’s eyes are wide with horror as she watches Voldemort and the snake; Griphook lies dead, tenaciously gripping the Sword of Gryffindor, which emits a faint, mystical glow as it slowly disappears from sight. As nighttime descends over a snowy Hogsmeade, the trio—Hermione, Ron, and Harry—apparates into the area. In a stealthy manner, the three friends dash away on foot while the vigilant Death Eaters thoroughly scour the village; two of these dark figures meticulously search a covered market, peering beneath stalls and lifting covers, while the trio remains crouched low, keeping out of sight and undetected. Upon hearing an urgent call, the two Death Eaters swiftly rush out of the market, prompting the trio to ascend a narrow set of steps leading to a locked, barred gate. Drawn by the gestures of a shadowy figure, Harry cautiously makes his way to a doorway and steps inside, with Ron and Hermione closely following him down a descending staircase. They find themselves in a dimly lit stone-walled room, which is dimly illuminated by a solitary oil lamp. In this shadowy room, Ron appears puzzled, as Hermione and Ron both notice a striking painting on the wall—a moving portrait of a thin-faced girl with long, cascading brown hair.

Initially, it struggles, clumsily knocking against rooftops and chimneypots, causing a cacophony of noise as these obstacles brush past its rough scales. Gradually gaining altitude, the dragon eventually surges upwards, leaving the ground far below and revealing the Thames winding beneath them like a silvery ribbon. As the dragon finds its rhythm, the wind rushes past the three friends, tousling their hair as they continue to head westward, following the river’s course. They ascend, cutting through layers of clouds, while the dragon’s expansive wings remain nearly motionless, gliding smoothly on the atmospheric currents propelling it onward. As they approach the river once more, the dragon dips low, almost skimming the surface, before plunging them deep into the water. In this immersive aquatic moment, Harry is suddenly confronted with vivid visions of Voldemort. He briefly witnesses the dark lord attacking a bank guard, recoiling fingers from a luminous ring, a flash of Tom Riddle's scorched diary, and the Horcrux locket, all interspersed with Voldemort's frantic movements. Emerging from this surreal underwater scene, Harry sees Ron, sword in hand, destroy the locket with the Sword of Gryffindor, prompting an anguished roar from Voldemort. More images flood in, revealing Hogwarts School, a dark-haired woman, and a banner brandishing the eagle of Ravenclaw, followed by a two-handled gold cup, which causes Voldemort to frown and turn with unease. As consciousness returns, Harry finds himself surfacing again, his mind clearing as he swims determinedly towards the shore. Together, the friends clamber onto a rocky outcrop, water streaming from their clothes which they quickly replace with dry ones. Concurrently, Voldemort, in a separate scene, strides purposefully among the corpses in Gringotts Bank, conversing with his sinister snake in the presence of the Malfoys. Narcissa's eyes widen in horror as she gazes at Voldemort and the snake, her attention drawn to Griphook's lifeless grip on the glowing Sword of Gryffindor, which soon fades into oblivion. Night descends upon the snowy streets of Hogsmeade, where Hermione, Ron, and Harry apparate, the chill biting at their senses. Concealed in the shadows, they move stealthily while Death Eaters patrol the village, two of them carefully searching a covered market by peering under stalls and lifting covers. The trio crouches low, hiding from view until the Death Eaters, hearing a call, rush from the market, giving the friends a chance to dash up a narrow flight of steps. They arrive before a locked and barred gate but are beckoned by a shadowy figure. Harry approaches the obscured doorway, leading the others inside and down a dimly lit staircase. Entering a stone-walled room, its somberness punctuated by a solitary oil lamp, Ron appears puzzled as he and Hermione notice a painting—a moving portrait of a thin-faced girl with long brown hair. Hermione’s attention is caught by a nearby mirror, where she sees Harry’s face reflected back, and notices a missing piece in the corner. Surprised, she turns to Harry, who inspects his own shard of mirror, which reflects the back of her head. Harry aligns his shard with the missing part of the mirror, contemplating the fit, as a bearded man enters, depositing food and drink on a nearby table. Harry's gaze narrows in on Aberforth, who meets his eyes before addressing the portrait. The girl within nods, her figure becoming animated as she turns and walks deeper into the painted landscape, disappearing among the trees and bushes. Hermione steps closer to Harry, her eyes fixed with curiosity on the retreating figure in the painting."

The wind ruffles their hair as the dragon, a rare and powerful creature often kept in highly secure magical reserves, flies off, heading west along the river. They soar through clouds towards it, with the dragon's outstretched wings barely moving as the currents of air, once navigated by famed explorers of old, carry it along. They fly low over the river, and as they plunge deep into the water, Harry sees an image of Voldemort, a dark wizard feared throughout the magical world for his ruthless quest for power. The dark lord attacks a bank guard, likely at Gringotts, the only wizarding bank known for its formidable security, and a finger recoils from a glowing ring, Tom Riddle's scorched diary, and the Horcrux locket as Voldemort spins and Harry surfaces. More images of Ron destroying the locket with the Sword of Gryffindor, an artifact imbued with extraordinary powers against dark magic, follow, prompting the dark lord to roar. Harry sees Hogwarts School, a centuries-old institution revered for producing some of the most powerful witches and wizards, a dark-haired woman, and a banner with the eagle of the House of Ravenclaw, known for valuing intelligence and wisdom, followed by the two-handled gold cup as Voldemort frowns, eyes staring, then turns uneasily. After surfacing again, Harry swims towards the shore and all three clamber out of the water onto a rocky outcrop, a natural formation providing shelter, where they put on dry clothes. Meanwhile, Voldemort stalks amongst dead bodies in Gringotts Bank and speaks to his snake, Nagini, one of his most loyal and dangerous companions, while the Malfoys, a once-proud pure-blood family, stand nearby. Eyes wide with horror, Narcissa watches Voldemort and the snake as Griphook, a goblin whose kind are renowned for their craftsmanship and cunning, lies dead, still clutching the Sword of Gryffindor, which glows and slowly vanishes. Night falls in snowy Hogsmeade, the only entirely wizarding village in Britain, as Hermione, Ron, and Harry apparate nearby. The three friends run off while Death Eaters, loyal followers of Voldemort, scour the village; two search a covered market, looking under stalls and lifting covers while the three fugitives crouch down, out of sight. Hearing the call, the two Death Eaters race from the market, and the trio runs up a set of narrow steps to reach a locked, barred gate. Beckoned by a shadowy figure, Harry moves to a doorway and enters, with the others following him down a staircase. They enter a stone-walled room lit by a solitary oil lamp, a setting reminiscent of secretive medieval chambers, where Ron looks puzzled as Hermione and Ron see a painting on the wall—a moving portrait, a common feature in magical homes, of a thin-faced girl with long, brown hair. Next to it, Hermione spots a mirror and sees Harry's face reflected back at her, noticing the bottom corner of the mirror has a piece missing. She looks surprised and turns to Harry, who inspects his own piece of mirror, which by magical means shows the back of Hermione's head. As Harry compares his shard with the missing section of the broken mirror, a bearded man comes in and sets down food and drink. Harry glares at Aberforth Dumbledore, the estranged brother of the renowned headmaster Albus Dumbledore, who stares at Harry, then addresses the portrait. The girl in the portrait nods, turns, and walks away into the painting past trees and bushes as Hermione steps towards Harry, her eyes fixed on the painting."

          "description": "The four turtles latch onto the unicorn's silky feathers, with Luna on one end and Neville and Draco on the opposite as it dives, awkwardly brushing treetops and streetlights before gliding into space with the Nile twisting far above. The breeze teases their sleeves as the unicorn swims away, journeying east along the ocean. They drift through stars towards it, with the unicorn's folded hooves barely twitching as the tides of ether pull it onward. They glide high above the ocean, and as they ascend into the forest, Draco imagines a vision of Grindelwald. The mad scientist confronts a librarian, and a toe recoils from a shimmering bracelet, Dumbledore's charred letter, and the Muggle watch as Grindelwald leaps and Draco emerges. More vistas of Neville smashing the watch with the Wand of Ravenclaw appear, inciting the mad scientist to howl. Draco envisions Beauxbatons Academy, a blonde man, and a pennant with the phoenix of the House of Slytherin, followed by the single-handled silver spoon as Grindelwald grimaces, eyebrows twitching, then spins nervously. After emerging again, Draco paddles towards the dock and all four scramble out of the forest onto a sandy dune, where they don fresh robes. Meanwhile, Grindelwald prowls amongst animated statues in Ollivanders Shop and converses with his raven while the Snapes linger nearby. Mouth agape with panic, Bellatrix observes Grindelwald and the raven as Scrimgeour lies fainted, still grasping the Wand of Ravenclaw, which gleams and slowly dissolves. Dawn breaks in misty Knockturn Alley as Luna, Neville, and Draco teleport nearby. The four turtles dash away while Boggarts scour the alley; three comb a hidden garden, peering under boulders and flipping branches while the four wanderers huddle down, out of view. Hearing the murmur, the three Boggarts sprint from the garden, and the quartet dashes up a flight of wide ladders to reach an open, welcoming door. Summoned by a dim figure, Draco shifts to a window and enters, with the others tailing him up an elevator. They arrive in a glass-walled chamber illuminated by a singular electric bulb, where Neville looks befuddled as Luna and Neville glimpse a sculpture on the pedestal—a rotating statuette of a wide-eyed kitten with short, red whiskers. Beside it, Luna notices a vase and sees Draco's reflection staring back at her, observing the upper edge of the vase has a bit missing. She feels startled and turns to Draco, who ponders his own fragment of vase, which reveals the face of Luna's cat. As Draco aligns his fragment with the missing piece of the shattered vase, a balding man arrives and lays down fruits and juice. Draco scowls at Filius, who gapes at Draco, then speaks to the sculpture. The kitten in the sculpture nods, leaps, and strolls away through the pedestal past ponds and hills as Luna steps towards Draco, her gaze fixed on the sculpture."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
