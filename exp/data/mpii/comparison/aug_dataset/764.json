In the eerie silence of a postapocalyptic wasteland a hardened survivor scavenges through abandoned ruins haunted by the echoes of a oncethriving civilization now reduced to dust. Beneath the shimmering surface of an underwater kingdom a rebellious mermaid defies ancient traditions to explore forbidden coral reefs and secret caverns brimming with forgotten lore. In the quiet confines of a suburban attic an unassuming teenager stumbles upon a mysterious portal that thrusts him into a surreal world where the very fabric of time and space unravels. On the rugged highlands of Scotland a stoic warrior faces rival clans and ancient curses alike his fierce battle cry resonating across mistcovered moors and turbulent skies. Amid the vibrant chaos of a South American carnival a fearless dancer twirls through streets bursting with color and rhythm each graceful move challenging the rigid boundaries of tradition. During a clandestine meeting in a snowcovered mountain lodge two rival spies exchange cryptic messages hinting at an imminent global conspiracy. Joseph's eyes are on David who is sitting opposite a whitehaired woman at a table. Next to Joseph sits a boy with a thermometer in his mouth and Joseph nods looks pityingly at the other boy. David shakes his head and shakes his head again and yet again and then he swallows his eyes fixed on the woman and stares. He and Joseph are outside humbling through the playground across the colored markings for hopscotch and Joseph shakes his head as dusk falls outside their house. In the kitchen David is at the sink washing up puts down a pan and stops staring at Joseph who is sitting at a table with David's gun in front of him. Joseph picks up the gun holds it in both hands pointing it at David and the gun lands on the table. David grabs it and quickly removes the bullets while Audrey collapses leaning on the table head in hands. David bangs the unloaded gun on the cooker slides down the wall and sits slumped against it while Audrey collapses onto the floor. In the limited edition gallery he stares down at the carpet in the silvergrey room. Street and shop lights glare in the grey evening as people wait to cross a busy junction. In a shop Elijah is motionless glowering and sullen in his wheelchair and the walls are covered with comics individually wrapped in plastic covers which reflect the light."

          "description": "Brian pivots quickly and gazes behind him while Oliver is still whispering to Brenda. In the theater, Brian crouches animatedly on the rim of the escalator, pivots quickly, smiling, not really glancing at the audience, and a young girl in a vivid, yellow raincoat stumbles over him. In the locker room, another young girl in a green and orange raincoat, cloaked over her head, dries her feet, pivots toward the mirror, peers toward the window, and she is surrounded. She delves inside a storage container, retrieves a tiny envelope, tucks it into her hoodie pocket, and, straightening her raincoat, paces quickly out. In the escalator, Brian observes the girl in the vivid yellow raincoat form a crowd for snacks and approaches her. The girl glares at Brian and energetically pivots to encounter him. The girl raises her feet, and Brian taps her shoes, places a finger into one raincoat sleeve, digging around, but discovers nothing, and retreats. The girl glances at him eagerly, and Brian blinks and nods. The girl pivots away, and Brian observes her, yawns, and spins to stroll in the opposite path. Brian pulls out his mobile phone, smiles, and peers forward at the girl in the raincoat, who is also observing him, and the girl swiftly turns away. Greg's gaze rests on Brian, who's lounging next to a brown-bearded gentleman at a bench. Beside Greg, stands a cat with a bowtie on its tail, and Greg smiles, glances supportively at the other cat. Brian shakes his head, and shakes his head once more, and again and again, and then he grins, his gaze fixed on the gentleman, and squints. He and Greg are indoors, sprinting through the gym across the giant shapes for basketball, and Greg shakes his head as dawn rises inside their garage. In the living room, Brian is at the fridge, tidying up, picks up a bowl, and pauses, squinting at Greg, who's lounging at a bench with Brian's book beneath him. Greg picks up the book, clasps it in both feet, waving it at Brian, and the book tumbles on the bench. Brian snatches it and immediately tears out the pages while Brenda rises, leaning on the bench, face in feet. Brian tosses the shredded book on the radiator, slides along the floor, and lounges perched against it, while Brenda rises onto the chair. In the rare edition theater, he glances down at the tiles in the auburn-blue nook. Avenue and café bulbs shimmer in the blue morning as animals rush to cross a silent roadway. In a café, Oliver is animated, beaming and jubilant in his recliner, and the windows are adorned with paintings individually wrapped in glass frames which darken the glow."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

          "description": "David, caught in a tense atmosphere, stands still at a stadium, distracted and bumped by a man in a blue anorak. Another man in a red and blue anorak discreetly retrieves a package from a waste bin. On the walkway, David, suspicious, confronts the man in the blue anorak but finds nothing. He reluctantly steps back, still watching the man, who quickly turns away. David, communicating via walkie-talkie, remains uneasy. Later, he faces tension at home with his son, Joseph, who points David's gun at him before it lands on the table. David removes the bullets, and both he and Audrey slump down in distress. Elsewhere, Elijah sits in a shop, motionless and sullen in his wheelchair, surrounded by light-gleaming comics."
