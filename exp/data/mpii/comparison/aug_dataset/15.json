Jane's singing stops, and panicked, Lester scurries down the hall. Angela crosses to the window and looks out. We see Angela standing at the window in her underwear, looking down at us. We're across from Jane's window, looking in. We zoom toward her, even as Angela poses in the window; we're clearly not interested in Angela. Finally, we settle on the small make-up mirror where we see a reflection of Jane, back at her computer. Ricky sits in darkness with his digicam, videotaping. She's smiling. Then suddenly the drapes close and she's gone. He lowers the camera and smiles, then something below catches his attention. Through a window on the side of the Burnham's garage door, we see Lester, still in his suit, digging through shelves against the back wall. Lester digs through stuff stored on the shelves, searching for something as if his very life depended on it. Suddenly we hear someone trying to open a locked door. Moving swiftly, Ricky pulls the drapes shut and switches on a light. His room is a haven of high-tech.

There is easily twenty thousand dollars worth of equipment in this room. Ricky opens the door. The Colonel stands outside, eyeing him. The Colonel holds out a small plastic cup with a cap. He disappears down the hall. Ricky smiles, shuts and locks his door. He puts the plastic cup on the shelf, then crosses to a mini refrigerator in the corner of his room and takes out a cup-sized Tupperware container from the freezer, already filled with urine, albeit frozen, and places it on a saucer to thaw overnight. Carolyn lies sleeping. Lester is awake, staring at the ceiling. After a moment, he gets up, taking care not to disturb Carolyn, and walks toward the bathroom. The room is filled with steam. Lester looks around, confused, then focuses on: Across from us, in a pedestal bathtub, is Angela. Rose petals float on the surface of the water, obscuring her naked body. Lester kneels by the bathtub like a man in church. She arches her back and looks up at him provocatively. Lester gives her a hard look, then slowly slips his hand into the water between her legs. Her eyes widen and she throws her head back. Close on Carolyn, her eyes wide, listening to the rhythmic brush of Lester's hand as he masturbates under the covers. She flips over and faces him.

Jane's crooning halts, and frantic, Lester dashes down the corridor. Angela strides to the glass and gazes out. We observe Angela standing at the glass in her lingerie, peering down at us. We're opposite Jane's glass, peering in. We zoom toward her, even as Angela poses in the glass; we're evidently not focused on Angela. Ultimately, we settle on the small cosmetic mirror where we perceive a reflection of Jane, back at her workstation. Ricky sits in shadow with his digicam, recording. She's grinning. Then abruptly the curtains close and she's vanished. He lowers the camera and grins, then something below attracts his notice. Through a glass on the flank of the Burnham's garage door, we discern Lester, still in his attire, rifling through racks against the rear wall. Lester rummages through items stored on the racks, hunting for something as though his very existence hinged on it. Abruptly we hear someone attempting to unlatch a locked door. Moving rapidly, Ricky yanks the curtains shut and flicks on a lamp. His space is a shelter of high-tech. A state-of-the-art multimedia computer fills his desk, and premium stereo and video apparatus line the racks, as well as hundreds of CDs. There is readily twenty thousand dollars worth of apparatus in this space. Ricky opens the door. The Colonel stands outdoors, inspecting him. The Colonel extends a small plastic cup with a cap. He vanishes down the corridor. Ricky grins, shuts and secures his door. He places the plastic cup on the rack, then strides to a mini refrigerator in the corner of his space and removes a cup-sized Tupperware container from the freezer, already filled with urine, albeit frozen, and sets it on a plate to thaw overnight. Carolyn lies slumbering. Lester is awake, gazing at the ceiling. After a moment, he rises, taking care not to rouse Carolyn, and strolls toward the bathroom. The space is filled with steam. Lester glances around, perplexed, then concentrates on: Opposite us, in a pedestal bathtub, is Angela. Rose petals drift on the surface of the liquid, obscuring her nude form. Lester kneels by the bathtub like a man in church. She arches her back and gazes up at him suggestively. Lester gives her a hard look, then gradually slips his hand into the liquid between her limbs. Her eyes widen and she throws her head back. Close on Carolyn, her eyes wide, listening to the rhythmic brush of Lester's hand as he masturbates under the covers. She flips over and faces him. Carolyn gets out of bed, repelled."

Jane's singing stops, and in a panic, the hall is scurried down by Lester. The window is crossed to by Angela, who looks out. Angela is seen standing at the window in her underwear, looking down at us. Jane's window is across from us, where we look in. We are zoomed toward her, even as Angela poses in the window; Angela is clearly not of interest to us. Finally, we settle on the small make-up mirror, which shows a reflection of Jane back at her computer. Ricky sits in darkness, videotaping with his digicam. She smiles. Then suddenly, the drapes are closed and she's gone. The camera is lowered by him, and he smiles, then something below catches his attention. Seen through a window on the side of the Burnham's garage door is Lester, still in his suit, digging through shelves against the back wall. Through the stuff stored on the shelves, Lester digs, searching for something as if his very life depended on it. Suddenly, someone is heard trying to open a locked door.

The plastic cup is put on the shelf by him, then he crosses to a mini refrigerator in the corner of his room and takes out a cup-sized Tupperware container from the freezer, already filled with urine, albeit frozen, and places it on a saucer to thaw overnight. Sleeping, Carolyn lies. The ceiling is stared at by Lester, who is awake. After a moment, he gets up, taking care not to disturb Carolyn, and walks toward the bathroom. The room is filled with steam. Around, Lester looks, confused, then focuses on: Across from us, in a pedestal bathtub, is Angela. The surface of the water is obscured by rose petals, hiding her naked body. The bathtub is knelt by Lester like a man in church. Her back is arched by her, and she looks up at him provocatively. A hard look is given to her by Lester, then his hand is slowly slipped into the water between her legs. Her eyes widen and her head is thrown back by her. Close on Carolyn, her eyes wide, she listens to the rhythmic brush of Lester's hand as he masturbates under the covers. Over she flips and faces him. Out of bed, Carolyn gets, repelled."

At the same time, Jane, in an earnest effort to block out the intrusive noise that is overwhelming her, covers her ears firmly with her hands and begins to sing loudly, her voice rising in volume to drown out the unwelcome sound. Her singing comes to a sudden and abrupt stop, and in a state of sheer panic, Lester quickly scurries down the hallway, almost as if fleeing from the tension. Angela, in contrast, calmly makes her way over to the window and gazes out thoughtfully, lost in her own world. We observe Angela standing at the window, dressed only in her underwear, her figure framed against the glass as she looks down at us. Our perspective is one from across Jane's window, where we are peering in. We zoom in toward Angela, even as she strikes a pose in the window, yet it becomes evident that our interest does not center on Angela. Eventually, our focus shifts to the small make-up mirror, where we catch a glimpse of Jane's reflection as she resumes working at her computer. Ricky sits quietly in the darkness, holding his digicam with steady hands, as he diligently records the entire scene. Jane is smiling, seemingly pleased. Then, quite suddenly and without warning, the drapes close, and she vanishes from view. Ricky lowers his camera and smiles contentedly, but then something below catches his attention.

After a few moments, he carefully gets up, taking great care not to disturb Carolyn, and walks toward the bathroom. The room is filled with steam, creating a hazy and dreamlike atmosphere. Lester looks around, momentarily confused, then focuses on the scene before him: Across from us, in a pedestal bathtub, we see Angela. Rose petals float delicately on the surface of the water, artfully obscuring her naked body. Lester kneels by the bathtub, like a man in church, filled with reverence and awe. Angela arches her back and looks up at him provocatively, invitingly. Lester gives her a hard, intense look, then slowly and deliberately slips his hand into the water between her legs. Her eyes widen in response, and she throws her head back in reaction. Close on Carolyn, her eyes wide open, listening to the rhythmic brush of Lester's hand as he masturbates under the covers.

From our vantage point across from Jane's window, we observe Angela standing there in her underwear, looking down at us with a detached air.

Lester returns her gaze with intensity, then slowly, deliberately, slips his hand into the water between her legs. Angela's eyes widen in response, and she throws her head back. Meanwhile, close on Carolyn, her eyes snap open, wide and alert, as she listens to the rhythmic sound of Lester's hand moving under the covers. Repulsed, Carolyn flips over to face him, then decisively gets out of bed, distancing herself from the scene."

Jane covers her ears and starts singing a line from a popular Beatles song to drown her out. Jane's singing stops abruptly as the chaos intensifies, and panicked, Lester scurries down the hall of their suburban home, which has recently felt more like a battleground than a sanctuary. Angela crosses to the window and looks out, her silhouette framed against the early evening sky. We see Angela standing at the window in her underwear, a boldness that reflects the modern societal shift towards body positivity, looking down at us. We're across from Jane's window, looking in from the vantage point of the neighbor's sprawling elm tree. We zoom toward her, even as Angela poses in the window; we're clearly not interested in Angela. Finally, we settle on the small make-up mirror where we see a reflection of Jane, back at her computer, a refuge for the teenager overwhelmed by her parents' ongoing disputes.

Then suddenly the drapes close and she's gone. He lowers the camera and smiles with a mix of satisfaction and sadness, then something below catches his attention. Through a window on the side of the Burnham's garage door, we see Lester, still in his suit from his demoralizing job selling advertising, digging through shelves against the back wall. Lester digs through stuff stored on the shelves, searching for something as if his very life depended on it, perhaps a metaphor for his desperate search for meaning. Suddenly we hear someone trying to open a locked door, the sound echoing like a warning bell. Moving swiftly, Ricky pulls the drapes shut and switches on a light. His room is a haven of high-tech, reflecting his father's military discipline and his own rebellion through technological means. A state-of-the-art multimedia computer crowds his desk, and high-end stereo and video equipment line the shelves, as well as hundreds of CDs, cherished artifacts in the age of digital music. There is easily twenty thousand dollars worth of equipment in this room, a testament to his hidden talents. Ricky opens the door. The Colonel, his father known for his strict demeanor, stands outside, eyeing him with a mixture of suspicion and disappointment. The Colonel holds out a small plastic cup with a cap, a compulsory drug test that has become a ritual between them. He disappears down the hall, the silence heavy with unspoken words. Ricky smiles, shuts and locks his door, a symbolic gesture of maintaining control over his fragmented world. He puts the plastic cup on the shelf, then crosses to a mini refrigerator in the corner of his room and takes out a cup-sized Tupperware container from the freezer, already filled with urine, albeit frozen, a clever ruse to pass his father's tests, and places it on a saucer to thaw overnight. Carolyn lies sleeping beside Lester, who is awake, staring at the ceiling as if seeking answers in the stippled plaster. After a moment, he gets up, taking care not to disturb Carolyn, and walks toward the bathroom. The room is filled with steam, the remnants of a late-night shower. Lester looks around, confused, then focuses on: Across from us, in a pedestal bathtub, is Angela, a vision that haunts his midlife crisis. Rose petals float on the surface of the water, obscuring her naked body, a scene reminiscent of classical art, yet tinged with modern desire. Lester kneels by the bathtub like a man in church, caught between lust and reverence. She arches her back and looks up at him provocatively, aware of the power she holds. Lester gives her a hard look, then slowly slips his hand into the water between her legs, a bold move driven by months of suppressed longing. Her eyes widen and she throws her head back, caught in the intensity of the moment. Close on Carolyn, her eyes wide, listening to the rhythmic brush of Lester's hand as he masturbates under the covers, the sound like a taunt to her unfulfilled desires. She flips over and faces him, the reality of their distant marriage weighing heavily. Carolyn gets out of bed, repelled by the growing chasm between them."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Angela stands at the window in her underwear, but the focus shifts to Jane at her computer, watched by Ricky with his digicam. Ricky captures Jane's smile until she disappears behind closed drapes. He notices Lester, in a suit, searching the garage frantically. Someone tries to unlock Ricky's door, prompting him to hide his high-tech room and prepare for a drug test. Meanwhile, Lester dreams of Angela in a bathtub filled with rose petals. As he fantasizes, Carolyn is disturbed by Lester's actions in bed and turns away, repelled by him."
