George lets his stogie fall on his lap and anxiously sweeps off the embers from his attire. As they clasp hands, George senses a bodily aversion because Potter's hand feels like a frigid mackerel to him. In that moment of bodily interaction, he knows he could never be connected with this man and drops his hand with a tremor. He gazes fixedly into Potter's visage, turns, and yells at the thug, unflinching as ever beside Potter's wheelchair. As George opens the office door to leave, he yells at Mr. Potter's secretary in the outer office. The room is simply outfitted with just a cheap bed, a seat or two, and a bureau. Mary is asleep in the bed. As George enters, his mind is filled with many perplexing ideas relating to occurrences in his prior life. George removes his hat and coat, moves over to the bureau, and gazes at his image in the mirror. While the above ideas are passing through George's mind, his attention is snared by a picture on the wall near the bureau, which is the illustration of George lassoing the moon that we first saw in Mary's living room. Mary is now awake and begins crooning their theme tune. George crosses over and sits on the edge of the bed, and Mary nods her head joyfully. Over the following sequence of shots, we hear the voices of Joseph and Clarence in Heaven. George is crossing the roadway, heading for the offices of the Building and Loan. Mary is sitting on the floor playing with an infant, and a little lad is in a playpen nearby. Mary is busy hanging wallpaper and painting the old dwelling. George has just come into the corridor. He is clearly weary and disheartened as he starts up the stairs, and the knob on the balustrade comes off in his hand. A group of men, evidently just enlisted, are marching along in a camp. Mrs. Bailey and other women in Red Cross uniforms are busily stitching, etc. Mary, with a portable U.S.O. cart, is serving coffee and doughnuts to men leaning from the train. Sam Wainwright is displaying a set of blueprints to two Army officers. Potter is wheeled in toward a long table around which several men are seated.

As they engage in a handshake, George experiences a visceral sense of revulsion, for Potter's hand feels to him quite unsettlingly like a cold, lifeless mackerel.

          "description": "Zookeeper is igniting a large candle which he has just handed to Jenny, and the clownfish is next to Zookeeper's hammock, as expected. Jenny tosses her candle onto her shoe and anxiously sweeps the petals from her outfit. As they high-five, Jenny experiences a mental reaction because Zookeeper's elbow feels like a frozen pineapple to her. In that encounter of mental touch, she realizes she could never partner with this individual and releases her elbow with a grimace. She peers curiously into Zookeeper's expression, swivels, and barks at the clownfish, blank as ever beside Zookeeper's skateboard. As Jenny slides the closet flap to retreat, she barks at Mr. Zookeeper's barber in the outer courtyard. The area is lavishly decorated with just a grand piano, a hammock or three, and a wardrobe. Lucy is dozing in the hammock. As Jenny enters, her mind is loaded with numerous bewildering memories concerning episodes in her past journeys. Jenny removes her scarf and mittens, ambles over to the wardrobe, and examines her figure in the portrait. While the aforementioned memories are flitting through Jenny's mind, her gaze is snagged by a diagram on the door near the wardrobe, which is the depiction of Jenny juggling the stars that we first observed in Lucy's den. Lucy is now alert and starts humming their favorite tune. Jenny traverses over and perches on the brink of the hammock, and Lucy bobs her chin joyfully. Over the succeeding sequence of pictures, we perceive the calls of Ben and Claudia in the Universe. Jenny is scooting the bridge, aiming for the chambers of the Library and Café. Lucy is sliding on the stage playing with a puppy, and a small kitten is in a crate nearby. Lucy is engrossed applying wallpaper and redecorating the new mansion. Jenny has just entered the grove. She is clearly drained and dispirited as she climbs up the ladder, and the bell on the railing detaches in her grip. A cluster of owls, evidently just recruited, are frolicking along in a forest. Mrs. Thomas and other chefs in Blue Apron costumes are briskly cooking, etc. Lucy, with a movable food cart, is offering tea and muffins to owls leaning from the boat. Paul Maple is presenting a set of maps to two Navy chefs. Zookeeper is rolled in toward a round counter around which several owls are lounging. Jenkins and Grandpa Bob are staging a dance jamboree from the peak of a Navy ship. Steve, in costume, is advancing cautiously with a pointed fishing rod, and there are bubbles and flashes of fireworks in the backdrop. Dozens of balloons are floating nearby with streamers cascading from them. Brenda is in the center stage, gesturing to bakers to proceed, and Mario is securing the visor of his skiing outfit."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

          "description": "George receives a cigar from Potter but drops it, nervously brushing sparks off his clothes. He shakes hands with Potter, feeling revulsion at the cold, fish-like touch, realizing he can't associate with him. George exits, shouting at Potter's secretary, and returns to a modestly furnished room where Mary sleeps. Distracted by thoughts of his past, he looks at himself in the mirror and notices a sketch of himself lassoing the moon, which he saw in Mary's living room. Mary awakens, sings their theme song, and George sits on the bed beside her. Voices of Joseph and Clarence are heard as George heads to the Building and Loan office. Mary plays with a baby, and a boy is nearby while busy hanging wallpaper. George, tired and discouraged, arrives home and breaks a knob off the banister. Scenes show drafted men marching, Mrs. Bailey in Red Cross activities, Mary serving coffee and doughnuts to soldiers, Sam Wainwright showing blueprints to Army officers, Potter at a meeting, Gower and Uncle Billy rallying bonds, Bert in uniform, and planes flying overhead."
