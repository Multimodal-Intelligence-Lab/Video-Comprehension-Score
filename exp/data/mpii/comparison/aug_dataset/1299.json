Daylight fills the family room, and he is alone on the couch and alone in the room. He looks to where the television used to be, which is not there, and then moves to his feet and looks around the room. His eyes stop on an extension cord that runs from a wall outlet in the family room, across the front hall, and under a closet door. Graham moves to the door, opens the closet, and sees Merrill looking up. Merrill is seated on a kitchen chair with the television on a roll-away stand crammed in with him. Graham looks at the TV screen, which shows a daylight shot of Mexico City with empty skies above it. Merrill puts a finger on the screen and trails it to the bottom. Graham opens the bathroom door and steps out with wet hair, towel drying it as he moves to his bedroom window. He observes the large, green backyard with a wooden jungle gym, a single tree that shades a picnic table, and corn crops lining the back, golden and brown, six feet high, stretching beyond view. Graham stares at them quietly and listens closely. He walks into the hall and looks into the room where Morgan and Bo are seated on the edge of their bed with tin foil wrapped around their heads like helmets. Graham stares at his children, enters the room, and the children make space for him on the bed where he takes a seat between them. Morgan puts a book on his father's lap, and Graham looks for a picture on the back cover while Morgan closes the book. Graham gazes at his children with foil on their heads as Morgan puts the book on his lap again and opens it. Graham acknowledges with a nod and turns the page to see an illustration of a small, bulbous-headed figure shaking hands with a bearded human. Morgan turns the page, revealing a space ship hovering over a home, shooting laser beams at it, and a picture of a house with three bodies lying dead on the front lawn, two of which are children. The children scream and cling to their father until their screams die down. Graham closes the book as the phone rings again. He gets up, steps out into the hallway, tucks the book under his arm, and picks up the phone. Through the phone, there is sudden scuffling, a chair squealing against the floor, and then the phone disconnects.",

Sunlight fills the family space, and he is solitary on the sofa and solitary in the space. He glances to where the TV used to be, which is absent, and then rises to his feet and glances around the space. His eyes halt on an extension cable that runs from a wall socket in the family space, across the front corridor, and beneath a closet portal. Graham advances to the portal, opens the closet, and notices Merrill gazing upwards. Merrill is positioned on a cooking chair with the TV on a roll-away stand jammed in with him. Graham glances at the TV display, which presents a sunlight shot of Mexico City with vacant heavens above it. Merrill places a digit on the display and trails it to the bottom. Graham opens the washroom portal and steps out with damp hair, towel drying it as he advances to his bedroom window. He observes the large, verdant backyard with a wooden play structure, a single tree that shades a picnic bench, and maize crops lining the back, golden and brown, six feet high, stretching beyond view. Graham surveys them quietly and listens intently. He strides into the corridor and glances into the space where Morgan and Bo are positioned on the edge of their bed with tin foil wrapped around their heads like helmets. Graham surveys his offspring, enters the space, and the offspring make room for him on the bed where he occupies a seat between them. Morgan places a volume on his father's lap, and Graham glances for a picture on the back cover while Morgan shuts the volume. Graham gazes at his offspring with foil on their heads as Morgan places the volume on his lap again and opens it. Graham acknowledges with a nod and turns the page to see an illustration of a diminutive, bulbous-headed being shaking hands with a bearded human. Morgan turns the page, revealing a spacecraft hovering over a residence, discharging laser beams at it, and a picture of a dwelling with three bodies lying lifeless on the front lawn, two of which are offspring. The offspring shriek and cling to their father until their shrieks diminish. Graham shuts the volume as the telephone rings again. He rises, steps out into the corridor, tucks the volume under his arm, and picks up the telephone. Through the telephone, there is abrupt scuffling, a chair squealing against the floor, and then the telephone disconnects."

Merrill's mouth opens slightly, perhaps in surprise or a sense of curiosity, and Graham, his eyes widening in response, turns once more to gaze at the television. Daylight streams generously into the family room, bathing it in bright, natural light, and he finds himself alone on the couch, solitary in the spacious room. He glances over to the spot where the television used to be, noticing now its absence, then rises to his feet, casting his gaze around the room, which is filled with a tranquil stillness. His eyes settle on an extension cord that snakes its way from a wall outlet in the family room, extending across the front hall, and vanishing beneath a closet door. With curiosity, Graham moves toward the door, opens it, and discovers Merrill seated in a kitchen chair, looking up at him. Merrill, accompanied by the television perched on a roll-away stand, is crammed into the small, confined space with him. Graham's eyes drift to the TV screen, which portrays a daylight scene of Mexico City, with vast, empty skies stretching boundlessly above it. Merrill traces a finger down the screen to its bottom. Graham then opens the bathroom door and steps out, his hair draped in wetness, as he towel-dries it with deliberate care while making his way to his bedroom window. From there, he takes in the view of the expansive, green backyard, complete with a sturdy wooden jungle gym, a solitary tree providing cooling shade to a picnic table, and a row of corn crops lining the back, their tall, golden and brown stalks reaching six feet high and stretching beyond what the eye can see. Graham gazes quietly at them, listening with intent. He walks into the hallway and peers into the room where Morgan and Bo are seated on the very edge of their bed, with their heads wrapped in tin foil like makeshift helmets intended for protection. Graham gazes at his children, enters the room, and they kindly make space for him on the bed, where he takes a place between them.

Merrill's mouth opens a bit and Graham turns back to the television with his eyes opening. Daylight fills the family room and he is alone on the couch and alone in the room. He looks to where the television used to be which is not there and then moves to his feet and looks around the room. His eyes stop on an extension cord that runs from a wall outlet in the family room across the front hall and under a closet door. Graham moves to the door opens the closet and sees Merrill looking up. Graham acknowledges with a nod and turns the page to see an illustration of a small bulbousheaded figure shaking hands with a bearded human. Morgan turns the page revealing a space ship hovering over a home shooting laser beams at it and a picture of a house with three bodies lying dead on the front lawn two of which are children. The children scream and cling to their father until their screams die down. Graham closes the book as the phone rings again. He gets up steps out into the hallway tucks the book under his arm and picks up the phone. Through the phone there is sudden scuffling a chair squealing against the floor and then the phone disconnects."

          "description": "Baxter grins, and the pair of them swivel back to the whispering canvas of the projector. Lindsay's jaw flutters slightly, and Baxter swivels back to the projector with his eyes widening. Moonlight floods the dining chamber, and he is solitary on the lounger and solitary in the space. He glances to where the projector once was, which is absent, and then rises to his knees and glances throughout the chamber. His gaze halts on a power strip that snakes from a corner socket in the dining chamber, across the main corridor, and beneath a pantry hatch. Baxter advances to the hatch, unlatches the pantry, and spots Lindsay peering upward. Lindsay is perched on a porch stool with the projector on a wheeled rack squeezed in beside her. Baxter peers at the projector canvas, which displays a moonlit image of Tokyo with vacant clouds hovering over it. Lindsay places a fingernail on the canvas and drags it downward. Baxter unlatches the shower hatch and steps forth with damp fur, cloth fluffing it as he advances to his sleeping chamber portal. He surveys the vast, verdant lawn with a metal climbing frame, a lone shrub that shades a dining bench, and wheat fields bordering the rear, amber and tan, seven feet tall, reaching beyond sight. Baxter glares at them mutely and listens intently. He strides into the corridor and peeks into the space where Bailey and Kim are poised on the fringe of their mattress with parchment wrapped around their skulls like visors. Baxter glares at his offspring, enters the space, and the offspring create a gap for him on the mattress where he rests between them. Bailey places a magazine on his father's knees, and Baxter searches for an illustration on the back cover while Bailey seals the magazine. Baxter gazes at his offspring with parchment on their skulls as Bailey places the magazine on his knees again and unfolds it. Baxter acknowledges with a tilt and flips the sheet to reveal a depiction of a tiny, squash-headed entity embracing a mustached beast. Bailey flips the sheet, unveiling a hovercraft floating above a kennel, launching beams at it, and a depiction of a kennel with three silhouettes lying lifeless on the front patch, two of which are cubs. The cubs yell and clutch their sire until their yells fade. Baxter seals the magazine as the buzzer chimes again. He rises, steps into the corridor, tucks the magazine beneath his limb, and answers the buzzer. Through the buzzer, there is abrupt clattering, a stool screeching against the tiles, and then the buzzer severs."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

          "description": "Graham and Merrill are watching a silent television when daylight fills the room, revealing Graham alone. Noticing the TV's absence, Graham follows an extension cord to a closet where Merrill sits with the TV showing Mexico's quiet sky. After drying his hair, Graham observes the backyard's serenity and enters a room where his children, Morgan and Bo, sit with tin foil \"helmets.\" Joining them, Graham explores a book with illustrations of aliens and spaceships. The children scream upon seeing a disturbing image, then calm down. Graham closes the book when the phone rings, steps out, and answers, only to hear scuffling and a disconnection."
