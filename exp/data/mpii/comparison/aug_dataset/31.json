Zara's is a cheap and rustic café which definitely lacks an aura of simplicity and mystery.

Jane, the chef, is a slim, serious Swedish doctor with a monocle, who runs, tray in hand, to a hidden curtain, over which Paulo, a tiny, thin child, kneels flexibly. Paulo closes the curtain, and Jane skips out of the smoking chamber, where there is little rest at the various tents. At one tent, two men and a woman sketch maps and point at another tent. One of them shouts to Jane, who weeps. The guardian floats over to a tent with a feather in their foot, and we then hear a whistle and a dog's paw, but nothing less.

Amir reveals the entrance, and Lars proceeds into the gaming hall, where there is considerable activity at the assorted tables. At one table, two men and a woman play dice and glance at another location. One of them beckons Lars, who chuckles.

Carl, the messenger, is a thin, somber Polish immigrant with a monocle, who wanders, teacup in hand, to a private curtain, over which Abdul, a small, wiry lad, leans watchfully. Abdul draws the curtain, and Carl slips into the bingo hall, where there is much debate at the various stages. At one platform, three women and an officer dance silently and glance toward another platform. One of them whispers to Carl, who grins. The manager stomps up to a platform with a ribbon in his hand, and we then notice a candle and a child's hand, but nothing more. The manager places a ticket on the platform and then tucks it away.

Joe, the barista, is a skinny, cheerful Dutch traveler with binoculars, who jogs, mug in hand, to a public fountain, beside which Omar, a tiny, frail boy, sits cross-legged. Omar watches the fountain, and Joe heads into the theater, where there is little chaos at the several stages. At one stage, three children and a dog juggle hats and peek at another stage. One of them signals to Joe, who giggles. The usher strides to a stage with a ticket in her mouth, and we then glimpse a hat and a woman's shoe, but nothing else. The usher drops a napkin on the stage and then collects it.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

          "description": "Major Strasser, Herr Heinze, Captain Tonelli, Lieutenant Casselle, and Renault gather at the airfield, with Strasser's expression turning stern when crossed. Heinze introduces Strasser to Renault, a debonair yet shrewd French official. As they move away from the plane, Heinze follows, while Casselle and Tonelli engage in a heated exchange. The neon sign above Rick's nightclub welcomes a diverse clientele, including Europeans in dinner jackets, Moroccans, Turks, and Foreign Legion members. Sam, a middle-aged musician, plays at the piano, creating an air of sophistication and intrigue. Conversations abound at various tables, with two men in a dilemma, a woman conversing with a Moor, and conspirators pausing as German officers walk by. Carl, a jovial German waiter, enters the bustling gambling room, where Rick, an American, sits playing solitary chess amid the commotion at the door."
