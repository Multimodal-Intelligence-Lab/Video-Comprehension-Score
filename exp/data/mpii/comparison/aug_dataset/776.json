A spire of flame and dense ebony smoke fills the atmosphere as Kate embraces Noah by her side. Charlie scrambles back to his feet as fireballs descend behind him from the colossal explosion, standing with his arms extended wide as a gigantic fragment plummets directly into him while fireballs pummel down on the park. Jackson maneuvers the RV along the road through this destruction, veering to avoid colliding debris and then aligning the vehicle before a fireball impacts the rear of the RV, leaving a blazing gap. On the runway, Noah gazes out of the aircraft, and Kate stands appearing uneasy as molten stones crash down on the research facility with the flaming rocks battering the region. A crack splits the earth between the RV and the runway as Jackson speeds up, making the RV leap. The terrain collapses away as the RV lands narrowly between the broadening chasm, and Jackson pulls up behind the aircraft. Kate dashes over as Jackson appears, rushing back to the aircraft with Lilly. The tarmac fractures as Jackson glances back into the RV and finds a London tube chart before an enormous searing crack breaks open, and the RV tips backward into it. Jackson falls along the center aisle and desperately seizes a grip as, at the aircraft's controls, Gordon glances over his shoulder and sets the aircraft moving.

Charlie clambers back to his feet while fireballs rain down behind him from the massive eruption, and he stands with his hands up wide as right into him crashes a huge chunk while the park is slammed down on by fireballs. The RV is driven by Jackson along the road through this carnage; crashing rock is avoided by swerving, and then the vehicle is straightened before the back of the RV is hit by a fireball, leaving a flaming hole. On the runway, the plane is peered out of by Noah, and anxious Kate stands looking as the research center is crashed down on by molten rocks with the area being hammered by the flaming rocks. Between the RV and the runway, a fissure splits the ground as the RV is accelerated by Jackson, making it jump. The ground is fallen away by as the RV lands narrowly between the widening canyon, and behind the plane it is pulled up by Jackson. Over, Kate rushes as Jackson emerges, hurrying back to the plane with Lilly. The tarmac is cracked by Jackson as back into the RV he looks and finds a London tube map before a big burning fissure is broken open, and into it, the RV tips backward.

The ground is slammed into by fireballs trailing thick columns as to the end of the runway the plane rises, with flaming rocks arrowing through the sky as a hilltop is cleared by Gordon and a volcanic eruption is outrun. On the plane, the cloud gains, passing the occupants in shadow, before from the swirling cloud the plane is rocketed and flown away from the fireballs. A thumbs up is given by Noah as to Jackson, who is caught in his breath as he opens up the map, and Kate turns, revealing a big map of China while at him everyone stares dubiously. Around, Gordon looks from the pilot seat as into Anheuser's office Adrian hurries, following him into the corridor buzzing with activity.

A tower of fire and thick black smoke, reminiscent of the pyroclastic flows from Mount St. Helens in 1980, fills the air as Kate hugs Noah by her side. Charlie clambers back to his feet as fireballs, similar to those seen during catastrophic eruptions, rain down behind him from the massive eruption, standing with his hands up wide as a huge chunk crashes right into him while fireballs slam down on the park. Jackson, who once navigated through hazardous terrains as a cross-country driver, drives the RV along the road through this carnage, swerving to avoid crashing rock and then straightening the vehicle before a fireball hits the back of the RV, leaving a flaming hole. On the runway, a place of supposed safety now turned dangerous, Noah peers out of the plane, and Kate stands looking anxious as molten rocks, reminiscent of the volcanic debris from Icelandâ€™s EyjafjallajÃ¶kull eruption in 2010, crash down on the research center with the flaming rocks hammering the area. A fissure, similar to those formed during tectonic shifts, splits the ground between the RV and the runway as Jackson accelerates, making the RV jump. The ground falls away as the RV lands narrowly between the widening canyon, and Jackson pulls up behind the plane. Kate rushes over as Jackson emerges, hurrying back to the plane with Lilly. The tarmac, now cracking under the intense pressure, gives way as Jackson looks back into the RV and finds a London tube map, perhaps a reminder of a world less chaotic, before a big burning fissure breaks open, and the RV tips backward into it. Jackson falls along the center aisle and desperately grabs a handle as, at the plane's controls, Gordon, a former flight instructor with nerves of steel, looks over his shoulder and sets the plane moving. Fireballs, as ferocious as those in a meteor shower, hit the ground by the runway as a hand appears on the jagged edge of the fissure, followed by another hand clutching a map. Thick smoke fills the sky as Jackson sprints along the runway after the plane, with Kate grabbing and yanking him inside the plane. Fireballs trailing thick columns slam into the ground as the plane rises to the end of the runway, with flaming rocks arrowing through the sky as Gordon clears a hilltop and outruns a volcanic eruption that rivals the infamous Krakatoa event of 1883.

Noah gives a thumbs up as Kate turns to Jackson, who catches his breath and opens up the map, revealing a big map of China, a destination shrouded in mystery and hope in times of disaster while everyone stares at him dubiously.

Harold scrambles back to his knees as icicles rain down behind him from the colossal explosion, standing with his fingers spread wide as a gigantic slab crashes right into him while icicles pummel the stadium.

Thomas scrambles back to his knees as hailstones cascade down ahead of him from the colossal avalanche, standing with his arms outstretched as a giant block crushes him while hailstones pummel the stadium. Oliver sails the submarine along the coast through this chaos, veering to dodge falling ice and then steadying the vessel before a hailstone smashes into the bow, leaving a frozen dent.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby cafÃ©, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
