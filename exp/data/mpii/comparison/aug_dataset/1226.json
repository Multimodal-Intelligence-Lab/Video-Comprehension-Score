Emily presses down a lever, and the piston arms pump, picking up paper, setting it on the platen, and printing on it. Emily watches in amazement, then wraps her arms around Ben's neck and hugs him tight. Ben gradually responds to her touch, rests his head on her shoulder, closes his eyes, and lays his hands on her back. A tearful Emily nuzzles into him, and Ben stands back, gently drawing her to him and planting a lingering kiss on her lips. Emily brushes her fingers against Ben's cheek as they continue kissing passionately. They break off and stand with their foreheads together. Ben pulls back a little and kisses her fingertips. Ben hurries out of the workshop, steps over the low picket fence, goes to unlock his car, and takes out the gift. His brother, Ben, now Tim, goes to his car and reaches in for the ID, which he hands to his brother, Ben. Tim, who has put his gift back in the car, looks sheepish while the real Ben considers uneasily for a moment. Tim reaches into his jeans' pocket and hands them over, then walks briskly back towards the house, breaking into a jog. He steps back over the picket fence and returns to the workshop, where Emily sits in a sultry pose, waiting for him. Emily stands, and shuffling uneasily, Tim reluctantly moves away from Emily's touch. Ever-persistent, she draws his face to her and kisses his cheek. Tim calms a little and lets her kiss his cheek several more times. Cupping his face in her hands, Emily kisses Tim on the lips, and Tim remains motionless with his eyes closed but gradually begins to kiss her back as tears roll down his cheeks. The couple wrap their arms tightly around each other as they continue to kiss with mounting passion. Emily's arms are around Tim's neck as he lifts her legs and holds her in his arms. They kiss again, and Tim carries her out of the workshop. Tim and Emily, still kissing, fall back on gold satin pillows, and Tim kneels astride Emily, who helps him off with his polo shirt. She sees a long scar running from his side and back. In golden light, Emily slips off her delicate sandals and undoes the clasp on her halterneck dress. She and Tim move slowly into a tender kiss, and Tim lays a hand gently on a scar on Emily's naked breast and kisses it.

Amazement is shown by Emily as she watches, then Ben's neck is wrapped around by her arms as she hugs him tight. Her touch is gradually responded to by Ben, and his head is rested on her shoulder, his eyes are closed, and her back is laid on by his hands. Into him, a tearful Emily is nuzzled, while back is stood by Ben, and her to him is gently drawn, as a lingering kiss is planted on her lips. Against Ben's cheek, her fingers are brushed by Emily as a passionate kiss is continued. The kiss is broken off, and with their foreheads together, they stand. Back is pulled by Ben a little, and her fingertips are kissed by him. Out of the workshop is hurried by Ben, and over the low picket fence, he is stepped, going to his car to unlock it and taking out the gift.

A little calmed is Tim, allowing his cheek to be kissed several more times. Tim's face is cupped in her hands by Emily as his lips are kissed, and motionless with eyes closed, Tim remains but back gradually begins to kiss her as tears roll down his cheeks. Each other is tightly wrapped around by the couple's arms as a kiss with mounting passion is continued. Around Tim’s neck, Emily's arms are as her legs are lifted and held in his arms. A kiss is given again, and out of the workshop, she is carried by Tim. On gold satin pillows, Tim and Emily, still kissing, fall back, while across Emily Tim kneels and off with his polo shirt helps him. From his side and back, a long scar is seen by her. In golden light, off comes Emily’s delicate sandals, and undone is the clasp on her halterneck dress.

          "description": "The Robot is now shimmering as it advances with a skeptical grin. Alex reaches for the knob, and his eyes widen as he gazes at Sam in wonderment as the propellers spin. Alex pulls down a handle, and the gearboxes churn, lifting fabric, placing it on the easel, and sketching on it. Alex observes in astonishment, then wraps his arms around Sam's waist and squeezes him tight. Sam slowly reacts to his embrace, leans his head on his arm, closes his eyes, and rests his fingers on his shoulder. A tearful Alex snuggles into him, and Sam steps back, gently pulling him closer and offering a lingering peck on his forehead. Alex traces his fingers against Sam's nose as they continue pecking tenderly. They separate and stand with their noses touching. Sam draws back a bit and pecks his knuckles. Sam rushes out of the studio, hops over the small stone wall, goes to open his bike, and pulls out the parcel. His sister, Sam, now Pat, goes to her bike and reaches in for the badge, which she hands to her sister, Sam. Pat, who has put her parcel back in the bike, looks bashful while the real Sam ponders awkwardly for a moment. Pat reaches into her coat's pocket and gives them over, then strides briskly back towards the cabin, breaking into a dash. She hops back over the stone wall and returns to the studio, where Alex sits in a reclining stance, waiting for her. Alex stands, and shifting nervously, Pat hesitantly withdraws from Alex's embrace. Always determined, he pulls her face to him and pecks her nose. Pat calms a little and lets him peck her nose several more times. Holding her face in his hands, Alex pecks Pat on the hand, and Pat remains still with her eyes shut but gradually begins to peck him back as snowflakes fall down her nose. The pair wrap their arms tightly around each other as they continue to peck with growing affection. Alex's arms are around Pat's waist as he lifts her feet and holds her in his embrace. They peck again, and Pat carries her out of the studio. Pat and Alex, still pecking, topple back on emerald velvet cushions, and Pat kneels beside Alex, who helps him off with his sweater. He spots a long tattoo stretching from her arm and elbow. In emerald light, Alex slips off his sturdy boots and undoes the clasp on his turtleneck sweater. He and Pat move slowly into a gentle peck, and Pat rests a hand softly on a tattoo on Alex's bare shoulder and pecks it. Outside, snow covers a window, making the image of the pecking pair inside blurry."

He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call.

He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
