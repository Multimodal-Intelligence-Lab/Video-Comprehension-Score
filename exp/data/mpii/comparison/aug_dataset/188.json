Finally, the dog's legs stop moving and dangle lifelessly. Laurie and Tommy are sitting on the couch watching the Horror-thon on TV. Laurie holds out her hand, and Tommy takes it, and together they walk into the kitchen. Annie walks through the passageway to the laundry room, wearing a nylon robe and carrying her clothes to be washed. The wind blows the robe open as the door creaks open, and Annie walks into the dark laundry room. In the light from the main house, Annie sees the light switch. Almost immediately, the wind blows the door shut. Annie stands motionless for a moment, then begins looking for the light switch and turns toward the slightly open door. Behind the door, we see the outline of the shape standing there. The wind blows the door open a little wider, and she glances outside the door. She steps back inside and crosses to the washing machine, opens the top, and dumps her clothes inside. Suddenly, a big gust of wind comes through the opened window above her, and the door slams shut. Annie hurries to the door and tries to open it, but she is unsuccessful and tries to pull the door open. Meanwhile, Lindsey Wallace, 8 years old with a pretty face, watches the Horror Marathon at top volume on TV and lets the phone ring away.

We perceive the figure's limbs a few yards from the residence, adjacent to Lester's limbs, thrashing and writhing a few yards above the earth; off screen, the figure is throttling the canine in mid-air. Finally, the canine's limbs cease moving and hang lifelessly. Laurie and Tommy are seated on the settee observing the Horror-thon on TV. Laurie extends out her hand, and Tommy grasps it, and jointly they stroll into the culinary area. Annie strolls through the corridor to the laundry chamber, wearing a nylon gown and bearing her garments to be laundered. The breeze blows the gown open as the portal squeaks open, and Annie strolls into the dim laundry chamber. In the illumination from the main residence, Annie perceives the light switch. Almost instantly, the breeze blows the portal shut. Annie stands still for a moment, then commences searching for the light switch and pivots toward the slightly ajar portal. Behind the portal, we perceive the silhouette of the figure standing there. The breeze blows the portal open a little broader, and she peeks outside the portal. She steps rearward inside and crosses to the washing apparatus, opens the top, and deposits her garments inside. Abruptly, a large gust of wind arrives through the opened casement above her, and the portal bangs shut. Annie hastens to the portal and attempts to open it, but she is unsuccessful and endeavors to pull the portal open. Meanwhile, Lindsey Wallace, 8 years of age with an attractive countenance, observes the Horror Marathon at top intensity on TV and lets the telephone chime away. Annie pivots and peeks at the casement above the washing apparatus, where we perceive the figure gazing in, but then the figure is absent. She swiftly crosses to the washing apparatus, ascends up on top of it, and starts out the casement, but midway through she becomes wedged. Lindsey finally rises and ambles to the telephone, her eyes riveted on the TV. Lindsey pulls on Annie's limbs, and she slides from the casement onto the dryer. As Annie and Lindsey stroll back into the residence, the telephone chimes, and from the residence, Annie hears the telephone chime. Lindsey races across the chamber and picks it up, then sets down the handset and strolls out of the culinary area. Annie gives Lindsey a dirty glance and picks it up. Abruptly, behind Annie, the figure strolls through the corridor between the residing chamber and the culinary area. Annie then strolls into the residing chamber."

Finally, the dog's legs are stopped from moving and dangle lifelessly. The couch is sat on by Laurie and Tommy while they watch the Horror-thon on TV. Laurie's hand is held out, and it is taken by Tommy, and together the kitchen is walked into by them. The passageway to the laundry room is walked through by Annie, wearing a nylon robe and carrying her clothes to be washed.

Laurie reaches out her hand, and Tommy takes it, and together they make their way toward the kitchen.

Finally, the dog's legs stop moving and dangle lifelessly, a sight that mirrors the suspenseful atmosphere of a horror film. Laurie and Tommy are sitting on the couch watching the Horror-thon on TV, an annual event known for showcasing classic horror movies.

Annie walks through the passageway to the laundry room, which is known for its frequent drafts, wearing a nylon robe and carrying her clothes to be washed. The wind, a frequent visitor in this creaky old house, blows the robe open as the door creaks open, and Annie walks into the dark laundry room. In the light from the main house, Annie sees the light switch, one that often flickers due to faulty wiring. Almost immediately, the wind blows the door shut, a common nuisance in this part of the house. Annie stands motionless for a moment, then begins looking for the light switch and turns toward the slightly open door. Behind the door, we see the outline of the shape standing there, a silent sentinel of fear. The wind blows the door open a little wider, and she glances outside the door. She steps back inside and crosses to the washing machine, a vintage model known for its durability, opens the top, and dumps her clothes inside. Suddenly, a big gust of wind comes through the opened window above her, known to stick open on stormy nights, and the door slams shut. Annie hurries to the door and tries to open it, but she is unsuccessful and tries to pull the door open. Meanwhile, Lindsey Wallace, 8 years old with a pretty face and an adventurous spirit, watches the Horror Marathon at top volume on TV and lets the phone ring away, too absorbed in the cinematic scares to notice. Annie turns and glances at the window above the washing machine, where we see the shape looking in, but then the shape is gone, disappearing as silently as it appeared. She quickly crosses to the washing machine, climbs up on top of it, and starts out the window, but halfway through she gets stuck, a predicament all too common with this narrow escape route. Lindsey finally gets up and walks to the phone, her eyes pivoted on the TV, a suspenseful masterpiece from the mid-20th century. Lindsey pulls on Annie's legs, and she slides from the window onto the dryer, landing with a soft thud. As Annie and Lindsey walk back into the house, the phone rings, a persistent ring that echoes through the evening air, and from the house, Annie hears the phone ring. Lindsey races across the room and picks it up, then sets down the receiver and walks out of the kitchen, her mind already drifting back to the horror on screen. Annie gives Lindsey a dirty look and picks it up. Suddenly, behind Annie, the shape walks through the hallway between the living room and the kitchen, its presence foreboding and silent. Annie then walks into the living room, a space now tinged with an unseen tension."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
