His wheels spin rapidly as he becomes airborne, momentarily soaring before he crashes back down to the earth in the foreground with a thunderous impact, and then he roars away into the distance. The scene shifts dramatically from the open desert environment to a dimly lit street at twilight, where we find the Arizona house. The Biker's roaring engine and the clanking noise of his chains grow fainter, gradually fading until he seems to dissolve into nothingness, leaving behind only the sight of the empty street and the distant image of the Arizona house.\n\nAn eerily beautiful singing begins to emerge, with the haunting voice of a woman crooning a lullaby, as the receding roar of the Biker's presence slowly fades away.

The high-pitched drone becomes increasingly prominent, gradually gaining strength under the cover of the singing, and the camera starts to pick up speed. As this relentless drone grows louder, it reveals itself to be not just any noise but a chilling human scream, setting the tone as the viewpoint draws closer to the Arizona house, where a ladder leans against the building, leading up to a second-story window. As the pace of movement intensifies, the scream nearly drowns out the lullaby, becoming overwhelmingly dominant. The camera surges toward the house, straight to the base of the ladder, irresistibly pulled in by the ongoing, ear-splitting scream.

His wheels spin rapidly and eagerly as he becomes airborne, soaring for a brief moment before he crashes back down onto the earth in the foreground with a resounding, thunderous impact. After landing, he roars away into the distance, leaving behind a trail of noise.

As the crane descends further, he momentarily disappears from view over the rise, hidden from sight, creating an anticipatory pause. Then, with sudden intensity, a powerful ROAR heralds his emergence as he tops the rise, propelling himself into the air with wheels now spinning rapidly beneath him. He crashes back down to earth in the foreground, the impact echoing as he reestablishes connection with the ground and quickly accelerates to roar away. The scene transitions from the arid, expansive desert to a twilight street where the Arizona house stands, casting shadows in the dimming light. The roar of the Biker's engine, accompanied by the metallic clanking of his chains, gradually fades as he seemingly dissolves into thin air, leaving behind an empty street where the distant Arizona house can be seen. As the sound of the Biker's departure diminishes, eerily beautiful singing emerges, a woman's voice delicately rendering a lullaby that fills the silence with haunting melody. Beneath this ethereal singing, a faint droning high-pitched noise becomes perceptible, adding an undercurrent of tension to the scene. The camera begins its journey, floating forward near the ground, moving incrementally yet deliberately toward the Arizona house, and the drone becomes less faint, increasingly blending with the singing. As the camera accelerates, the drone escalates in volume, gradually transforming until it reveals itself to be a human scream, piercing the auditory landscape. The approach to the Arizona house unveils a ladder propped securely against the structure, leading to a second-story window, intensifying the intrigue. With increasing velocity, the scream nearly buries the singing, amplifying the urgency of the scene. The camera hastens its approach to the house, irresistibly drawn toward the base of the ladder by the pull of the harrowing scream. Without deceleration, it ascends the ladder with force, propelled upward by the deafening scream's propulsion. Upon reaching the top, it crashes through the billowing white curtains of the open second-story window and enters the nursery, where Florence Arizona is revealed with her back to us, her body rigid as she releases a piercing scream over the crib. The view rushes toward her, closing the distance rapidly as she rotates, hands clamped tightly over her ears, her mouth stretched wide in an ear-splitting shriek. The camera draws in for an extreme close-up, focusing intently on her gaping mouth and the wildly vibrating epiglottis within, capturing the raw intensity of the moment. Abruptly, the scene changes, the scream is silenced in an instant, and the previously obscured lullaby singing becomes audible once more. Morning light bathes the scene as perspiration beads on Hi's forehead, indicating his recent awakening as Ed gently paces back and forth, delicately bouncing the baby in her arms while singing a soothing lullaby. Hi rises from bed as the orange sun begins its upward ascent, its rumbling awakening the day. The sun's rumble is suddenly interrupted by the high-pitched ba-WEEEEeeee of a strobe, indicative of a flash picture being taken. The perspective shifts to view over Nathan Jr.'s shoulder as he stands at his open front door, confronted by a group of press people assembled on the porch, their cameras poised and ready. An obie light mounted above a local TV news camera casts a glaring spotlight into the scene, while various flashbulbs intermittently pop, capturing the moment in a flurry."

As the crane descends, he momentarily disappears from view over the rise in the rugged terrain of the Arizona desert; then suddenly - ROAR - he tops the rise and, with wheels spinning from his custom-built dirt bike, becomes airborne. He crashes back down to earth in the foreground and roars away with the dust trailing behind. The scene shifts from the vast, barren desert to a twilight street where the Arizona house, a mid-century bungalow typical of the region, is located. The roar of the Biker's engine and the clank of his chains recede into the distance as he gradually dissolves into thin air, leaving us looking at the empty street and the faraway Arizona house, reminiscent of classic Americana architecture. Eerily beautiful singing, a woman singing a lullaby that echoes with haunting sweetness, emerges as the receding roar fades. Behind the singing, a droning high-pitched noise, similar to feedback from an old radio, is faintly audible. The camera begins to float forward very close to the ground, slowly moving toward the Arizona house. The high-pitched drone becomes less faint under the singing, as if signaling an impending climax, and the camera accelerates. The drone grows louder, revealing itself to be a human scream, an expression of terror or agony, as the approach to the Arizona house shows a weathered wooden ladder propped up to a second-story window. As the speed of movement increases, the scream nearly buries the singing. The camera rushes to the house, toward the base of the ladder, drawn in by the sustained scream. Without slowing, it hurtles straight up the ladder, propelled forward by the deafening scream. Reaching the top, it crashes through the white curtains of the open second-story window into the nursery, revealing Florence Arizona, Hi and Ed's neighbor known for her dramatic outbursts, with her back to us, screaming over the crib. The view rockets toward her as she turns, hands pressed to her ears to dampen the sound, mouth stretched wide in an ear-splitting shriek, drawing in for an extreme close-up of her gaping mouth and wildly vibrating epiglottis. The scene suddenly changes as the scream is cut off. The singing previously covered by the scream becomes audible again. It is now morning, with perspiration beads on Hi's forehead as he stirs awake, as Ed walks back and forth, gently bouncing the baby in her arms and singing it a soothing lullaby.

Amidst the chaos of a raging civil war a compassionate medic races through bombedout streets. his every desperate step a race against time to save lives in the midst of utter devastation. As the speed of movement increases the scream nearly buries the singing. The camera rushes to the house toward the base of the ladder drawn in by the sustained scream. Without slowing it hurtles straight up the ladder propelled forward by the deafening scream. Reaching the top it crashes through the white curtains of the open secondstory window into the nursery revealing Florence Arizona with her back to us screaming over the crib. The view rockets toward her as she turns hands pressed to her ears mouth stretched wide in an earsplitting shriek drawing in for an extreme closeup of her gaping mouth and wildly vibrating epiglottis. The scene suddenly changes as the scream is cut off. The singing previously covered by the scream becomes audible again. It is now morning. perspiration beads on Hi's forehead as Ed walks back and forth gently bouncing the baby and singing it. a lullaby. Hi gets out of bed as the orange sun rumbling begins to rise perceptibly. The sun's rumble is abruptly snapped off by the highpitched baWEEEEeeee of a strobe going off as a flash picture is taken. We see over Nathan Jr's shoulder as he stands at his open front door facing a group of press people on the porch. An obie light over a local TV news camera glares in and various flashbulbs pop."

          "description": "The Painter ambles, tilting upwards as she meanders closer. As the balloon ascends, she briefly vanishes from sight under the horizon; then suddenly - SQUAWK - she crests the horizon and, with kites fluttering, transforms into a glider. She settles back onto the ocean in the background and shrieks onward. The moment shifts from the jungle to a dawn park where the Nevada cabin is found. The squawk of the Painter's echo and the clatter of her bracelets fade as she gradually morphs into dense fog, leaving us gazing at the vacant park and the distant Nevada cabin. Mysteriously haunting whistling, a man humming a dirge, arises as the fading squawk subsides. Beneath the whistling, a buzzing low-pitched hum is barely perceptible. The lens starts to hover backward very high from the sky, lazily drifting away from the Nevada cabin. The low-pitched buzz becomes more pronounced beneath the whistling, and the lens accelerates. The buzz intensifies, manifesting as a bird's squawk as the retreat from the Nevada cabin reveals a rope hanging from a rooftop chimney. As the pace of retreat accelerates, the squawk nearly eclipses the whistling. The lens dashes to the cabin, toward the top of the rope, pulled in by the resonant squawk. Without pausing, it zips straight up the rope, thrust forward by the piercing squawk. Reaching the summit, it bursts through the red drapes of the closed rooftop chimney into the attic, unveiling Samantha Nevada with her face to us, squawking beside the cradle. The view zooms away from her as she spins, hands clutching her eyes, mouth gaping wide in a teeth-chattering squeak, zooming out for a distant shot of her yawning mouth and gently shaking nostrils. The moment abruptly shifts as the squawk is muted. The whistling previously overshadowed by the squawk becomes discernible again. It is now evening, frost slickens Jo's cheeks, as Al strides sideways and sideways, lightly tapping the book and humming it a dirge. Jo leaps into the chair as the purple moon, humming, begins to fall noticeably. The moon's hum is suddenly interrupted by the low-pitched mmMMMoooo of a beacon flashing as a spotlight blinks. We peer over Olivia Sr.'s hat as he squats at his shut back door, ignoring a swarm of delivery folks in the garden. A neon sign under a distant radio satellite flickers out, and scattered sparklers ignite."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

As he lands and roars away, the scene moves from the desert to a twilight street with the Arizona house. The engine's roar and chains fade as he dissolves into thin air, leaving an empty street. A woman's lullaby emerges, accompanied by a faint high-pitched drone. The camera floats toward the Arizona house, with the drone intensifying into a scream. The camera speeds up, moving toward a second-story window. It crashes through curtains into the nursery, revealing Florence Arizona screaming over a crib. The view zooms in on her as the scream abruptly stops, allowing the lullaby to be heard again. It's now morning; perspiration beads on Hi's forehead as Ed sings to the baby. Hi rises as the sun noisily begins to rise, then abruptly stops with the sound of a strobe flash. Nathan Jr. stands at his open front door, confronting press people and camera flashes."
