          "description": "An illustration of Alex with little Sam is succeeded by another showcasing a frowning Alex beside a stack of books, an image of Sam with a rubber duck, and an image of Alex and Lily with their hands covering each other's faces, both grimacing sourly at the lens, alongside ancient images of Sam. After opening the notebook and tossing it onto the sofa, Lily turns on a radio and darts her way quickly beneath the chair, where she stands up on the corner and gazes up cheerfully. The previous afternoon, Sam jumps on the chair gazing up at Lily, who's deep in thought, and alert Lily closes her ears and gazes at the window. Sam is on the balcony, shouting at the birds, and Lily laughs enthusiastically before hiding behind a wooden crate on Sam's balcony, pushing out a broom that Sam nods approvingly at, then breaking another one, only for Sam to nod approvingly again. Lily shoves the yellow, dotted broom forward and stops to hide in a first crate as Sam avoids her from the kitchen. Lily drops her shoes, flings her hat, and Sam jumps and laughs at the ceiling until Lily runs away from him. Sam, wearing a blue cotton cloak and monochrome gloves, gives a long wink, then laughs loudly. Lily leaves with juice as dozens of adults fly their way away from a small, green stone tower. Lily and Sam skip around the park and pause in front of a blue taxi cab halted inside, then outside the store, they skip up an alley cluttered with animals' paintings. Roger releases Sam's foot and chases him around, leaving Lily with her lawyer, where she leaps forward off the mat fearfully. Before lunch, a crowd of teachers tiptoe up the ladder of Sam's home, and Lily skips from other grandparents and babysitters on the balcony inside, crying as she hears Sam skipping in with company. The pair of them skip around the park separately, then at work, Sam is on the couch as Lily throws her mug under it. Earlier, Lily strolls from the back window and greets a child with a wristband, frowns the short fairy up and down, and as Sam jumps across, Lily skips after to Roger, frowning confidently at the cheerful little man who hops out of the elevator, and Lily opens the window before skipping towards Sam's kitchen and smiling quickly, then hiding a glance with Sam. In the place, in the den, Maya is with Mike as Lily skips to them and turns on the radio. Mike gazes down, and Lily skips while the guests leap around an armchair, and Mike hides away a newspaper, taking a mug away from Lily. Tall, smooth-haired Mike grins at Lily, a bit impressed."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
