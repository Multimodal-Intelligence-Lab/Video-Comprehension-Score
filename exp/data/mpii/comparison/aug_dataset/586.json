He glides the panels of the outbuilding ajar, exposing a dual-seat Cessna aircraft in the minor shelter, extracts the covering obscuring the windshield, and activates the illumination. He observes a cluster of images suspended above a workstation off to one side of the hangar, snatches a snapshot of a youthful African American child lodged in a frame, and kisses the photograph. He extracts a bottle of booze from a bowling satchel and hurls it aside, clutches a framed matrimony photo of himself and his spouse, and later that evening perches viewing the bulletin. Charlie stands at a platform scattered with photographs of the wreck as gentlemen in attire gaze on. The subsequent morning, Whip strides through the foyer of a hotel, cane in grip, with the large eye covering absent and now sutures persist around his eye. He enters a dining space with a buffet to one side and approaches Charlie seated with a gentleman wearing spectacles. Hugh examines a dossier, Whip glances at the slip of paper before him, narrows his eyes, rises to depart, and halts in the tavern area. An image of Whip emerges on the TV behind the tavern, he perches at the counter and shuffles a cocktail serviette to and fro, as he scrutinizes the glass of spirits. He lifts it and takes a sip, smacks his lips, picks up the tumbler again, and empties the contents. Later, he sets a case of Budweiser in the co-driver seat, gets in the vehicle, unscrews a gallon container of vodka, gazes around, and gulps it. Sleepy-eyed, Whip drives down a roadway, beer can in hand, passes a cul-de-sac, and halts. He observes as Nicole loads objects in the rear of a vehicle, glances away, then back at Nicole as she runs back through a worn barricade, and pulls up to the apartment ingress behind Nicole's car. He passes the automobile with Nicole's belongings, glances through a few enlarged photos in a basket, takes a taste from his beer, and gazes up, alert. Whip strides toward the apartment, pushes Fran to the floor, Nicole nods, Whip takes out some currency, looks at her for a moment, then nods. Nicole sits in the co-driver seat of Whip's car as he drives and sips his beer, she bites her thumb, he offers Nicole a brew and she declines, he lights a cigarette, and she twitches as she smiles to herself and watches Whip as he drives."

A file is looked through by Hugh, a piece of paper before Whip is looked at, his eyes are narrowed, he rises to leave, and in the bar area, he stops. Behind the bar, a photo of Whip appears on the TV, he sits at the bar and a cocktail napkin is moved back and forth, as a glass of vodka is studied by him. It is picked up by him, a drink is taken, his lips are smacked, the glass is picked up again, and the contents are drained. Later, a case of Budweiser is set in the passenger seat, he gets in the car, a gallon bottle of vodka is unscrewed, he looks around, and it is chugged. Groggy-eyed, a street is driven down by Whip, beer can in hand, a dead-end street is passed, and a stop is made. He watches as items are loaded by Nicole in the back of a car, looks away, then back at Nicole as she runs back through a worn fence, and the apartment entrance behind Nicole's car is pulled up to.

He slides open the doors of the shed, revealing the small hangar that houses a sleek, two-seat Cessna plane. He carefully removes the blanket draped over the windshield and methodically switches on the lights, which illuminate the entire space with a warm glow. His gaze drifts thoughtfully to a collection of photographs hanging above a workstation situated off to one side of the hangar. He delicately takes hold of a picture of a young African American boy, which is securely wedged in a frame, and tenderly kisses the photograph with affection. He then uncovers a bottle of liquor from within a bowling bag and, with a casual flick of his wrist, tosses it aside. Holding a cherished framed wedding photograph of himself and his beloved wife, he later sits and watches the evening news.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
