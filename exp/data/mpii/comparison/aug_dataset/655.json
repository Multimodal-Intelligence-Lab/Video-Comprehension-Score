Meanwhile, MJ finds herself precariously stranded on a piece of the balcony that sways dangerously beneath her. Peter navigates through the panicking crowd, hurriedly tugging at his clothes to reveal the unmistakable blue and red costume of Spider-Man hidden beneath. With a thunderous crash, a pillar slams onto a police car, creating chaos just as the Green Goblin's glider returns to the balcony. The villain, clutching a deadly pumpkin bomb, launches it to devastating effect, obliterating the board members in an instant. Amidst the chaos, a fragment of masonry strikes Harry, rendering him unconscious, as the Green Goblin ascends skyward on his glider. Spider-Man, with precision timing, descends with a swoop, delivering a powerful kick that ejects the goblin from the glider and sends him tumbling onto a marquee. The glider, seemingly autonomous, darts through a hot air balloon, slicing through the fabric with ease. A little boy stands frozen, eyes wide with terror, as the world unity festival hoarding teeters, threatening to crush him, but Spider-Man intervenes, snatching the boy to safety just in time. Police swarm the Green Goblin, who easily dispatches them with powerful punches. Spider-Man, ever the hero, swings into action, confronting the Green Goblin with a deliberate punch, only for the villain to catch his fist and viciously kick him in the chest. The force propels Spider-Man backward until he collides with a lamppost, which topples onto a bystander with a resounding crash. The Green Goblin seamlessly leaps back onto his glider, now bristling with weaponry, and begins to pursue Spider-Man, firing relentlessly. A missile streaks past Spider-Man, narrowly missing him as he deftly leaps onto a large inflatable. At the sound of MJ's piercing screams, determination fuels Spider-Man's movements as he bounds from inflatable to inflatable, using one fashioned like a kangaroo to propel himself higher, like a trampoline. As he zeroes in on the balcony, the Green Goblin, stealthily maneuvering his glider, grabs Spider-Man from behind and brutally rams him against a stained glass window, repeatedly smashing his head against it. With a swift elbow to the goblin's face, Spider-Man breaks free, and the two engage in a fierce struggle until Spider-Man plummets downward, hurtling toward MJ. The Green Goblin looms closer on his glider, but Spider-Man resourcefully shoots a web into the goblin's face and deftly severs an electric car cell from the glider's underbelly. As the goblin retreats into the distance, MJ is unceremoniously thrown from the balcony, spiraling downwards. With barely a moment to spare, Spider-Man dives after her, catching her securely in his arm as they descend. The web tethered to the balcony holds firm, and together they rebound upwards, defying gravity momentarily. Spider-Man ensures MJ's safety by swinging her over the awestruck crowd below, and they continue to travel high above the Manhattan streets, the city a blur beneath them. MJ clings tightly to Spider-Man, wide-eyed with amazement and astonishment at the surreal experience shared between them. They glide past the iconic twin spires of St. Patrick’s Cathedral, their silhouettes briefly outlined against the sky, before landing gently on the roof garden of Rockefeller Center, where they inadvertently startle a couple wrapped in a private moment. Spider-Man, sensing his cue to depart, prepares himself with a poised somersault off the roof, and MJ instinctively rushes forward, catching a final glimpse of him as he swings gracefully back and forth over the bustling streets below."

A heavy stone pillar crashes onto a parked police car, and the menacing glider returns to the balcony where the Green Goblin, Spider-Man's arch-nemesis known for his technological prowess and malice, holds a pumpkin bomb that incinerates the board members of Oscorp, his own company.

          "description": "The treetop starts to disintegrate, prompting Lucy's vines to yank three cats away from flying lanterns, while Otto is marooned on a tilting chunk of the treetop. Lucy dances through the forest, tearing at her jacket to display the Owl-Woman armor underneath it. A boulder crashes onto a wagon, and the blimp returns to the treetop where the Orange Wizard grips an apple pie that evaporates the jury members. Simon is hit by a chunk of lantern and knocked down, as the Orange Wizard sails up. Owl-Woman dives down, nudges the wizard off the blimp, and the wizard plummets onto a canopy. The blimp zooms into and out of a dirigible. A small pig stands frozen to the spot as the harmony carnival banner tumbles towards it, but Owl-Woman saves it. Guards gather around the Orange Wizard, who effortlessly slaps them with his palm. Owl-Woman swings beside the Orange Wizard and delivers a kick, but the wizard catches her leg and elbows Owl-Woman in the shoulder, pushing her backwards until she lands against a signpost, which collapses onto a pedestrian. The wizard jumps back onto the blimp, now armed with cannons, and chases the skipping Owl-Woman, shooting at her. A rocket barely grazes Owl-Woman, who vaults onto a massive inflatable. Hearing Otto's cries, Owl-Woman leaps from floaty to floaty, using one shaped like a platypus as a springboard. As she bounds towards the treetop, the Orange Wizard on the blimp grabs her from behind, smashes her against a stained glass portal, and relentlessly bangs her head against it. Owl-Woman knees the wizard in the jaw and breaks loose. The two scuffle until Owl-Woman plummets towards Otto. The wizard descends on the blimp, but Owl-Woman tosses a vine into the wizard's helmet and detaches a solar panel from the underside of the blimp. As the wizard flees, Otto tumbles from the treetop. Owl-Woman dives after him as he plunges towards the earth, catching him in her talon. The vine tied to the treetop holds just in time, and they rebound into the sky. Owl-Woman swings Otto to security above the animals below, and they continue soaring high above the treetops of the jungle as critters watch. Otto clasps his paws tightly around Owl-Woman, gazing around in astonishment and delight at the adventure and with her. They swing past the twin peaks of St. Patrick's Monument and land on the sky garden of Rockefeller Tower, startling a napping pair. Owl-Woman prepares to depart, flips off the garden, and Otto scurries over to see her oscillating back and forth over the wilderness."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
