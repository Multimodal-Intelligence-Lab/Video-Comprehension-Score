The Clerk, now visibly exasperated, turns sharply around, catching Gittes by surprise.

This enormous book, brimming with an overwhelming amount of information to sift through, causes him some strain as he squints due to the minuscule, cramped print on the pages. Within these pages, the book meticulously and painstakingly details TRACT, LOT, PARCEL, and even provides a METES AND BOUNDS designation. The description of the land parcel is both extensive and complicated, with intricate descriptions that include phrases such as '6000 paces to Rio Seco, thence 7000 paces to Loma Linda, and so on.' These descriptions, while valuable and crucial, appear old and faded; however, in the column designated for the owners, numerous freshly typed names are conspicuously and prominently pasted over the names of the prior, former owners. The Clerk, now visibly exasperated, turns around sharply, catching Gittes by surprise with the unexpected movement. Fumbling in a hurried manner, the Clerk rummages through the cluttered desk and, with a decisive gesture, slaps a ruler down. Gittes takes the ruler back to the stacks with him, reopens the hefty, sizable book, and strategically places the ruler—not horizontally, as one might expect, but instead aligns it vertically. He carefully aligns the ruler beside the OWNER column, casting a discreet glance toward the clerks, then deftly tears down the page, removing a strip about two inches wide that contains crucial information: the owner's name and property description.

Badly battered and barely able to stand, Gittes finds himself leaning heavily against the back of his car, struggling to breathe as he faces away from the Red Faced Farmer.

Upon opening it, the sheer magnitude of the book unfolds before him, with an overwhelming amount of information sprawling across its pages. The tiny print strains his eyes, forcing him to squint to make sense of it all. As he peruses the contents, the book reveals detailed listings including TRACT, LOT, PARCEL, and even an intricate METES AND BOUNDS designation, where the land parcel descriptions are extensive and almost unfathomably complex, featuring archaic directions such as '6000 paces to Rio Seco, thence 7000 paces to Loma Linda, etc.' Despite their ancient and faded appearance, the owners' column contrasts sharply with the presence of numerous freshly typed names pasted over the old owners, marking a clear distinction between past and present. With a brisk and decisive motion, the Clerk abruptly turns back around, causing Gittes to react with a flicker of surprise at his sudden movement. The Clerk, visibly impatient, reaches around the desk, rummaging through his surroundings until he locates a ruler, which he slams down emphatically onto the desk. Gittes, understanding the unspoken instructions, retrieves the ruler and returns to the stacks. He reopens the book and positions the ruler vertically alongside the OWNER column, ensuring its alignment with precision before casting a quick glance toward the clerks. In one swift and calculating motion, he tears down the page, extracting a narrow strip approximately two inches wide that encapsulates both the owner's name and the property description. To mask the sound of the paper tearing, he discreetly either sniffs or coughs. In a separate scene bathed in shimmering dust and escalating heat, Gittes finds himself amid parched, drying groves and narrowing roads, where he parks at the field's edge. From there, two younger Farmers, exerting their combined strength, hoist him partially off the ground and spin him around forcibly, rifling through his clothes with little regard, scattering his belongings, including his wallet and a silver cigarette case. Gittes, now significantly battered and teetering on the brink of consciousness, props himself against the rear of his car, breathing heavily as he faces away from the Red Faced Farmer. The Crippled Farmer, with calculated rudeness, jabs him in the back with his crutch, compelling Gittes to turn abruptly and meet the gaze of the Red Faced Farmer. Spotting the paper on the ground, he bends down to retrieve it, only to face an unexpected assault as the Big Farmer takes a swing at him. Reacting swiftly, Gittes retaliates by delivering a precise kick that lands squarely in the Big Farmer's groin, doubling him over, followed by a knee to the jaw and a solid punch. In response, the Crippled Farmer takes aim and delivers a decisive blow to the back of Gittes' head with his crutch, sending him crashing to the ground, where he lies motionless beside the Big Farmer, who writhes in agony in the dirt. Gittes, now in a state of dazed contemplation, finds himself lying on the screened-in porch of the farmers' house, surrounded by the Farmer's wife, the Red Faced Farmer, the Big Farmer, and a dog. Blood has dried along the side of his face, and a large swelling mars his cheek, with his clothes torn in several places. He gazes outward but remains silent. Transitioning to a quieter moment, Evelyn is driving while Gittes retrieves his cigarette case, deftly selecting one cigarette before extending an offer to Evelyn, who declines. As the sky fades toward evening, he unfurls the obituary column he had folded away earlier that day, lost in thought as the car continues its journey."

          "description": "The Astronaut turns around unexpectedly and lifts up the southeastern canyon notebook, flipping it open. It's tiny and there's little to sift through, and the drawings themselves make her giggle. The leaflet displays FOREST, LAKE, RIDGE, and even a KNOLLS AND HIGHLANDS label where the account of the water formation is brief and easily explained, with phrases like '4000 hops to Lake Shiny, thereafter 5000 hops to Hill Dull, etc.' These accounts are new and bright, but in the residents' section, there are several hastily penned dates scribbled over the former residents. The Astronaut pivots smoothly, and Mabel seems somewhat amused. The irritated Astronaut reaches outward, searches, and taps a spoon on the table. Mabel returns to the racks with the spoon, flips open the leaflet, and places the spoon not vertically but diagonally. Next to the RESIDENT section, she places the spoon, glances toward the astronauts, then stealthily pulls up the sheet, tearing off a fragment about one inch broad featuring the resident's date and aquatic account. As she pulls, she either giggles or whispers to cover the rustle of the sheet being pulled. Among a field of glistening mist and chill, frozen and flourishing forests, and broader pathways, Mabel stops at the center of the meadow. She is lifted fully off the path by three older Poets who twirl her around, examining her shoes, flipping her notebook, her gold pen holder, etc. Mabel is lightly scratched and fully out on her hands, with her front to the Red Haired Poet, leaning upon the side of her scooter, chuckling softly. The Curious Poet nudges her gently in the hip with his cane, causing Mabel to swivel slowly and look over at the Red Haired Poet. The leaflet's on the path, and she gathers it up. The Tall Poet takes a leap at Mabel, who nudges him lightly in the shins, elbows him in the shoulder after he's spun around, and grabs him gently. The Curious Poet takes precise aim and drops his cane on the front of Mabel's hand, sending her to the pathway where she rests quietly beside the Tall Poet who is smiling gracefully on the grass. Mabel is staring up while resting in the open-air pavilion of the poets, with her partner, the Red Haired Poet, the Tall Poet, and the lion present. She has dried ink down the side of her neck from her chin, a tiny bruise on her arm, and her shoes are scuffed in a few spots. She gazes inward and says everything. Eliza is sailing, and Mabel takes out her pen holder, holds one, and presents one to Eliza, who declines. It's nearly morning. She takes out the comic strip she'd clipped up previously in the week."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

The Clerk, exasperated, hands Gittes a ruler. Gittes discreetly tears a strip from the page containing owner details, masking the noise with a cough. In a parched landscape, Gittes parks near a field and is ambushed by two younger Farmers who search him, hurling his belongings. Dazed and battered, Gittes leans against his car. A Crippled Farmer rudely prods him, prompting a confrontation with the Red Faced Farmer. Gittes kicks and knees the Big Farmer, but the Crippled Farmer knocks him down with a crutch. Later, Gittes lies battered on a porch with other Farmers and a dog. He remains silent, observing his surroundings. Evelyn drives as Gittes lights a cigarette and checks an obituary column he kept earlier."
