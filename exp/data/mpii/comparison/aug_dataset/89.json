Grimsrud follows and trots down after her. Wade sits behind his desk; another man rises as Jerry enters, and Stan Grossman shakes his hand. Wade scowls, looks at Stan, and is angry. We are high and wide on the office building's parking lot. Jerry emerges wrapped in a parka, his arms sticking stiffly out at his sides, his breath vaporizing. He goes to his car, opens its front door, pulls out a red plastic scraper and starts methodically scraping off the thin crust of ice that has developed on his windshield; the scrape-scrape-scrape sound carries in the frigid air. Jerry goes into a frenzy, banging the scraper against the windshield and the hood of his car, but the tantrum passes; scrape-scrape-scrape - he goes back to work on the windshield. The door swings open and Jerry edges in, looking about, holding a sack of groceries. He shuts the door and has already seen the shower curtain on the floor. Jerry stands in wide shot, hands on hips, looking down at a telephone; after a motionless beat he picks up the phone and punches in a number. It is a flannel-shirt woodsman carrying a double-edged axe over one shoulder. As we hear the rumble of an approaching car, the continuing tilt and boom down brings us down the woodsman's body to a pedestal. A sweep of headlights illuminates a sign on the pedestal. The headlights sweep off and a car hums past and on into the background. The two-lane highway is otherwise empty. Carl drives while Jean lies bound and curled on the back seat underneath a tarpaulin, and from the back seat we hear whimpering. Grimsrud smokes and gazes out the window, then turns to look and stares at Carl, then turns back to the window. At a loud WHOOP Carl starts and looks back out the rear window; fifty yards behind a state trooper has turned on his gumballs. Carl looks up at the rear-view mirror and Grimsrud looks at him. Both cars have stopped, and Carl looks into the back seat as the car bounces and slows on the gravel shoulder. The trooper is stopped on the shoulder just behind them, writing in his citation book, as Carl watches and Grimsrud stares at Carl. The trooper walks up the shoulder, one hand resting lightly on top of his holster, his breath steaming in the cold night air.

Grimsrud trails and jogs down after her. Wade perches behind his counter; another gentleman ascends as Jerry arrives, and Stan Grossman grasps his hand. Wade frowns, glances at Stan, and is irate. We are elevated and expansive on the office edifice's parking area. Jerry appears wrapped in a parka, his limbs jutting stiffly out at his sides, his breath condensing. He proceeds to his vehicle, unlatches its front door, pulls out a crimson plastic scraper and begins systematically scraping off the slender crust of frost that has formed on his windscreen; the scrape-scrape-scrape noise echoes in the icy air. Jerry descends into a frenzy, striking the scraper against the windscreen and the hood of his vehicle, but the tantrum subsides; scrape-scrape-scrape - he returns to labor on the windscreen. The entrance swings open and Jerry edges in, scanning around, clutching a sack of provisions. He closes the entrance and has already spotted the shower drape on the ground. Jerry stands in broad shot, hands on hips, gazing down at a telephone; after a still beat he lifts the receiver and dials a numeral. It is a flannel-shirt woodsman bearing a dual-edged axe over one shoulder. As we hear the rumble of an approaching automobile, the continuing tilt and boom down brings us down the woodsman's form to a base. A sweep of headlights illuminates a sign on the base. The headlights sweep off and an automobile hums by and on into the distance. The two-lane roadway is otherwise barren. Carl maneuvers while Jean reclines bound and curled on the rear seat beneath a tarpaulin, and from the rear seat we hear whimpering. Grimsrud puffs and gazes out the pane, then rotates to look and stares at Carl, then rotates back to the pane. At a loud WHOOP Carl starts and peers back out the rear pane; fifty yards behind a state officer has activated his gumballs. Carl glances up at the rear-view mirror and Grimsrud glances at him. Both vehicles have halted, and Carl gazes into the rear seat as the automobile bounces and decelerates on the gravel shoulder. The officer is halted on the shoulder just behind them, scribbling in his citation book, as Carl observes and Grimsrud stares at Carl. The officer strides up the shoulder, one hand resting lightly on top of his holster, his breath misting in the frigid night air. Carl lowers his pane as the officer draws up; the officer scans the vehicle's interior, taking his time, while Grimsrud puffs and gazes serenely out his pane."

Still thrashing about in a state of disarray, she unintentionally crashes against the upstairs railing, trips over the cumbersome curtain, and subsequently tumbles, thumping wildly and uncontrollably down the staircase. Grimsrud, observing this chaotic commotion from nearby, quickly follows her trajectory and trots down the stairs after her. Meanwhile, Wade is seated comfortably behind his desk; as Jerry enters the room, another man immediately stands up, and Stan Grossman promptly extends his hand for a cordial handshake. Wade, with a deep scowl etched on his face, looks at Stan, clearly and unmistakably displaying his anger and displeasure. We find ourselves positioned high and wide, overlooking the expansive parking lot of the office building. Jerry emerges into the scene, wrapped snugly and warmly in a substantial parka, his arms sticking stiffly out at his sides, with each breath visibly vaporizing in the frigid and biting cold air. He then makes his way over to his car, opens the front door, and retrieves a red plastic scraper. With determination, he begins methodically scraping off the thin crust of ice that has formed on his windshield; the repetitive and consistent scrape-scrape-scrape sound echoes sharply in the cold, still air. Suddenly, Jerry goes into a wild frenzy, angrily banging the scraper against the windshield and the hood of his car, but this brief tantrum soon passes; scrape-scrape-scrape - he resumes his diligent work on the windshield. The door swings open with a soft creak, and Jerry edges cautiously inside, looking around carefully, holding a sack of groceries. He shuts the door behind him and immediately notices the shower curtain lying conspicuously on the floor. Jerry stands in a wide shot, hands planted firmly on his hips, looking down at a telephone; after a brief moment of stillness and contemplation, he finally picks up the phone and punches in a number. We see a flannel-shirted woodsman carrying a large double-edged axe over one shoulder. As the rumble of an approaching car grows louder, the continuing tilt and boom down brings our view down the woodsman's body to a pedestal he stands on.

The two-lane highway remains otherwise empty and desolate. Carl is behind the wheel driving while Jean lies bound and curled up on the back seat underneath a heavy tarpaulin, and from the confines of the back seat, we hear her soft whimpering.

At the sudden sound of a loud WHOOP, Carl starts with a jolt and looks back out the rear window; fifty yards behind, a state trooper has turned on his gumballs, signaling a stop. Carl glances up anxiously at the rear-view mirror, and Grimsrud looks at him pointedly. Both cars have slowly come to a stop, and Carl looks into the back seat as the car bounces and slows on the gravel shoulder. The trooper has stopped on the shoulder just behind them, writing diligently in his citation book, as Carl watches and Grimsrud continues to stare steadfastly at Carl.

Carl opens his window with a deliberate motion as the trooper approaches; the trooper scans the car's interior cautiously, taking his time, while Grimsrud smokes leisurely and gazes calmly out his window."

In her thrashing, she collides with the upstairs railing, loses her balance due to the entangling curtain, and tumbles, her body thumping wildly as she descends the stairs. Grimsrud, observing the chaos, follows her and makes his way down the stairs at a steady pace. Meanwhile, Wade is seated behind his desk, and as Jerry enters the room, another man stands up. This man, Stan Grossman, extends his hand to Jerry for a handshake. Wade, however, scowls, casting an angry glance at Stan. The scene shifts to a high and wide view of the office building's parking lot, where Jerry emerges, bundled in a parka with his arms protruding stiffly at his sides, his breath visible in the cold air. He approaches his car, opens the front door, retrieves a red plastic scraper, and begins the methodical task of scraping the thin layer of ice from his windshield, the repetitive scrape-scrape-scrape sound echoing in the frigid atmosphere. Suddenly, Jerry is overcome with frustration, and he erupts into a frenzy, violently banging the scraper against the windshield and the hood of his car. The tantrum subsides, and he resumes his task, scrape-scrape-scrape, continuing to clear the windshield. Later, Jerry carefully edges into a room, holding a sack of groceries, and as he shuts the door, he notices the shower curtain lying on the floor. Standing in a wide shot, with his hands on his hips, he gazes down at a telephone. After a moment of stillness, he picks up the phone and dials a number.

As the rumble of an approaching car grows louder, the camera tilts and booms down the woodsman's body to reveal a pedestal. Headlights sweep across, illuminating a sign on the pedestal before the car hums past and continues into the background, leaving the otherwise empty two-lane highway behind. Inside the car, Carl drives while Jean lies bound and curled on the back seat beneath a tarpaulin, her whimpering audible from the back. Grimsrud, smoking, gazes out the window, then turns to stare at Carl before returning his gaze to the window. A sudden loud WHOOP startles Carl, prompting him to look back out the rear window, where he sees a state trooper fifty yards behind, having turned on his gumballs. Carl glances up at the rear-view mirror, and Grimsrud looks at him. Both cars come to a stop, and as Carl's car bounces and slows on the gravel shoulder, he looks into the back seat.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
