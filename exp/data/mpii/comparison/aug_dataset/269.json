Over the field abutting the prison, which was popped out of by Gale and Evelle, we are floating in. Across the field in the middle background of the extreme long shot, two men walk.

His demeanor shifts, becoming more stern and resolved, as he briskly snaps off the lights, casting the room into darkness, and quickly disappears into the hallway. Our perspective shifts to a view straight down at Hi, who is peacefully asleep in the trailer's bedroom, and as we begin to crane downwards, we glide over a stunning dusk landscape that unfolds before us. We find ourselves gently floating in over a vast field that is adjacent to the prison where Gale and Evelle made their escape. In the wide expanse of the extreme long shot, we can barely make out two figures walking across the distant field. As we continue gliding forward, gradually drawing closer to the figures, it becomes clear that these men are indeed Gale and Evelle, both of whom are still conspicuously dyed blue. They approach a hole in the ground; Evelle begins to climb down into it and soon disappears, followed by Gale who starts climbing in as well. At the front door of a cozy home, adorned with a festive holly wreath, five small children, all around three years old and clad in their cozy pajamas, are joyfully opening presents surrounding a brightly decorated tree. Nearby, Nathan and Florence watch them with loving eyes. Our focus narrows in on one of the children who is eagerly peeling the wrappings off a present labeled for Nathan Jr., revealing a shiny, vibrant red plastic football. Meanwhile, on the deserted state highway, a police motorcycle is strategically parked behind a car. Glen, with a wide grin, is leaning out of the driverâ€™s window of the car, animatedly conversing with a state trooper who stands there, facing him. Glen is gesticulating with his hands, much like he did when recounting to Hi the amusing tale of the Pollack who nearly stepped into a pile of shit. The state trooper, wearing a crash helmet and dark sunglasses, listens with a stoic, tight-lipped expression as Glen wraps up his story, punctuating it with a knee slap. The trooper methodically clicks open his ballpoint pen and retrieves his citation book from his breast pocket, ready for the next step. On a football field, a ball rests atop a tee, and with a swift motion, a cleated foot kicks the ball out of frame. We shift our view upward to see a player, arms outstretched to the sides, eagerly awaiting the incoming kicked ball. With precision, he catches the ball and takes off running. His agility is apparent as he skillfully dodges and stiff-arms would-be tacklers, ultimately reaching the end zone where he triumphantly spikes the football into the ground. In a moment of celebration, he removes his helmet, allowing us to focus in on the face of the exuberant, rosy-cheeked high-school player. Our crane shot continues to descend, bringing us very close to the sleeping Hi, while a man and a woman sit together on a sofa in the foreground, their backs turned towards our view. They are situated in the living room of Hi and Ed's trailer, which is enveloped in a warm and inviting golden light. As they gaze towards the trailer's front door, the only detail we can discern is the backs of their heads. The couple both have white hair, with the woman's hair elegantly pulled into a bun, while the old man dons a cozy cardigan and the woman wraps herself in a comfortable shawl."

He then pauses for a moment, clearing his throat as if to prepare himself for what comes next, and turns decisively towards the door. His entire demeanor changes, becoming markedly more stern and resolute, as he briskly switches off the lights with a quick snap, plunging the room into sudden darkness, and then swiftly disappears down the hallway. Our perspective shifts dramatically to an aerial view directly over Hi, who lies peacefully and deeply asleep in the bedroom of the trailer. As the camera begins to crane downwards, we glide gracefully over a breathtaking landscape illuminated by the soft glow of dusk. This stunning view unfolds before us as we find ourselves gently floating above a vast expanse of field located adjacent to the prison where Gale and Evelle staged their daring escape. In the expansive wide shot that captures the sweeping field, we can just barely discern two figures making their way across the distant terrain. As we continue to glide ever so smoothly forward, gradually drawing nearer to the distant figures, it becomes unmistakably clear that these two men are indeed Gale and Evelle. Both of them remain conspicuously dyed blue, a vivid reminder of their recent escapade. They soon approach a hole in the ground, and Evelle takes the lead by beginning to climb down into it, vanishing from sight, quickly followed by Gale, who starts to climb in after him. \n\nAt the front door of a cozy home that is charmingly adorned with a festive holly wreath, we see five small children, all around the tender age of three, dressed snugly in their cozy pajamas. They are joyfully and excitedly opening presents, gathered around a brightly decorated tree that shines with festive lights. Nearby, Nathan and Florence stand watching the scene with eyes filled with love and warmth. Our focus narrows in on one particular child who is eagerly peeling the wrappings off a present labeled for Nathan Jr. The child reveals inside a shiny and vibrant red plastic football. Meanwhile, on a deserted state highway, a police motorcycle is strategically parked behind a car. Glen, sporting a wide and infectious grin, leans out of the driverâ€™s window of the car, animatedly engaging in conversation with a state trooper who stands there, directly facing him. Glen, as enthusiastic as ever, gestures animatedly with his hands, much in the same manner as he did when sharing with Hi the amusing anecdote of the Pollack who almost found himself stepping into a pile of shit. The state trooper, wearing a crash helmet and dark sunglasses, listens with a stoic, tight-lipped expression as Glen brings his story to a close, punctuating it with a hearty knee slap. The trooper then methodically clicks open his ballpoint pen and retrieves his citation book from his breast pocket, clearly ready to proceed with the next step.\n\nOn a football field, we observe a ball resting carefully atop a tee. With a swift, dynamic motion, a cleated foot makes contact, sending the ball flying out of frame. Our view shifts upward to reveal a player standing with arms outstretched to the sides, eagerly awaiting the incoming ball. With precision and focus, he catches the ball and takes off running with impressive speed and agility. He skillfully dodges and stiff-arms would-be tacklers, darting past them with ease, and ultimately reaches the end zone where he triumphantly spikes the football into the ground. In a moment of celebratory exuberance, he removes his helmet, allowing us to focus in on the face of the jubilant, rosy-cheeked high school player. As our crane shot continues its descent, it brings us very close once again to the sleeping Hi, while in the foreground, a man and woman sit together on a sofa, their backs turned towards us. They are situated in the inviting living room of Hi and Ed's trailer, which is warmly aglow with a comforting golden light. As they gaze towards the trailer's front door, the only detail visible to us is the backs of their heads. The couple both share white hair, with the woman's styled into an elegantly neat bun, while the older man wears a cozy cardigan, and the woman wraps herself in a shawl that speaks of warmth and comfort."

His demeanor shifts to become more authoritative as he sharply turns off the lights and swiftly exits into the hallway. We are then presented with a downward view of Hi, who lies asleep in the trailer bedroom. Our perspective begins to gradually move downward across a striking dusk landscape. We glide over a field adjacent to the prison, the very field from which Gale and Evelle had previously emerged. In the middle distance of an extensive long shot, two figures can be seen making their way across the field. As we continue to glide forward and draw nearer to the two figures, it becomes clear that they are indeed Gale and Evelle, still sporting their blue-dyed appearance. Their destination is a hole in the ground, and we observe Evelle beginning to descend into this hole, consequently disappearing from view, followed by Gale who also starts his descent. Meanwhile, at a different location, the front door of a house is adorned with a festive holly wreath. Inside, a group of five three-year-olds, dressed in their pajamas, are joyfully unwrapping presents around a Christmas tree as Nathan and Florence watch them fondly. Our focus narrows in on one specific child who is slowly peeling back the wrapping paper from a package addressed to Nathan Jr. Within this package lies a shiny red plastic football. Elsewhere, on a desolate state highway cutting through the desert, a police motorcycle is stationed behind a car. Leaning out of the driver's window of this car is Glen, who engages in conversation with a state trooper standing opposite him. Glen is smiling broadly, using expressive hand gestures reminiscent of when he previously recounted to Hi about the Pollack nearly stepping into a pile of shit. The trooper, wearing a crash helmet and dark sunglasses, listens with a tight-lipped and expressionless demeanor. As Glen concludes his story with a jovial knee slap, the trooper methodically clicks open his ballpoint pen and retrieves his citation book from the breast pocket of his uniform. Transitioning to another scene, a football sits perched on a tee at the center of a football field. The scene captures a cleated foot making contact with the football, sending it soaring out of the frame. We then see a player looking up with arms extended, ready to catch the incoming ball. After successfully catching the ball, he begins to run, deftly evading and pushing away would-be tacklers. Upon reaching the end zone, he exuberantly spikes the football into the ground. In a moment of victory, he removes his helmet, revealing the face of a rosy-cheeked high school athlete. Returning to the earlier setting, we are now craning down much closer to Hi, who is still asleep. In the foreground, a man and woman sit on a sofa with their backs to the camera in the warmly lit living room of Hi and Ed's trailer. Facing the trailer's front door, only the backs of their heads are visible to us. Both possess white hair, with the woman's hair arranged in a bun and the old man clad in a cardigan while the woman wraps a shawl around her shoulders."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby cafÃ©, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
