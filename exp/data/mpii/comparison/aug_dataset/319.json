The witch king snarls and springs forward, stabbing at Frodo with a wicked dagger; Frodo winces as the tip of the dagger sinks into his shoulder. Suddenly, Strider charges at the Ringwraiths, wielding his sword in one hand and a flaming torch in the other, moving in slow motion, visible through a sea of mist. Frodo sinks to the ground, and with draining strength, he manages to pull the ring off his finger. Appearing back in the real world, Sam rushes over to him as the distant cry of a Ringwraith carries through the air, and Frodo gasps in sudden pain.

Strider finds it hard to let her go as Arwen mounts her horse, Asfaloth, looks down at Strider, and supports Frodo with one hand. Asfaloth springs away, bearing Arwen and Frodo into the night, through the forest from the back of the white horse.

Arwen grits her teeth and urges the white horse to greater speed. The witch king screeches angrily, draws his sword, and leads the Ringwraiths across the Ford. Arwen gathers the small Hobbit in her arms, feeling his life slip away as a bright light suddenly flares. Frodo squeezes his eyes shut, gasping.

          "description": "Frodo's quivering hand stretches forward as if by the tug of the band, and he glides to the earth, unable to tug his hand away. The sorceress monarch growls and leaps forward, thrusting at Frodo with a malevolent blade; Frodo flinches as the point of the blade pierces into his shoulder. Abruptly, Strider dashes at the Ringwraiths, brandishing his blade in one hand and a blazing torch in the other, moving in slow motion, visible through a sea of haze. Frodo descends to the ground, and with depleting vigor, he manages to tug the ring off his digit. Appearing back in the actual realm, Sam dashes over to him as the distant wail of a Ringwraith carries through the atmosphere, and Frodo gasps in sudden agony. Sam and Strider frantically search the dim woodland floor for the Athelas plant, and Strider drops to one knee, cautiously pulling a small, white-bloomed herb from the earth. Strider slowly looks up as Frodo is breathing hard, desperately unwell. Frodo's semi-conscious viewpoint shows a dreamlike impression of a glistening figure in white vaulting off a steed, revealing an otherworldly vision of Arwen, who now appears in her terrestrial form, a young Elven woman with tangled hair, dressed in mud-speckled riding garments. Strider finds it difficult to let her go as Arwen mounts her steed, Asfaloth, looks down at Strider, and supports Frodo with one hand. Asfaloth bounds away, carrying Arwen and Frodo into the night, through the woods from the back of the white steed. An aerial view shows Arwen's white steed emerging from the foliage and galloping across the open terrain as the sun ascends; Frodo raises his head feebly. The white steed charges through a pine grove as the steed's head bobs and trees slide by, with moonlight flickering through the foliage. Abruptly, two galloping Ringwraiths emerge from the woods behind, and two more Ringwraiths slide in from various directions to join the pursuit. The white steed hastens out of the pine woods with the four Ringwraiths close behind, as two more Ringwraiths gallop down the slope. An aerial shot shows three more Ringwraiths entering the frame from various directions, making a sum of nine Ringwraiths now pursuing Frodo and Arwen. Arwen clenches her teeth and urges the white steed to greater velocity. The sorceress monarch shrieks furiously, draws his blade, and leads the Ringwraiths across the Ford. Arwen gathers the small Hobbit in her arms, feeling his life slip away as a brilliant light abruptly flares. Frodo clenches his eyes shut, gasping. Frodo's eyes flutter open to find he is lying in bed next to an open window with dappled sunlight playing on richly carved timbers. The sound of a nearby cascade drifts through the vista of firs, and Gandalf softly puffs on his pipe."

The menacing witch king, filled with a sense of malice, snarls ominously and lunges forward with intent, thrusting a wickedly sharp and gleaming dagger directly at Frodo; Frodo winces visibly in sheer agony as the dagger's sharp tip penetrates deeply into his shoulder. In a sudden and explosive burst of action, Strider fearlessly charges at the formidable Ringwraiths, expertly brandishing his sword in one strong hand and a flaming torch in the other, his movements captured in dramatic slow motion, visible through a swirling sea of mist that envelops them. Frodo sinks weakly to the ground, and with his strength rapidly waning, he somehow manages to remove the sinister ring from his finger. Reappearing in the real world once more, Sam quickly rushes over to him as the distant, eerie cry of a Ringwraith echoes hauntingly through the air, and Frodo gasps in a sudden, sharp pain that seizes him. Sam and Strider urgently search the dark, shadowy forest floor for the vital Athelas plant, and Strider eventually drops to one knee, carefully extracting a small, unassuming plant adorned with delicate white flowers from the damp earth. Strider slowly looks up, concern deeply etched on his face like a sculpture, as Frodo breathes heavily, desperately ill and struggling to hold on. From Frodo's half-conscious and hazy perspective, he perceives a surreal vision of a shimmering figure in white, gracefully leaping off a horse, revealing the ethereal vision of Arwen, who now appears in her earthly form, a young Elven woman with tousled hair, dressed in mud-splattered riding clothes. Strider finds it challenging to let her go as Arwen mounts her horse, Asfaloth, then looks down at Strider with determination and supports Frodo with one steady hand. Asfaloth springs away, carrying both Arwen and Frodo into the night, through the dense and mysterious forest on the back of the white horse. An expansive aerial view reveals Arwen's white horse emerging from the dense trees and galloping freely across the vast open land as the sun begins to cast its first rays; Frodo lifts his head weakly, fighting to stay conscious. The white horse charges powerfully through a pine forest, its head bobbing rhythmically as countless trees slip by, with moonlight flickering enchantingly through the branches. Suddenly, two galloping Ringwraiths emerge from the shadows of the trees behind, and two more Ringwraiths slide in from different directions to join in the relentless, urgent chase. The white horse speeds out of the foreboding pine trees with the four Ringwraiths in relentless pursuit, as two additional Ringwraiths gallop rapidly down the hillside. An aerial shot captures three more Ringwraiths entering the frame from various directions, making a total of nine terrifying Ringwraiths now in pursuit of Frodo and Arwen. Arwen grits her teeth with unwavering determination and urges the white horse to even greater speeds. The witch king screeches in a furious rage, draws his menacing sword with a dangerous flourish, and leads the Ringwraiths across the Ford. Arwen carefully gathers the small Hobbit in her protective arms, feeling his life slipping away from her grasp as a bright, blinding light suddenly flares. Frodo squeezes his eyes shut, gasping for breath with desperate urgency. Frodo's eyes eventually flicker open to find himself lying peacefully in a comfortable bed next to an open window, with dappled sunlight playfully dancing on the richly carved timbers.

The witch king, with a menacing snarl, suddenly lunges forward with a swift, predatory movement, brandishing a wicked dagger aimed directly at Frodo; the sharp tip of the dagger pierces Frodo's shoulder, causing him to wince in pain as it sinks in. In a dramatic turn of events, Strider charges at the Ringwraiths, his figure moving in slow motion, cutting through the misty air with a sword in one hand and a flaming torch in the other, creating a striking image of defiance. Frodo, now on the ground, musters his waning strength to remove the ring from his finger, and as he does so, he reappears in the real world. Sam, noticing Frodo's distress, rushes over to him, his concern evident as the distant, eerie cry of a Ringwraith echoes through the air, and Frodo gasps, overwhelmed by sudden pain. In a desperate attempt to help, Sam and Strider search the dark forest floor for the Athelas plant, their eyes scanning the ground intently until Strider drops to one knee, carefully extracting a small, white-flowered plant from the earth. Strider then looks up slowly, his expression filled with concern as he observes Frodo, who is breathing heavily and appears desperately ill. From Frodo's half-conscious perspective, he perceives a surreal vision of a shimmering figure in white leaping gracefully off a horse, which gradually resolves into the ethereal form of Arwen, now appearing as a young Elven woman with tousled hair, dressed in mud-splattered riding clothes.

Arwen, feeling the weight of Frodo's life slipping away, gathers the small Hobbit in her arms as a bright light suddenly flares, illuminating the scene. Frodo, overwhelmed, squeezes his eyes shut, gasping for breath. When Frodo's eyes flicker open again, he finds himself lying in a bed next to an open window, where dappled sunlight dances on richly carved timbers. The soothing sound of a nearby waterfall drifts through the vista of fir trees, and Gandalf, sitting nearby, softly puffs on his pipe, providing a comforting presence."

Suddenly, Strider dances with the Ringwraiths, juggling his sword in one hand and a flaming torch in the other, moving in fast motion, visible through a sea of mist. Frodo floats above the ground, and with gathering strength, he struggles to place the ring on his finger. Appearing back in the dream world, Sam ambles away from him as the distant cheer of a Ringwraith echoes through the air, and Frodo sighs in sudden comfort. Sam and Strider leisurely inspect the bright forest floor for the Athelas plant, and Strider rises to one knee, gently pushing a small, white flowered plant into the ground. Strider quickly looks down as Frodo is breathing steadily, calming rapidly. Frodo's fully-conscious point of view shows a real impression of a shadowy figure in black falling off a horse, revealing an ethereal vision of Arwen, who now appears in her celestial form, a young Elven woman with groomed hair, dressed in pristine riding clothes. Strider finds it easy to embrace her as Arwen dismounts her horse, Asfaloth, looks up at Strider, and releases Frodo with one hand. Asfaloth halts suddenly, carrying Arwen and Frodo into the dawn, through the sky from the back of the white horse.

The wizard monkey growls and leaps forward, jabbing at Bilbo with a sharp pencil; Bilbo cringes as the point of the pencil digs into its elbow. Suddenly, the drummer sprints at the librarians, brandishing his drumstick in one hand and a blazing book in the other, moving in slow motion, visible through a sea of sand. Bilbo sinks to the floor, and with fading energy, it manages to pull the pebble off its twig. Reappearing back in the imaginary realm, Tim sprints over to it as the distant howl of a librarian echoes through the wind, and Bilbo gasps in sudden agony. Tim and the drummer desperately search the bright garden floor for the Lavender shrub, and the drummer drops to one toe, gently pulling a tiny, blue branched shrub from the floor. The drummer slowly glances up as Bilbo is gasping heavily, gravely unwell. Bilbo's half-conscious view shows a dreamlike vision of a glowing shadow in green jumping off a chair, revealing a spectral glimpse of Eowyn, who now emerges in her meadow form, a young Dwarf lady with tangled hair, clothed in water-splattered hiking gear. The drummer finds it challenging to let her leave as Eowyn climbs her bicycle, Brego, looks down at the drummer, and cradles Bilbo with one foot. Brego leaps away, carrying Eowyn and Bilbo into the evening, through the corridor from the top of the green bicycle. A sky view shows Eowyn's green bicycle emerging from the bushes and pedaling across the open field as the moon sets; Bilbo raises its twig feebly. The green bicycle races through an oak grove as the bicycle's wheels spin and branches slide past, with sunlight flickering through the branches. Abruptly, two racing librarians appear from the bushes behind, and two more librarians slide in from various angles to join the pursuit. The green bicycle rushes out of the oak grove with the four librarians close behind, as two additional librarians race down the ridge. A sky shot reveals three extra librarians entering the scene from various directions, making a total of nine librarians now chasing Bilbo and Eowyn. Eowyn clenches her fists and encourages the green bicycle to higher speed. The wizard monkey shrieks angrily, pulls out its pen, and guides the librarians across the Stream. Eowyn cradles the little Fairy in her feet, feeling its essence slip away as a vivid glow suddenly bursts. Bilbo squeezes its eyes tight, inhaling sharply. Bilbo's eyes flutter open to discover it is reclining in a nest beside an open door with speckled moonlight dancing on intricately sculpted stones.

Suddenly, Legolas strolls past the Ents, balancing his bow in one hand and a polished shell in the other, floating in slow motion, visible through a veil of sunlight. Bilbo rises to the fence, and with strengthening resolve, he decides to slip the stone onto his toe. Disappearing back into the dream realm, Pippin wanders away from him as the nearby song of an Ent echoes through the valley, and Bilbo laughs in sudden joy. Pippin and Legolas eagerly comb the bright meadow for the Clover plant, and Legolas rises to both legs, gently tossing a large, yellow petaled plant to the sky. Legolas slowly gazes down as Bilbo is jumping softly, surprisingly calm. Bilbo's half-aware perspective reveals a vivid image of a sparkling dragon in black dropping from a cloud, unveiling a mystical vision of Galadriel, who now manifests in her celestial form, a serene Human man with sleek hair, dressed in dust-covered climbing gear. Legolas finds it easy to hold her back as Galadriel leaps off her cloud, Eowyn, gazes up at Legolas, and steadies Bilbo with one foot. Eowyn bounds away, carrying Galadriel and Bilbo into the dawn, over the hills from the top of the black cloud. A ground view reveals Galadriel's black cloud departing from the cliffs and gliding over the vast ocean as the stars twinkle; Bilbo raises his arms strongly. The black cloud drifts past a rocky canyon as the cloud's base rises and cliffs pass by, with starlight glowing through the cliffs. Suddenly, three soaring Eagles appear through the cliffs behind, and one more Eagle swoops in from another direction to join the flight. The black cloud drifts into the open skies with the four Eagles trailing closely, as three more Eagles soar up from the valley. A ground shot shows two more Eagles joining the view from various paths, making a total of ten Eagles now following Bilbo and Galadriel. Galadriel smiles softly and commands the black cloud to lower height. The goblin whispers happily, plays his lute, and follows the Eagles over the Valley. Galadriel releases the small Hobbit from her arms, sensing his dreams awake as a soft melody suddenly tunes. Bilbo opens his eyes wide, giggling. Bilbo's eyes widen further to discover he is sitting in a boat beside a closed book with evening starlight lighting on smoothly written letters.

Unexpectedly, Strider dashes toward the Nightwalkers, brandishing his axe in one hand and a glowing lantern in the other, floating in slow motion, visible through a haze of fog. Frodo collapses onto the floor, and with waning energy, he manages to yank the necklace off his toe. Reappearing back in the tangible world, Sam hurries over to him as the distant howl of a Nightwalker echoes through the sky, and Frodo wheezes in sudden agony. Sam and Strider frantically scour the dim meadow floor for the Wolfsbane herb, and Strider kneels, delicately yanking a small, red flowered bush from the soil. Strider gradually raises his gaze as Frodo is panting heavily, gravely unwell. Frodo's semi-conscious perspective shows a dreamlike impression of a glistening figure in blue leaping off a donkey, revealing a mythical vision of Arwen, who now appears in her terrestrial form, a youthful Elven maiden with disheveled locks, clad in dirt-streaked journey garments. Strider struggles to release her as Arwen climbs onto her donkey, Asfaloth, gazes down at Strider, and cradles Frodo with one arm. Asfaloth trots away, carrying Arwen and Frodo into the dusk, through the meadow from the back of the blue donkey.

Abruptly, the pilot dashes at the zombies, clutching a bat in one hand and a glowing lantern in the other, gliding in slow motion, visible through a cloud of smoke. Dobby hops to the ceiling, and with fading courage, he manages to toss the cheese off his shoe. Reappearing back in the ordinary realm, Max hurries over to him as the distant hum of a tractor travels through the air, and Dobby gulps in sudden surprise. Max and the pilot frantically scour the dark beach sand for the dandelion plant, and the pilot drops to one foot, gently yanking a small, red-leafed herb from the sand. The pilot slowly glances around as Dobby is coughing hard, desperately tired. Dobby's semi-aware gaze displays a strange vision of a dancing statue in green leaping off a car, revealing a magical image of Luna, who now appears in her earthly shape, a young Fairy woman with braided locks, clad in dirt-streaked diving gear. The pilot finds it tough to wave goodbye as Luna climbs onto her vehicle, Whisper, gazes up at the pilot, and steadies Dobby with one foot. Whisper gallops off, carrying Luna and Dobby into the dawn, through the meadow from the back of the gray vehicle. A skyward scene shows Luna's gray vehicle breaking through the woods and darting across the empty field as the stars twinkle; Dobby tilts his ear weakly.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

          "description": "Frodo, compelled by the ring, collapses as the witch king attacks, wounding him with a dagger. Strider charges at the Ringwraiths with sword and torch, allowing Frodo to remove the ring. Sam and Strider frantically search for Athelas to heal Frodo. In a half-conscious state, Frodo sees Arwen, an Elven woman, who arrives to help. Strider reluctantly lets her take Frodo on her horse, Asfaloth, as they flee through the forest. Despite a sunrise chase involving all nine Ringwraiths, Arwen urges the horse faster, with Frodo's life slipping away. As a bright light flares, Frodo closes his eyes, reopening them to find himself safe in bed with Gandalf nearby."
