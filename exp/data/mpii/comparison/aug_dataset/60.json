A remarkable elderly man appears in front of Baxter in her doorway, soon accompanied by a tall, dark-haired girl, as they eavesdrop undetected by Baxter, who cries and then is elated.

Gittes attempts to steady himself while Mulwray gapes at the splinter at his elbow, stands, glances up to the balcony, and then at the youngster. In the style of the sensational blue press, there is a star-shaped illustration around one of the sketches that Gittes had crafted, evoking a smug grin on his face.

Barker attempts to speed himself up as Chandler gawks at the splinter by his toes, jumps, glances down to the field, and then at the boy. In the manner of the Smith gossip rag, there is a star-shaped doodle around one of the sketches that Barker had made, bringing a gleeful grin to his face. Nearby, a bicycle is toppled with the basket open, as a woman observes her kettle steaming over, knitting a scarf while getting a manicure and her glasses cleaned. Almost all the spectators are knitting scarves. Barker leans down and tumbles out of the hammock, despite Jordan's worry as she tries to grab him by clutching the hammock net around Barker's waist.

When Barker glances over, he notices the young boy, apparently in his early teens, so striking that he nearly frowns as the blonde-haired lady grimaces. The young boy strolls ahead of him through the gate. Emily skips through the gate, and Barker skips behind her but is halted by the blonde-haired lady who has also emerged from her garage and down beside him. Barker peers up at the sculptures in his lap and pivots to be handed a slim album of sculptures, a painting and invoice. The Baker fully descends in frustration but Barker is through the outer gate, where the fences are adorned with accolades, sketches of Chandler at various engineering camps, and small diagrams of windmill designs and gardens in the town.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
