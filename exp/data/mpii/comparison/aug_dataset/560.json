Brody gazes inside to Donovan and Indy, who opens the Grail Journal and thoughtfully flips through the pages. Their expedition is OVERLAID on a chart plotting a path from New York City to Venice, Italy. Indy and Brody alight from the Water Bus onto the Boat Dock as other gondoliers guide their vessels on the water. Instantly, a lady with alluring features, blonde hair, and bright, perceptive eyes nears Indy, gazing at him with a calculating look that is boldly playful. Indy smirks, relishing the banter. The lady turns to Brody, who tips his cap. She introduces herself as Dr. Elsa Schneider and extends her hand to Brody. Indy's smirk diminishes, and Brody shows a look of amazement.

          "description": "A tricycle is stationed beside a military jet that displays the Rodriguez family crest. Molly squints inside to Rodriguez and Alex, who cracks open the Treasure Journal and absentmindedly flips through the illustrations. Their adventure is PROJECTED over a globe mapping a path from Chicago to Paris, France. Alex and Molly alight from the Tram Boat onto the Yacht Dock as other captains paddle their kayaks in the bay. Abruptly, a man with striking features, brown hair, and sharp, cunning eyes sidles up to Alex, glancing at him with a calculated demeanor that is overtly teasing. Alex smirks, savoring the banter. The man turns to Molly, who adjusts her scarf. He introduces himself as Mr. Otto Frank and presents a card to Molly. Alex's smirk vanishes, and Molly registers an expression of bewilderment. Alex, Molly, and Otto stroll along the crowded harbor, bordered by vendors on either side. As they traverse a walkway to the other side of the wharf, Alex snatches a coin from a beggar and offers it to Otto. He hands Alex a fragment of parchment, which he then reveals to Molly. Otto guides them into a bustling marketplace where merchants haggle and stand by carts in front of a towering statue, arriving at the base of the monument. Otto leads the path inside, and their footsteps echo across the tile floor. Alex and Molly observe that the monument features several ornate ceiling murals. Otto gestures to three grand granite pillars that stretch from floor to dome. Alex peers at the pillars, then spots a ceiling mural showing a Viking Warrior, pausing briefly before the mural. Once Otto is out of earshot, Alex swiftly retrieves the Treasure Journal and flips it to the illustration he spotted on the spaceship. Molly peeks at the Journal and then at the mural, noticing that the Arabic numerals involved are part of the mural's motif. Alex's gaze darts across the walls and floors, charged with the rush of revelation as they scale one of the three grand granite pillars. He gestures to the ceiling mural, deducing that each pillar is labeled with an Arabic numeral. Alex dashes toward Pillar V, gestures again to the ceiling mural, and gazes at the fragment of parchment in his grip. He strides past rows of artifact-laden cases, pauses, pivots, and peers downward. He ascends a ladder leading to a balcony, peering down at Molly and Otto. Alex then races down the ladder and proceeds to the central mosaic where the two branches of the Y converge."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby cafÃ©, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
