He yanks off his mask and turns to the Kid, who shakes his head. The sound of a tumbler tripping is heard, and suddenly, light sweeps in as the safe door opens to reveal a smiling Willie with his stethoscope in his ears and, in the foreground, a few stacks of cash and a folio. Willie reaches in, grabs the folio, and flips through it. A new Mercedes screeches through the frame, and as it recedes, we are left looking at the Kid, who stands at the curb, waving happily, while Willie and Marcus walk to their cars. Opal looks at him with disdain and reluctantly sidles over. Willie is at a pay phone, and the Kid swings the door open to Willie, who stands on the stoop holding a small grip. The Kid follows Willie like a puppy dog as Willie checks out the house, bumping open doors and looking around. Willie has discovered the master bedroom, which appears long unused, and he tosses his grip onto the double bed. Willie lies in the tub, motionless, with a wet washcloth over his face and the fingers of one hand resting against a tumbler filled with ice and amber liquid that sits on the edge of the tub. From under his washcloth, he drags the washcloth off his face and looks at the Kid, who looks at him unperturbed. She glances in as the person passes, and still chewing, gets out her notebook and jots something down. Willie stares at the board for a long beat, then leaps up screaming and flings the board across the room, while the Kid's face remains unfazed and still smiling. The kid lies in bed, sleeping peacefully as Willie bangs Sue in the Jacuzzi, wearing his Santa hat, while blearily, she gazes back. He closes the door, then tips back the bottle and polishes it off with a series of quick gulps. Ever so daintily, he puts the bottle down, and a beat later -- WHAM! -- he faints dead away, hitting the floor like a felled tree. Willie wakes on the floor to the sound of the scream, a bedroom door crashes open, and the Kid emerges screaming and runs right into Willie, immediately caroms off, and goes screaming down the hall, turning the corner to see a row of fresh, bloody palm-prints down one side of the hall while the Kid, screaming, is just disappearing at the far end.",

He yanks off his mask and turns to the Youth, who shakes his head. The noise of a tumbler tripping is heard, and suddenly, illumination sweeps in as the vault door opens to reveal a smiling Willie with his stethoscope in his ears and, in the foreground, a few piles of currency and a portfolio. Willie reaches in, seizes the portfolio, and flips through it. A new Mercedes screeches through the frame, and as it recedes, we are left observing the Youth, who stands at the curb, waving happily, while Willie and Marcus stroll to their vehicles. Opal looks at him with scorn and reluctantly edges over. Willie is at a pay telephone, and the Youth swings the portal open to Willie, who stands on the stoop holding a small grip. The Youth follows Willie like a puppy dog as Willie inspects the residence, nudging open doors and looking around. Willie has discovered the master bedroom, which seems long unused, and he tosses his grip onto the double bed. Willie reclines in the tub, motionless, with a wet washcloth over his visage and the fingers of one hand resting against a tumbler filled with ice and amber liquid that sits on the edge of the tub. From under his washcloth, he drags the washcloth off his visage and looks at the Youth, who looks at him nonchalantly. She glances in as the person passes, and still chewing, retrieves her notebook and jots something down. Willie gazes at the board for a long moment, then leaps up yelling and flings the board across the chamber, while the Youth's face remains unfazed and still smiling. The youth lies in bed, sleeping peacefully as Willie bangs Sue in the Jacuzzi, wearing his Santa hat, while groggily, she gazes back. He closes the portal, then tips back the bottle and drains it with a series of swift gulps. Ever so delicately, he places the bottle down, and a moment later -- WHAM! -- he faints dead away, hitting the floor like a felled tree. Willie awakes on the floor to the sound of the shriek, a bedroom portal crashes open, and the Youth emerges shrieking and runs right into Willie, immediately caroms off, and goes shrieking down the corridor, turning the corner to see a row of fresh, bloody palm-prints down one side of the corridor while the Youth, shrieking, is just disappearing at the far extremity."

On the rugged highlands of Scotland a stoic warrior faces rival clans and ancient curses alike his fierce battle cry resonating across mistcovered moors and turbulent skies. Amid the vibrant chaos of a South American carnival a fearless dancer twirls through streets bursting with color and rhythm each graceful move challenging the rigid boundaries of tradition. During a clandestine meeting in a snowcovered mountain lodge two rival spies exchange cryptic messages hinting at an imminent global conspiracy. their whispered words carried off by the howling wind. Inside a lavish 1920s speakeasy a troubled jazz musician pours his soul into a melancholic melody every note echoing the bittersweet memories of lost love and shattered dreams. Willie lies in the tub motionless with a wet washcloth over his face and the fingers of one hand resting against a tumbler filled with ice and amber liquid that sits on the edge of the tub. From under his washcloth he drags the washcloth off his face and looks at the Kid who looks at him unperturbed. She glances in as the person passes and still chewing gets out her notebook and jots something down. Willie stares at the board for a long beat then leaps up screaming and flings the board across the room while the Kid's face remains unfazed and still smiling. The kid lies in bed sleeping peacefully. as Willie bangs Sue in the Jacuzzi wearing his Santa hat while blearily she gazes back. He closes the door then tips back the bottle and polishes it off with a series of quick gulps. Ever so daintily he puts the bottle down and a beat later  WHAM. he faints dead away hitting the floor like a felled tree. Willie wakes on the floor to the sound of the scream. a bedroom door crashes open and the Kid emerges screaming and runs right into. Willie immediately caroms off and goes screaming down the hall turning the corner to see a row of fresh bloody palmprints down one side of the hall while the Kid screaming is just disappearing at the far end."

The sound of a tumbler tripping is heard and suddenly light sweeps in as the safe door opens to reveal a smiling Willie with his stethoscope in his ears and in the foreground a few stacks of cash and a folio.

          "description": "Nana levitates from her hammock with the aid of her scooter and starts to drift toward Leo, dressed in a jumpsuit and oversized goggles with another pair of binoculars on a string around her wrist, while he listens as the forgetful young man cluelessly tinkers away. He peels off his wig and spins to the Cat, who nods his tail. The sound of a bell ringing is heard, and suddenly, darkness falls in as the wardrobe door closes to reveal a frowning Leo with his microphone in his paws and, in the background, a few piles of marbles and a ledger. Leo dives in, snatches the ledger, and flicks through it. A shiny bicycle zooms through the window, and as it approaches, we are left watching the Cat, who rests at the fence, meowing cheerfully, while Leo and Harry stroll to their bikes. Jade frowns at him with envy and hesitantly waddles over. Leo is at an ATM, and the Cat swings the gate closed to Leo, who stands on the lawn holding a large suitcase. The Cat trails Leo like a duckling as Leo inspects the garden, kicking open gates and snooping around. Leo has located the laundry room, which seems often crowded, and he slings his suitcase onto the single cot. Leo floats in the pool, lifeless, with a dry towel over his head and the claws of one paw resting against a glass filled with milk and clear liquid that perches on the brink of the pool. From beneath his towel, he drags the towel off his head and glances at the Cat, who stares at him indifferent. He peers in as the creature dashes by, and still chomping, pulls out his planner and scribbles something down. Leo observes the shelf for a long pause, then vaults up giggling and hurls the shelf into the ceiling, while the Cat's eyes remain unblinking and still grinning. The cat rests on a rug, napping soundly as Leo splashes Jen in the fountain, wearing his clown wig, while hazily, she peers back. He slams the lid, then pulls forward the flask and finishes it with a set of gentle sips. Ever so clumsily, he places the flask up, and a pause later -- BAM! -- he collapses breathlessly, hitting the rug like a toppled statue. Leo stirs on the rug to the noise of a whistle, a living room window slides shut, and the Cat appears whistling and collides straight with Leo, promptly bounces off, and dashes whistling through the garden, rounding the hedge to notice a line of old, dusty shoe-prints along one edge of the garden while the Cat, whistling, is just fading at the near end."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

A new Mercedes drives by as the Kid waves happily, and Willie and Marcus head to their cars. Opal disapprovingly joins them. Later, Willie, followed by the Kid, inspects a house, discovering an unused master bedroom. He lounges in a tub with a drink when the Kid arrives. Willie then angrily flings a board across the room, the Kid unfazed. While the Kid sleeps peacefully, Willie is in a Jacuzzi with Sue, wearing a Santa hat. Willie drinks heavily, faints, and wakes to the Kid's screams. The Kid runs into Willie and down a hall marked with bloody palm prints."
