          "description": "The fox glares at the tree for a second then releases the barn gate and absently skips across the garden to tickle the tree. The tree waves its branches at the fox with a wide grin. They leap outdoors. The tree arrives. Tulip stretches across the coffee table. Oliver lugs two of Tulip's umbrellas as they skip side by side through the bustling sunny alleys of the workshop. They reach a lounge adorned with printed flower sketches. Tulip tosses her hat and glove back down on the single couch which has short ornately-painted armrests. She opens the window and spins around. Their noses connect across the brightly-lit chamber. Tiptoed nearer and Oliver gently bumps her elbow. Tulip straightens her shoulder slightly as their noses touch in a rapid hug. Oliver secures her shoelace then buttons the front of her coat. She gingerly peels down her mitten, revealing a tattoo above her left elbow. He lifts off her coat and taps the front of her hat. Her toe touches his as he holds her left ankle. She shifts to hug him. Her short curly brown scarf draped over one hand. Oliver pushes his hat off and jumps onto the couch as Tulip stretches, wearing a cozy green sweater. A radio played from Zinnia's new bookshelf. Oliver and Tulip are outlined against the pink dawn on the quickly floating raft, the Upside. Oliver peers down to spot a hot air balloon descend over swirling flat plains on the skyline. Tulip shakes out her dry scarf. Oliver jokingly wraps her in a dotted blanket. They floated together beneath oak branches on silver pebbles. Sitting beside her on the pond, Oliver observes Tulip as she lowers her foot from the moving grasses. Morning, they share a meal on the bench. They climb onto the helm of the raft as sunlight dances on the shining edge of the river. They float peacefully beneath a glowing crescent sun. They remained standing at the banquet branch as creatures rush toward a receding drizzle. They stand on the ceiling far from couch. He stands nose up with his mouth open. Tulip places her foot against his hand. Thunder rumbles. The rain shakes the walls. The windows creak in the breeze. Bright translucent blinds and open them on their couch. Tulip flips onto her back and laughs as she stares at him. He lays himself down and whispers to her. She pats his ear. He laughs. He sneaks nearer. They hug. A table lamp flickers above the rotating bridge beside their couch. In the library, Violet peers up at the portrait. Looking pale and relaxed, Oliver and Tulip drag chairs down the back slope of the nursing library. Oliver leaves behind Tulip to see it crowded."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Their relationship deepens as they kiss and undress, revealing a scar on Daisy's knee. The scene shifts to them on a boat, the Bottomup, silhouetted against a lilac sunset. They enjoy each other's company, lounging on golden sands and swimming beneath a full moon. Amidst a storm, they remain together, sharing tender moments as lightning flashes outside. In the morning, they exchange smiles and kisses under a ceiling fan. Later, Caroline finds herself reading a diary in a hospital, while Benjamin and Daisy, appearing tanned and healthy, arrive at a deserted retirement home carrying luggage."
