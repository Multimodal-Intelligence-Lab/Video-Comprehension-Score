Transitioning indoors, they find a place to sit together and share a sense of closeness before she departs, leaving a lingering silence behind.

Later, Benjamin takes hold of two of Daisy's suitcases, carrying them with a sense of purpose as they walk side by side down the silent, shadowy corridors of the home, their footsteps echoing slightly in the quiet.

She moves to close the door, imbuing the room with an air of privacy, and turns to face Benjamin, their eyes meeting across the dimly-lit room, creating an intimate connection. Stepping closer, Benjamin firmly places his hands around her torso, pulling her into an embrace.

Swimming gracefully beneath the brilliance of the full moon, their movements are fluid and harmonious. Later, they remain seated at the picnic bench even as others flee in haste from the threatening storm advancing upon them. Retreating from the chaos, they lie on the floor close to the bed, finding solace in each other's presence. He rests face down, his eyes closed in a peaceful slumber, while Daisy tenderly rests her chin against his shoulder, providing a comforting presence. Lightning flashes intermittently, illuminating the room, while the wind rattles the windows with a relentless force that echoes throughout the space. The doors join in the cacophony, shaking in the gale. Attempting to create a cocoon of tranquility, they pull the pale diaphanous drapes closed around their bed. Daisy rolls onto her side, gracing him with a smile filled with affection and contentment as she gazes upon him. In response, he props himself up slightly, meeting her gaze with equal warmth. She gently strokes his cheek, a gesture filled with tenderness as he inches closer to share a kiss.

She flings her arms around him with a big smile that speaks of a long-awaited reunion. They sit indoors in the cozy living room filled with the scent of freshly brewed coffee. She leaves, heading out to run errands. Daisy leans across the dining table, set with fine china and an elegant floral centerpiece. Benjamin carries two of Daisy's suitcases, which are well-worn from countless travels, as they walk side by side through the silent shadowy corridors of the home, a historic mansion with a storied past. They enter a bedroom decorated with framed landscape paintings by local artists celebrated for capturing the area's natural beauty. Daisy puts her coat and hand back down on the double bed which has tall elaborately-carved bedposts, reminiscent of Victorian craftsmanship. She closes the door and turns around. Their eyes meet across the dimly-lit room, an intimate space illuminated by the soft glow of a vintage lamp. Stepped closer and Benjamin firmly clasps her torso. Daisy arches her back slightly as their lips meet in a slow kiss, a moment that seems to pause time. Benjamin unfastens her belt, a sleek leather piece, then unzips the back of her dress, a classic A-line with intricate lacework. She carefully rolls down her stocking, revealing a scar beneath her right knee, a reminder of a childhood accident when she climbed the tallest tree. He slides off her dress and kisses the back of her neck, a tender gesture. Her hand meets his as he grasps her right thigh. She turns to kiss him, her long sleek red hair draped over one shoulder like cascading silk.

Benjamin and Daisy are silhouetted against the lilac sunset on the slowly drifting boat, the Bottomup, an old yacht restored to its former glory. Benjamin looks up to see a space rocket rise over billowing mountainous clouds on the horizon, part of a rare launch from the nearby space center. Daisy wrings out her wet hair, her laughter mingling with the ocean breeze. Benjamin playfully engulfs her in a stripy towel, reminiscent of the ones used during their beach vacations. They lounged together beneath palm trees on golden sands, reminiscent of a secluded island paradise. Standing beside her on the ocean, Benjamin watches Daisy as she raises her head from the still waters, sparkling under the afternoon sun. Night, they make love on the deck, under a blanket of stars. They dive off the prowl of the boat as moonlight plays on the glittering surface of the sea, casting a magical glow. They swim gracefully beneath a brilliant full moon, which guides their path. They remained seated at the picnic branch as people flee from an advancing storm, a sudden summer squall. They lie on the floor close to bed, the plush carpet providing warmth. He lies face down with his eyes closed, exhausted but content. Daisy rests her chin against his shoulder, finding comfort in his presence. Lightning flashes, illuminating the room in brief bursts. The wind rattles the windows with a relentless force. The doors rattle in the gale, echoing the tempest outside. Pale diaphanous drapes and close them in their bed, creating a cocoon-like sanctuary.

They remained standing at the banquet branch as creatures rush toward a receding drizzle. They stand on the ceiling far from couch. He stands nose up with his mouth open. Tulip places her foot against his hand. Thunder rumbles. The rain shakes the walls. The windows creak in the breeze. Bright translucent blinds and open them on their couch. Tulip flips onto her back and laughs as she stares at him. He lays himself down and whispers to her. She pats his ear. He laughs. He sneaks nearer. They hug. A table lamp flickers above the rotating bridge beside their couch. In the library, Violet peers up at the portrait. Looking pale and relaxed, Oliver and Tulip drag chairs down the back slope of the nursing library. Oliver leaves behind Tulip to see it crowded."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

          "description": "Benjamin and Daisy reunite with an embrace and share intimate moments in a dimly-lit room. They enter a bedroom adorned with landscape paintings and carved bedposts. Their relationship deepens as they kiss and undress, revealing a scar on Daisy's knee. The scene shifts to them on a boat, the Bottomup, silhouetted against a lilac sunset. They enjoy each other's company, lounging on golden sands and swimming beneath a full moon. Amidst a storm, they remain together, sharing tender moments as lightning flashes outside. In the morning, they exchange smiles and kisses under a ceiling fan. Later, Caroline finds herself reading a diary in a hospital, while Benjamin and Daisy, appearing tanned and healthy, arrive at a deserted retirement home carrying luggage."
