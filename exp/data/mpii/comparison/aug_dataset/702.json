As Peter turns his way and that, Venom grabs him from above, using the element of surprise to his advantage, and hurls him into a girder, the impact resonating with the metal. Peter falls on his face, vulnerable and exposed. Venom lassos his wrists with two black threads, exhibiting the symbiote's versatile powers, and holds him to his knees. He whacks him with an iron bar, the brutality of the attack underscoring Venom's ruthless nature. He hits him twice more, ripping the mask right off, laying bare Peter's identity.

          "description": "Benny stretches out a paw, and Carlos grips it lightly. Benny shakes his head, and Carlos drops to his hands. They roll around to face their allies. Phantom glides at Carlos. Benny swings Carlos like a bat to hit Boulder. He zaps Boulder's leg with water from his cloud plank. Boulder attempts to snatch Benny, but the creature's tiny leg disintegrates like sand. Lenny's in the congregation above. He attempts to draw a sketch. The notepad's blank. Lenny squints at the boy. Carlos and Benny dodge Boulder's tiny toes. Beside them, the bucket soars towards Tina. The bucket misses her. She dangles on by a rope. Benny and Carlos glide towards her on the cloud plank, twisting past the rocky giant. The rope snaps, and Tina plunges. Carlos swivels the cloud plank around. Being onto one another, they glide past Boulder, and Carlos jumps off the cloud plank and grabs her. The observing audience cheers as he swings away on a vine carrying Tina in his paws and lands back on the half-finished monument. He shakes through his tattered veil. Boulder snatches at Benny. Carlos kicks rocks in Boulder's nose. Boulder twirls around, puzzled, then smacks Carlos with his tiny leg, sending him soaring down to one of the lower levels of the half-constructed tower. He's outside of Boulder's grasp. He launches fireworks from the cloud plank. They strike their aim, and the colossal stone creature wobbles back, cracking and dissolving. As his tiny right leg crumbles into the air leaving out of mist, the congregation cheer their excitement. Low down on the monument, Carlos, his Bat-Man veil mostly shredded, his nose and ears quite showing, scans around for Phantom. As Carlos turns his head and this, Phantom seizes him from below and flings him into a beam. Carlos crashes on his back. Phantom binds his ankles with two white ropes and pins him to his elbows. He hammers him with a wooden rod. He taps him twice more, peeling the veil right off. Phantom presses the blunt wooden rod to Carlos's shoulder. Phantom's vines wrap Blake's hair. As he goes to jab Carlos, a citrus fruit smashes against him. Benny glides down. Phantom grabs the cloud plank from below him. As Benny descends, he snatches a stack of short wooden rods that roll to the ceiling. Carlos still confined watches as Phantom puts his feet to his knees and seems to partly dissolve. Carlos recalls bumping himself on the gong when he struggled to remove the white cloak. Phantom jumps up Carlos, brandishing the cloud plank as a shield. Benny stands in behind them. Benny glances up at the three arrows jutting through his back. Phantom lifts him down into the ground and drags him away."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Harry uses his sky stick to attack Sandman, whose attempts to grab Harry fail as his arm shatters. Meanwhile, Jameson in the crowd below finds his camera empty. As Sandman swings at them, Peter and Harry narrowly avoid his massive fists. Above them, Mary Jane is in peril as a cab nearly hits her, but the duo manages to rescue her just in time. The crowd cheers as Peter swings away with Mary Jane. Back on the skyscraper, Sandman crumbles after Peter's rocket attack. Meanwhile, Venom ambushes Peter, restraining and battering him, ripping his mask off. When Venom is about to finish Peter, a pumpkin bomb intercedes. Harry tries to help but falls after Venom snatches his sky stick. Recalling a previous encounter with the suit, Peter observes Venom disoriented by sound. As Venom advances with the sky stick, Harry selflessly intervenes but is mortally wounded, saving Peter in the process."
