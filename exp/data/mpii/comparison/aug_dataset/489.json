He pauses halfway down, turns, puts his hands on her arms. The silhouette of Norman is seen; he is still. Norman then turns slowly until, in silhouette, we see his profile, his chin lowered furtively as he looks over his shoulder in the direction of the house. The store is in darkness, only the glow from the back room spilling in. With the camera placed with its back to the street door, we see the distant tiny figure of Lila seated and waiting in the back room beyond. The tiny figure jumps up and runs all the way from the back room down the aisle of hardware and comes into a big head. From her viewpoint, we see Sam alighting from his truck and coming toward the door of the store. He enters, and he and Lila exchange quiet glances. She feels his pause, turns, and for a moment they share at each other across the darkened room. She hands the receiver to the Sheriff, who takes it reluctantly and listens to the dim sound of ringing on the other end. Sam and Lila stare at the Sheriff, who stares back at them, and when he finally speaks there is an almost inaudible tone of irony in his voice. Norman sits in the dim, one-lamp light, the phone next to him, his hand still near it as if he had not been able to move his hand after hanging up, staring at the shrike-like bird perched on the lamp shade. Suddenly, he rises, starts quickly out of the room, tries to switch off the lamp as he goes, and in so doing, succeeds only in knocking the bird off the shade. He then puts out the lamp, goes out, crosses the darkened office, and goes outside, coming off the porch. He walks to the path, directly up to the house, opens the door, and goes in. Norman goes up, pauses one moment outside his mother's door, then opens it and goes in, leaving the door open. He moves away and the others follow. She smiles brightly, as if having invited them over to discuss this year's charity fandango, takes the Sheriff's arm, and starts away. The Sheriff nods as he goes. Sam and Lila are alone now at the curb before the deserted chapel. As the truck drives off, Sam takes Lila's arm and starts with her toward the path that leads to the old house. The camera pans with them, and as they turn around the office corner, they see Norman coming down the path toward them.",

He hesitates midway down, swivels, places his hands on her limbs. The outline of Norman is observed; he is motionless. Norman then rotates slowly until, in outline, we view his aspect, his chin lowered secretively as he glances over his shoulder in the direction of the residence. The shop is in dimness, only the radiance from the rear chamber spilling in. With the camera positioned with its back to the avenue entrance, we observe the distant tiny shape of Lila seated and awaiting in the rear chamber beyond. The diminutive shape leaps up and sprints all the way from the rear chamber down the passageway of hardware and arrives into a large head. From her perspective, we view Sam descending from his vehicle and approaching the entrance of the shop. He enters, and he and Lila swap quiet looks. She senses his hesitation, turns, and for a moment they share at each other across the darkened chamber. She hands the handset to the Sheriff, who takes it unwillingly and listens to the faint tone of ringing on the other end. Sam and Lila gaze at the Sheriff, who gazes back at them, and when he finally speaks there is an almost imperceptible tone of sarcasm in his voice. Norman perches in the dim, one-bulb light, the telephone next to him, his hand still near it as if he had not been capable to move his hand after hanging up, staring at the shrike-like avian perched on the lamp shade. Abruptly, he rises, starts swiftly out of the chamber, attempts to turn off the lamp as he goes, and in so doing, manages only in knocking the avian off the shade. He then extinguishes the lamp, goes out, traverses the darkened bureau, and goes outside, descending off the porch. He strides to the path, directly up to the residence, opens the entrance, and goes in. Norman ascends, hesitates one moment outside his mother's entrance, then opens it and goes in, leaving the entrance open. He shifts away and the others trail. She grins brightly, as if having invited them over to discuss this year's charity gala, takes the Sheriff's limb, and commences away. The Sheriff nods as he goes. Sam and Lila are solitary now at the curb before the deserted chapel. As the truck drives off, Sam takes Lila's limb and starts with her toward the path that directs to the aged residence. The camera pans with them, and as they rotate around the bureau corner, they observe Norman descending the path toward them."

Norman’s silhouette is seen; he remains still. Slowly, Norman is turned until his profile in silhouette is visible, his chin furtively lowered as a look over his shoulder in the house's direction is given by him. Darkness encompasses the store, with only the glow from the back room spilling in. With its back to the street door, the camera shows Lila’s distant tiny figure seated and waiting in the back room beyond. Up she jumps and runs all the way from the back room down the aisle of hardware, and is brought into a big head. From her viewpoint, Sam is seen by us alighting from his truck and coming toward the store's door. He enters, and quiet glances are exchanged by him and Lila. A pause is felt by her; she turns, and for a moment they share a look across the darkened room.

Norman then slowly turns, and in silhouette, his profile is revealed, his chin lowered in a furtive manner as he glances over his shoulder in the direction of the house. The store is enveloped in darkness, with only a faint glow emanating from the back room, casting a soft light. Positioned with its back to the street door, the camera captures the distant, tiny figure of Lila, seated and waiting patiently in the back room beyond. Suddenly, the small figure springs up and dashes all the way from the back room, racing down the aisle lined with hardware, and comes into a large close-up.

With a determined air, he moves purposefully toward the telephone, dials the operator with precision, and begins heading toward the door, his strides deliberate. Lila follows closely behind him, seamlessly entering the store in his wake. As he reaches the halfway point across the room, he pauses briefly, turns back towards her, and gently places his hands reassuringly on her arms, offering a moment filled with comfort. In the dim, subdued light, the silhouette of Norman becomes distinctly visible; he remains completely motionless, a figure shrouded in shadow. Norman then slowly turns, and in silhouette, his profile is gradually revealed; his chin is lowered in a furtive manner as he glances suspiciously over his shoulder toward the direction of the house. The entire store is enveloped in a blanket of darkness, with only a faint glow emanating from the back room, casting a soft and gentle light. Positioned with its back to the street door, the camera captures the distant, almost tiny figure of Lila, seated and waiting patiently in the back room beyond her immediate surroundings. Suddenly, the small figure springs up from her seat, dashing all the way from the back room, racing energetically down the aisle lined meticulously with hardware, and comes into a large, dramatic close-up. From her perspective, we see Sam stepping gracefully down from his truck and making his determined way toward the store's entrance. He steps inside, and he and Lila exchange quiet, meaningful glances, each filled with unspoken understanding. She senses his hesitation, turns slightly, and for a brief moment, they share a silent, significant connection across the shadowy room.

Norman then turns slowly until, in silhouette against the evening sky, we see his profile, his chin lowered furtively as he looks over his shoulder in the direction of the house known locally as the Bates Mansion. The store is in darkness, only the glow from the back room, where inventory was often counted by hand, spilling in. With the camera placed with its back to the street door, we see the distant tiny figure of Lila seated and waiting in the back room beyond, surrounded by old shelves lining the walls.

Amidst the chaos of a raging civil war a compassionate medic races through bombedout streets. Sam and Lila stare at the Sheriff who stares back at them and when he finally speaks there is an almost inaudible tone of irony in his voice. Norman sits in the dim onelamp light the phone next to him his hand still near it as if he had not been able to move his hand after hanging up staring at the shrikelike bird perched on the lamp shade. Suddenly he rises starts quickly out of the room tries to switch off the lamp as he goes and in so doing succeeds only in knocking the bird off the shade. He then puts out the lamp goes out crosses the darkened office and goes outside coming off the porch. He walks to the path directly up to the house opens the door and goes in.

          "description": "Max glares at him, grins in curiosity over his imaginary bravery, skips to the couch, presses intercom, and leaps for the window, trailed by Zoe into the library. She halts midway down, spins, places her feet on his shoulders. The outline of Edgar is visible; he is frozen. Edgar then spins swiftly until, in outline, we catch his shadow, his forehead lifted suspiciously as he peers past his elbow in the direction of the barn. The library is in brightness, only the shadow from the front desk seeping out. With the camera positioned with its front to the garden gate, we observe the distant large silhouette of Zoe standing and pacing in the front desk beyond. The large silhouette sits down and tiptoes all the way from the front desk up the hallway of ceramics and tumbles into a small toe. From his perspective, we watch Max descending from his bicycle and going toward the window of the library. He exits, and he and Zoe exchange loud whispers. He senses her shift, spins, and for a fragment they gaze at each other across the illuminated space. He passes the microphone to the Gardener, who grabs it eagerly and listens to the faint echo of music on the other side. Max and Zoe peer at the Gardener, who peers back at them, and when he finally whispers there is an almost inaudible tone of amusement in his laughter. Edgar lounges in the bright, three-bulb glow, the stereo next to him, his foot still on it as if he had not been able to lift his foot after turning it off, peering at the wasp-like drone hovering around the bulb holder. Suddenly, he drops, moves sluggishly into the yard, attempts to turn on the light as he travels, and in so doing, succeeds only in scaring the drone from the holder. He then turns on the bulb, moves in, traverses the illuminated patio, and goes inside, coming onto the pier. He jogs to the fence, directly down to the barn, closes the gate, and moves out. Edgar climbs down, stops for a second inside his uncle's gate, then closes it and moves out, leaving the gate shut. He steps behind and the others wander. He frowns warmly, as if having pushed them away to solve next month's puzzle maze, grabs the Gardener's ear, and leaps toward. The Gardener shakes as he jumps. Max and Zoe are standing now in the aisle beside the overcrowded palace. As the bicycle rides on, Max grabs Zoe's hand and leaps with her down the pavement that guides to the new barn. The camera zooms on them, and as they twist beyond the patio hedge, they spot Edgar climbing up the pavement away from them."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

          "description": "Sam, concerned about the evident anxiety of a woman named Lila, calls the operator before heading with her into a dark store. They notice Norman, who seems suspicious and glances toward his house. The store's dim light reveals Lila watching Sam arrive from his truck. Inside, they quietly acknowledge each other, and Lila passes the phone receiver to a hesitant Sheriff. The Sheriff, displaying a trace of irony, listens to the faint ringing. Meanwhile, Norman, in a dimly lit room, struggles to move after a phone call, knocking a bird off a lamp. He then exits, crossing an office and entering his house. At his mother's door, Norman pauses before going in. Elsewhere, a smiling woman escorts the Sheriff away, and Sam and Lila find themselves alone by a deserted chapel. As the truck departs, Sam guides Lila toward the path by the old house, where they encounter Norman approaching."
