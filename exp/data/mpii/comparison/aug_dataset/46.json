Once he is satisfied with his observation and verification, he straightens up and gently repositions the foot back to its place. He then proceeds with deliberate steps to the opposite end, where he begins the process of revealing the head by slowly lifting the sheet. Observing this action, she instinctively closes her eyes for a brief pause, perhaps steeling herself, before reopening them and fixing her gaze on what is now exposed. She then nods in affirmation, and after a moment's contemplation, she nods once more, confirming her acknowledgment. At this juncture, GRANDPIERRE, the figure of authority, enters the scene. He acknowledges the situation with a nod directed at the attendant who remains out of the camera's view. The camera next executes a sudden, smooth movement as the 'drawer' mechanism is activated, sliding the contained object back into the wall with precision. The scene is enveloped in darkness as a loud clang resonates, the reverberations gradually diminishing into silence. The scene transitions to a top-down view of a desk drawer being smoothly pulled open, revealing a photograph of Charles Lampert, which lies conspicuously face-up within the drawer. The camera then captures the setting of the office, which is sparsely furnished, typical of a policeman's workspace, where GRANDPIERRE is seated with an air of authority behind his desk, and REGGIE sits across from him, sifting through her handbag. She extracts a package of nuts, beginning to separate the shells with precision using her thumbnail, consuming the nuts one by one, and tidily placing the discarded shells into the ashtray. GRANDPIERRE observes her actions for a fleeting moment, then lets out a sigh as he sets his pencil down, and decisively presses a button on his desk. He reaches into his desk and retrieves a cigar with a decisive motion, briefly placing it in his mouth before reconsidering, removing it with a swift motion, and returning it to the drawer with a forceful slam, closing it with intensity. As the door swings open once more, a policeman enters bearing a wicker basket, which he places securely on GRANDPIERRE's desk before making a hasty exit. GRANDPIERRE leans forward, peering into the basket with curiosity, and begins to methodically extract the items, laying them out on the desk with care, identifying each one as he does so. GRANDPIERRE then hands her a letter, observing her intently as she reads through its contents. He slides a blank sheet of paper along with a pen toward her, encouraging her to respond, and simultaneously starts to replace the items back into the basket with care as he continues to speak. Reaching once again into the depths of his desk drawer, he retrieves a passport and extends it to her; its cover unmistakably identifies it as Swiss. REGGIE reacts by opening it, revealing inside the image of a man — one that matches the photograph previously seen in GRANDPIERRE's possession. He proceeds to present her with yet another passport, noticeably American, followed by two additional passports, handing each to her one at a time, his focus unwavering as his eyes remain cast downward. The camera then subtly pans downwards, emphasizing his hands, which are engaged in a meticulous task as he trims his nails with a small metal clipper. In a different location, the entrance to the chapel swings open with a creak, allowing a beam of daylight to pierce through the dim interior. Within this bright frame, a short, heavy-set silhouette of a man is silhouetted against the light streaming in from outside. He pauses, taking a moment to survey his surroundings before closing the door firmly behind him. The man, identified as LEOPOLD GIDEON, is characterized by his short-sighted gaze, a balding head, and the demeanor of someone in his mid-forties. He casts a nervous glance around the chapel, akin to a skittish barnyard bird, before making his way down one of the side aisles. As he proceeds, she follows his movements with a watchful eye, observing his progression until GIDEON arrives resolutely at the coffin."

Satisfied, he recovers the foot, then moves to the other end to uncover the head, revealing it to be a typical procedure in identifying bodies. As the sheet starts to lift, she closes her eyes for a moment, then looks again, bracing herself for the emotional weight of the moment. She nods, acknowledging the reality before her. She nods again, confirming her recognition. GRANDPIERRE, a seasoned detective known in Paris for his meticulous approach, moves into the shot. GRANDPIERRE nods as he turns to the unseen attendant, a witness to countless somber identifications. The camera suddenly moves as the 'drawer,' resembling those used in morgues worldwide, is slid back into the wall. Blackness comes with a loud clang and continues while the echo dies, reminiscent of the finality in such proceedings. A close shot of a desk drawer from above as it is pulled open reveals a photograph of Charles Lampert, an enigmatic figure intricately linked to an ongoing investigation, lying face up in the drawer. The scene includes GRANDPIERRE sitting behind his desk, and REGGIE sitting across from him, in an office as bare as most policemen's offices, stark and unadorned to reflect the seriousness of their work. She starts to rummage through her bag, but she pulls a package of nuts out, the kind commonly found in convenience stores, begins separating the shells with her thumbnail, eating the nuts, and depositing the shells in the ashtray, a makeshift disposal. GRANDPIERRE watches this for an instant, a momentary distraction from their grave conversation. GRANDPIERRE sighs, a sign of his weariness with the case, puts down his pencil, and pushes a button on the desk, an intercom used to summon assistance. He removes a cigar from his desk, a habit picked up over long hours on the job, and inserts it into his mouth, then rips the cigar out of his mouth and slams it back into the drawer, closing it fiercely as if to dispel his frustration. The door opens and a policeman enters again, this time carrying a wicker basket, which he deposits on GRANDPIERRE's desk, then leaves. GRANDPIERRE peers into the basket, begins to take the items out, placing them on the desk, identifying each as he does as part of the methodical inventory of personal effects. GRANDPIERRE hands her the letter, a crucial piece of evidence, and watches her closely as she reads it. He slides a sheet of paper and pen across to her, then starts to put the things back into the basket while he speaks, organizing his thoughts as methodically as the items. He reaches into the desk drawer, pulls out a passport, which he hands to her; the cover indicates that it is Swiss, hinting at a life of international intrigue. REGGIE's hand opens it to a picture of a man—the man seen in GRANDPIERRE's photo, whose identity is central to the mystery. He hands her another passport, the cover is American, suggesting dual identities or possibly espionage. He hands her, one at a time, two more passports, each representing different facets of a complex life, his eyes still lowered. The camera pans down to feature his hands—he is methodically trimming his nails with a small clipper, a mundane act that contrasts with the gravity of their discussion. The front door of the chapel is heard opening, and a shaft of daylight streams in, breaking the dim solemnity of the chapel. The short, heavy-set figure of a man is outlined against the bright outdoor light. He stands for a moment, then closes the door after him. LEOPOLD GIDEON, short-sighted, bald, in his middle forties, glances around nervously, like a barnyard bird, then walks down one of the side aisles of the chapel as he watches GIDEON, as she watches him, and GIDEON arrives at the coffin, the center of their shared, silent vigil."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

He retrieves a cigar, angrily returns it to the drawer, and a policeman delivers a wicker basket. Grandpierre methodically removes items, handing Reggie a letter and closely observing her reaction. He passes her several passports, showing a picture of a man seen earlier. Meanwhile, Leopold Gideon, a nervous, short-sighted man, enters a chapel, his figure silhouetted against the light, as he approaches a coffin under Reggie’s watchful eyes."
