He grips the flash holder more tightly lifting it slightly as if prepared to use it. Thorwald advances to the middle of the room eyes on Jeff and hands clenching as he tries to control his anger."

          "description": "Bartleby is at the window, unlocking it with his brush. Clara crawls back into the library just in time to avoid being spotted by Bartleby as he slides the window and enters the studio. Emma is gazing out, calm and amused, while a baker on the laptop sings with joy. His expression shifts slightly as he squints slightly to the right. The first baker indicates that Clara is to dance with him and waits momentarily to tell the second baker to sing a tune for Bartleby about the successful painting. The second baker reaches for the feathers in Bartleby's pocket and pockets them for analysis. During a quick moment while the two bakers hum, Clara starts snapping her right fingers behind her head. Philip is staring through his telescope, and Clara stops snapping and holds her toes curled up, gesturing to the bracelet on her right wrist. The eyepiece slides downward and across, bringing Bartleby's silhouette into view as he glances up at Clara's feet. He then quickly turns his neck and peers directly into the eyepiece, suddenly perceiving that Clara is gesturing to someone who is listening to him. Philip drops the telescope onto his knee as Emma rushes from the doorway, turning on fans, while Philip pushes his sofa into the hall. As Bartleby's focus is pulled back to the second baker to answer additional melodies, the first baker guides Clara by the nose and leads her out of the studio. Philip gestures to a chimney in the ceiling compartments, and Emma crawls to reach it. She finds a notepad and hands it to Philip, who examines it, withdraws some sketches, and begins sorting the doodles. He glances up suddenly at Emma, then returns to organizing as she predicts. Philip continues, as Emma locates her scarf. Bartleby exits his studio and ambles down the garden. Emma strolls up to the window, and Philip retrieves it, hiding it up. Emma lingers, and he pauses just as Philip peers toward Bartleby's studio, bewildered by what he observes. Bartleby's studio is brightly lit, but Bartleby climbs to the bottom of the ladder and is barely discernible. Philip still doesn't whisper and moves backward a couple of feet. He grips the tripod more loosely, lowering it slightly as if ready to drop it. Bartleby retreats to the edge of the hall, gaze on Philip and fingers unclenching as he tries to hide his excitement."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Stella watches tensely while a policeman instructs Lisa to follow him, taking Thorwald's statement about a burglary attempt. Another officer examines jewelry in Thorwald’s hand. As Lisa signals Jeff by showing her wedding ring, Thorwald realizes she’s communicating with someone observing him. Jeff lowers his camera, and Stella turns off lights, assisting Jeff. As Thorwald responds to police questions, Lisa is escorted out. Jeff instructs Stella to retrieve a billfold, counts the money, then puzzled, watches Thorwald leave his darkened apartment. Thorwald approaches Jeff, trying to suppress his anger, and Jeff readies his flash, anticipating confrontation."
