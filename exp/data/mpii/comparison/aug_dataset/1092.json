The siblings observe it crash into the cable and crowd towards the German trooper sprawling on the soil. They divest the lifeless man of his firearm and rummage through his saddlebags. A vehicle's headlights emerge in the expanse, and Zus and the others lift up the corpse, carry it to the verge of the route, and hurl it down into the forest. They assume their stances and observe the vehicle approach closer. The operator exits the convertible to scrutinize the hindrance in the route, gazes to the verge of the route near where Zus and the others are concealing. The two Germans in the vehicle and their female associate ignite. The operator unzips his fly and urinates all over Zus, who attempts to shield his visage with his hands. The operator detects him, and Zus pierces him. The other Germans are trapped from behind as the sergeant discharges blindly into the obscurity. Asael and others pursue a private while Zus releases automatic weapon shots. Asael pursues the fleeing private and brings him down. Zus completes the Germans in the vehicle as Asael shoots his quarry point blank. The band inspects the firearms they have amassed, but more headlights emerge in the expanse, beaming their rays directly at them. The siblings brace and discharge into the blinding light. Peretz is struck, and Asael retrieves more guns and runs into a meadow while Tuvia aids Peretz to his feet and draws him away from the barrage. He picks up another firearm and sprints into the thickets as an armored carrier rolls up. Troopers leap off the back and chase Asael, who's speeding across a meadow. Tuvia and Peretz pause by and observe the carrier decelerating while a spotlight on its path highlights Asael sprinting across the meadow. Armed Germans pursue Asael, but their bullets whiz past him. The hefty spotlight is on the soil and highlights Tuvia, who shoots directly at it, shattering the filament. Asael is hunted like a creature, but he and Zus gather up their arsenal of firearms and escape. The subsequent dawn at their encampment, sandy-haired Tuvia looks across at Zus with rage in his pale azure eyes. Laila is scraping the bottom of a cooking vessel with a scoop. Shimon, in his headwear, coat, and woolen muffler, observes her grimly, and others in the encampment look pale and emaciated. Aron, chewing on a piece of loaf, hands it to Rachel, the adolescent girl, and she devours it. Tuvia turns to Malbin, who's sitting with Peretz, whose eyes are open but vacant.

As the German soldier is thrown from the bike and sprawls on the ground, they swarm him with a sense of urgency. They quickly relieve the deceased man of his weapon and rifle through his saddlebags, searching for anything of use. Suddenly, the distant glow of a car's headlights appears, prompting Zus and the others to swiftly pick up the body. They carry it to the side of the road, exerting effort to move it swiftly and discreetly, before unceremoniously tossing it down into the woods. They waste no time in taking up their positions, crouching stealthily as they watch the car draw nearer. The driver of the open-topped car exits to inspect the obstacle on the road, his eyes scanning the area near where Zus and the others are hidden. Meanwhile, the two Germans in the car, accompanied by their female companion, casually light up cigarettes, oblivious to the imminent danger. The driver, feeling daring, unzips his fly and urinates, inadvertently showering Zus, who desperately tries to shield his face with his hands. The act, however, alerts the driver to Zus's presence, prompting Zus to react quickly by stabbing him. With precision, the others ambush the remaining Germans from behind, as the sergeant frantically shoots into the darkness, hoping to hit something, anything.

          "description": "Tuvia throws out some wire across the track as a German motorbike, part of a Wehrmacht patrol known for its speed and mobility, comes into view. The brothers, who were partisans in the dense forests of Eastern Europe during World War II, watch it plow into the wire and swarm towards the German soldier sprawled on the ground. They relieve the dead man of his weapon, an MP40 submachine gun, and rifle through his saddlebags, likely finding maps or orders that could aid their resistance efforts. A car's headlights appear in the distance, and Zus and the others pick up the body, carry it to the side of the road, and toss it down into the wood, a common tactic to avoid detection. They take up their positions and watch the car, a staff car typically used by German officers, draw nearer. The driver gets out of the open-topped car to investigate the obstacle on the road, peers to the side of the road near where Zus and the others are hiding, knowing full well the danger of partisan attacks. The two Germans in the car and their female companion, likely a secretary or a civilian forced into service, light up. The driver opens his fly and takes a leak all over Zus, who tries to protect his face with his hands. The driver spots him, and Zus stabs him, using a knife often carried by resistance fighters for close combat. The other Germans are ambushed from behind as the sergeant shoots blindly into the darkness. Asael and others chase after a private, who is part of the invading forces, while Zus unleashes machine gun fire from a position of cover. Asael chases after the fleeing private and brings him down with a tackle learned from their survival training. Zus finishes up the Germans in the car as Asael shoots his prey point blank, a brutal necessity in their fight for survival. The group examines the weapons they have collected, including grenades and ammunition that are always in short supply, but more headlights appear in the distance, shining their beams straight at them. The brothers, knowing they are outnumbered, line up and open fire into the dazzling light. Peretz is hit, and Asael recoups more guns and runs into a field while Tuvia helps Peretz to his feet and pulls him away from the line of fire, mindful of the German reinforcements. He picks up another rifle, a weapon they desperately need, and dashes into the bushes as an armored vehicle, likely an Sd.Kfz. half-track, drives up. Soldiers jump off the back and run after Asael, who's haring across a field where their camp lies hidden. Tuvia and Peretz stop by and watch the truck slowing down while a searchlight, standard on German patrol vehicles, on its route picks out Asael running across the field. Armed Germans go after Asael, but their bullets whiz past him, unable to match his desperation-fueled speed. The heavy searchlight is on the ground and picks out Tuvia, who fires straight at it, destroying the bulb and plunging the area into darkness. Asael is pursued like an animal, but he and Zus gather up their armory of guns and run back to their forested refuge. The next morning at their camp, a hidden enclave known only to those fighting for freedom, sandy-haired Tuvia looks across at Zus with fury in his pale blue eyes, a sign of the stress and pressure they all face. Laila is scraping the bottom of a cooking pot with a ladle, trying to make the most of their limited provisions. Shimon, in his hat, coat, and woolen scarf, watches her grimly, as the chill of the early morning bites. Others in the camp look pale and gaunt, a direct consequence of the ongoing struggle to find enough food. Aron, chewing on a piece of bread scavenged from a recent raid, hands it to Rachel, the teenage girl who joined their band after her village was attacked, and she devours it, hungry from the constant rationing. Tuvia turns to Malbin, who's sitting with Peretz, whose eyes are open but lifeless, evidence of the toll war takes on the spirit. Malbin shakes his head, indicating that despite the night’s success, the losses weigh heavily on them all."

          "description": "Claude tosses out some string along the path as a French bicycle rolls into sight.

The mechanic gets out of the covered-top truck to inspect the barrier in the alley, squints towards the edge of the alley near where Max and the others are lurking. The two Italians in the truck and their feline passenger laugh aloud. The mechanic opens his map and scribbles on Max, who attempts to shield his eyes with his arms.

He grabs another sandwich and dashes into the hedges as an armored scooter rides up. Workers jump off the deck and dash after Aaron, who's leaping across a garden.

The dim flashlight is on the terrain and highlights Claude, who hurls a rock at it, shattering the glass. Aaron is chased like a rabbit, but he and Max collect their supply of sandwiches and flee. The next afternoon at their shelter, curly-haired Claude glances across at Max with warmth in his dark brown eyes. Carla is stirring the top of a teapot with a spoon. Simon, in his cap, sweater, and leather belt, observes her happily, and others in the shelter look bright and healthy.

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
