He examines his fingertips with curiosity and concern before casting a glance up at the towering building beside him. Alone in the alley, he makes his way toward the building.

He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

          "description": "Peter experiences a series of challenges and reflections. After being slapped by Harry and watched by a flustered MJ, Peter takes photos as Spider-Man swings through the city. Struggling with his powers, he falls and attempts to climb a building, but slips and ends up in a puddle. Frustrated, he examines a newspaper headline but soon discards it. Octavius, occupied with his mechanical limbs in his lab, enjoys a cigar. Meanwhile, Peter visits a doctor to discuss his concerns. Later, he sits in his room, pondering deeply, as an old man stretches out his hand. Peter’s thoughts wander to Uncle Ben, who looks back at him with a sad expression."
