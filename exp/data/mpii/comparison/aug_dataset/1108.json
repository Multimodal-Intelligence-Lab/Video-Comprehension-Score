A pristine alabaster vista appears as high-stepping pale steeds prance out of the snow-covered woodland, pulling attractive sleighs filled with pupils well-wrapped against the chill. In the Great Hall, now adorned with towering Christmas trees, the ceiling mirrors the climate outside, and vast snowflakes hover above the heads of the students sitting at the extended, gleaming dining tables. Harry and Ron are sitting by themselves at the end of one of the tables when Hermione carries her meal down the hall and sits across from them. She holds up two pastries. Later, followed by Harry, Ron peeks around a statue in the corridor, ensures the coast is clear, and lifts his crooked wand. Harry waves his wand, and the two pastries float into the air. Harry and Ron conceal themselves as Crabbe and Goyle emerge with armfuls of pastry. They see the floating pastries, snatch them, and commence to consume them, greedily smacking their lips and stuffing the pastries into their mouths. They abruptly stop chewing as their eyes roll up, and they both collapse backward and hit the floor. Later, in the girls' washroom, Hermione fills three goblets and hands one to Harry and one to Ron. They look at their thick sludge suspiciously and put the hairs into the concoction. Ron makes a face, and clinking goblets, they all drink at once. Ron takes a gulp and heads for the nearest cubicle, followed by Hermione. Harry drops his goblet and clutches his abdomen in agony. He lurches to the marble basin and leans on it. Looking down, he sees the skin on his hands begin to swell and blister, and when Harry looks into the mirror, his visage is also erupting. As he observes, he gradually turns into podgy Goyle. He lifts his hand and touches his beefy visage with plump fingers. Pleased with the metamorphosis, Harry grins, then turns and sees Ron coming out of the cubicle, transformed into chubby-faced, squat Crabbe. They gaze at one another. In a dim corridor, Percy Weasley spots them, and Draco Malfoy stares at Harry, then glowers at Percy, giving him a withering look. In the Slytherin common room, Draco slumps onto a leather couch. Looking around nervously, Harry and Ron sit across from him. Ron clenches his fist, and Harry nudges Ron. Draco stares at Harry, then gets to his feet and looks down at him menacingly. To Harry's relief, Draco withdraws. Ron looks at Harry with surprise, picks up a small package, and shakes it. Harry shakes his head, and Draco puts the package in his pocket. Ron springs up, and Harry cautions Ron, who looks at him in dismay as Harry touches his forehead where his scar is reappearing."

These majestic creatures trot with elegance, pulling behind them handsome sleighs filled with students who are bundled up warmly against the biting cold. Inside the Great Hall, the atmosphere is transformed with the festive decoration of tall Christmas trees, and the enchanted ceiling mirrors the wintry weather outside, with huge snowflakes gently floating above the heads of the students who are seated at the long, polished dining tables.

Later, in a different part of the castle, Ron, with Harry following closely behind, cautiously peers around a statue in the corridor.

Their chewing suddenly halts as their eyes roll up, and they both collapse backward, hitting the floor with a thud. Later, in the girls' lavatory, Hermione carefully fills three glasses with a thick potion and hands one to Harry and another to Ron. They both eye the thick sludge with suspicion before dropping hairs into the potion. Ron grimaces at the sight, but they clink their glasses together in a show of solidarity and drink the potion all at once. Ron takes a swig and immediately rushes to the nearest cubicle, with Hermione following closely behind.

Tentatively, he lifts his hand and touches his newly transformed beefy face with plump fingers, feeling a sense of satisfaction with the transformation. Harry smiles at his reflection, then turns to see Ron emerging from the cubicle, now transformed into the fat-faced, dumpy Crabbe. They stare at each other in disbelief at their new appearances.

Ron clenches his fist in a moment of tension, and Harry discreetly nudges him to stay calm. Draco's eyes lock onto Harry, and he rises to his feet, looking down at him with an ominous air. To Harry's relief, Draco eventually backs off, leaving Harry to exhale quietly. Ron, surprised by the turn of events, picks up a small parcel and gives it a shake, curious about its contents. Harry shakes his head in warning, and Draco, noticing the exchange, slips the parcel into his pocket. Suddenly, Ron springs up, and Harry quickly warns him, his voice tinged with urgency.

          "description": "The petite fairy exits the cavern, and Timmy squints at her doubtingly, then waves his tail. A vivid red desert materializes as softly trotting green camels march out of the sand-filled jungle, pulling colorful wagons packed with travelers bundled against the heat. In the Enchanted Chamber, now adorned with short palm trees, the walls echo the conditions outside, and bright petals drift above the heads of the visitors lounging on the long, rustic benches. Timmy and Max are lounging together at the beginning of one of the benches when Sally hauls her feast up the chamber and lounges across from them. She waves two pies. Later, trailed by Timmy, Max peeks around a fountain in the hallway, checks the setting is secure, and raises his bent cane. Timmy sways his cane, and the two pies ascend into the breeze. Timmy and Max scurry as Ike and Mike arrive with bundles of pie. They notice the levitating pies, snatch them, and begin to consume them, eagerly smacking their tongues and devouring the pies into their throats. They abruptly pause swallowing as their noses tilt upward, and they both topple forward and strike the ground. Later, in the boys' library, Sally fills three bowls and offers one to Timmy and one to Max. They gaze at their thick gruel suspiciously and toss the feathers into the brew. Max grimaces, and clinking bowls, they all sip together. Max takes a gulp and darts for the nearest stall, trailed by Sally. Timmy drops his bowl and clutches his belly in distress. He stumbles to the wooden counter and braces against it. Looking upwards, he sees the skin on his arms start to ripple and crack, and when Timmy glances at the reflection, his profile is also altering. As he observes, he gradually becomes lanky George. He raises his elbow and pats his narrow chin with slender fingers. Content with the metamorphosis, Timmy grins, then pivots and notices Max stepping out of the stall, transformed into spiky-haired, lanky Al. They gaze at one another. In a dim hallway, Percy Weasley detects them, and Billy May glares at Timmy, then scowls at Percy, gifting him a scornful stare. In the Hufflepuff club lounge, Billy collapses onto a velvet recliner. Glancing around cautiously, Timmy and Max recline across from him. Max squeezes his elbow, and Timmy elbows Max. Billy glances at Timmy, then rises to his toes and gazes at him threateningly. To Timmy's comfort, Billy retreats. Max glances at Timmy with amazement, picks up a tiny cube, and jostles it. Timmy nods, and Billy slips the cube in his pouch. Max leaps up, and Timmy advises Max, who glances at him in disbelief as Timmy pats his chin where his whisker is reappearing."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
