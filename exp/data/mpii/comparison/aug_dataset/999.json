Cars crammed with people arrive, and Nick walks up, holding his invitation, getting caught up in the tide of people surging towards the mansion. Hundreds of people move towards a cavernous ballroom, where a spot-lit dancer twirls enormous multicolored feathers. A giant, dome-shaped crystal chandelier glitters, and standing on a raised platform is a large pipe organ. A flood-lit blue pool sits in the middle of the ballroom as Nick wanders about, smiling. A dancer hangs upside-down from the ceiling, and someone plays the massive organ. People dance everywhere, and Nick talks to a barman before downing a martini in one. He wears beige boots, white trousers and shirt, a dark-blue blazer, and a bowtie. Two flapper girls in flouncy yellow dresses do the Charleston with a man who's standing on a podium. An extremely attractive young woman glides through the proceedings, and Nick turns to Jordan, who takes off her hat. Gilda shimmies across the dance floor in a cream flapper dress with tiers of tassels. She pushes her hands out, spins and kicks, her tassels swishing and swaying as she moves frenetically. The dance floor fills, and Nick and Jordan walk upstairs. At the top of the stairs, Jordan leans sharply to Nick, then leans against doors, and Nick pushes her, and they tumble into a library. The old man comes down the library steps and hands them drinks. They look through a window down at the party, which throbs as people dance crazily. Colorful confetti floats down from the ceiling, the band wear red fezzes, and people jump into the round pool for a dip. Back amongst the throng, Nick holds his hand out to Jordan, who's dancing with Teddy Barton. Nick pulls her away from Teddy, a chiseled young man with slicked hair. Jordan flops her arms over Nick's shoulders, and they shimmy on the circular platform over the middle of the pool as glittering strings fly through the air. Teddy grabs Jordan's hand, and Jordan turns back to Nick, who looks miffed. The man turns to Nick, smiling, and Nick gawks at Gatsby, a handsome, fine-featured man with bright eyes and swept-back, wavy brown hair. Gatsby talks to Jordan, kisses her hand, and squeezes Nick's shoulder as fireworks light up the sky. Gatsby nods to them both and goes, and Jordan smiles and turns to Nick. The older, distinguished-looking man, Herzog, leaves Jordan looking bewildered. Gatsby watches from the top of the stairs for a moment, then walks away.",

Nick wakes up in his underwear, curled up on the porch swing outside his quaint Long Island cottage, as Gatsby, the enigmatic millionaire known for his lavish parties, watches from a window. Nick receives a personal invitation, a rarity in Gatsby's world of open-house extravaganzas, and cars loaded with party goers roll up to Gatsby's immense mansion, an extravagant estate designed in the style of a French château, which is lit up at night with opulent lighting, with a fountain in front. Cars crammed with people arrive, and Nick walks up, holding his invitation, getting caught up in the tide of people surging towards the mansion. Hundreds of people move towards a cavernous ballroom, where a spot-lit dancer, reminiscent of the era's jazz culture, twirls enormous multicolored feathers. A giant, dome-shaped crystal chandelier glitters, imported from Europe, and standing on a raised platform is a large pipe organ, reminiscent of the grand instruments found in old cathedrals. A flood-lit blue pool, a feature of decadence and luxury in the 1920s, sits in the middle of the ballroom as Nick wanders about, smiling. A dancer hangs upside-down from the ceiling, showcasing the daring performances of the Roaring Twenties, and someone plays the massive organ. People dance everywhere, embodying the spirit of the Jazz Age, and Nick talks to a barman before downing a martini in one, a classic cocktail of the Prohibition era. He wears beige boots, white trousers and shirt, a dark-blue blazer, and a bowtie, reflecting the dapper fashion of the time. Two flapper girls in flouncy yellow dresses, outfits emblematic of the era's rebellious spirit, do the Charleston with a man who's standing on a podium. An extremely attractive young woman glides through the proceedings, drawing attention as the epitome of 1920s glamour, and Nick turns to Jordan, a competitive golfer and socialite, who takes off her hat. Gilda shimmies across the dance floor in a cream flapper dress with tiers of tassels, embodying the carefree and spirited nature of the era. She pushes her hands out, spins and kicks, her tassels swishing and swaying as she moves frenetically. The dance floor fills, and Nick and Jordan walk upstairs. At the top of the stairs, Jordan leans sharply to Nick, then leans against doors, and Nick pushes her, and they tumble into a library, a room filled with Gatsby's carefully curated collection of books. The old man, known as Owl Eyes for his keen observation, comes down the library steps and hands them drinks, a mix of gin and vermouth popular in this time. They look through a window down at the party, which throbs as people dance crazily. Colorful confetti floats down from the ceiling, the band wear red fezzes, an ode to the exotic influences of the time, and people jump into the round pool for a dip, a testament to the carefree abandon of Gatsby's soirées. Back amongst the throng, Nick holds his hand out to Jordan, who's dancing with Teddy Barton, a local playboy and frequent party-goer. Nick pulls her away from Teddy, a chiseled young man with slicked hair, styled with the popular pomade of the day.

Gatsby talks to Jordan, kisses her hand, and squeezes Nick's shoulder as fireworks light up the sky, orchestrated to dazzle and amaze. Gatsby nods to them both and goes, and Jordan smiles and turns to Nick. The older, distinguished-looking man, Herzog, a guest at the party known for his old-money roots, leaves Jordan looking bewildered. Gatsby watches from the top of the stairs for a moment, then walks away, a fleeting figure at the center of his own grand spectacle."

Beneath the shimmering surface of an underwater kingdom a rebellious mermaid defies ancient traditions to explore forbidden coral reefs and secret caverns brimming with forgotten lore. In the quiet confines of a suburban attic an unassuming teenager stumbles upon a mysterious portal that thrusts him into a surreal world where the very fabric of time and space unravels.

Colorful confetti floats down from the ceiling. the band wear red fezzes and people jump into the round pool for a dip. Back amongst the throng Nick holds his hand out to Jordan who is dancing with Teddy Barton. Nick pulls her away from Teddy a chiseled young man with slicked hair. Jordan flops her arms over Nick's shoulders and they shimmy on the circular platform over the middle of the pool as glittering strings fly through the air. Teddy grabs Jordan's hand and Jordan turns back to Nick who looks miffed. The man turns to Nick smiling and Nick gawks at Gatsby a handsome finefeatured man with bright eyes and sweptback wavy brown hair. Gatsby talks to Jordan kisses her hand and squeezes Nick's shoulder as fireworks light up the sky. Gatsby nods to them both and goes and Jordan smiles and turns to Nick. The older distinguishedlooking man Herzog leaves Jordan looking bewildered. Gatsby watches from the top of the stairs for a moment then walks away."

          "description": "High on a zeppelin, a chef drills a wooden plank, and snowflakes flutter. Jamie dozes off in his pajamas, rolled up on the hammock inside his treehouse, as Luna stares from a balcony. Jamie receives a secretive postcard, and bicycles brimming with tourists glide up to Luna's enormous castle, which glows at dusk, with a pond in the back. Bicycles packed with animals arrive, and Jamie skips up, clutching his postcard, getting swept away by the herd of creatures flowing towards the castle. Thousands of creatures glide towards a spacious greenhouse, where a spotlighted actor twirls immense polka-dotted banners. A colossal, pyramid-shaped gold chandelier shimmers, and placed on a sunken platform is a vast accordion. A lantern-lit red lake rests in the corner of the greenhouse as Jamie meanders around, grinning. An acrobat hangs upright from the rooftop, and someone plays the gigantic accordion. Creatures prance everywhere, and Jamie chats with a bartender before sipping a lemonade in one. He wears purple slippers, green shorts, a pink jacket, and a scarf. Two clowns in striking orange costumes perform a jig with a lady who's perching on a stage. A remarkably charming older gentleman glides past the event, and Jamie turns to Riley, who removes her scarf. Fiona flutters across the stage in a lavender clown suit with layers of ribbons. She waves her arms out, twirls and jumps, her ribbons fluttering and flitting as she dances wildly. The stage floods, and Jamie and Riley march downstairs. At the bottom of the stairs, Riley tilts awkwardly to Jamie, then leans against walls, and Jamie nudges her, and they stumble into an office. The young boy comes up the office ladder and gives them cookies. They peer through a glass wall down at the festivity, which pulses as creatures prance madly. Vibrant glitter drifts down from the rafters, the performers wear blue hats, and creatures dive into the square pond for a splash. Back amid the crowd, Jamie waves his shoe at Riley, who's prancing with Max Jenkins. Jamie tugs her away from Max, a rugged older lady with braided hair. Riley drops her hat on Jamie's elbows, and they hop on the oval stage above the corner of the pond as sparkling confetti flutters through the sky. Max tugs Riley's shoe, and Riley turns back to Jamie, who looks puzzled. The lady turns to Jamie, grinning, and Jamie gapes at Luna, an elegant, fine-featured lady with shining eyes and tied-back, curly blonde hair. Luna chats with Riley, pats her hat, and clutches Jamie's elbow as lanterns illuminate the horizon. Luna nods to them both and disappears, and Riley beams and turns to Jamie. The younger, flamboyant-seeming boy, Emerson, leaves Riley appearing dizzy. Luna observes from the base of the stairs for a moment, then drifts away."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
