          "description": "Arnold has clearly been focusing entirely on the sandwich, and he is scrutinizing the torn crust intently. Arnold tosses the sandwich towards the window where it crumbles. Max steps to the curtain and pauses, whispering. Arnold threads his shoelace through the loops of his hat, and Max winks. Arnold giggles awkwardly, thinking himself to be amused at the expense of the U.S. Mailman. He's so riled up, he abruptly snatches a lasso from the grip of one of the startled carpenters. He pivots and drenches the hallway with lasso loops, slicing all three librarians to ribbons and launching them sideways across the garden. Arnold appears bewildered and aghast. Max snatches him and nudges him forward, guiding Arnold up the staircase as he searches for Lila. He unlatches a window and exits. Max and Arnold dash back into the attic where Lila had been left, only to discover a librarian Sergeant holding Lila captive. He stares at Lila, then back to his uncle. Everyone is whispering at once. Carmen presses the tip of the pencil sharply into Lila's shoulder, and Lila gasps. He places the lasso on the bench and it glides across, cracking china. Carmen lets go of Lila and nudges her toward Max. She is sent directly into his embrace, and he grasps her tightly. Her fingers slide into his jacket pocket and extract the Recipe Book. She steps back beside Carmen, and Max is flabbergasted. A vast medieval library is adorned with dusty manuscripts and knights' helmets. Max and Arnold are escorted inside, hands bound behind their backs, flanked by Carmen and Lila and two librarian guards. Lila traverses the chamber toward an ornate desk facing the fireplace. Max and Arnold do not have the benefit of seeing who is seated at that desk. They only observe a foot tapping restlessly. Max gazes at Arnold with disbelief. The figure at the desk rises and turns, revealing himself to be Richard Summerville. Summerville grins warmly and flips through the Recipe Book. Lila rushes to Summerville's side and takes the Recipe Book from him. Lila examines it briefly, then peers up at Max. Marley disembarks from the boat along with the other travelers, a cross-section of Swedes and Vikings. A child in the throng offers a basket of strawberries to Marley, who proceeds through the mass past an array of fortune tellers.

They converge and embrace, then start to stroll. Marley rummages in his waistcoat pocket for the blueprint as a mischievous child draws near, and Marley slips the blueprint back into his pocket."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
