Once the flowers are placed, Peter directs his attention to a white-haired elderly woman who is struggling to rise. He extends a helping hand, carefully assisting her to her feet, ensuring she is steady before letting go. Simultaneously, Aunt May's coat flutters dramatically in the stiff breeze, which also whirls fallen leaves around both Peter and the elderly woman. Holding her bag closely against her body and pressing one hand to keep her hat from flying off, Aunt May moves purposefully away from the grave, leaving Peter standing there with his back turned towards her retreating figure. In the next scene, Peter is seated at the dining table, lost in thought, when Aunt May walks in from the kitchen holding a teapot. She moves briskly towards the table, with a determined air, and proceeds to pour a cup of tea. She takes a seat beside Peter, who, dressed in a blue shirt with a tie and still wearing his spectacles, lowers his gaze momentarily before looking up at Aunt May as she takes a sip of her tea. He silently nods his head in acknowledgment or agreement. Aunt May, her eyes fixed intently on Peter, seems to search his face for answers, her brow furrowed in a quizzical expression. As she notices tears beginning to form in Peter's eyes, he reaches out to place his hand on hers, seeking comfort, but she, maintaining her gaze on Peter's tearful face, gently withdraws her hand. Overcome with emotion, Peter averts his eyes, and Aunt May, sensing the tension, rises to her feet. She steadies herself momentarily by leaning on the table, then decisively turns around and hurries up the stairs, leaving Peter alone at the table, pondering the unspoken feelings between them. Meanwhile, in his lab, Octavius deftly uses two of his mechanical limbs to maneuver a curved base into position within a replica fusion chamber, carefully aligning it with four rising curved pillars. He skillfully eases the final girder into place, ensuring a secure fit. Satisfied with his handiwork, Octavius steps back to admire the structure, standing within the fusion chamber that floats on the river below, his gaze shifting upwards to inspect both the structure and a limb. Suddenly, he spins around as the houseman enters, interrupting his moment of reflection, while Harry, elsewhere in his home, takes a sip of his drink. Bernard, the houseman, quietly exits as lightning illuminates the room, casting an eerie pallid glow on Harry's features. With a determined stride, Harry approaches the open French windows leading to a balcony, stepping out into the cool air with his glass in hand. He halts abruptly upon hearing a distant thud, his senses heightened, prompting him to survey the expansive, terrace-like balcony where lights on the pillars and small decorative trees remain unlit. As the balcony vibrates from the approaching thuds, Harry, his expression a mix of curiosity and concern, moves cautiously towards the balustrade. As he peers over the edge, one of Octavius's mechanical limbs suddenly rises, knocking Harry off his feet in a swift motion, sending his glass flying. A pincer from another limb deftly catches the glass mid-air, while yet another limb seizes Harry by the ankle just as Octavius allows a satisfied smile to form on his lips. The mechanical limb hauls Harry back onto the balcony, assisted by another, setting him down firmly on the ground, where he finds himself face-to-face with Octavius. As Harry looks on in shock, Octavius's four powerful limbs begin to carry him away, moving with a spider-like agility that allows him to disappear swiftly from Harry's view.

Clutching her bag, a vintage handbag she has owned since her younger years, to her and, with one hand on her hat, an old fedora that once belonged to Uncle Ben, Aunt May strides away while Peter stands with his back to the departing figure. Later, Peter is sitting at the dining table, a sturdy oak piece that has been the family's gathering place for generations, when Aunt May comes through from the kitchen holding a tea pot, a family heirloom from her grandmother. She strides up to the table, pours a cup of Earl Grey tea, sits down next to him, and as Peter, in a blue shirt, tie, and spectacles still on—the typical attire of a diligent graduate student—lowers his eyes and then looks at his aunt who sips her tea, he nods his head. She looks at him quizzically, her gaze soft yet probing, as tears well up in Peter's eyes. He stretches out his hand to place it on hers, but with her eyes fixed on Peter's face, Aunt May, whose heart is burdened with unspoken worries, removes her hand from under his. As he gazes at her through tearful eyes and looks away, Aunt May gets to her feet, leans on the table for support, with bones weary from a long life, then about turns and runs up the creaking stairs, leaving Peter sitting at the table. Meanwhile, in his lab, Octavius uses two of his mechanical limbs, equipped with advanced AI for precision, to push a curved base into a replica fusion chamber from which four curved pillars rise—an ambitious attempt to harness the power of a miniature sun—easing the final girder securely into position. He steps back standing inside the fusion chamber which floats on the East River below, looking up at the structure and the limb, and then suddenly spins around as the houseman, Bernard, enters while Harry drinks an expensive vintage scotch. Bernard turns and walks out as lightning flashes, casting Harry's features in a pallid white. Harry strides over to the open French windows which lead out onto a sprawling balcony, goes outside with his glass in hand, and stops when he hears a distant thud. He starts to look around the vast terrace-like balcony, where lights on the pillars and small trees and bushes remain dormant, giving the place an eerie stillness. The balcony judders as the thuds seem to move closer, prompting Harry, his face grim and curious, to step forward towards the ornate balustrade. As he looks over the parapet, one of the mechanical limbs rears up and throws him off his feet, causing Harry's glass to fly in the air, only for a pincer, designed for dexterity and strength, to catch it and a limb to grab Harry by the ankle as Octavius smiles with a mix of triumph and madness. The limb hauls Harry back onto the balcony, aided by another limb, and Harry is set down on the ground, staring at Octavius with a mixture of fear and defiance. Then, the four mighty limbs, masters of industrial espionage, start to move away with Octavius carried in midair and, as he turns to Harry, scuttles like a spider out of Harry's sight.

Later, Simon is reclining on the armchair when Grandma Liz comes through from the hallway holding a pitcher.

George marches over to the closed wooden doors which lead in from a balcony, goes inside with his plate in hand, and stops when he hears a nearby crash.

Meanwhile, in his workshop, Johnson uses two of his appendages to press a circular platform into a duplicate generator compartment from which four elongated rods rise, nudging the last beam securely into its slot.

Nigel pivots and strides out as the storm flickers, illuminating William's visage in a ghostly light. William marches to the ajar sliding doors which lead to a veranda, steps outside with his cup in hand, and halts when he perceives a remote boom.

The veranda shakes as the booms seem to advance nearer, prompting William, his face stern and intrigued, to inch toward the railing.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
