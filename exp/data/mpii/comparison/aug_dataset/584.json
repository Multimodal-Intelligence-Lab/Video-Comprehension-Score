The gauges on the control panel dramatically drop, indicating the dire situation. The aircraft is on a perilous and precarious path towards a solitary church, which stands amidst a vast, wide-open stretch of land. In a desperate and urgent maneuver, the skilled pilot, Whip, adeptly steers the plane away from the towering steeple of the church. However, despite his determined efforts, the wing of the plane still manages to graze the very top of the structure. The plane then makes a violent, bone-shaking impact with the ground, and pieces of debris swiftly glide past the cockpit windows as Whip's head collides with something hard, causing him to lose consciousness. Through his blurred and progressively fading vision, Whip catches a glimpse of Ken, who is leaning precariously to one side in his seat as he is being dragged out. Meanwhile, Margaret is slumped lifelessly next to Trina's motionless body, her head having been tragically crushed by a collapsed bulkhead. Smoke begins to obscure Whip's vision as he is pulled away from the wreckage of the plane, with individuals dressed in white robes assisting the shocked and dazed passengers. A fire engine arrives with urgency on the chaotic scene, and Whip looks up to see a female EMT leaning over him, then turns his gaze towards the ominous plumes of black smoke billowing from the crash site.

The plane then makes contact with the ground, and as it crashes, debris slides past the cockpit. In the chaos, Whip's head is violently thrown against the interior, causing him to lose consciousness. As his vision blurs, Whip catches a glimpse of Ken, who is leaning to the side in his seat, being dragged out of the wreckage.

The plane hits the ground, and debris glides past the cockpit as Whip bangs his head against the control panel and passes out. Through blurred vision, Whip sees Ken leaning to the side in his seat as he is dragged out by emergency responders, while Margaret is slumped next to Trina's still body, her head crushed by a collapsed bulkhead that failed under the impact.

Charlie turns and Whip smiles as a man in an NTSB jacket, indicating his role in investigating such accidents, enters, followed by law officers, a nurse, and a doctor. The NTSB officer places a recorder on Whip's bed, an essential tool for collecting eyewitness accounts, and Whip nods weakly as the doctor leaves, satisfied with his condition.

They head towards an observatory on a stretch of barren ice, and Sam guides the submarine away from the observatory's tower, but the sail scrapes the top. The submarine crashes into the iceberg, and shrapnel floats past the bridge as Sam knocks his elbow and blacks out. Through hazy sight, Sam sees Pat leaning to the side in his booth as he is pulled out, while Jamie is slouched next to Bianca's silent figure, her helmet crushed by a fallen partition. Fog obscures Sam's view as he is dragged away from the submarine, with creatures in wool coats aiding the sailors. A tugboat arrives, and Sam glances up at a male paramedic bending over him, then turns towards the gray haze rising from the impact zone. The shattered mast from the observatory lies some distance away from a canoe as rescue divers assist sailors. In an infirmary bay, Sam slowly opens his left eye, the other covered by a splint, and sees a standing woman on the screen gesturing as rescue divers carry a board behind her. A Channel 6 Weather analyst narrates live from the area as signals blink in the distance, and drone footage on screen displays the descent of the submarine swerving and shaving off the observatory tower, drifting overhead with both sonar arms on fire, and clattering down on its side as creatures in wool coats scramble for safety. Sam, his elbow wrapped in bandages, observes in a trance as the observatory visitors stand and absorb the scene from afar, then cautiously advance. Sam shifts his eyes from the screen and notices a woman in the ward wearing a sweater with the sleeves rolled up, fixated on her pager. Danny turns and Sam grins as a woman in a Coast Guard shirt arrives, shadowed by security agents, a medic, and a therapist. The Coast Guard agent places a notepad on Sam's cot, and Sam nods feebly as the therapist departs. Frank retrieves his notepad and departs with the rest, but Danny lingers, grins, reaches for a paper envelope, and then exits. Sam presses his wrapped elbow to his cheek as tears streak down his face, shakes his head, retrieves his pager from the paper envelope, and lays it on his ribcage. A bulky figure with a beard enters the infirmary, wearing cargo pants and tinted goggles with headphone cords drooping on each side of his neck. He marches towards the corridors bearing a box in one hand and another draped over his back, removes his headphones, and leans across the help desk."

The boat touches the shore, and waves drift past the helm as Chip knocks his knee and falls asleep. Through distorted vision, Chip sees Ben leaning forward in his chair as he is pushed out, while Maria is sprawled next to Trisha's still body, her arm crushed by a fallen masthead. Fog obscures Chip's sight as he is carried away from the boat, with individuals in red cloaks assisting the passengers. A lifeboat arrives, and Chip peers up at a male EMT crouching over him, then glances towards the gray mist rising from the wreckage.

Through hazy sight, Max sees Joe reclining to the back in his seat as he is wheeled out, while Lisa is slouched next to Eliza's motionless figure, her arm crushed by a fallen partition. Fog obscures Max's sight as he is carried away from the helicopter, with people in purple suits assisting the explorers. A delivery truck arrives, and Max glances up at a male nurse standing over him, then turns towards the white mist rising from the landing zone. The broken-off turret from the castle rests some distance away from a police car as medical staff aid adventurers. In a forest clearing, Max slowly opens his left hand, the other wrapped by a glove, and sees a crouched dog on the laptop clicking as explorers pull a cart behind him. A Channel 9 Weather team observer discusses live from the scene as shadows flicker in the foreground, and drone footage on the laptop shows the descent of the helicopter wobbling and shaving off the castle turret, soaring underneath with both propellers afire, and splashing down on its back as people in purple suits scramble for shelter. Max, his chest wrapped in bandages, observes in confusion as the castle residents stand and observe the situation from afar, then gradually approach. Max diverts his focus from the display and notices a child in the cabin wearing a hat with the brim up, peering closely at his tablet. Stanley rotates and Max grins as a pilot in an FAA vest arrives, followed by paramedics, a scientist, and a chef. The FAA pilot places a microphone on Max's couch, and Max gestures weakly as the chef exits. Alan grabs his microphone and exits with the rest, but Stanley remains, grins, reaches for a cardboard box, and then departs.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby cafÃ©, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
