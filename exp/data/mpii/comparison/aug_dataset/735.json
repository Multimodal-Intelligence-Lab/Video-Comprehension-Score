With curiosity and concern, Jack glances at Rose, whose eyes are wide with surprise. Cal, meanwhile, gently rubs Rose's arms in a comforting gesture before striding purposefully back toward Jack. As Rose prepares to leave with Cal, she casts a glance at Jack. With a subtle motion, Jack signals to Cal's brown-haired manservant, who approaches Jack and offers him a cigarette case. Accepting the gesture, Jack takes two cigarettes: one is placed between his lips, and the other is tucked behind his left ear for later. His attention momentarily shifts downward as he notices his unlaced boots, just as the manservant walks off. In her cabin, Rose sits pensively at a vanity table, holding a delicate silver hand mirror. She sets it down just as Cal enters, carrying a box. Inside is the sparkling heart of the ocean.

His attention momentarily shifts downward as he notices his unlaced boots, just as the manservant walks off into the distance.

She sets it down gently just as Cal enters, carrying a beautifully crafted box. Inside is the sparkling heart of the ocean.

Mesmerized by its beauty, Rose gently strokes the necklace while gazing intently at her own reflection in the vanity mirror.

Cal offers a warm smile to the blank-faced Rose, who blinks, then turns her gaze back to her reflection.

Jack takes a seat beside Rose as she curiously flips through the pages of his carefully drawn sketches.

With a smile playing at the corners of her lips, she turns to a sketch of a nude, dark-haired woman reclining with one arm stretched languidly over her head. Another drawing presents just a simple yet expressive pair of hands, capturing pure emotion. Rose looks down, her mouth open in surprise, as Jack flips to another drawing. This one features a fully clothed, middle-aged woman, shown with dignity. Smiling warmly at Jack, her expression slowly fades away as she reflects on the art. Meanwhile, in a grand and opulent dining room, Ruth sits with two other women, sipping tea thoughtfully and engaging in conversation. After nodding at Molly, she strides purposefully away, leaving the table. Nearby, the mustached Ismay is engaged in a deep conversation with the captain.

As he does so, three sailors nearby become alert, turning quickly and sprinting toward Jack with urgency in their steps. Meanwhile, Rose clutches the railing tightly with her free hand for support, while Jack lifts her onto the poop deck, wrapping his arms securely around her torso and hoisting her back over the rail with care. In the process, Jack's momentum carries him forward, causing him to fall on top of Rose as she spills onto the deck. The sailors reach them at that moment, glancing first at Jack and then at the torn fabric of Rose's dress, taking in the scene with assessing eyes. Jack pushes himself up from the deck, brushing off the encounter as he stands and slides his hands nonchalantly into his trouser pockets. Later, Rose finds herself enveloped in a warm blanket, a stark contrast to the cold metal of the handcuffs that secure Jack. He casts a glance toward Rose, whose eyes are wide with emotion, before Cal steps in, gently rubbing Rose's arms in a comforting gesture. Cal then takes confident strides back to Jack, who exchanges a lingering glance with Rose before she turns away to leave with Cal. Jack discreetly signals to Cal's brown-haired manservant, who approaches and offers a cigarette case. Jack accepts two cigarettes, placing one casually between his lips and tucking the other behind his left ear. As he looks down at his unlaced boots, Jack watches quietly as the manservant walks away. In the privacy of her berth, Rose sits at her vanity table, holding her silver hand mirror and examining her reflection. She carefully sets down the mirror as Cal enters and opens a box, revealing the heart of the ocean necklace inside. Cal gently fastens the necklace around Rose's neck, the blue heart-shaped diamond resting prominently against her skin. Rose's fingers stroke the necklace as she gazes at her reflection in the vanity mirror, lost in thought. Cal kneels beside her, looking up at her expectantly. Rose stares at him with a blank expression, prompting Cal to smile encouragingly at her. She blinks, then turns back to her reflection, her hand instinctively covering the diamond. In the bright daylight on the upper deck, Jack and Rose walk alongside one another. Rose extends her hand, displaying her engagement ring to Jack. With a firm grip, she shakes Jack's hand up and down before releasing it and walking away, her eyes remaining fixed on him, her mouth slightly open in an unspoken question. She quickly snatches Jack's sketchbook, her curiosity piqued. Jack sits beside her, watching as she flips through the pages, each drawing revealing a new story. She pauses at a sketch of a woman breastfeeding an infant, studies it, then turns to a drawing of a nude woman reclining on her side with a cigarette provocatively in her mouth. Another sketch captures a nude woman posed against a ballet bar, her form elegantly depicted. As another passenger strolls past them, Rose instinctively closes the sketchbook, but a smile tugs at her lips. She reopens it to find a drawing of a nude dark-haired woman lying with one arm stretched above her head, and another sketch focuses solely on a pair of hands. Rose leans in closer, her mouth open in awe as Jack flips to another drawing, this time of a fully-clothed middle-aged woman. Her eyes meet Jack's, and a smile spreads across her face, though it fades quickly into a more serious contemplation. In a nearby dining room, Ruth sips tea with two other women, nodding politely at Molly before striding purposefully away. At another table, Ismay, with his distinguished mustache, sits engaged in conversation with the captain. Meanwhile, Jack reaches for Rose's hand, and together they move to a different section of the railing. With a casual flick, Jack spits over the side, marking the end of their shared moment."

          "description": "He pulls Rose up on the Titanic's famous deck, known for its grandeur and opulence. Three nearby sailors, trained rigorously for such emergencies on this maiden voyage of the largest ship afloat, turn and run toward Jack. Rose grips the railing with her free hand, the metal cold as it had been cast in the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast, as Jack holds her up and onto the poop deck, a term used for the elevated stern section of a ship, as Jack wraps his arms around Rose's torso and lifts her back over the rail. Jack falls on top of Rose as she is spilled onto the deck. The sailors, part of a crew responsible for the safety of over two thousand passengers, run up to them. One sailor glances at Jack and then at Rose's torn dress, a delicate piece made in the fashion of 1912. Jack stands and places his hands into his trouser pockets, a gesture betraying his lower-class attire in contrast to the opulent surroundings. Later, Rose is wrapped in a blanket like those provided to first-class passengers, as men handcuffed Jack, suspecting him of theft or misconduct. Jack glances at wide-eyed Rose, who is caught between social expectations and personal feelings. Cal, her wealthy fiancÃ© from one of Pittsburgh's steel dynasties, rubs Rose's arms, trying to assert his protective role. Cal strides back to Jack, exuding an air of entitlement common among the well-to-do aboard. Rose glances at Jack before leaving with Cal, torn by her growing feelings for the free-spirited artist. Jack motions over Cal's brown-haired manservant, whose loyalty is dictated by the rigid class structures of the time. He steps up to Jack and holds out a cigarette case, crafted from silver by a renowned London silversmith. Jack takes two cigarettes, placing one in his mouth and the other behind his left ear, a classic move of carefree individuals. Jack looks down at his unlaced boots, symbolic of his outsider status among the shipâ€™s elite. Jack looks down as the man walks off, maintaining the manservant's discreet presence. In her luxurious first-class berth, decorated with stained glass lamps and velvet furnishings, Rose sits at a vanity table and holds her silver hand mirror, reflecting her inner conflict. She sets down the mirror as Cal opens the door, his entrance an intrusion on her solitude. Cal opens a box containing the heart of the ocean, a fictional but priceless necklace evoking the Hope Diamond in its grandeur. He fastens the necklace with a blue heart-shaped diamond on Rose, a symbol of his wealth and control. Rose strokes the necklace as she gazes at her own reflection on the vanity mirror, contemplating her future. Cal kneels beside Rose, hoping the grand gesture will bind her to him. She stares at him, her emotions hidden. Cal smiles at the blank-faced Rose who blinks then turns and stares at her reflection, trapped in a role she did not choose. She places her right hand over the diamond, feeling the weight of her choices. Daytime, Jack and Rose walk along in the upper deck, where first-class passengers stroll and socialize. Rose holds out her engagement ring, a sparkling testament to her engagement with Cal. Rose shakes Jack's hand up and down, a gesture of newfound trust. She releases his hand and walks away, her heart torn. She stares at him with her mouth open, recognizing the freedom he represents. She snatches Jack's sketchbook, curious about the world he captures through art. Jack sits beside Rose as she flips through his drawings, each telling a unique story. She studies a sketch of a woman breastfeeding an infant, a tender moment of motherhood. She turns to a drawing of a nude woman lying on her side with a cigarette in her mouth, reflecting Jack's bohemian lifestyle. Another sketch depicts a nude woman standing against a ballet bar, showcasing grace and strength. Rose closes the sketchbook as another passenger walks past, aware of the social norms dictating her actions. Smiling, Rose turns to his sketch of a nude dark-haired woman lying with one arm stretched over her head, seeing beauty in every form. Another drawing of just a pair of hands, capturing the simplicity and complexity of human connection. Rose looks down open-mouthed as Jack flips to another drawing, each page an insight into his world. A fully-clothed middle-aged woman, a contrast to the previous sketches, highlighting everyday beauty. Rose smiles at Jack, understanding his vision. Her smile fades, reflecting her internal struggle. In a dining room, opulently set with fine china and crystal chandeliers, Ruth sips tea with two other women, a ritual of elite social life. Ruth nods at Molly, a spirited American millionairess known for her independent ways, then strides off, maintaining her social stature. Nearby mustached Ismay, a key figure in the White Star Line, sits with the captain, discussing the ship's progress. Jack takes Rose's hand, symbolizing his defiance against the world separating them. He pulled her to a different section of the railing, seeking privacy on the vast ship. Jack spits, a rebellious act against the constraints of societal expectations."

Daisy clutches the lamppost with her baggy hand as Max pushes her up and onto the caboose as Max wraps his legs around Daisy's waist and hoists her back over the gate. Max tumbles on top of Daisy as she is tumbled onto the floor. The plumbers dash up to them. One plumber peeks at Max and then at Daisy's ripped skirt. Max leaps and places his fingers into his coat pockets. Later, Daisy is draped in a towel as farmers shackled Max. Max peeks at astonished Daisy. Sam pets Daisy's shoulders. Sam strides back to Max. Daisy peeks at Max before departing with Sam. Max signals over Sam's curly-haired assistant. He steps up to Max and offers a book. Max takes two bookmarks, placing one in his notebook and the other behind his right ear. Max gazes down at his untied shoes. Max gazes down as the assistant strolls away. In her cabin, Daisy rests at a kitchen counter and grasps her golden spoon. She places down the spoon as Sam opens the cupboard. Sam opens a jar containing the key to the attic. He secures the bracelet with a blue heart-shaped emblem on Daisy. Daisy caresses the bracelet as she stares at her own reflection on the kitchen window. Sam crouches beside Daisy. She glances at him. Sam grins at the emotionless Daisy who blinks then turns and gazes at her reflection. She places her right finger over the emblem. Daytime, Max and Daisy stroll along in the main hallway. Daisy extends her friendship bracelet. Daisy shakes Max's foot up and down. She releases his foot and strolls away. She glances at him with her nose flared. She snatches Max's textbook. Max sits beside Daisy as she flips through his doodles. She examines a drawing of a farmer feeding a calf. She flips to a doodle of a clothed woman lying on her back with a pen in her mouth. Another doodle features a clothed woman standing against a lamppost. Daisy closes the textbook as another pedestrian walks past. Grinning, Daisy turns to his doodle of a clothed red-haired woman lying with one arm extended over her head. Another doodle of just a pair of feet. Daisy gazes down surprised as Max flips to another doodle. A fully-dressed elderly man. Daisy grins at Max. Her grin fades. In a living room, Claire sips water with two other men. Claire winks at Sarah then ambles off. Nearby bearded Harold chats with the bartender. Max takes Daisy's foot. He pulled her to a different area of the garden. Max whistles."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby cafÃ©, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Nearby sailors notice Rose's torn dress and confront Jack, who is later handcuffed, while Cal comforts Rose. In her room, Rose receives a necklace with a blue heart-shaped diamond from Cal, who tries to charm her, but she remains detached. Later, Jack and Rose walk together, and she examines Jack's sketchbook, intrigued by his drawings. They share a moment before being interrupted by another passenger. In the dining room, Jack takes Rose to a different section of the ship, where he spits over the railing, symbolizing their growing bond."
