From the phone booth, Reggie peeks cautiously over the bottom of the window and sees, through the glass, Adam leaving the Sortie area. Carefully, Reggie opens the door and comes out, goes to the corner, and looks around it as Adam walks away from the camera down the platform. The camera pans to Reggie, peeking around the corner. She looks back once more at Adam, makes up her mind, and starts running towards the exit as the bell rings announcing the next train. Adam turns to look and sees Reggie, and this news hits her hard, causing her to stop in alarm. Reggie stands out in the open with the stamps in her hand, confused as to which man she should go to, looking at one, then the other, not knowing what to do, and stops in alarm. During the following, Adam looks around, seeking a way out, and moves out from behind the columns, creeping cautiously across the open space between the two colonnades and finally behind the second. As he aims carefully and fires, the bullet creases, and the deflected bullet rips the shoulder of his coat, leaving him unharmed. He wheels around with Carson in the background, who fires at him. Quickly, Adam peers back out and throws another shot. Seeing Carson otherwise occupied, Reggie turns and runs toward the open stage door of the Comédie Française behind her, including Carson, who, seeing Reggie running to the door, turns and fires at her, but he is too late as she is safely inside. Carson looks quickly back toward Adam, then takes off after Reggie. He runs to the door, tries it, and enters. As Carson enters the auditorium, he looks around while the camera sweeps the magnificent old theatre—boxes, seats, stage—but there is no sign of Reggie. Carson walks up the aisle checking between the rows of seats. Meanwhile, Adam appears in a large room lit by a single bare bulb under the stage, moving cautiously with his gun ready. He creeps along next to the wall, looking around at all the various scenic pieces filling the room. As Carson moves carefully across the darkened stage near the footlights, looking for Reggie, the camera pans down to his feet, only a few inches from the prompter's box. Inside, huddling down, is a terrified Reggie, holding her breath as she watches him. Carson moves into the opposite wings, sees the light board, and throws on all the switches, bathing the stage in light, then returns to the stage.",

From the telephone booth, Reggie glances cautiously over the bottom of the pane and observes, through the glass, Adam departing the Sortie zone. Carefully, Reggie unseals the portal and emerges, proceeds to the junction, and peers around it as Adam strides away from the camera down the platform. The camera pans to Reggie, peering around the corner. She glances back once more at Adam, decides, and begins sprinting towards the exit as the bell tolls announcing the next train. Adam turns to look and perceives Reggie, and this revelation impacts her profoundly, causing her to halt in shock. Reggie stands exposed with the stamps in her hand, bewildered as to which man she should approach, gazing at one, then the other, uncertain what to do, and halts in shock. During the subsequent events, Adam glances around, searching for a way out, and maneuvers out from behind the pillars, creeping cautiously across the open area between the two colonnades and finally behind the second. As he aims carefully and fires, the projectile grazes, and the deflected bullet tears the shoulder of his coat, leaving him unscathed. He wheels around with Carson in the background, who fires at him. Swiftly, Adam peers back out and discharges another shot. Seeing Carson otherwise engaged, Reggie turns and dashes toward the open stage door of the Comédie Française behind her, including Carson, who, seeing Reggie dashing to the door, turns and fires at her, but he is too late as she is securely inside. Carson glances quickly back toward Adam, then takes off after Reggie. He runs to the door, attempts it, and enters.

Deciding it’s safe, Reggie gently opens the door of the phone booth, carefully steps out, and proceeds to the corner where she hopes to stay hidden. She peeks around the corner, her eyes following Adam as he walks away down the platform, distancing himself from the camera's view. The camera captures Reggie’s cautious movements as she peers around the corner, contemplating her next move. With one final glance at Adam, she makes a decisive choice and begins to sprint towards the exit, urged on by the sound of a bell ringing to announce the arrival of the next train. Suddenly, Adam senses movement and turns to look, his eyes meeting Reggie’s. This unexpected moment leaves Reggie stunned, causing her to halt abruptly, standing exposed with stamps clutched in her hand, torn between two directions and unsure whom to trust. Her indecision is palpable as she glances between Adam and another figure, paralyzed with uncertainty. Meanwhile, Adam’s mind races as he looks for an escape route, maneuvering from behind a column and cautiously crossing the open space between two colonnades, seeking cover. Once concealed behind the second colonnade, he takes careful aim and fires, but the bullet merely grazes his coat, leaving him unharmed. Swiftly, he pivots to face Carson, who appears in the background and takes a shot at him. Adam remains composed, quickly looking back out and returning fire with determination. Observing Carson occupied with Adam, Reggie seizes the opportunity to pivot and dash toward the open stage door of the Comédie Française. Carson, noticing Reggie's retreat, hastily aims and fires, but she reaches the door just in time to slip inside safely. Carson, realizing she’s escaped, hastily shifts his focus back to Adam before dashing after Reggie. Reaching the door, he attempts to open it and succeeds in entering. Stepping into the auditorium, Carson scans the magnificent setting—the grand boxes, the array of seats, the stage itself—yet Reggie remains elusive. Determined, Carson methodically walks up the aisle, peering between rows for any sign of her. Meanwhile, Adam has reached a large room under the stage, dimly lit by a single bare bulb. Moving cautiously, his gun at the ready, he stays close to the wall while his eyes sweep over the various scenic elements cluttering the room. Back upstairs, Carson makes his way carefully across the darkened stage, his footsteps nearing the footlights. Unbeknownst to him, Reggie remains hidden just inches away inside the prompter's box, desperately trying to remain silent and unnoticed as she watches him. Carson, still searching, ventures into the opposite wings and, spotting the light board, flips all the switches, instantly flooding the stage with light. Satisfied, he steps back onto the stage, resuming his search with renewed determination."

He creeps along next to the wall looking around at all the various scenic pieces filling the room. As Carson moves carefully across the darkened stage near the footlights looking for Reggie the camera pans down to his feet only a few inches from the prompter's box. Inside huddling down is a terrified Reggie holding her breath as she watches him. Carson moves into the opposite wings sees the light board and throws on all the switches bathing the stage in light then returns to the stage."

          "description": "Charlie lounges on the carpet of the gazebo, texting, while a cyclist whispers into a walkie-talkie. From the treehouse, Charlie glances cautiously over the lower part of the curtain and observes, through the blinds, Jamie entering the Exit zone. Nervously, Charlie closes the curtain and steps out, strolls to the hedge, and peers around it as Jamie dances away from the mirror down the driveway. The mirror tilts to Charlie, sneaking around the hedge. He glances back once more at Jamie, decides swiftly, and begins hopping toward the entrance as the horn blares announcing the next bus. Jamie spins to glance and notices Charlie, and this surprise shakes him deeply, causing him to pause in confusion. Charlie stands exposed with the coins in his fist, befuddled as to which dog he should approach, staring at one, then the other, uncertain what to choose, and halts in distress. During the following, Jamie glances around, seeking an escape, and slips out from behind the lampposts, sneaking silently across the open distance between the two gateways and finally behind the second. As he aims steadily and tosses, the pebble skims, and the deflected pebble scrapes the wrist of his glove, leaving him untouched. He twirls around with Jordan in the backdrop, who throws at him. Hastily, Jamie peers back out and hurls another pebble. Watching Jordan otherwise engaged, Charlie pivots and darts toward the open barn door of the Palais Royale behind him, including Jordan, who, observing Charlie dashing to the entrance, spins and throws at him, but he is too slow as Charlie slips inside securely. Jordan glances swiftly back toward Jamie, then dashes after Charlie. He sprints to the entrance, taps it, and enters. As Jordan steps into the cinema, he peers around while the mirror glides over the splendid old gallery—balconies, pews, platform—but there is no trace of Charlie. Jordan strides up the aisle checking between the rows of pews. Meanwhile, Jamie materializes in a vast hall illuminated by a single dangling lantern beneath the platform, maneuvering stealthily with his slingshot at the ready. He sneaks alongside the partition, scanning the assorted props cluttering the hall. As Jordan treads carefully across the shadowed platform near the footlamps, searching for Charlie, the mirror shifts down to his boots, merely inches from the prompter's crate. Inside, crouching low, is a petrified Charlie, holding his breath as he observes him. Jordan advances into the opposing outskirts, notices the switchboard, and flips all the levers, flooding the platform with brightness, then returns to the platform."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

When Adam notices her, she freezes, confused about whom to pursue. As Adam and Carson engage in a brief shootout, Reggie seizes the chance to escape into the Comédie Française stage door. Carson follows her inside but can't find her in the empty theater. Meanwhile, Adam navigates a dimly lit room beneath the stage, gun ready. Carson searches the stage, and as he nears the prompter's box, Reggie hides inside, terrified. Carson turns on the stage lights but is unable to locate her."
