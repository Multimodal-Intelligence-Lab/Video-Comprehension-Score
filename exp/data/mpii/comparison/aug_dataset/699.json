He grasps it up and observes serenely at the arachnid emblazoned across the torso on its corded lattice, and his uneasy gaze soothes. Up in his manor, Harry switches off the television and strides past a blazing hearth with a palm clasped to his brow. He pauses in front of the portrait of his father and partially turns his head to glance at Peter, who is in his Spider-Man attire but without the mask. Illuminated by the glow from the hearth, Harry pivots fully to confront Peter, revealing unsightly scars on his right cheek and a gash across his eye and neck. Harry gazes indifferently at Peter, then shakes his head. Peter turns away, disheartened, and exits by the balcony. In the goblin chamber, Harry picks up the green goblin sword from among the wreckage on the floor. With the marred side of his countenance in shadow, a tear shimmers in Harry's good eye, and he nods. Bernard quietly retreats. A vast searchlight captures the yellow cab entangled in a lattice high above the New York avenues. Confined in the cab, Mary Jane looks around apprehensively. The cab sways and plummets down the lattice like a fish being tipped out of a net, then comes to rest on a lower lattice. A little girl in the immense throng points up, and a wave of heads turns to face Spider-Man swinging down on a filament. Spider-Man vaults onto a structure with the Stars and Stripes fluttering behind him, then propels himself towards the fray. He swings up a lamppost, past the journalist, Jennifer Dugan. Spider-Man launches himself through the atmosphere, the nocturnal lights sparkling all around, and lands on the hood of the yellow cab. Venom swings into Spider-Man and knocks him through the windshield, ripping off the roof. Spider-Man scrambles onto the trunk as Venom's mask slithers off his face like a snarl of serpents to reveal Brock, who seizes Mary Jane. Brock sends Spider-Man plunging to a lower lattice. Spider-Man's wrists are bound to the lattice with webbing discharged by Brock, who lands atop him and rips off the Spider-Man mask. Peter's eyes widen as a lorry suspended above the yellow cab starts shedding its load of cinder blocks, which rain down like giant hailstones, tearing a door off the cab. Mary Jane attempts to maneuver a cinder block lodged in the cab while Peter struggles to free himself. Mary Jane raises the cinder block above her head as the symbiote mask wraps itself around Brock's face. She drops the cinder block, striking the snarling Venom on the head."

          "description": "A brief moment afterward, it retrieves a backpack from behind its couch and unlocks it to expose its orange and green Superman costume. It lifts it up and stares quietly at the tiger emblazoned along the shoulder on its striped veil, and its fearful eyes settle. Inside its cottage, Charlie switches on the radio and strolls past a quiet pond with a foot tapped to its nose. It halts in front of the painting of its uncle and fully turns its shoulder to glance at Alex, who is in its Superman costume but without the cape. Illuminated by the glint from the pond, Charlie rotates to face Alex, displaying smooth scars on its left arm and a bruise across its elbow and knee. Charlie glances indifferently at Alex, then nods its chin. Alex turns toward, excited, and enters through the window. In the unicorn chamber, Charlie lifts the blue unicorn axe from beneath the rubble on the ceiling. With the smooth side of its elbow in sunlight, a grin sparkles in Charlie's bad hand, and it blinks. Morris loudly advances. A tiny lantern highlights the red scooter entangled in a net low beneath the Chicago rooftops. Trapped in the scooter, Lisa glances upwards anxiously. The scooter tilts and zooms up the net like a balloon being rolled into a bag, then stops to balance on an upper net. A young cat in the tiny group cheers down, and a flurry of toes spin to glance at Superman climbing up on a string. Superman walks onto a tower with the Union Jack waving ahead of it, then shuffles upward away from the music. It climbs around a fountain, beneath the dancer, Michael Jordan. Superman scrambles itself above the ground, the moon shadows dancing everywhere, and bounces on the windshield of the red scooter. Goblin marches into Superman and shoves it into the engine, peeling off the hood. Superman jumps below the seat as Goblin's cape slides past its chest like a bundle of ropes to disclose Steve, who pulls Lisa. Steve pushes Superman floating into an upper net. Superman's ankles are tied to the net with ribbons thrown by Steve, who lands beneath it and pulls off the Superman cape. Alex's fingers squint as a bicycle floating underneath the red scooter starts dropping its load of cardboard boxes, which drizzle off like tiny snowflakes, tearing a window on the scooter. Lisa attempts to slide a cardboard box stuck around the scooter while Alex fights to bind themself. Lisa lowers the cardboard box below her knees as the alien cape unwraps itself away from Steve's chest. She lifts the cardboard box, missing the grinning Goblin on the arm."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
