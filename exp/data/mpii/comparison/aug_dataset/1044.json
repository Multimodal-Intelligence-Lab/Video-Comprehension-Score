He takes a deliberate moment to thoroughly inspect the magazine, ensuring it's in proper condition before decisively cocking the gun with a sense of determination. His arms, face, and hair are drenched with sweat, glistening under the light, as he steps out from behind the protective cover of a sturdy pillar. He casts a sharp, intense glare along the road, scanning his surroundings. Suddenly, the narrative shifts in time, rewinding to the critical moment when Enrique initially cocks the gun. In quick succession, he is struck by the first car, witnesses Veronica lying inside the ambulance, sees Holden aiming his gun directly at him, experiences the shock of the explosion, and is tackled by Barnes along with the man who accompanied Veronica. All of this transpires as the clock ticks steadily toward twelve noon.\n\nIn the enclosed, bustling space of Plaza Mayor, a seething, restless crowd has gathered. Their eyes are collectively fixed on a helicopter that hovers ominously overhead. Among the throng, a man wearing a checked shirt, who is identified by the name Howard Lewis, is busy with his camera, diligently recording the scene. He captures footage of the intricate upper windows and one of the many arches within the plaza. Meanwhile, children enthusiastically shout greetings from some of the ornate balconies. Howard, seeking a better angle, moves away from the animated children and continues his video recording endeavors. The timer on his cameraâ€™s LCD screen indicates nearly two hours and two minutes have elapsed as he strolls deeper into the heart of the crowd, maintaining his camera's focus high above their heads. He pans his camera carefully around, and on the LCD screen, he notices Veronica standing by the pillar with the young man Enrique had observed her with earlier. He zooms in meticulously as she discreetly places something in the young man's hand and grasps his palm gently, then lowers his gaze, ceasing to film as their heads draw closer together in a subtle, intimate moment.\n\nHoward persistently continues to film until a short man approaches him unexpectedly, and a little girl accidentally bumps into him, her ice cream causing a slight mess. Sam departs hurriedly, and the little girl begins to sob softly. Howard bends down compassionately to ask for her name, but the girl, named Anna, is quickly pulled away by her mother, who glances back fleetingly as they make their way out. Alerted by the resonant sound of applause echoing around him, Howard swiftly switches back into record mode as President Ashton steps up onto the podium and graciously shakes hands with the Mayor.

Howard, maintaining his composure, keeps the tape rolling as Holden and Matthews swiftly rush to assist the President, and the crowd begins to peel back from the podium in a state of shock and disbelief.

His arms, face, and hair are wet with sweat as he steps out from behind a pillar, part of the architectural design common in many historic city centers, and looks along the road, glaring. Suddenly, the story rewinds to Enrique cocking the gun, being hit by the first car in a sequence of chaotic events, seeing Veronica in the ambulance, a vehicle essential for emergency medical transport, Holden aiming his gun at him, the explosion, a calamitous event that often indicates sabotage or conflict, being tackled by Barnes, a seasoned law enforcement officer, and the man Veronica was with, and the clock reaches twelve noon, a time often associated with pivotal moments in narratives. In the enclosed Plaza Mayor, a historic and cultural square often at the heart of Spanish cities, a seething crowd watches a helicopter overhead, an aerial vehicle often used for surveillance or news coverage. The man in the checked shirt, Howard Lewis, is videoing, using a handheld camcorder, a popular device for capturing personal footage before smartphones became prevalent. He records the upper windows and one of the many arches in the plaza, each an example of the classical architecture that draws tourists, while kids shout hello from some of the balconies, a common scene in lively public spaces. Howard walks away from the kids and resumes videoing. The timer on his LCD screen reads nearly two hours and two minutes as he strolls deeper into the crowd, his camera focused above their heads, capturing the atmosphere from an elevated angle. He pans his camera around, and on the LCD screen he sees Veronica by the pillar, engaged with the young man Enrique saw her with, possibly indicating a conspiracy or personal connection. He zooms in as she places something in his hand, a furtive exchange suggesting secrecy, and clutches his palm, then lowers his gaze and stops filming as their heads move closer, an intimate gesture in the midst of chaos. Howard films some more until a short man approaches him, and a little girl bumps him with her ice cream, a mundane incident amid tense proceedings. Sam leaves, and the little girl sobs, a reaction typical of surprised children. Howard bends down and asks her name, but Anna is dragged off by her mother, glancing back, a protective instinct in the face of unfamiliar faces. Alerted by applause, a sign of appreciation or protocol, Howard goes into record mode as President Ashton, the nation's leader, steps up onto the podium and shakes the Mayor's hand, a formal greeting often signaling cooperation or celebration. Howard moves forward as the Mayor walks to the lectern, his eyes fixed on the LCD screen, grinning, an expression that may indicate satisfaction or intrigue. Howard's camera pans to take in Barnes looking upward and speaking into his cuff mic, a discreet communication tool used by security personnel. Howard wheels around and focuses on the moving curtain, looks up from the screen, and sees a shadow behind the curtain, a foreboding sign often depicted in suspense narratives, keeping his camera focused on the shadowy figure. He then turns as the President is shot, a pivotal and tragic event that propels the narrative into crisis. Howard keeps the tape running as Holden and Matthews, both likely part of the President's security detail, race to the President, and the crowds peel back from the podium, a natural reaction to danger. Howard spins back to the now open window, then to the podium as Enrique leaps onto it, an audacious move suggesting desperation or heroism. The video captures Barnes tackling Enrique, a decisive action taken by law enforcement to neutralize threats, and despite the chaos around them, Howard continues to videotape the events in front of him. Howard tapes Veronica tossing her bag under the podium and fleeing, an act indicating guilt or a need to escape, while the crowds grow more restless upon hearing the distant explosion, a sound that escalates the tension and fear. Anna has lost hold of her mother's hand, a common occurrence in panic situations, and panicking people flee and stand on those who have stumbled, a grim reality in crowded emergencies. Howard uses his cell phone, likely to report the incident or seek help amid the unfolding crisis."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby cafÃ©, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
