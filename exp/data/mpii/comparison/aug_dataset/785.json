Tess looks worried as Jane strides off, then turns and grins at her, but her face freezes as Jane looks her in the eye and picks up a folder from the table behind her, while Casey looks bored. Tess smiles at George, and cute baby pictures of the couple fill the screen, showing young George petting a goat, Tess dangling a cat by its hind legs, George in academic robes, cheerleader Tess flirting with footballers, George helping at a soup kitchen, bikini-wearing Tess getting soaked at a car wash, him at the United Nations, her in Europe with two guys, and George helping with an animal charity. Tess tucks into a helping of ribs, and George looks unhappy as slides show him with his proud parents, then Tess in a fight, grimacing at a baby, and being afraid of George's dog. Behind the now not-so-happy couple, Casey gets to her feet, and Jane looks miserable. Tess runs up, and Jane opens her mouth, but no sound comes out. She stands awkwardly, biting her lip, her eyes brimming with tears, as Casey feels her friend's pain while Jane hurries out of the restaurant.

Jane is at her father's store, where Tess freezes upon noticing her. Jane can't meet Tess's furious gaze and is baffled, sitting with her shoulders hunched on the store counter, staring dejectedly at the floor.

Having consumed Casey's beverage, Jane moves toward Tess and George, glancing defiantly at Tess and cramming an entire sausage pastry into her mouth at once. Tess appears anxious as Jane marches away, then turns and beams at her, but her expression freezes as Jane gazes her in the eye and retrieves a folder from the table behind her, while Casey seems uninterested. Tess beams at George, and adorable infant images of the pair fill the screen, showing young George stroking a goat, Tess dangling a feline by its hind legs, George in scholarly attire, cheerleader Tess flirting with athletes, George assisting at a soup kitchen, swimsuit-clad Tess getting drenched at a car wash, him at the United Nations, her in Europe with two men, and George aiding with an animal charity. Tess digs into a portion of ribs, and George appears dissatisfied as slides show him with his proud parents, then Tess in a scuffle, grimacing at an infant, and being terrified of George's dog. Behind the now not-so-cheerful pair, Casey rises to her feet, and Jane appears desolate. Tess dashes up, and Jane opens her mouth, but no sound emerges. She stands awkwardly, biting her lip, her eyes filled with tears, as Casey empathizes with her friend's anguish while Jane rushes out of the restaurant. Kevin, lurking in the background, follows her out, and she gazes at him with wide, tearful eyes. He waits for a response, turns to walk away, then halts and returns again. He presents a smartphone with a ribbon on it, places it in her hand, gives her a lingering glance, then departs. Jane watches him leave with a sad half-smile, looks down at the present in her hand, and suppresses more tears. She returns to her apartment, places her bag and keys on the hall table, and idly fiddles with a bloom in one of the many vases occupying every available surface. Kevin is at his desk, staring dejectedly into space as Maureen approaches, and he gives a regretful smile and sinks back thoughtfully into his chair. Jane is at her father's shop, where Tess freezes upon noticing her. Jane can't meet Tess's angry gaze and is perplexed, sitting with her shoulders hunched on the shop counter, staring disheartenedly at the floor. Back at her apartment, she is idly brushing her teeth when she wanders out of the bathroom and catches sight of the closet full of garments. She throws open the closet, starts tossing the garments out into the hall, and soon stuffs the last garment into one of several black plastic trash bags."

          "description": "Sandra is approached by a casually clothed young man, leaving her bewildered and uncertain about what she just witnessed. Having guzzled Leo's milkshake, Sandra ambles towards Clara and Leo, glaring defiantly at Clara and gobbling a whole cinnamon bun at once. Clara appears anxious as Sandra marches away, then spins and smirks at her, but her expression stiffens as Sandra meets her gaze and snatches a briefcase from the chair nearby, while Leo seems uninterested. Clara beams at Leo, and playful puppy drawings of the friends fill the TV, depicting young Leo feeding a rabbit, Clara dangling a parrot by its wings, Leo in graduation attire, cheerleader Clara winking at musicians, Leo volunteering at a library, swimsuit-clad Clara getting drenched at a carnival, him at a chess tournament, her in Asia with three friends, and Leo assisting at a plant nursery. Clara digs into a serving of pasta, and Leo looks displeased as images show him with his proud teachers, then Clara in a race, grimacing at a kitten, and being terrified of Leo's hamster. Behind the now less-than-content friends, Leo rises to his feet, and Sandra looks disheartened. Clara dashes over, and Sandra opens her mouth, but no word escapes. She stands clumsily, biting her cheek, her eyes shimmering with tears, as Leo senses her friend's sorrow while Sandra rushes out of the café. Ron, hiding in the backdrop, trails after her, and she glances at him with wide, tear-filled eyes. He anticipates a reaction, turns to depart, then hesitates and returns. He holds up a tablet with a bow on it, places it in her palm, gives her an extended glance, then walks away. Sandra observes him leave with a melancholy half-grin, glances down at the item in her hand, and fights back more tears. She returns to her flat, sets her wallet and sunglasses on the entry table, and absentmindedly fiddles with a sculpture in one of the numerous baskets occupying every reachable spot. Ron is at his workstation, gazing gloomily at the ceiling as Lisa approaches, and he offers a wry smile and sinks back pensively into his seat. Sandra is at her uncle's shop, where Clara freezes upon spotting her. Sandra can't face Clara's livid stare and is perplexed, sitting with her shoulders drooped on the shop register, gazing despondently at the ground. Back at her flat, she is absentmindedly combing her hair when she roams out of the bedroom and glimpses the closet full of shoes. She flings open the closet, starts tossing the shoes out into the corridor, and soon crams the last shoe into one of several blue plastic laundry bags."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
