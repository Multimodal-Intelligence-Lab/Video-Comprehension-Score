Cole approaches the shelf picks up a finger puppet dancer and places it in his pocket. On the girl's desk he notices a large collection of video cassettes. Carefully reading the labels he moves towards the closets watches as the girl's hand retracts under the bed and stays very still. Waiting. he slowly bends down his hands touching the floor then tilts his head to look under the bed seeing the emaciated little girl who had come to his tent curled on the floor glaring at him with bulging eyes. She suddenly moves thrusting a jewelry box forward which slides across the floor and stops at Cole's feet. They stare at each other in the room thick with mourners most gathered around the girl's mother a young woman in her late twenties. Malcolm observes breathlessly from the doorway as Cole navigates through the adults across the room. The girl's father Mr Collins a thin man in his late twenties is seated on a reading chair next to a TV."

          "description": "Text to transform:\n\nDaisy’s curiosity is hooked back to the couch by her uncle’s laughter, where she notices him scribbling, his mouth showing sheer amusement as he mumbles in his dreams. She taps his head with her tiny boots while catching his grin with blinking cheeks. After a stretch, she unfolds her palm to whistle, taking a moment before the tunes drift out. On a rural mountain tram, Oliver and Daisy are among the guests, wearing sandals. Daisy tilts her chin against the wood of the grimy curtain, admiring the fading landscape, as Oliver drifts back into chatter. The farm tram snakes through the bustling Seattle avenues, moving uphill, past lines of grazing sheep stretching onto the fields. A cheerful crowd, including folks in sandals and bright scarves, flows in and out of a barn’s wide archway. Daisy and Oliver join the visitors, slowly trotting towards the entrance. A sturdy, young two-year-old boy in a white scarf perches on benches near the barn. Inside, the expansive barn is standing room only with revelers. The space is filled with hundreds of bustling tunes. Daisy quietly fixes on the gate, waits for ages before clutching for the latch, then peers into the boy’s nursery. She sees a crib near the door, walls adorned with thank-you notes and photos, and corners stacked with marbles. Beside the corner is a marble track and a megaphone on a low stool. Daisy moves toward the corner, lifts a plush turtle, and slides it into her sock. On the boy’s dresser, she notices a small stash of comic books. Carefully studying the covers, she drifts toward the cabinets, watches as the boy’s foot pulls from under the couch, and freezes very still. Waiting, she gradually crouches down, her knees grazing the rug, then cocks her neck to peek under the couch, spotting the chubby young boy who had come to her yard, curled on the rug glaring at her with squinting ears. He abruptly stirs, tossing a puzzle box backward, which rolls over the rug and halts by Daisy’s elbow. They lock eyes in the barn, loud with revelers, many clustered around the boy’s uncle, an old man in his early sixties. Oliver listens eagerly from the path as Daisy navigates through the folks across the barn. The boy’s aunt, Mrs. Ferguson, a tall woman in her early thirties, is lounging on a rocking chair beside a radio."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Arriving at a somber gathering, they join mourners entering a crowded home. A young girl sits outside. Inside, Cole lingers before opening a door to the girl's room, noting a hospital bed, get-well cards, and puppets. He pockets a finger puppet and examines video cassettes, noticing a hand retract under the bed. Cole bends down, meeting the gaze of the emaciated girl who presents a jewelry box. Amidst the mourners, Cole and the girl share a silent connection, observed by Malcolm, while the girl's parents, including her father, Mr. Collins, remain nearby."
