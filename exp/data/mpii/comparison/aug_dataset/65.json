Gittes turns and strolls around the office, stopping as he spots a photo of the man with the cane, whom he had seen photos of earlier, standing high in the mountains near a pass. Gittes pulls out a cigarette case, offers the Secretary one, but she refuses. He lights up and begins to hum 'The Way You Look Tonight,' while strolling along the wall looking at more photographs, where he spots several photos of a much younger Mulwray, along with Julian Cross. Still humming, Gittes turns to the Secretary, who gets up, annoyed, and goes into Yelburton's inner office. Gittes goes back to the photographs and hears a scratching sound, apparently coming from just outside the outer door. He moves quickly to it, hesitates, and swiftly opens the door to find workmen scraping away Mulwray's name on the outer door, looking up at him in some surprise. The Secretary returns and sees the workman on the floor as Gittes heads toward the door and nods graciously, heading into Yelburton's office, where there is a subtle but perceptible difference in Yelburton's attitude.

Sophie tries to tell him something, but Gittes goes on into his office, where she looks up when he enters. Gittes moves to his desk, barely breaking stride at the sight of her, sits, and smokes. Gittes buzzes Sophie, Evelyn nods, she lights another cigarette, and signs it. Cross is visibly surprised and nods. Gittes glances down at the fish whose isinglass eye is glazed over with the heat of cooking, and he laughs and shrugs. Cross starts to reply, but there is the sound of a mariachi band as some men in formation clear a bluff about a hundred yards off, dressed like Spanish dons on horseback. Cross shakes his head, looks to Gittes in some real surprise, and then hatefully. Dark and quiet except for the whirring of fans, Gittes approaches one of the clerks at a desk, whose droopy eyes widen a little at a snotty remark. Gittes smiles, regards the clerk's back a moment, then goes to the stacks, where he sees the clerk turn to another and say something, prompting the second clerk to get on the phone.",

Evelyn remains composed as he maneuvers off into the Wilshire traffic, leaving her observing after him. Gittes proceeds through the entry to the Secretary, who glances up, identifies him again, and is not pleased to see him; she promptly rises and goes into the inner office. Gittes rotates and saunters around the office, halting as he notices a photograph of the gentleman with the cane, whom he had viewed pictures of earlier, standing elevated in the peaks near a pass. Gittes extracts a cigarette case, presents the Secretary one, but she declines. He ignites and commences to murmur 'The Way You Look Tonight,' while sauntering along the wall observing more pictures, where he notices several photographs of a much younger Mulwray, along with Julian Cross. Still murmuring, Gittes turns to the Secretary, who rises, irritated, and goes into Yelburton's inner office. Gittes returns to the pictures and detects a scratching noise, seemingly emanating from just outside the outer entryway. He moves swiftly to it, hesitates, and quickly opens the entryway to discover workers scraping away Mulwray's name on the outer entryway, glancing up at him in some astonishment. The Secretary returns and perceives the worker on the floor as Gittes heads toward the entryway and nods graciously, heading into Yelburton's office, where there is a subtle but noticeable shift in Yelburton's demeanor. Gittes nods and grins, leaving an unsmiling Yelburton, enters, and places his hat on Sophie's desk. Sophie attempts to inform him of something, but Gittes continues into his office, where she glances up when he enters. Gittes advances to his desk, scarcely breaking stride at the sight of her, sits, and smokes. Gittes buzzes Sophie, Evelyn nods, she ignites another cigarette, and signs it. Cross is evidently astonished and nods. Gittes peers down at the fish whose isinglass eye is glazed over with the heat of cooking, and he chuckles and shrugs. Cross begins to respond, but there is the sound of a mariachi ensemble as some men in formation clear a bluff about a hundred yards off, attired like Spanish dons on horseback. Cross shakes his head, looks to Gittes in some genuine astonishment, and then resentfully. Dim and quiet except for the whirring of fans, Gittes approaches one of the clerks at a desk, whose droopy eyes enlarge a little at a snotty comment.

Unshaken by the parting, Evelyn stands resolute as he merges into the bustling flow of Wilshire traffic, leaving her behind. As Gittes continues, he passes through the entrance to the Secretary, who, upon looking up and recognizing him, exhibits visible displeasure at his unexpected presence. She quickly rises, without any delay, and proceeds into the inner sanctum of the office. Meanwhile, Gittes meanders around the office space, his attention caught by a photograph of a man with a cane—a familiar face he had observed in photos earlier—who is depicted standing proudly amid the towering mountains near a scenic pass.\n\nGittes, ever the gentleman, retrieves a cigarette case from his pocket and extends an offering to the Secretary, who declines with a subtle gesture. He lights his own cigarette, and as tendrils of smoke curl upward, he begins to hum the familiar tune of 'The Way You Look Tonight.' Leisurely, he continues his exploratory stroll along the wall, his eyes catching several photographs of a youthful Mulwray alongside Julian Cross. The melody still on his lips, Gittes turns his attention to the Secretary, whose growing irritation is evident as she rises once again and disappears into Yelburton's more private office quarters. Returning his focus to the photographs, Gittes's senses are suddenly piqued by a peculiar scratching noise emanating from beyond the outer door.

Gittes, unfazed, offers a cordial smile as he regards the clerk's back momentarily before proceeding to the stacks.

          "description": "Evelyn supports herself gently on the edge of the open car door, her gaze fixed on Gittes for an extended moment as if trying to convey unspoken words or emotions through the intensity of her stare. Meanwhile, Gittes, maintaining a composed demeanor, carefully guides the car door to a soft close, ensuring not to disturb Evelyn's poise. As he drives away into the bustling flow of Wilshire traffic, the vehicle smoothly merges with other cars, leaving Evelyn standing there, her eyes following the car until it becomes just another part of the city's rhythm. Inside a building, Gittes strides through a door leading to a reception area where sitting at a desk, the Secretary looks up from her work. Recognition crosses her face, and an immediate shift in demeanor indicates her displeasure at his unexpected return. Without delay, she rises from her chair, swiftly moving through another door into the inner sanctum of the office, leaving Gittes momentarily alone in the space. Taking the opportunity to explore, Gittes meanders leisurely around the office. His movements come to a halt when his attention is drawn to a photograph featuring a man with a cane, someone familiar from photos he had seen previously, captured standing proudly in the high mountains near a distinctive pass. Gittes retrieves a cigarette case from his pocket, smoothly presenting a cigarette to the Secretary as she re-emerges but her hand declines the offer. With practiced ease, he lights his own cigarette, the flame briefly illuminating his features before an aromatic cloud envelopes him. A melodic hum escapes his lips as he begins serenading the room with 'The Way You Look Tonight,' his body moving in sync with the tune as he continues to examine the wall adorned with photographs. Among them, he discovers images depicting a much younger version of Mulwray alongside Julian Cross, a discovery that holds his attention until the Secretary, clearly perturbed by his presence and demeanor, rises once again to retreat into Yelburton's inner office. Gittes redirects his focus back to the photographs, his reflective state interrupted by an unexpected scratching noise emanating from the vicinity of the outer door. Reacting with swift curiosity, he approaches the door, his hand hesitating momentarily before he decisively swings it open. There, he confronts workmen who are in the midst of erasing Mulwray's name from the door, an alteration that leads them to glance up at him with mild surprise at the intrusion. The Secretary returns once more, catching sight of the workmen where one is sprawled, a detail that prompts Gittes to proceed toward the next office with a polite nod. As he enters Yelburton's office, a subtle yet noticeable shift in Yelburton's demeanor informs him of a change in attitude. Gittes responds with a nod and a smile that seems to linger in the air, juxtaposed against Yelburton's unsmiling countenance. Transitioning seamlessly into the next space, Gittes deposits his hat on Sophie's desk with a casual air. Sophie attempts to communicate something urgent to him, but Gittes, unfazed, continues into his office, his pace unaltered by whatever awaits him inside. Once in his office, he moves directly to his desk, his stride and purpose uninterrupted by the presence of anyone or any unexpected sight. Settling into his chair, he indulges in the soothing ritual of smoking, the tendrils of smoke curling upwards languidly. Buzzing Sophie, he receives acknowledgment from Evelyn, who quietly nods, her fingers expertly lighting another cigarette before signing something, a small act of routine yet laced with significance. Nearby, Cross's surprise is apparent, his nod acknowledging a silent understanding or realization. Gittes's eyes momentarily drift to a fish on display, its isinglass eye appearing glazed from cooking heat, prompting a wry laugh and a nonchalant shrug from him. Cross seems on the verge of a response, but the unexpected sound of a mariachi band steals the focus, as a procession of men in formation becomes visible, clearing a bluff approximately a hundred yards away. They are clad in traditional attire reminiscent of Spanish dons on horseback, their appearance both anachronistic and vibrant against the landscape. This unexpected spectacle elicits a headshake from Cross, his gaze shifting to Gittes, initially tinged with surprise which swiftly morphs into a more sinister hatefulness. In the now dim and quiet office, with only the steady whirring of fans punctuating the silence, Gittes approaches a clerk seated at a desk. The clerk's droopy eyes widen slightly in reaction to a snotty remark made by Gittes, whose face breaks into a smile, lingering a moment to observe the clerk’s back before diverting his path toward the stacks. From this vantage point, Gittes observes the clerk's interaction with another, noticing as the second clerk discreetly picks up the phone, a subtle communication passing between them that does not escape Gittes's notice."

          "description": "Bianca balances herself on the swinging gate and gazes at Linus for a brief moment before he softly pushes the gate shut. Bianca remains composed as he zooms off into the Broadway lanes, leaving her watching him depart. Linus strolls through the portal to the Assistant, who glances up, identifies him once more, and is displeased to notice him; she promptly rises and heads into the back chamber. Linus wanders and meanders around the chamber, pausing as he catches a glimpse of a portrait of the woman with the umbrella, whom he had viewed images of previously, standing tall in the valleys near a gorge. Linus extracts a candy box, offers the Assistant one, but she declines. He strikes a match and starts to whistle 'Moon River,' while sauntering alongside the wall inspecting more pictures, where he notices numerous images of a much younger Bailey, alongside Dominic Fields. Still whistling, Linus turns to the Assistant, who stands up, irritated, and proceeds into Bronson's back chamber. Linus returns to the pictures and detects a rustling noise, seemingly emanating from right outside the entryway. He dashes swiftly to it, pauses, and swiftly swings open the entrance to discover gardeners scraping away Bailey's title on the front plaque, peering at him with mild astonishment. The Assistant reappears and observes the gardener on the tiles as Linus strides toward the entrance and nods politely, entering Bronson's chamber, where there's a subtle but noticeable alteration in Bronson's demeanor. Linus nods and grins, exiting a stern Bronson, enters, and drops his scarf on Marcie's table. Marcie attempts to convey something to him, but Linus continues into his study, where she glances up upon his entrance. Linus approaches his table, hardly pausing at the sight of her, sits, and puffs. Linus dials Marcie, Bianca acknowledges, she ignites another match, and stamps it out. Fields is overtly astonished and nods. Linus peers down at the painting whose acrylic eye is dulled over with the rays of sunlight, and he chuckles and shrugs. Fields begins to comment, but there is the melody of a jazz orchestra as some women in formation clear a knoll about a hundred meters away, clad like French aviators on bicycles. Fields shakes his head, stares at Linus with genuine bewilderment, and then bitterly. Dim and still apart from the whirring of machinery, Linus approaches one of the typists at a station, whose droopy gaze brights a tad at a sarcastic jest. Linus grins, regards the typist's outline briefly, then ventures to the shelves, where he observes the typist turn to another and murmur something, prompting the second typist to pick up the receiver."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

He acknowledges the Secretary and proceeds to Yelburton's office, where Yelburton's demeanor subtly changes.
