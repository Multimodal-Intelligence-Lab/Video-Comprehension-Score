As he scans her eyes with curiosity, eager to read her reaction, she leans in and kisses him softly. In another part of the house, Lester is seated at the table, dressed in messy, unkempt clothing, consuming his meal with a voracious appetite and washing it down with beer. Carolyn watches him intently, her face set with contempt. Jane, witnessing her parents' interaction, feels a wave of apprehension. Obeying an unspoken command, she is taken aback by the sheer power of the voice.

Sometimes, it propels the object forward with a violent and relentless force, while at other times, it gently guides it to soar gracefully skyward before finally allowing it to drift softly back down to the earth below. At the same time, Jane and Ricky find themselves comfortably positioned on the bed, their attention captivated by the images flickering across the expansive screen of his large, widescreen television. Jane shifts her gaze away from the moving pictures, directing her eyes thoughtfully towards Ricky. She observes him with a contemplative expression before reaching out with tenderness to take his hand gently in hers.

She is taken aback by the sheer authoritative power of the voice, as if compelled against her will. In the heat of the moment, Lester grabs a plate heaped with asparagus and serves himself generously, but in an unexpected outburst, he hurls it against the wall, startling both Carolyn and Jane.

Carolyn’s eyes meet Jane’s, and moments later, overwhelmed by emotions, she begins to cry. Overcome with anguish, she slaps Jane hard across the face before hurriedly departing, overcome with embarrassment at her own actions. Jane, feeling the sting of the slap, directs her gaze to the mirror, gently rubbing her smarting cheek. She then moves towards the window, where she looks out and across to the room opposite, where Ricky stands at his window. Ricky raises a digital camera in his hand, capturing her image on video.

Jane shifts her attention from the screen to Ricky, studying him intently, before reaching out to take his hand in hers. Ricky meets her gaze, scanning her eyes with a curious expression, searching for a clue to her thoughts. In response, she leans in and places a gentle kiss on his lips. Meanwhile, Lester sits at the dining table, dressed in unkempt clothes, and devours his food with an insatiable appetite, washing it down with beer, as Carolyn stands nearby, watching him with disdain etched on her face. Jane observes her parents from a distance with a sense of unease. Unexpectedly, Jane finds herself compelled to comply, taken aback by the commanding presence of Lester's voice. With deliberate movements, Lester reaches for a plate filled with asparagus, serves himself a portion, and then, in a sudden outburst, launches the plate against the wall, startling both Carolyn and Jane. Despite the chaos, he resumes eating as though the incident never occurred. Jane fixes her stare on her untouched plate. Later, in the solitude of her bedroom, she hears an insistent knock at the door; she rolls her eyes in exasperation and reluctantly allows Carolyn to enter. Carolyn steps in, looks at Jane with an intensity that quickly dissolves into tears, and then, overcome by emotion, delivers a swift slap to Jane's face, only to exit the room in a state of embarrassment. Jane, left with the sting on her cheek, turns to the mirror, tenderly rubbing the affected area before moving towards the window to peer outside. Across from her, in Ricky's room, Ricky stands at his window with his digicam in hand, capturing her on video. From behind, Ricky remains focused on recording Jane as she acknowledges him with a wave. Emboldened, she begins to remove her shirt, continuing until she is left in her bra. With awkward movements, she fumbles to remove her bra entirely, as the camera zooms in, and on the television behind Ricky, Jane's reflection is visible in her window. She stands exposed, wanting to appear defiant, yet unable to hide her vulnerability. Suddenly, the Colonel storms in, his face twisted with anger. Ricky, startled, turns to face the imminent threat, and as the realization dawns, he attempts to evade his father's wrath, but the Colonel's fist connects, sending Ricky sprawling to the floor. Jane, witnessing the ordeal from her window, swiftly draws the drapes closed. Though Ricky's lip is bloodied, he defiantly holds his gaze steady on his father as the blows continue to rain down, with the Colonel relentlessly striking him while Jane, hidden from view, strains to watch from her vantage point across the way."

She clumsily takes off her bra as we zoom in, and on the TV behind him, we see Jane in her window. She stands exposed, trying to look defiant but is vulnerable in a moment that underscores the fine line between empowerment and exploitation. Suddenly, the Colonel, known for his rigid military discipline, enters, incensed. Ricky turns around, realizes the situation, and tries to dodge his father, but the Colonel, whose temper is as notorious as his martial bearing, punches Ricky, knocking him to the floor. Jane watches from her window, pulling the drapes, seeking refuge from the violence she cannot unsee. Ricky's lip bleeds, but he maintains his gaze at his father during the beating, a silent rebellion against the abuse, and the Colonel continues to hit him in the window across from her."

Clara and Max lounge on the couch viewing her small-screen monitor. Clara observes Max and then places her elbow. He examines her chin, confused about her expression, and she hugs him awkwardly. Oliver perches at the counter in formal attire, munching leisurely and sipping tea, while Monica observes him with admiration. Clara glances at her siblings, anxious. Clara hesitates, startled by her dad's authority. Oliver receives a bowl of spinach, helps himself, and then lobs it against the bookshelf, startling Monica and Clara, but keeps drinking as if everything was usual. Clara gapes at her glass. She stands by her desk, hears a bell, sighs deeply, and allows Monica in. Monica gazes at Clara, begins laughing, claps her softly, and exits cheerfully. Clara glances at the clock, pats her elbow, steps to the door, and peeks inside. Opposite Max's space, Max sits by the door with his smartphone, photographing her. Beside Max, he captures Clara, who yawns, then begins to put on her hat until she dons her scarf. She deftly wears her scarf as the camera pans out, and on the monitor beside him, we view Clara at her door. She stands concealed, trying to appear indifferent but is embarrassed. Abruptly, the Mayor arrives, amused. Max glances back, understands the moment, and attempts to greet his uncle, but the Mayor embraces Max, lifting him from the seat. Clara views from her door, closing the curtains. Max's nose twitches, but he maintains his smile at his uncle during the hug, and the Mayor continues to hold him at the door opposite her."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Meanwhile, Lester eats sloppily at the table, irritating Carolyn, and throwing asparagus in a fit, unsettling his family. Jane looks at her parents with apprehension. Later, Carolyn enters Jane's room, cries, slaps her, and leaves embarrassed. Jane rubs her cheek and sees Ricky videotaping her from his window. She waves and starts undressing to her bra, appearing defiant yet vulnerable. Suddenly, the Colonel storms in, furious. Ricky, trying to avoid him, gets punched to the floor, as Jane watches and closes her drapes. Despite bleeding, Ricky stares defiantly at his father during the continued beating."
