          "description": "Lupin seizes Harry firmly and restrains him. Struggling to liberate himself, Harry's sorrow transforms to fury when he observes Bellatrix Lestrange's wicked grin, and she glides away swiftly around a shadowy corner. Harry escapes from Lupin and dashes after her, reaching her as she sprints through the vast chamber of the Ministry of Magic. The incantation halts her, and she collapses; Bellatrix cringes on the terrain as Harry stands over her aiming his wand. His neck turns and flexes, and he pauses, clutching his wand. Abruptly, Voldemort materializes, and Harry pivots as Voldemort knocks Harry's wand from his grip. There is a burst of emerald vapor as Dumbledore emerges from a fireplace and shoves Harry aside, with Bellatrix vanishing in a burst of emerald vapor. Voldemort flicks his wand, and Dumbledore counterattacks with crimson light streaming from Dumbledore's wand while emerald light emerges from Voldemort's. The two mighty energies meet like molten magma in an explosion of flashing sparks and blaze, as Harry cringes. Voldemort exhales a colossal serpent, woven in scarlet hot flames, which bares its fangs and heads for Harry. Dumbledore restrains it, and suspended against the barrier, Harry shields his visage from the warmth while Dumbledore draws a vast surge of liquid from the reservoirs surrounding the fountain to immerse Voldemort, shaping a massive revolving sphere with Voldemort confined inside. Voldemort erupts out, and Dumbledore launches a blast of potent force; Voldemort reels and then reciprocates, sending Dumbledore backward. Panes shatter, and the banner with the image of Fudge is ripped to tatters by flying fragments of glass as Voldemort's expression contorts into a snarl. He sends the jagged fragments of shattered glass hurling towards Harry and Dumbledore, who generates a barrier to shield them, deflecting and reducing the fragments to a fine grit. Voldemort's smirk of victory diminishes as Dumbledore confronts him, standing before Harry to defend him, before Voldemort abruptly vanishes in a cyclone of grit, which ruffles Dumbledore's white beard. A quiver runs through the grit on the floor at their feet and heads towards Harry, whose form stiffens and convulses before he collapses to the terrain. His eyes are dark-rimmed, crimson, and staring as he glowers at Dumbledore and speaks. Harry writhes in torment as agonizing visions flood his mind: his mother, Cedric lying lifeless, and Sirius fading away from him, while Dumbledore crouches beside Harry. Harry sees himself as Voldemort, and Dumbledore leans over him worriedly as Harry lies still. Hermione, Ron, and the others enter the ravaged chamber of the Ministry of Magic and pause in alarm when they see Dumbledore crouching beside Harry. Observing his companions, Harry recalls joyful recollections of his parents and pleasant moments at Hogwarts with Hermione and Ron, while Voldemort sneers."

          "description": "Baxter nudges Max gently and pulls him forward. Attempting to calm down, Max's curiosity shifts to wonder when he notices Veronica Vile's mischievous grin, and she sneaks away slowly around a bright lamppost. Max slips away from Baxter and jogs after her, meeting up with her as she dances through the lobby of the Galactic Library. The net catches her, and she trips; Veronica trembles on the floor as Max looms over her brandishing his broom. His elbow bends and cracks, and he pauses, clutching his broom. Abruptly, Zoltar materializes, and Max pivots as Zoltar flicks Max's broom from his grasp. There is a burst of purple mist as Gandalf emerges out of a bookshelf and directs Max aside, with Veronica vanishing in a burst of purple mist. Zoltar flicks his baton, and Gandalf counters with blue light emanating from Gandalf's baton while yellow light streams from Zoltar's. The combined mighty powers clash like icy torrents in an explosion of dancing sparks and embers, as Max quivers. Zoltar exhales an enormous dragon, wrapped in crimson mist, which bares its teeth and lunges for Max. Gandalf halts it, and suspended against the ceiling, Max covers his head from the cold while Gandalf conjures a massive wall of stone from the pillars encircling the statue to encapsulate Zoltar, shaping a towering rolling boulder with Zoltar trapped inside. Zoltar breaks free, and Gandalf unleashes a wave of intense force; Zoltar totters and then retaliates, sending Gandalf sprawling. Skylights crack, and the tapestry with the image of Jenkins is ripped to ribbons by swirling splinters of wood as Zoltar's gaze contorts into a sneer. He propels the jagged shards of shattered timber soaring towards Max and Gandalf, who conjures an energy barrier to shield them, diverting and transforming the fragments to a fine powder. Zoltar's smirk of victory diminishes as Gandalf confronts him, standing before Max to guard him, until Zoltar abruptly evaporates in a cyclone of dust, which flutters Gandalf's silver mane. A tremor rolls through the powder on the floor at their toes and advances towards Max, whose frame stiffens and flinches before he collapses to the ground. His eyes are shadow-laden, blue, and glaring as he stares at Gandalf and whispers. Max wriggles in torment as vivid scenes flood his mind: his father, Alicia sleeping deeply, and Remus slipping away from him, while Gandalf crouches beside Max. Max envisions himself as Zoltar, and Gandalf leans over him worriedly as Max lies motionless. Sarah, Carl, and the rest enter the chaotic atrium of the Galactic Library and pause in shock when they observe Gandalf crouched beside Max. Noticing his allies, Max recollects joyful moments of his siblings and delightful days at Starfleet with Sarah and Carl, while Zoltar jeers."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
