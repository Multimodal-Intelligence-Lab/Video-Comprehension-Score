Harry reclines and gazes under the cot, observing the tome, which remains still, then snaps once more and slithers out, twisting this way and that before it glides back under the cot. Harry swiftly loosens his shoelace and suspends his shoe over the brink of the cot, dropping his shoe onto the ground, prompting the tome to race out, snapping its covers, as Harry leaps onto the tome with both feet. In the hallway, a domestic knocks at the chamber next door, and Harry descends downstairs. A ginger feline pursues a rodent down the hallway, passing a wanted poster for Sirius Black. On the Hogwarts Express, Mrs. Weasley hands Ron his rodent, and a gentleman is asleep in a compartment. Harry slides the door shut as vapor billows from the funnel while the Hogwarts Express journeys through the rain beside the margin of a vast lake. Harry gazes along the hallway, and the door slides shut as the lights go out. Ron stares out the window into the rain as the Express halts on a bridge, and one by one, the carriages go dim. The train lurches again, and the air turns so frigid that they can see their breath. Ron pulls his hand away from the window as frost spreads across the pane, and ice forms in Professor Lupin's flask of water while he remains asleep in the corner, wrapped in his cloak. The train lurches again, and Hermione shivers. Something materializes out in the hallway, gliding towards the door, something black, formless, and enigmatic. It reaches out as the door slides open, revealing a dreadful hand with long digits like twisted, dead twigs reaching into the compartment. A hooded black form looms in the doorway, as Hermione's feline spits and Ron's rodent, Scabbers, conceals under his coat. The ghastly cloaked entity floats into the compartment and faces Harry, who stares helplessly at the frightening creature that seems to draw the vigor out of him, making his body go rigid. Professor Lupin throws off his cloak and aims his wand at the menacing entity, which, in a burst of light, hurtles backwards and vanishes. Harry loses consciousness and then opens his eyes, finding himself reclining on the seat. Hermione hands him his spectacles, which he puts on, and looking bewildered, he takes a piece of chocolate from Professor Lupin. He rises, turns, and grins as Ron and Hermione stare at him. Harry looks at the rain teeming down outside the window and gazes at his own anxious face mirrored in the pane.

Under the bed, Harry lies down and peers, watching the book, which is still, then once more snaps and is slithered out, with it being turned this way and that before it is slid back under the bed. Harry’s shoelace is quickly untied and his shoe is dangled over the bed's edge, his shoe is dropped onto the floor, prompting the book to be hurtled out, snapping its covers, as the book is jumped onto by Harry with both feet. In the corridor, the room next door is knocked at by a maid, and downstairs, Harry goes. A rat is chased down the corridor by a ginger cat, passing a wanted poster for Sirius Black. On the Hogwarts Express, Ron is passed his rat by Mrs. Weasley, and in a compartment, a man sleeps. The door is slid closed by Harry as steam is billowed from the funnel while the Hogwarts Express is traveled through the rain beside the edge of a vast lake. The corridor is peered along by Harry, and the door is slid shut as the lights are gone out. Out the window into the rain, Ron stares as the Express is stopped on a viaduct, and the carriages, one by one, are darkened. Again, the train is lurched, and the air is turned so cold that their breath can be seen. Ron’s hand is pulled away from the window as the glass is spread with frost, and in Professor Lupin's bottle of water, ice forms while he stays asleep in the corner, wrapped in his cloak. Again, the train is lurched, and Hermione shivers. In the corridor, something appears, floating towards the door, something black, shapeless, and mysterious. Out, it reaches as the door is slid open, revealing a horrible hand with long fingers like crooked, dead twigs reaching into the compartment. In the doorway, a hooded black shape looms, as Hermione's cat spits and under his coat, Ron’s rat, Scabbers, is hidden. Into the compartment, the hideous cloaked figure floats and faces Harry, who helplessly stares at the terrifying creature that seems to draw the energy out of him, making his body stiff. Professor Lupin's cloak is thrown off and his wand is pointed at the threatening figure by him, which, in a flash of light, is hurtled backwards and disappears. Consciousness is lost by Harry and then his eyes are opened, finding himself lying on the seat. His glasses are handed to him by Hermione, which he puts on, and looking confused, a piece of chocolate is taken from Professor Lupin by him. Up, he gets, turns, and smiles as he is stared at by Ron and Hermione. At the rain teeming down outside the window, Harry looks and at his own worried face reflected in the glass, he stares. The students up to Hogwarts Castle, where, in the Great Hall, the welcoming feast is assembled for, are taken by horseless carriages, sitting at long tables with lighted candles hanging above their heads as the choir is listened to by them."

Harry lies down comfortably on the bed and peers underneath it, intently watching the book. The book, lying still for a moment, suddenly snaps once more and slithers out, unpredictably turning this way and that before swiftly sliding back under the bed again. Harry, thinking quickly, unties his shoelace with deft fingers and dangles his shoe provocatively over the edge of the bed, dropping it onto the floor with purpose. This prompt action causes the book to hurtle out again, snapping its covers, just as Harry leaps onto the book with both feet, trapping it effectively.

He then settles himself comfortably on the bed, lying down as he casts a focused gaze underneath, intently observing the book's movements. After lying still for a brief moment, the book suddenly snaps its covers once again and unpredictably slithers out from its hiding place, twisting this way and that, before swiftly sliding back under the bed. Reacting swiftly, Harry unties his shoelace with nimble fingers and provocatively dangles his shoe over the edge of the bed, letting it drop with deliberate purpose onto the floor. This quick action prompts the book to rush out once more, snapping its covers excitedly, just as Harry pounces onto it with both feet, effectively trapping it beneath him. Meanwhile, in the corridor outside, a conscientious maid knocks at the room next door, signaling her presence as Harry makes his way downstairs. A lively ginger cat energetically dashes down the corridor, in pursuit of a fleeing rat, racing past a wanted poster for Sirius Black that hangs ominously on the wall. On the Hogwarts Express, Mrs. Weasley, ever attentive to her children, hands Ron his rat, and in one of the train's compartments, a man remains asleep, completely undisturbed by the commotion around him. Quietly, Harry slides the compartment door closed, as dramatic steam billows from the funnel while the Hogwarts Express travels through the rain, skimming the edge of a vast and sprawling lake. As Harry peers curiously along the corridor, the door slides shut, and unexpectedly, the lights extinguish entirely. Ron stares intently out the window into the relentless downpour as the Express grinds to a halt on a viaduct, and one by one, the carriages are suddenly plunged into darkness. With another lurch, the train shudders, and the air becomes so frigid that both Harry and Ron can see their breath materializing in the icy atmosphere. Ron hastily pulls his hand away from the window as frost rapidly spreads across the pane, ice forming in Professor Lupin's bottle of water, even as the professor remains asleep in the corner, snugly wrapped in his warm cloak. The train lurches yet again, causing Hermione to shiver visibly. Out in the corridor, something strange and mysterious appears, floating eerily toward the compartment door, a dark and formless enigma. As the door slides open, it reveals a ghastly hand, with long fingers that resemble crooked, lifeless twigs, ominously reaching into the compartment. A hooded, black figure looms threateningly in the doorway, and Hermione's cat spits defensively while Ron's rat, Scabbers, quickly burrows under his coat for protection. The grotesque, cloaked figure floats menacingly into the compartment, confronting Harry, who watches helplessly as the terrifying creature seems to sap all the energy from him, leaving his body rigid and unresponsive. Professor Lupin springs into decisive action, casting off his protective cloak and pointing his wand resolutely at the threatening figure, which, with a blinding flash of light, is propelled backward and disappears without a trace. Harry loses consciousness, but when he opens his eyes once more, he finds himself lying on the seat. Hermione compassionately offers him his glasses, which he gratefully puts on, and looking somewhat bewildered, he accepts a piece of chocolate from Professor Lupin. Rising to his feet, he turns around and smiles warmly as Ron and Hermione gaze at him with concern.

He then lies down on the bed and peers underneath, observing the book as it initially lies still but suddenly snaps to life, slithering out from under the bed, twisting and turning erratically before it swiftly retreats back into its hiding place. In a bid to lure it out again, Harry quickly unties his shoelace, allowing his shoe to dangle precariously over the bed's edge before letting it fall to the floor. This action successfully entices the book to dart out, its covers snapping fiercely, prompting Harry to leap onto it with both feet. Meanwhile, in the corridor, a maid knocks at the room next door, while Harry descends the stairs. A ginger cat, in an energetic pursuit, chases a rat down the corridor, past a wanted poster for Sirius Black. Transitioning to another scene on the Hogwarts Express, Mrs. Weasley passes Ron his rat, while a man remains asleep in one of the train's compartments. Harry gently slides the compartment door closed as steam surges from the funnel, the Hogwarts Express continuing its journey through the rain beside a vast lake. As Harry peers down the corridor, the door slides shut, and the lights abruptly go out. Ron gazes out the rain-drenched window as the Express comes to a halt on a viaduct, and the carriages darken one by one. The train lurches once more, the temperature drops sharply, allowing them to see their breath mist in the chilly air. Ron hastily pulls his hand away as frost begins to crawl across the glass, while ice forms in Professor Lupin's bottle of water, though he remains asleep, cocooned in his cloak. The train lurches once again, causing Hermione to shiver. Suddenly, something appears in the corridor, floating ominously toward the door—a black, amorphous, and mysterious presence. It reaches out, and as the door smoothly slides open, it reveals a ghastly hand with long, gnarled fingers resembling twisted, dead twigs, reaching menacingly into the compartment. A hooded, black figure looms in the doorway, causing Hermione's cat to hiss and Ron's rat, Scabbers, to scurry under his coat. The dreadful cloaked figure drifts into the compartment, facing Harry, who stands paralyzed by the sight of the terrifying creature that seems to drain the energy from his body, rendering him stiff. In this dire moment, Professor Lupin swiftly removes his cloak and points his wand at the spectral figure, which, in a brilliant flash of light, is sent hurtling backward and vanishes. Harry loses consciousness in the aftermath but soon regains awareness, finding himself lying on the seat. Hermione offers him his glasses, which he carefully puts on, and, feeling bewildered, accepts a piece of chocolate from Professor Lupin. Rising to his feet, he turns and smiles at Ron and Hermione, who gaze at him intently. Harry then redirects his gaze to the rain pouring relentlessly outside the window, contemplating his own anxious reflection in the glass. As the scene shifts, horseless carriages transport the students to Hogwarts Castle, where they gather in the Great Hall for the welcoming feast.

Harry lies down and peers under the bed, watching the book, which lies still, then snaps once more and slithers out, turning this way and that before it slides back under the bed. Not wanting to lose it, Harry quickly unties his shoelace, which he learned in Professor Flitwick's Charms class can be used to lure magical objects, and dangles his shoe over the edge of the bed, dropping his shoe onto the floor, prompting the book to hurtle out, snapping its covers, as Harry jumps onto the book with both feet. In the corridor of the inn known as the Leaky Cauldron, a maid knocks at the room next door, and Harry goes downstairs. A ginger cat, known as Crookshanks in the wizarding world, chases a rat down the corridor, passing a wanted poster for Sirius Black, a notorious wizard believed to have escaped from Azkaban. On the Hogwarts Express, which is the train that takes students to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Mrs. Weasley passes Ron his rat, Scabbers, unaware it is actually the Animagus Peter Pettigrew, and a man is asleep in a compartment. Harry slides the door closed as steam billows from the funnel of the train while the Hogwarts Express travels through the rain beside the edge of a vast lake, part of the scenic route to Hogwarts. Harry peers along the corridor, and the door slides shut as the lights go out, a signal of the impending arrival of the Dementors. Ron stares out the window into the rain as the Express stops on a viaduct, a high bridge spanning the valley, and one by one, the carriages go dark. The train lurches again, and the air turns so cold that they can see their breath, a common effect of Dementor presence. Ron pulls his hand away from the window as frost, unusual for the season, spreads across the glass, and ice forms in Professor Lupin's bottle of water while he remains asleep in the corner, wrapped in his cloak, known for its protective enchantments. The train lurches again, and Hermione shivers. Something appears out in the corridor, floating towards the door, something black, shapeless, and mysterious, a Dementor, a dark creature that feeds on human happiness. It reaches out as the door slides open, revealing a horrible hand with long fingers like crooked, dead twigs reaching into the compartment. A hooded black shape looms in the doorway, as Hermione's cat Crookshanks spits and Ron's rat, Scabbers, hides under his coat. The hideous cloaked figure floats into the compartment and faces Harry, who stares helplessly at the terrifying creature, known to cause despair and hopelessness, that seems to draw the energy out of him, making his body go stiff. Professor Lupin throws off his cloak and points his wand at the threatening figure, which, in a flash of light, hurtles backwards and disappears. Harry loses consciousness and then opens his eyes, finding himself lying on the seat. Hermione hands him his glasses, which he puts on, and looking confused, he takes a piece of chocolate from Professor Lupin, a remedy known to help recover from a Dementor's effects. He gets up, turns, and smiles as Ron and Hermione stare at him. Harry looks at the rain teeming down outside the window and stares at his own worried face reflected in the glass. Horseless carriages, drawn by Thestrals that can only be seen by those who have witnessed death, take the students up to Hogwarts Castle, where they assemble in the Great Hall for the welcoming feast, sitting at long tables with lighted candles enchanted to float above their heads as they listen to the choir, setting the stage for another year of magical learning."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

He reflects on his worried face in the window as horseless carriages take students to Hogwarts, where they gather in the Great Hall for the welcoming feast with floating candles and a choir."
