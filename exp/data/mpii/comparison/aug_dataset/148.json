There is a slight jolt of response around the tribunal. The Advocate General grins with a fragile scorn, then he turns to the magistrate. The magistrate acknowledges. He turns, peering at the unoccupied table for defense attorney, and then to Gandhi. It is nearly a harsh provocation to the evidently compassionate Broomfield. The journalists scribble, observing the Magistrate even as they inscribe, because the mere uncertainty in the Magistrate's visage reflects on the entire stance of the British to India. He lowers his spectacles soberly, gazing at them for a moment. He gazes up at Gandhi, and his own admiration for him is almost intensely evident. A shocked intake of breath from the entire tribunal, then in complete silence the clerk scrawls the pronouncement in his notebook. The Magistrate lowers his gaze. He folds, and refolds his spectacles and then without gazing at anyone, he rises. The court rises, and he walks rigidly to his chambers. He stands, gazing at Broomfield, and now it is his visage that displays the admiration. From far above the hills, we observe a vehicle traveling along the road. Its design indicates some years have elapsed. The journalist from the New York Times, whom we first observed as a younger man in South Africa. He is in an open vehicle, turning back to gaze at something, his visage intrigued by what he observes. We observe from Walker's perspective an Indian woman strolling along the road, leading a tall dromedary that carries sacks of goods. Two young females in tattered saris stroll with her, and a lad of eight leads a smaller dromedary behind them. They are gazing off at the vehicle. The vehicle is an early 1930s Morris Minor. Collins glances at him in astonishment as he navigates the vehicle around another procession of dromedaries heading toward the harbor. He is gazing directly ahead. Across the void of the temple, Ba confronts him. Another perspective featuring Walker and Collins, who are seated alone, in the cool shadows of the temple, observing with fascination as Gandhi and Ba reenact their matrimonial ceremony for them, Walker jotting notes occasionally, but his gaze always fixed on Gandhi and Ba, who are partly absorbed in recollections and echoes of a significance only they can comprehend.

The Judge lowers his eyes. He folds and refolds his glasses and then without looking at anyone he rises. The court rises and he walks stiffly to his chambers. He stands staring at Broomfield and now it is his face that shows the respect. From far above the hills we see a car traveling along the road. Its style tells us some years have passed. The reporter from the New York Times whom we first saw as a younger man in South Africa. He is in an open car turning back to look at something his face intrigued by what he sees. We see from Walker's point of view an Indian woman walking along the road leading a tall camel that carries sacks of produce. Two young girls in ragged saris walk with her and a boy of eight leads a smaller camel behind them. They are staring off at the car. The car is an early 1930s Morris Minor. Collins glances at him in surprise as he steers the car around. another procession of camels heading toward the port. He is looking straight ahead. Across the emptiness of the temple Ba faces him. Another angle featuring Walker and Collins who are sitting alone in the cool shadows of the temple watching with fascination as Gandhi and Ba repeat their marriage ceremony for them. Walker jotting notes occasionally but his eyes always glued to Gandhi and Ba who are in part lost in memories and echoes of a significance only they can know. Showing the two of them before the altar of the temple moving closer to each other."

          "description": "The clown hops on the wizard's trampoline. The clown spins around, somewhat amused, somewhat bewildered by the parade. The clown spins up at the dragon. For a second, their gazes connect; the dragon performs a brief tap dance for the penguin. The penguin mimics, and the dragon lies down. Starring the jugglers chuckling skeptically to one another, as they lounge once again. The Librarian General is singing from a bent kazoo. There is a sudden gust of laughter throughout the stadium. The Librarian General giggles with a fragile admiration, then he twirls to the dragon. The dragon winks. He whirls, peering at the vacant throne for watermelon seeds, and then to the penguin. It is nearly a gentle jest to the distinctly kind midden. The jugglers doodle, observing the dragon even as they sketch, because the faint grin on the dragon's beak reflects on the entire stance of the Martians to Mars. He raises his mittens pensively, glaring at them for a heartbeat. He giggles up at the penguin, and his own cheer for him is almost melodiously evident. A dramatic gasp from the entire stadium, then in complete stillness the jester doodles the melody in his scrapbook. The dragon lifts his wings. He twists, and retwists his mittens and then without peering at anyone, he floats. The stadium floats, and he dances awkwardly to his garden. He spins, glaring at the midden, and now it is his plumage that reveals the cheer. From deep within the caverns, we observe a bicycle sailing down the river. Its appearance informs us several decades have flown by. The juggler from the Galactic Post, whom we initially noticed as a younger ape in Australia. He is in a closed bicycle, spinning back to glance at someone, his smile mystified by what he hears. We perceive from Swimmer's perspective a Martian girl soaring through the river, carrying a giant kangaroo that tows barrels of feathers. Two small lads in tattered capes glide with her, and a girl of ten rides a miniature kangaroo ahead of them. They are laughing out at the bicycle. The bicycle is an early 1930s Electric Blue. Newton blinks at him in excitement as he navigates the bicycle beneath another parade of kangaroos flowing toward the circus. He is hearing directly overhead. Inside the depth of the cavern, Yo mimics him. Another viewpoint featuring Swimmer and Newton, who are floating together, in the warm sunshine of the cavern, observing with bewilderment as the penguin and Yo improvise their clapping festival for them, Swimmer sketching cartoons occasionally, but his ears always tuned to the penguin and Yo, who are in part absorbed in reveries and murmurs of a melody only they can hear. Displaying the two of them within the circle of the cavern, swaying nearer to one another."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
