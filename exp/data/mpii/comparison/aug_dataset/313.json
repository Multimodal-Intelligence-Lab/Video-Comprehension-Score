Meanwhile, Evan, Kayleigh, Lenny, and Tommy, all thirteen years old, fixate on the mailbox across the street with palpable anticipation. As Evan becomes aware of his surroundings within this memory, a lit cigarette inadvertently slips from his lips and settles into the folds of his shirt. His attention returns to the mailbox. Suddenly, a car emerges from down the street, gradually making its way into the driveway. Mrs. Halpern, a 24-year-old attractive young mother, steps out of the car, strides over to the mailbox, and retrieves its contents before returning to the vehicle. Watching in horror, Evan unconsciously clenches his teeth in pain and swiftly swipes the front of his shirt, causing the lit cigarette to tumble to the ground. He then lifts his shirt to reveal a fresh burn mark on his stomach. Andrea shakes her head in disapproval while Evan responds with a nod, though an unsettling feeling lingers beneath the surface. With urgency, Evan frantically searches through his journals, disheveling the room in pursuit of a specific book. Thumper, lounging on his bed, observes Evan's frenzied actions with mounting concern. Leaping from the bed, Thumper snatches the journal and begins to examine the entry. After scanning the contents, Thumper returns the journal to Evan. Evan opens it and reads silently, his hands trembling as he absorbs the information. In frustration, he slams the book shut in defeat. Later, Evan pulls into the parking lot of a country diner.

Kayleigh's face flushes a deep red with embarrassment as she bends down to clean up the fallen order. As she gathers the mess and heads back into the kitchen, a customer provocatively pinches her, prompting Evan to observe her reaction intently. She flinches at the inappropriate gesture but then masks her discomfort with a composed smile for the customer. Feeling uneasy, Evan retreats. Moments later, Kayleigh struggles with the zipper of a worn-out coat as she makes her way out. Evan steps out from the shadows, causing her to startle initially, but recognition soon dawns upon her, and a fleeting smile graces her features as she allows him to embrace her. Kayleigh nods in acknowledgment, and together they proceed down the street. She reaches into her pocket, retrieves a pack of cigarettes, and offers one to Evan, who nods while scrutinizing her expression with his next query. Pausing mid-walk, Kayleigh crushes her cigarette underfoot as she begins to tremble, her eyes welling up with tears. Overcome with emotion, she turns to run, halts briefly, glancing back at Evan before turning away and sprinting off. Exhausted and despondent, Evan settles onto the nearby lawn, absently tracing the outline of the new burn scar on his belly. Later, Evan enters his dorm, disregarding Thumper, who occupies Evan's bed, fervently inhaling from a gurgling bong. Evan methodically places a towel under the door, shutting out the world."

Then Lenny suddenly moves back and begins working on the model airplane again, a project he took up after watching an inspiring documentary, his eyes a million miles away. Furthermore, the walls behind him vibrate, slightly worse than before, due to the ongoing construction in their neighborhood, notorious for its noise pollution. Evan, Kayleigh, Lenny, and Tommy, all thirteen, watch the mailbox across the street with intense anticipation, a mailbox often used by the residents to exchange secret messages. When Evan comes to in this memory, the lit cigarette absently drops from his mouth and nestles into the folds of his shirt, echoing the consequences of his recent foray into smoking, which he took up after succumbing to peer pressure. The mailbox is the focus of their plan. Suddenly a car, a rusty old sedan, appears from down the street and slowly pulls into the driveway. Mrs. Halpern, 24, an attractive young mother known for her vibrant social life, gets out of the car and walks to the mailbox. Mrs. Halpern walks back to the car, her expression unreadable after collecting the mail that might contain more than just bills. Evan looks on in horror and suddenly clenches his teeth in pain and silently swipes the front of his shirt, sending the lit cigarette to the ground, an action that mirrors his recent struggles with self-control. He pulls up his shirt, revealing a fresh burn mark on his stomach, an unfortunate souvenir of his carelessness. Andrea, who has been a steady friend through his ordeals, shakes her head. Evan nods, but something gnaws beneath the surface, a creeping worry about what they've just set into motion. Evan hastily hunts through his journals, tearing up the room looking for a certain book, his personal diary where he meticulously documents his turbulent thoughts. Thumper, lying on his bed, quietly watches Evan with growing concern, aware of Evan's tendency to spiral into these frantic searches. Thumper jumps off the bed and snatches the journal away, acting on their old pact to help each other in moments of crisis. Thumper begins scanning the journal entry that held the secrets of their recent adventures. He hands the journal back to Evan. Evan opens it and begins reading it silently, his hands beginning to tremble as the weight of their actions takes its toll. He slams the book shut in defeat, knowing that some things can't be undone. Evan pulls into a parking lot of a country diner, a spot frequented by locals known for its hearty breakfasts. Evan is about to enter when he spots Kayleigh coming out of the kitchen with a tray full of food, her part-time job that helps support her family. Her boss stares back in aggravation, a man known for being strict and unforgiving. Kayleigh's face turns beet red as she bends down to clean up the order, which had accidentally spilled. As she brings the mess inside the kitchen, a customer pinches her ass, a disrespectful act that she, unfortunately, faces too often. Evan closely studies her reaction to the offense. She flinches uncomfortably but then composes a smile for the customer, concealing her discomfort behind a practiced facade. Evan backs out uncomfortably, his heart heavy with empathy for her situation. Kayleigh struggles with the zipper of a shabby coat, a hand-me-down from her older brother, as she exits. Evan steps out of the shadows. She's startled at first, but eventually recognizes him, relief washing over her features. A smile flickers across her face and she allows herself to be hugged, finding comfort in an old friend's presence. Kayleigh nods and they walk down the street, the familiar route they used to take to the park near their school. She reaches into her pocket, pulls out a pack of smokes, a habit she picked up to manage stress. Evan nods and scrutinizes her face with his next question, carefully choosing his words. Kayleigh stops walking and crushes her cigarette, overwhelmed by emotions. Kayleigh begins to tremble, her façade cracking under the pressure. Tears flow, a release of pent-up emotions. Kayleigh runs, stops, and turns back to Evan, conflicted about leaving him behind. She turns and runs away, needing space to process everything. Evan, tired and depressed, sits on the lawn nearby, fingering the new burn scar on his belly, a reminder of the confusion and pain simmering inside him. Evan enters his dorm, the small room he shares with Thumper, furnished with mismatched furniture. He ignores Thumper, who sits on Evan's bed sucking furiously from a gurgling bong, his usual way of unwinding, despite Evan's silent disapproval. Evan puts a towel under the door, hoping to contain the residual smell and protect them both from unwanted attention."

He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

          "description": "Evan, along with friends Kayleigh, Lenny, and Tommy, all thirteen, anxiously watch a mailbox. In a memory, a cigarette drops from Evan's mouth, burning his stomach. Mrs. Halpern, an attractive young mother, arrives, and Evan experiences pain. Troubled, he searches for a specific journal, disrupting his room. Thumper, observing, hands the journal to Evan, who reads it with trembling hands and slams it shut in defeat. At a diner, Evan sees Kayleigh, embarrassed by her boss's reaction and a customer's inappropriate behavior. Outside, Evan approaches Kayleigh, who is initially startled but then smiles. They walk together until Kayleigh becomes upset and runs away. Exhausted, Evan sits, touching the burn scar on his belly. Back in his dorm, he ignores Thumper, focused on numbing his mind."
