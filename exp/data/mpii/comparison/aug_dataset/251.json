Butch's mother, around 35, stands in the doorway leading into the living room, next to a man dressed in the uniform of an American Air Force officer. The camera captures the perspective of a five-year-old boy as Koons steps inside the room toward the child, bending on one knee to match the boy's eyeline. When Koons speaks, he has a slight Texas accent and pulls a gold wristwatch out of his pocket, handing it to Butch. A little hand enters the frame to accept it. The 27-year-old Butch Coolidge is shown dressed in boxing regalia—trunks, shoes, and gloves—lying on a table catching a few zzzz's before a big fight. He wakes up suddenly, shaken by the bizarre memory, and wipes his sweaty face with a boxing glove. His trainer Klondike, an older fireplug, opens the door slightly, peeking into the room as pandemonium breaks out behind him in the hallway.

In the doorway, which serves as a threshold to the living room, stands Butch's mother, appearing to be about 35, beside a man donned in the attire of an American Air Force officer. The camera adopts the vantage point of a five-year-old boy, fixing its focus as Koons strides into the room, directing his steps toward the child and gracefully lowering himself onto one knee to align his gaze with the boy's. When Koons begins to speak, his voice carries a faint Texas accent, and he elegantly retrieves a gold wristwatch from his pocket, extending it towards young Butch. A tiny hand emerges into view to accept the timepiece. Fast forward in time, 27-year-old Butch Coolidge is portrayed in full boxing ensemble—trunks, shoes, and gloves—sprawled on a table, catching some sleep in preparation for an impending fight. He jolts awake, disoriented by the surreal recollection, and uses a boxing glove to dab the perspiration from his face. His trainer, Klondike, a sturdy and seasoned figure, gently nudges the door ajar, peering inside the room as chaos erupts in the hallway behind him. A taxi is stationed in the shadows of an alley adjacent to an auditorium. The scene gradually reveals the vehicle as the sound of a radio filters from within. Inside the car, a young woman with Spanish features savors steaming coffee from a plain white Styrofoam cup, as the voices of sportscasters persist in their broadcast. Esmarelda quietly switches off the radio, takes another sip, and upon hearing an unexpected noise from the alley's recesses, she extends her head beyond the car door to investigate, noticing a third-story window on the auditorium’s facade being pushed open. A gym bag plummets into a garbage dumpster below, promptly followed by Butch Coolidge, still clad in his boxing trunks, shoes, gloves, and a yellow robe, as he plunges into the dumpster. Esmarelda processes the oddity of the spectacle before her as Butch, drenched and only partially clad in trunks, shoes, and gloves, quickly clambers into the vehicle's backseat and shuts the door with a forceful slam. Directing her gaze forward, Esmarelda communicates with Butch through the reflection in the rearview mirror while he works to remove one of his boxing gloves. Esmarelda continues to observe him through the mirror, subsequently pressing a button to lower the back window. Butch discards his glove through the opening, shifts his effort to undo the remaining one, prompting Esmarelda to break her silence. As Butch lets the second glove fall out of the window, he completes the task of drying himself off and disposes of the towel similarly. An enveloping hush follows as Butch rummages through his gym bag in search of a t-shirt."

She sticks her head out of the car door to investigate and sees a window about three stories high open on the auditorium side of the alley. A gym bag is tossed out into a garbage dumpster below followed by Butch Coolidge still in boxing trunks shoes gloves and a yellow robe leaping into the dumpster. Esmarelda registers the strangeness of this scene as Butch soaking wet and naked except for his trunks shoes and gloves hops into the backseat and slams the door. Esmarelda stares straight ahead and talks to Butch through the rearview mirror as he gets one of his boxing gloves off. Esmarelda watches in the rearview mirror then presses a button to roll down the back window. Butch tosses his boxing glove out starts untying the other one and Esmarelda cannot stay quiet anymore. As he tosses his other glove out the window he finishes wiping himself down and tosses the towel out. Silence ensues as Butch digs in his bag for a tshirt."

The camera captures the perspective of a fiveyearold boy as Koons steps inside the room toward the child bending on one knee to match the boy's eyeline.

          "description": "Julian snickers and Lily chuckles as Julian pivots. We're in the garden of a lavish four-story villa in Madrid, Spain, in the year 1985. Nancy's uncle, around 50, leans in the archway leading into the garden, beside a woman dressed in the robes of an Italian Navy captain. The lens seizes the gaze of a three-year-old girl as Franco parades inside the courtyard toward the toddler, crouching to whisper in the child’s ear. When Franco mutters, he has a thick Scottish lilt and extracts a silver compass from his satchel, passing it to Nancy. A tiny foot shuffles into the view to grab it. The 19-year-old Nancy Bright is displayed cloaked in gymnastics attire—leotard, slippers, and wristbands—resting on a bench catching a few winks before a major competition. She jolts up suddenly, rattled by the peculiar recollection, and dabs her damp cheeks with a wristband. Her coach Yukon, an elderly dynamo, nudges the door slightly ajar, peering into the courtyard as chaos erupts behind him in the corridor. A carriage is stationed in a misty lane beside a stadium, and we gradually glide toward the stationary vehicle while the tune of the vehicle radio wafts from within. A young man with Nordic features reclines in the carriage, sipping piping hot tea from a blue porcelain mug as commentators prolong their analysis. Opal flicks the radio off, gulps her tea, and detects a clamor from overhead in the lane. She extends her arm out of the carriage window to scrutinize and perceives a roof about six stories high ajar on the stadium side of the lane. A suitcase is flung out into a recycling bin below, followed by Nancy Bright, still in gymnastics leotard, slippers, wristbands, and a green cape, diving into the bin. Opal perceives the oddity of this sight as Nancy, drenched and bare except for her leotard, slippers, and wristbands, clambers into the front seat and bangs the door. Opal glares directly ahead and converses with Nancy through the side mirror as she tugs one of her wristbands free. Opal observes in the side mirror, then taps a switch to lower the front window. Nancy hurls her wristband out, commences unfastening the other one, and Opal can’t remain silent anymore. As she launches her other wristband out the window, she completes drying herself off and flings the cloth out. Stillness follows as Nancy rummages in her suitcase for a hoodie."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

          "description": "In 1972 Alhambra, California, a young Butch Coolidge receives a gold wristwatch from Koons, an American Air Force officer, in a modest home. Fast forward to a present-day boxing match where 27-year-old Butch awakens from the memory, wiping sweat with a glove. His trainer Klondike peeks in amidst hallway chaos. Outside, a taxi idles next to the auditorium, with a young woman named Esmarelda inside, sipping coffee. Suddenly, Butch, in boxing attire, leaps into a dumpster from a third-story window, then jumps into the taxi backseat. Esmarelda, startled, engages him through the rearview mirror as he discards his boxing gloves and towel, eventually searching for a t-shirt in silence."
