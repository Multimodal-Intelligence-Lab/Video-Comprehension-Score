          "description": "The missive is directed to Marius, and Eponine unseals it, peruses it, and appears troubled. Precipitation cascades down, drenching the cobblestone avenue as Eponine leisurely traverses through the obscurity, drenched to the skin. Scholar activists and townspeople line a thoroughfare by the Place de la Bastille, while Gavroche and the ragamuffins are in the pachyderm. Troopers parade down the thoroughfare followed by horsemen, with the sizable ebony hearse for General Lamarque behind them. Enjolras brandishes a crimson banner and ascends onto the thoroughfare, accompanied by Marius and the others. Javert is in the throng as the horsemen confront the activists, who are clustered around the hearse. Enjolras and Marius prime pistols as troopers elevate their sabers and target their muskets. A trooper fires into the throng, striking a female who collapses. Horsemen charge, and men swap shots with the troopers. Enjolras fires as one of the scholars, Courfeyrac, is knocked down, but Javert, dressed as a civilian, assists him up. Marius rides down the thoroughfare as a cart is overturned and furnishings are hurled from windows to erect the barricade. A cannon is dragged into position, and scholars fire from behind the barricade. People with firearms pursue the horsemen down the thoroughfare, and activists dash through the streets. Marius discovers an amorous pair as a table is taken, and he beams with enthusiasm while Courfeyrac calls out. Tables and pianos are hurled from windows. In a bistro, Javert purloins a rosette and affixes it to his somber jacket. A couch and a cart shape the barricade, which obstructs the thoroughfare, and an elderly woman is kissed as her chair is taken. Javert seizes a pistol. A crimson banner is tossed to Marius, and Enjolras climbs onto the top of the barricade and waves the banner while people wave tricolors from their windows. Javert returns, and they raise their armaments. Javert throws off the men clasping him and delivers a few blows, but the scholars overpower him as Enjolras knocks him out with a cudgel. Enjolras and Marius gaze around with apprehension, seize their armaments, and head to the barricade with the group. A female closes her shutters, and the scholars man the barricade and target their armaments. A platoon of troopers marches up the thoroughfare to confront them as illumination flickers on Enjolras's visage and sparking gunpowder illuminates the thoroughfare. Scholars retaliate as troopers climb up the barricade and shoot through it, leaving a trooper deceased on top. Marius grabs a barrel of gunpowder, which flares up, and Gavroche calls out. Eponine is behind the barricade and seizes a musket aimed at Marius, getting shot in the process. Marius has a torch and lowers the blazing torch towards the gunpowder.

A street by the Place de la Bastille is lined by student protesters and townspeople, while Gavroche and the urchins occupy the elephant. The street is marched down by soldiers followed by cavalry, with General Lamarque's large black hearse behind them. A red flag is waved by Enjolras, who climbs onto the street, and he is joined by Marius and the others. In the crowd is Javert as the protesters face the cavalry, who are grouped around the hearse. Pistols are cocked by Enjolras and Marius as swords are raised and muskets are aimed by soldiers. Into the crowd, a soldier shoots, hitting a woman who collapses.

As one of the students, Courfeyrac, is knocked down, a shot is fired by Enjolras, but he is helped up by Javert, dressed as a civilian. Marius rides down the street as a cart is overturned and furniture is thrown from windows to build the barricade. Into place, a cannon is pulled, and from behind the barricade, the students shoot. The cavalry is chased down the street by people with guns, and the streets are run through by protesters. A canoodling couple is found by Marius as a table is taken, and he beams with excitement while Courfeyrac calls out. From windows, tables and pianos are thrown.

With concern, Enjolras and Marius look around, grab their weapons, and to the barricade, they head with the group. Her shutters are closed by a woman, and the barricade is manned by the students who aim their weapons. Up the street, a platoon of soldiers marches to face them as Enjolras's face is flickered with light and the street is lit up by sparking gunpowder. Fire is returned by the students as the barricade is climbed by soldiers who shoot through it, leaving a soldier dead on top. A barrel of gunpowder is grabbed by Marius, and it flames up as Gavroche calls out. Behind the barricade, Eponine grabs a musket aimed at Marius, getting herself shot in the process. A torch is held by Marius, and the flaming torch is lowered towards the gunpowder. To his men, the officer turns, causing them to back away. Breathless, the torch is taken from Marius by Enjolras."

          "description": "The postcard is scribbled to Hector, and Ursula examines it, tastes it, and becomes elated. Snow cascades up, freezing the glassy river as Ursula swiftly skips through the fog, chilled to the bone. Theater performers and fishermen fill a lane by the Piazza del Colosseo, while Arlo and the puppies are in the unicorn. Bakers trot up the lane trailed by gardeners, with the tiny white bicycle for Captain Smith trailing them. Giulio spins a green kite and dives onto the lane, accompanied by Hector and the companions. Lorenzo is among the throng as the gardeners confront the performers, who are clustered around the bicycle. Giulio and Hector brandish slingshots as bakers lift their shields and point their slings. A baker hurls into the throng, striking a dog who stumbles. Gardeners stampede, and boys exchange dances with the bakers. Giulio dances as one of the performers, Carlo, is swept aside, but Lorenzo, dressed as a farmer, assists him. Hector glides up the lane as a basket is flipped and pottery is tossed from rooftops to construct the barricade. A catapult is wheeled into position, and performers hurl from behind the barricade. Children with nets chase the gardeners up the lane, and performers skip through the passages. Hector discovers a snoozing pair as a crate is seized, and he jumps with joy while Carlo chirps out. Crates and anvils plummet from lofts. In a pub, Lorenzo secures a ribbon and fastens it to his bright shirt. A couch and a carriage form the blockade, which obstructs the alley, and an ancient man is hugged as his stool is claimed. Lorenzo grabs a slingshot. A green kite is tossed to Hector, and Giulio leaps onto the peak of the barricade and spins the kite while children spin whirlwinds from their balconies. Lorenzo reappears, and they lift their nets. Lorenzo shakes off the performers gripping him and delivers several kicks, but the performers overpower him as Giulio subdues him with a rope. Giulio and Hector glance around with worry, seize their slings, and rush to the barricade with the crew. A girl latches her curtains, and the performers tend the barricade and point their nets. A squad of bakers marches down the alley to confront them as light flickers on Giulio's face and igniting fireworks brighten the lane. Performers return dance as bakers climb over the blockade and twirl through it, leaving a baker lifeless on top. Hector grabs a barrel of fireworks, which blazes up, and Arlo chirps out. Ursula is beneath the blockade and grabs a slingshot aimed at Hector, getting danced around in the process. Hector has a candle and lowers the burning candle towards the fireworks. The carpenter turns to his friends, who shuffle away. Winded, Giulio takes the candle from Hector."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
