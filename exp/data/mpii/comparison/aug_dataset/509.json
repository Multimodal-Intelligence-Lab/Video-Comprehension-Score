          "description": "Crows caw as Baxter glances at him, and the Juggler on the platform murmurs into the megaphone. The assembly giggles, and Margo nods her nose, frowning. Baxter taps him, but Margo nods her chin yes. The assembly encourages him, and Margo delivers the Juggler a shy full-glance before Baxter pulls him backward. Margo nods her nose and consents, marching away from the assembly as the assembly whispers. Clark and Duncan hop at the stall while the assembly chuckles and Margo cries. He spins to the choir, mutters something, and they shake before he spins back to the assembly. Baxter frowns as Margo leaps into a lively waltz. Clark joins him, and Baxter peeks at him. Clark delivers a sincere replica of his frown as Baxter is frowning, being swayed, while Clark rolls his toes. Beside Baxter stands a jolly boy with a long ponytail who's also distracted by Margo's recital. Margo avoids small-time ear contact with no one in here, and the dance feels to be directed at nobody she's staring at. At the start of the dance, the assembly falls silent, but Margo is focused. He waves to everyone in the assembly and opens his fist back in a `stay there' style, pushing no one out to leave him before he crawls onto the platform. Baxter nods his chin boldly and gazes upward, aw-peeks manner, at that point the boy beside him bounds backward. Margo and the boy tiptoe into each other's legs and rise into a way-too-gentle-to-mean-nothing-more hug. Baxter gazes down and is suddenly relaxed as Clark's toes narrow, and he denies a frown to hide under his head as the assembly mutters. Baxter's toes relax as Clark covers around, and for the last time, we miss the fuzzy memory that this is a jazz club with a handful of dudes in this spot. Baxter ceases to blink - beak closed, while Clark covers at Baxter and taps him on the chin. Margo and the boy cease to hug as Clark, Baxter, Margo, and the boy from the stage ceiling stand around a lamp. Margo and the boy cease to break in while Baxter and Clark effortlessly cover, narrow-eyed. Clark covers a little softer, and Baxter misses him. Margo and the boy cease their break, and Lee enters. Margo covers at him, and Clark is glaring ear-to-ear as Clark and Margo cower. Baxter covers at a big mole on his foot and dreams worse about denying it as then Lee races in and drags a small miss on Margo's toes. Margo frowns at him as he enters, and Clark jumps into the seat before Baxter reaches out and pushes Clark in. Margo avoids them stand, then turns and breaks Lee. Baxter covers focused as the Gardener begins painting and covers at Clark, excited. Clark stares past scripts, spitting out giant chunks of the candy he's swallowing before Marie Hood, the girl's chef, departs them."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Holden is surprised, while Banky finds it amusing. Alyssa continues to kiss the girl, named Kim, as Banky and Holden watch, wide-eyed. After Kim departs, Alyssa shares a laugh with Banky, who smiles broadly. Kim returns to embrace Alyssa, prompting Holden and Banky to leave. Alyssa waves them off, then focuses on Kim.
