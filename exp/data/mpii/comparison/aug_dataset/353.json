Meanwhile, Frodo and Sam are climbing the face of Mount Doom, where the landscape is violent, red heat hisses out of fissures, the jagged rock is razor sharp, and ash blankets the land. Red lightning forks across the sky with a deafening crack. Close on Frodo and Sam's feet dragging across the ash, their parched lips, and sweating, dusty faces. Frodo trips and falls face-first into the dust, with Sam dropping beside him. Aragorn's army is surrounded by 300,000 Orcs poised to attack. Frodo slowly lifts his head and looks up, straight up the steep slopes of Mount Doom, a huge mass of ash, slag, and burned stone. Frodo begins to crawl on his hands and knees, hauling himself a few pitiful feet before slumping in the ash. Gimli surveys the army of Mordor and looks up into the eyes of Legolas, with whom he has shared much, and the gruff dwarf smiles quietly. Sam crawls to Frodo, who lies slumped against the rock-face, and turns him over, holding him in his arms. Frodo shuts his eyes, his breath coming in gasps, as Sam looks at him with grim determination. Sam lifts Frodo onto his shoulders and starts to climb Mount Doom, his hobbit-face growing stern, almost grim, with determination. The two tiny hobbits struggle on the endless shale slopes. Aragorn and company watch as they are surrounded by a tide of Orcs. Aragorn raises Andúril in a broad sweep as he walks forward, turning to face the others with quiet resolve written on his face, looking into the eyes of the remaining members of the Fellowship. Aragorn turns, sword-raised, and charges forward; a moment of silence follows, with no one else moving. Suddenly, a shout goes up, and angle on Pippin and Merry charging forward with the rest of the men following. Aragorn crashes head-on into a line of Orcs, the blade of Andúril flashing as he hacks at them. Like a small grey insect, Sam creeps up the slope with Frodo on his back, foot by foot, as the mantling cloud swirls, revealing the cruel pinnacles and iron crown of Barad-dûr, the Dark Tower, in the distance. Sam staggers under Frodo's weight as strong ash-laden winds buffet him while he slowly climbs Mount Doom, with the plain of Gorgoroth lying 1000 feet below, wrapped in fume and shadow. A tremor ripples through the ground, and a red flame explodes into the sky, causing Sam to look up, fearful the mountain could explode at any moment. Through the thick, fume-laden air, a set of stairs can be made out.",

Aragorn grips Andúril raised. Meanwhile, Frodo and Sam are ascending the surface of Mount Doom, where the terrain is ferocious, crimson warmth hisses out of crevices, the jagged stone is razor sharp, and soot covers the territory. Scarlet lightning splits across the heavens with a deafening crash. Close on Frodo and Sam's feet dragging across the soot, their parched lips, and perspiring, dusty visages. Frodo stumbles and tumbles face-first into the powder, with Sam dropping beside him. Aragorn's troops are encircled by 300,000 Orcs ready to strike. Frodo slowly raises his head and gazes up, straight up the steep inclines of Mount Doom, a vast mass of soot, slag, and burned stone. Frodo begins to crawl on his hands and knees, pulling himself a few pitiful feet before collapsing in the soot. Gimli inspects the troops of Mordor and gazes up into the eyes of Legolas, with whom he has shared much, and the gruff dwarf smiles quietly. Sam crawls to Frodo, who lies collapsed against the stone-face, and turns him over, holding him in his arms. Frodo shuts his eyes, his breath coming in pants, as Sam gazes at him with grim resolve. Sam lifts Frodo onto his shoulders and starts to climb Mount Doom, his hobbit-face growing stern, almost grim, with resolve. The two tiny hobbits struggle on the endless shale inclines. Aragorn and company observe as they are encircled by a wave of Orcs. Aragorn raises Andúril in a broad sweep as he strides forward, turning to face the others with quiet resolve written on his visage, gazing into the eyes of the remaining members of the Fellowship. Aragorn turns, sword-raised, and charges forward; a moment of silence follows, with no one else moving. Suddenly, a shout goes up, and angle on Pippin and Merry charging forward with the rest of the males following. Aragorn crashes head-on into a line of Orcs, the blade of Andúril flashing as he chops at them. Like a small grey insect, Sam crawls up the incline with Frodo on his back, foot by foot, as the mantling haze swirls, revealing the cruel spires and iron crown of Barad-dûr, the Dark Tower, in the distance. Sam staggers under Frodo's load as strong ash-laden gales buffet him while he slowly climbs Mount Doom, with the plain of Gorgoroth lying 1000 feet below, wrapped in smoke and shadow. A tremor ripples through the soil, and a crimson blaze erupts into the heavens, causing Sam to gaze up, fearful the mountain could erupt at any moment. Through the thick, smoke-laden air, a set of stairs can be made out."

Across the sky, red lightning forks with a deafening crack. Frodo and Sam's feet drag across the ash, their lips parched, and their faces sweaty and dusty. Frodo trips and into the dust he falls face-first, beside him, Sam drops. The army of Aragorn is surrounded by 300,000 Orcs who are poised to attack.

As he rides, Aragorn holds the blade Andúril high in the air, its presence commanding and powerful. Meanwhile, Frodo and Sam are arduously climbing the steep, treacherous face of Mount Doom. The landscape around them is a scene of violent upheaval, with the red-hot heat hissing furiously out of fissures in the ground. The jagged rock, as sharp as a razor, threatens with every step, while thick layers of ash blanket the already inhospitable land. Red lightning forks across the sky, splitting it with a deafening crack that echoes ominously. Close in on Frodo and Sam's weary feet as they drag through the thick ash, their parched lips and sweating, dust-covered faces telling the story of their struggle. In a weary stumble, Frodo trips and falls face-first into the suffocating dust, with Sam immediately dropping down beside him in concern. Nearby, Aragorn's army finds itself surrounded by a formidable force of 300,000 Orcs who are poised and ready to attack. Slowly, Frodo lifts his head, his eyes focusing upward, straight up the steep, daunting slopes of Mount Doom, which rises like a huge mass of ash, slag, and charred stone. Determined, Frodo begins to crawl forward on his hands and knees, hauling his weary body a few pitiful feet before slumping into the ash once more. Gimli, the stalwart dwarf, surveys the vast army of Mordor and looks up into the eyes of Legolas, with whom he has shared countless experiences; a quiet smile of camaraderie passes between them. Sam drags himself to where Frodo lies slumped against the unforgiving rock-face, gently turns him over, and cradles him in his arms. With Frodo’s eyes shutting in sheer exhaustion and his breath coming in shallow gasps, Sam gazes at him with a look of grim determination. Gathering his strength, Sam lifts Frodo onto his shoulders and begins the arduous climb up Mount Doom, his hobbit-face growing stern, even grim, with unwavering resolve.

As he rides onwards with purpose, Aragorn holds aloft the magnificent blade Andúril, its presence both commanding and powerful, instilling courage in those who see it.

As he rides, he locks eyes with each of his men, transmitting silent encouragement through steadfast glances. In his grip, he holds Andúril, raising it high above his head as a symbol of hope and strength. Meanwhile, Frodo and Sam painstakingly make their way up the daunting face of Mount Doom, where the landscape mirrors the violence of their quest, with blinding red heat hissing through fissures, jagged rocks slicing at their feet, and ash spread thickly across the ground like a suffocating blanket. The sky above is torn by red lightning, which forks with a deafening intensity, underscoring the peril they face. Close-up, the camera reveals Frodo’s and Sam’s feet as they drag heavily through the ash, capturing the desolation on their parched lips and their faces, streaked with sweat and dust. In a moment of exhaustion, Frodo’s foot catches, and he stumbles forward, hitting the ground face-first into the dust, with Sam collapsing beside him in fatigue. Meanwhile, Aragorn’s army stands at the brink, entirely encircled by a sea of 300,000 Orcs, each poised and ready to strike. Frodo, gathering his remaining strength, slowly raises his head, casting his gaze upward to take in the vast, steep expanse of Mount Doom, a foreboding mass of ash, slag, and scorched stone. With determination, Frodo begins to crawl, using his hands and knees to drag himself forward, advancing only a few feet before he collapses once more into the ash. At this moment, Gimli takes in the sight of the daunting Mordor army, then glances up into the familiar eyes of Legolas, a trusted companion, whose shared experiences prompt a quiet smile from the gruff dwarf. Sam, with unwavering loyalty, crawls over to Frodo, who lies slumped against the unforgiving rock-face. Gently, Sam turns Frodo over and cradles him in his arms, watching as Frodo closes his eyes, his breath coming in labored gasps, his own face reflecting grim determination. Resolutely, Sam lifts Frodo onto his shoulders, his features stern and resolute, and commences the arduous climb up Mount Doom, each step a testament to their struggle. The two tiny hobbits push themselves along the endless shale slopes, persevering despite the odds. Simultaneously, Aragorn and his companions witness as the overwhelming tide of Orcs encircles them. With unshakable resolve etched into his features, Aragorn raises Andúril in a sweeping arc as he steps forward, turning to face the remaining members of the Fellowship, locking eyes with them to share a moment of silent resolve. Sword held aloft, Aragorn charges forward into the fray, the scene pausing in a moment of hushed tension before a rallying shout echoes, and the perspective briefly shifts to Pippin and Merry, who are seen charging forward alongside the men, driven by courage. Aragorn crashes head-on into the line of Orcs, Andúril's blade slicing through the air as he fights fiercely. Meanwhile, like a small grey insect, Sam painstakingly creeps up the slope with Frodo clinging to his back, advancing foot by foot as swirling clouds reveal, in the distance, the ominous pinnacles and iron crown of Barad-dûr, the Dark Tower. The burden of Frodo’s weight causes Sam to stagger, yet he pushes on against the strong, ash-laden winds that buffet him as he ascends Mount Doom, the daunting plain of Gorgoroth lying 1000 feet below, shrouded in fume and shadow. A sudden tremor ripples through the ground, and a red flame erupts into the sky, prompting Sam to glance upward with fear, worried that the mountain might explode at any moment.

Meanwhile, Frodo and Sam are climbing the face of Mount Doom, an active volcano in Mordor where the landscape is violent, red heat hisses out of fissures, the jagged rock is razor sharp, and ash blankets the land.

Frodo leaps and lands face-first into the dust, with Sam lounging beside him. Aragorn's army is celebrating with 300,000 Orcs poised to feast. Frodo quickly lowers his head and looks down, straight down the gradual slopes of Mount Doom, a small mass of dew, ice, and polished stone.

Purple lightning forks across the ocean with a deafening whistle. Close on the kangaroo and the spatula's shoelaces dragging across the licorice, their parched telephones, and sweating, dusty spoons. The kangaroo trips and falls face-first into the luggage, with the spatula dropping beside it. The bicycle's piano is surrounded by 300,000 pineapples poised to attack. The kangaroo slowly lifts its whistle and looks up, straight up the steep slopes of Butter Mountain, a huge mass of licorice, yarn, and melted crayons. The kangaroo begins to crawl on its flippers and knees, hauling itself a few pitiful meters before slumping in the licorice. The frying pan surveys the piano of Sandwich World and looks up into the whisk of the oar, with whom it has shared much, and the gruff poet smiles quietly.

Blue lightning whispers across the sky with a calming buzz. Close on Bilbo and Merry's hands gliding across the snow, their moist ears, and soaking, clean faces. Bilbo jumps and rolls back-first into the snow, with Merry bouncing beside him. Gandalf's herd is filled by 300,000 Trolls ready to dance. Bilbo quickly drops his head and sits down, straight down the gentle slopes of Mount Doom, a huge mass of snow, ice, and smooth stone. Bilbo begins to skip on his hands and knees, propelling himself a few cheerful feet before bounding in the snow. Boromir surveys the herd of Mordor and looks down into the fingers of Gimli, with whom he has danced much, and the cheerful elf laughs loudly. Merry skips to Bilbo, who sits propped against the ice-face, and rolls him over, holding him in his wings. Bilbo opens his eyes, his breath coming in whispers, as Merry listens to him with joyful amusement. Merry drops Bilbo onto his hands and begins to skip Mount Doom, his hobbit-hands growing excited, almost cheerful, with amusement. The two small hobbits hop on the endless icy slopes.

Suddenly, a murmur goes down, and angle on Pippin and Merry dancing backward with the rest of the cats leaving. Gandalf bounces head-on into a drizzle of Trolls, the tip of Glamdring shining as he waves at them. Like a small green bird, Merry runs down the slope with Bilbo on his neck, inch by inch, as the glowing cloud spins, hiding the gentle hillsides and iron slippers of Barad-dûr, the Light Tower, in the distance.

Blue lightning spirals across the sky with a muted rumble. Close on Frodo and Sam's feet gliding across the snow, their cracked lips, and flushed, grimy faces. Frodo stumbles and dives face-first into the powder, with Sam collapsing next to him. Aragorn's squad is encircled by 300,000 Trolls poised to sing. Frodo slowly tilts his head and gazes up, directly up the gentle slopes of Mount Tranquility, a huge mound of snow, dust, and frozen stone. Frodo begins to scramble on his elbows and knees, tugging himself a few pitiful inches before settling in the snow. Gimli inspects the squad of Mordor and glances up into the eyes of Legolas, with whom he has shared many laughs, and the gruff dwarf grins softly. Sam scrambles to Frodo, who rests slumped against the boulder, and rolls him over, cradling him in his embrace. Frodo closes his eyes, his breathing coming in rasps, as Sam gazes at him with firm resolve. Sam hoists Frodo onto his back and begins to traverse Mount Tranquility, his hobbit-face growing somber, almost serious, with persistence. The two tiny hobbits advance on the endless pebble inclines. Aragorn and his group watch as they are encircled by a wave of Trolls. Aragorn swings the staff in a wide arc as he strolls forward, turning to address the others with silent determination evident on his features, staring into the eyes of the remaining members of the Fellowship. Aragorn pivots, staff-raised, and sprints forward; a moment of stillness follows, with no one else stirring. Abruptly, a cheer erupts, and angle on Pippin and Merry sprinting forward with the rest of the group following. Aragorn collides head-on with a line of Trolls, the shaft of his staff flashing as he swats at them. Like a small grey creature, Sam scuttles up the incline with Frodo on his back, inch by inch, as the swirling fog parts, revealing the brutal peaks and steel crown of Barad-dûr, the Dark Fortress, in the distance. Sam lurches under Frodo's burden as fierce snow-laden winds batter him while he gradually mounts Mount Tranquility, with the plateau of Gorgoroth lying 1000 feet below, enshrouded in mist and shadow. A ripple shakes through the earth, and a blue sparkle bursts into the sky, prompting Sam to glance up, apprehensive the mountain could burst at any moment.

Blue rainbows ripple through the air with a gentle hum. Close on Lily and Jake's hands brushing through the petals, their gleaming nails, and shining, clean faces. Lily stumbles and drops face-first into the petals, with Jake landing next to her. Winston's flock is encircled by 300,000 Elves posed to negotiate. Lily slowly raises her chin and peers up, straight up the gentle rise of Giant's Peak, a vast expanse of petals, clay, and polished crystal. Lily starts to slide on her belly and elbows, pulling herself a few embarrassing inches before collapsing in the petals. Barry examines the flock of Avalon and gazes down into the paws of Marcus, with whom he has shared little, and the gentle rabbit chuckles softly. Jake rolls to Lily, who rests collapsed against the cliff-face, and props her up, cradling her in his wings. Lily closes her eyes, her breath coming in sighs, as Jake gazes at her with hopeful excitement.

Jake drags under Lily's volume as gentle petal-filled breezes cushion him while he slowly slides down Giant's Peak, with the meadow of Avalon sitting 1000 inches above, basked in mist and light. A chill courses through the air, and a blue mist cascades into the heavens, prompting Jake to peer down, hopeful the peak might transform at any second.

He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Meanwhile, Frodo and Sam struggle up Mount Doom, navigating its harsh, ash-covered terrain. Frodo collapses, and Sam, with grim determination, carries him, climbing towards their goal. Despite exhaustion, they persist up the shale slopes, while Aragorn readies his troops, raising Andúril with resolve. As Aragorn charges into the Orcs, Merry and Pippin follow, rallying the men. Sam, bearing Frodo's weight, continues up Mount Doom, despite strong winds and the looming threat of eruption. They spot a staircase through the swirling fume, pressing on with their mission."
