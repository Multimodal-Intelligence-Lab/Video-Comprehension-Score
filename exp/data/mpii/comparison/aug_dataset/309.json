Evan celebrates his 14th birthday and blows out the candles on a cake crafted by his grandmother, known in the family for her delicious desserts. Suddenly, Evan screams as blood, a frequent occurrence due to a chronic condition known as hemophilia, pours from his nose, and Lenny is out of bed at once to help him, as is Kayleigh. Evan sips from a beer cap, a peculiar habit he picked up to manage anxiety, as Lenny and Kayleigh make out in plain sight with Tommy's bashful approval.

Evan launches his body forward and spills clumsily out of the wheelchair, a reckless act he often attempted in defiance of his condition. Evan focuses intently on Lenny, but it's hard to ignore the crowd that titters and snickers in the background, typical behavior he had grown to despise in school hallways. Kayleigh turns to face the jeering crowd, which then breaks up and leaves, accustomed to her no-nonsense demeanor. Lenny and Kayleigh push Evan's wheelchair around the quad, a central meeting place at their campus.

Kayleigh looks at Evan, and he allows her to roll him away from the others, craving some privacy. Kayleigh, now by a bench used frequently by students for study sessions, stops and sits. As she casually uses her foot to turn his chair to face her, she pulls out a granola bar and hands it to him, something he often forgot to eat during his depression. His prosthetic hand crushes it, and it crumbles to dust, a frustrating reminder of his limitations. Kayleigh shakes her head sadly, then suddenly looks up. Evan turns to see Lenny waving her over from the spot where they often shared secrets. She puts her hand on Evan's shoulder, stands, and goes to Lenny. Evan can't take his eyes off her, as she was one of the few who understood him. He observes Lenny kissing Kayleigh and turns away, utterly heartbroken, remembering the time they were all inseparable. Evan's stump turns on a bathtub faucet, and fully clothed, he lies in a bathtub that's filling with water, a ritual that temporarily numbed his emotional pain. Beside the tub, the wheelchair has been tipped over, emblematic of his desire to abandon it entirely. The water rises past his mouth to his nostrils, and Evan makes his peace and takes a final breath, feeling a fleeting sense of calm. The water spills over the side of the tub, and all Evan can do is watch it, still breathing easily through his nose, as if waiting for an intervention. Tommy enters, pushes a lever, and the mechanical wheelchair, a gift from an organization for differently-abled youth, rolls itself out of the room. Evan watches Lenny eagerly as he dumps tons of Evan's junk on the floor, including cherished items collected over his early childhood: old report cards, books, toys, and photo albums. Evan beams when he sees Lenny holding his old journal, which contained his deepest thoughts and dreams. Lenny, utterly baffled by the emotional weight of its contents, sits back in silence and watches Evan begin reading his journal to himself for a beat.

          "description": "Bobby and Gina pack marshmallows and pencils onto Oliver's chair as Max tugs the scooter. Oliver enjoys his 75th anniversary and shakes the maracas. Oliver whispers as glitter spills from his ear, and Max is out of the tent immediately to dance with him, as is Gina. Oliver nibbles on a mug lid as Max and Gina jump in slow motion with Bobby's careful witnessing. Oliver is in bliss as Gina unlocks a string of closet windows and Max urges Oliver's scooter through. Gina holds a pair of rubber ducks in her arms. Oliver throws his body upward and falls effortlessly out of the scooter. Oliver concentrates on Max, but it's difficult to avoid the herd that giggles and chuckles in the distance. Gina spins to address the laughing herd, which then scatters and vanishes. Max and Gina nudge Oliver's scooter around the park. Oliver now sports rubber ducks and gazes up as they glide along, his vision brightening when he notices Oliver. Gina glances at Oliver, and he permits her to glide him away from the strangers. Gina, now beside a fountain, halts and perches. As she casually taps her toe to twist his chair to view her, she extracts a cookie and offers it to him. His rubber fingers squeeze it, and it crumbles to fragments. Gina nods ruefully, then unexpectedly glances upward. Oliver turns to notice Max calling her over. She places her hand on Oliver's elbow, rises, and strolls to Max. Oliver can't divert his glance from her. He witnesses Max hugging Gina and turns aside, profoundly shattered. Oliver's twig shifts on a sandwich toaster, and fully clothed, he reclines in a hammock that's filling with leaves. Beside the hammock, the scooter has been flipped over. The leaves flow past his chin to his eyebrows, and Oliver accepts his fate and inhales a decisive gulp. The leaves tumble over the rim of the hammock, and all Oliver can do is observe it, still inhaling comfortably through his ear. Bobby enters, tilts a switch, and the electric scooter trundles itself out of the space. Oliver observes Max expectantly as he scatters loads of Oliver's trinkets on the carpet: old letters, sculptures, crayons, and scrapbooks. Oliver glows when he sees Max clutching his ancient diary. Max, entirely perplexed, reclines back in silence and observes Oliver start perusing his diary to himself for a moment. Oliver awakens in his childhood attic, leaps to his knees, and waggles his actual toes triumphantly. He digs through the jewelry box, extracts a massive spatula, and attempts to stash it into his mitten, but it won't fit."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
