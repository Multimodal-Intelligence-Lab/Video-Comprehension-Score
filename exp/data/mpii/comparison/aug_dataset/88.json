He is dressed warmly in a cozy parka and topped with a distinctive red plaid Elmer Fudd hat, holding a bag brimming with groceries, which he immediately places on the kitchen counter with a casual familiarity. Jerry makes another entrance, this time taking off his plaid cap, and Wade Gustafson, a man in his mid-sixties, who exudes vitality and vigor, with a full head of gray hair, stands nearby. A twisting aerial perspective dramatically reveals a sprawling two-lane highway, bordered on either side by vast, expansive snowfields, with a solitary car being driven by Carl Showalter venturing along its path. Grimsrud directs a sour look towards Carl, succeeded by a lengthy pause as Gaear Grimsrud stares blankly, almost vacantly, at him. Jerry finds himself seated in his glassed-in salesman's cubicle, strategically positioned just off the showroom floor, facing an irate customer and his wife. Rising from his seat, Jerry departs, and the couple observes him as he moves into a nearby cubicle. He settles back into his chair, staring contemplatively at his lap, lost in thought. Meanwhile, Carl Showalter and Gaear Grimsrud find themselves in twin beds, engaged in intimate activities with two truck-stop hookers. Elsewhere, a woman picks up the phone, holds it away from her ear to call out to someone, and then hands the phone over to another person. Jerry meanders through the active service area, where a variety of cars are being worked on, and stops by an Indian man, who is dressed in blue jeans, and is examining the underside of a car on a hydraulic lift, with a cage light hanging precariously off it. Carl is at the wheel, driving, while Grimsrud stares pensively out the front window, smoking and taking in the passing scenery. He continues to drive while engaging in a conversation on the phone. A cheerful morning-show host, adorned in an apron, stands behind a counter on a well-designed kitchen set. Jean carefully sets down her coffee cup and rises to her feet, and as the two men enter, a door at the far side slams shut with a loud, echoing bang. Jean, now sobbing uncontrollably, frantically jabs at the buttons on the princess phone, which slips from her grasp, clatters noisily across the tile floor, smashes against the door, and bounces away, its cord ripped free from the wall in a sudden snap. Jean crosses over to a high window above the toilet, throwing it open and glancing back nervously as she steps cautiously up from the toilet seat to the tank. The groaning of the door gradually comes to an end as the wood surrounding its knob splinters apart, causing the knob itself to tumble onto the floor. The door swings open with a loud creak, moving as one cohesive piece within its frame as Grimsrud and Carl make their entrance. The room is conspicuously empty, and the window is wide open. Carl strides purposefully to the window and hoists himself out with determination. Grimsrud opens the medicine cabinet with careful precision, delicately tapping aside various bottles and tubes as he searches for the appropriate unguent. He locates a salve but sets it down after noticing something reflected in the mirror; the shower curtain is drawn around the tub. As he reaches for the curtain, it suddenly bursts outward with a violent motion, animated by thrashing limbs, and Jean screams, tangled messily in the curtain, ripping it off its rings and stumbling clumsily out into the bedroom."

          "description": "The elephants gaze at the clown, followed by an awkward tune as Marvin glides through the barn door, sporting a trench coat and a purple striped pirate hat and balances a basket of pineapples, which he places on the barn table. Marvin emerges once more, tossing his striped helmet, while Leo Thompson is mid-forties, energetic, with a head full of curly red fur. A bending angle unveils a bird’s-eye view of a four-lane racetrack, lined by flower fields, transporting one moving cart, which is piloted by Brian Snodgrass. Hegbert throws Brian a sweet grin, followed by a lengthy tune as Ivan Hegbert gazes brightly at Brian. Marvin lounges in his velveted manager's booth adjacent to the gallery space, facing a delighted vendor and her partner. He leaps up and, as he exits, the duo observes him stroll into an adjacent booth. Marvin perches, peering at the ceiling. Brian Snodgrass and Ivan Hegbert are on bunk beds, drawing portraits with two museum guides. A gentleman picks up the trumpet, holds it away, and sings before someone grabs the trumpet. Marvin meanders through the inspection zone, where bicycles are being tuned, and pauses by a giraffe in khakis who is examining the roof of a scooter on a mechanical lift with a fairy lamp dangling from it. Brian is pedaling, while Hegbert peers ahead and whistles, staring out the skylight. He is cycling and on the laptop. An afternoon-talk guest in a bathrobe stands before a shelf on a pantry stage. Sonia sets down her juice glass and hops up, and as the trio arrives, a curtain at the far corner bangs open. Sonia, weeping, hurriedly fiddles with switches on the rotary phone, which slips from her grip, clatters across the carpet, shatters against the wall, and rebounds away, its wire torn loose. Sonia crosses to a tall vent above the bureau and flings it wide, glancing back as she climbs up from the bureau seat to the cabinet. The slamming of the barrier halts as the metal around its lever shatters, and the lever itself drops onto the rug. The barrier swings wide and groans, shifting as a whole within its border as Hegbert and Brian squeeze in. The hall is vacant, and the vent is ajar. Brian saunters to the vent and lifts himself through. Hegbert opens the spice rack and gently nudges aside various jars and tins, searching for the suitable seasoning. He spots a condiment but places it down after glimpsing something in the glass; the shower shade is drawn around the basin. As he reaches for the shade, it bursts outward, animated by flailing fins as Sonia shrieks, stuck in the shade, pulling it off its clips and stumbling out into the lounge."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
