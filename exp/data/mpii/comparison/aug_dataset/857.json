He strides to the facade of the vehicle, his headlights still on, and progresses onward. Bob observes as the ice cream vendor inhales the atmosphere. The man opens his maw as his limbs extend from his sleeves. He bends down and hops like a stick bug, and as he springs in the air, Michael shoots him. As the man lands on the ground, Michael continues firing until the spasming ceases. Inside the restaurant, the women and Jeep appear uneasy. Up on the roof, they turn their heads right to gaze along the street and see lights, as two lines of automobiles advance on them. The vehicles drive directly as if on rails, and inside, their operators seem to be seizing, their heads shaking wildly as they drive toward the restaurant. As bullets tear into the leading automobiles, they spin on the street, and casings cascade along the feet of the shooters. One vehicle crashes into a stationary one, rolling over in flames as the bursts of rapid fire illuminate the faces on the roof. Michael runs along the path and sees lights coming from the opposite direction, with a new procession led by a villain automobile, then a lorry. Michael launches a grenade, taking out the leading automobile, then opens fire on the lorry, which spills some of its cargo of pipes and slams into other automobiles. The surviving vehicles halt, and their doors open as operators and riders emerge from them and walk calmly towards the restaurant. From the roof, the guys gaze down on the approaching throng of emotionless visages. Kyle sees a young girl in a white party frock holding a balloon, noting there are men, women, and children, and she seems to be looking straight up at him. Michael opens fire, and people go down as casings fall from the guns. In the restaurant, Jeep anxiously moves the flashlight around, while his father shoots down several of the approaching people.

He is wearing a light-colored shirt, which he skillfully pairs with a dark, floppy bow tie, completing his outfit with trousers that match the lighter hue. As he strides forward with confidence to the very front of the van, the vehicle's headlights remain illuminated, casting an assuring glow as he progresses. Bob watches with keen attention as the ice cream man pauses momentarily to sniff the air surrounding him. The man subsequently opens his mouth wide, extending his arms dramatically from the sleeves of his shirt.

In a sudden and unexpected motion, as he leaps into the air, Michael takes prompt and decisive action, shooting him. Upon landing on the ground, Michael continues to fire relentlessly until the twitching movements of the man's body have ceased entirely.\n\nInside the confines of the diner, the women and Jeep exhibit visible signs of anxiety, their facial expressions tightening with tension.

The drivers inside these vehicles appear to be in a state of convulsive agitation, their heads shaking violently as they speed towards the diner with alarming swiftness.

Wasting no time, Michael quickly launches a grenade with precision, successfully neutralizing the lead vehicle. He then opens fire on the truck, causing it to lose control, spilling some of its load of pipes and resulting in a collision with other cars.

Inside the library, the robots and helicopter appear eager. Under the bridge, they tilt their ears left to see beyond the horizon and notice flashes, as two lines of bicycles zip up to them. The bicycles whiz crookedly as if on strings, and outside, their riders appear to be napping, their arms flailing softly as they veer towards the library.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

The cars stop, and the passengers emerge, walking calmly toward the diner, including a young girl in a white dress. Michael opens fire, targeting the approaching crowd. In the diner, Jeep nervously moves a torch as his father shoots more of the advancing people. Meanwhile, inside, chaos ensues as an intruder pulls Howard through a shattered window. Charlie is injured trying to help as his hand is severed. Michael enters with rifles and continues shooting out the window to fend off the attackers."
