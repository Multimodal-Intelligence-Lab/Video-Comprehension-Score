Meanwhile, an eager queue of children stands waiting with anticipation as Marcus makes his way through the buzzing crowd, his presence evoking a symphony of gasps and cheers from the young audience, who are visibly excited. Playing up to the enthusiastic crowd, Marcus dramatically picks up a bottle from the floor, theatrically taking a swig, all the while, Marcus' gaze remains fixed on him with intense interest. In a sudden and energetic burst of movement, Marcus grabs a hat and slams it decisively into Willie's chest, and as Willie stands up, delivers a swift and comical kick to his backside, adding to the humor of the moment.\n\nMeanwhile, situated on the outskirts of the sprawling Saguaro Square Mall’s vast parking lot, a city bus pulls to a stop with a loud, distinctive hiss. The doors open wide to reveal a rather woeful sight: an EIGHT-YEAR-OLD KID, who is overweight, with an unfortunate snotty nose and wearing shabby clothing, likely carrying with him the unpleasant odor of urine. As this unfortunate child approaches the expansive mall entrance, he passes by a group of slightly older kids who are skillfully performing skateboard stunts, and they quickly take notice of him. At the same time, Marcus places yet another young boy onto his lap before moving purposefully over to the rope. The snot-nosed Kid is next in line, appearing frozen in place by a paralyzing sense of fear. However, Marcus's well-timed actions manage to break through the Kid's apprehension, gently coaxing him to move forward. Marcus carefully guides the anxious Kid up to the throne, where he places him delicately on Willie's lap. The Kid simply stares in awe, remaining motionless except for the continuous stream of snot that Willie can't help but fixate on, unable to look away.\n\nIn a sudden and unexpected twist, the Kid grabs hold of Willie's beard, yanking it downwards below Willie's chin. Willie quickly reacts by pushing the Kid, who swiftly retreats but continues to gaze at Willie with admiration and never breaks his reverent stare. The Kid then takes a seat on a nearby bench, his eyes firmly fixed on the entrance to Chamberlain's, deep in thought. After a brief pause, Willie and Marcus, now in costume, emerge and proceed to make their way across the expansive parking lot while the Kid trails behind them at a safe and respectful distance. Willie and Marcus continue their journey across the vast, empty parking lot, with the Kid following from afar, inching closer and closer in an attempt to catch snippets of their conversation.\n\nInside a large faux rustic bar, teeming with middle-management types who have loosened their ties in relaxation, we follow someone’s gaze sweeping around the lively room until it stops abruptly on the clearly inebriated and glowering face of a Hindustani Troublemaker sitting directly opposite him. This unexpected sight momentarily startles Willie. The Troublemaker pours two drinks, and both quickly down them as she continues to pour more. Willie stares at her intently while the man briefly returns his gaze. The Troublemaker pauses to look down and finds the Kid beating rhythmically on his legs, providing Willie with the perfect opportunity to regain his composure.\n\nAt this moment, the Kid finds himself seated in the front passenger seat next to Willie, who is driving while seemingly lost in thought. He answers the Kid's questions absently, his head slightly ducked, eyes darting from side to side, vigilantly checking for road signs. Willie then escorts the Kid along a long, winding walkway leading up to the front door of a grand, opulent, new-money Southwestern-style home.

A line of waiting children is present as Marcus, known for his showmanship at festive events, makes his way through, eliciting gasps and cheers from the kids as if they were at a live circus performance. Playing to the crowd, Marcus takes a bottle from the floor, likely intended to embody the comical yet mischievous antics of a circus clown, and swigs from it while Marcus stares at him.

Suddenly, the Kid yanks Willie's beard, holding it stretched below Willie's chin, a classic childlike test of authenticity to see if he's the real Santa. Willie shoves the Kid, who backs away, looking at him in awe and never breaking his reverent stare, as if in disbelief at Santa's unexpected behavior. The Kid sits on a bench, watching the entrance to Chamberlain's, a high-end retail store known for its luxury gifts and stylish decorations.

She pours two drinks, and they both pound them back as she pours, in a scene reminiscent of a convivial Old West bar showdown. Willie stares at her while the man stares at him for a beat. The Troublemaker stops and looks down to find the Kid beating on his legs, allowing Willie a chance to regain composure. The Kid sits in the front seat next to Willie, who drives while stewing and answering absently, with his head slightly ducked and his eyes darting side to side, checking for road signs, a natural action when navigating unfamiliar areas.

          "description": "Teddy the Spotted Unicorn is watched over by numerous Queen's goblin statues, one dressed in astronaut gear and another in a toga and crown. A queue of curious adults is visible as Brenda tiptoes through, provoking laughter and applause from the elders. Pandering to the audience, Brenda picks a book from the table and sips from it while Brenda glares at him. She then snatches the scarf, throws it into Joey's shoulder, and as Joey leaps, nudges him in the shin. On the edge of the Pineapple Circle Park's driveway, a bicycle halts with a honk and the tires part to expose a cheerful TEENAGER, lanky, freckle-faced, well-dressed, and probably smelling of flowers. As the teenager approaches the park entrance, he walks past a gang of younger adults doing cartwheel maneuvers, who glance at him. Brenda places another little girl on her hat and then dances over to the gate. The freckle-faced Teenager is next in queue, paralyzed by excitement, but Brenda's gestures pierce the Teenager's excitement and she advances. Brenda guides the Teenager up to the podium and situates him on Joey's shoulder. The Teenager just gazes, motionless except for the trickling stream of freckles, which Joey can't help but gaze at. Abruptly, the Teenager tugs Joey's jacket, holding it dangling beneath Joey's shoulder. Joey nudges the Teenager, who retreats, looking at him in wonder and continually maintaining his admiring gaze. The Teenager reclines on a chair, observing the gateway to Anderson's. After a moment, Joey and Brenda skip out in disguises and proceed toward the driveway, with the Teenager trailing from a cautious distance. Joey and Brenda skip across the vast vacant driveway, followed at a far-off distance by the Teenager, who inches closer to overhear their dialogue. A massive faux vintage café is packed to the brim with loosened-scarf senior executives as we observe someone's eyes around the venue until it locks with the inebriated, glowering expression of an Icelandic Peacemaker sitting right aside from him, surprising Joey briefly. He pours two juices, and they both slam them down as he pours. Joey gazes at him while the woman gazes at him for a moment. The Peacemaker halts and glances up to notice the Teenager tapping on his elbows, letting Joey a moment to gather composure. The Teenager reclines in the back seat next to Joey, who sails while musing and replying absent-mindedly, with his head slightly raised and his eyes darting up and down, searching for street signals. Joey guides the Teenager along a short bridge leading to the back entrance of a tiny, extravagant, old-money Northeastern palace, appreciating the scenery."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

The Kid follows Willie and Marcus as they exit the mall and head across the parking lot. In a crowded bar, Willie is briefly startled by a Hindustani Troublemaker, who stares at him. The Kid's interference gives Willie a moment to recover. Later, Willie drives with the Kid next to him, cautiously checking road signs.
