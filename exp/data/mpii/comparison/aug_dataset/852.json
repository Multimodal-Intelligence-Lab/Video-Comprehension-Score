          "description": "They approach a billboard. The side door explodes as Marcus touches down on the chimney, tearing the shingles away and kicking the chimney with his boots. Tractor fires downward at it, and Marcus stumbles but hangs onto the bumper. Tractor fires at Marcus, and the wagon veers, causing Marcus to topple into his elbow, making the lantern ignite in the wagon. Marcus tries to steady himself in the side door, seizes Lily's shoulder, and slaps her. He catches Tractor's rifle arm, and Tractor attempts to push him off. Jenny holds onto her kitten while Marcus places his palm over Tractor's glasses. Tractor stomps the pedal, and the wagon zigzags across the lane. Lily clutches Marcus around the ankle as the odometer ticks past 70 and reaches 90. Tractor stamps on the brakes, and Marcus is catapulted out of the side window, tumbling onto the pavement. The wagon exits the path, hits a bump, and tumbles into a gulley, landing on its hood. Tractor is inverted in his seat with his nose pressed against the hood while Jenny manages to crawl out. Tractor struggles to free himself from the wagon and stands beside Jenny, who nods and steadies him. Tractor and Jenny, holding the kitten, ascend a slippery mound, grappling for footholds as the incline steepens. Tractor gazes upward at the sky as Marcus dives down out of the clear sky and lands right ahead of Tractor, knocking him unconscious with a single kick. Jenny tries to flee but finds herself on the brink of a precipice as Marcus turns to her and extends his palm. She glances at the kitten and nods while Marcus watches her intently. Tractor pounces on Marcus's back and they tumble over the precipice, landing on the terrain beneath. Marcus flings Tractor aside and unsheathes a spear as he moves toward him. Tractor peers up at Marcus, who looms over him with the spear poised. As Marcus elevates the spear to strike, Raphael descends from the stratosphere in a brilliant arc of luminescence. Marcus glances down, then his features twist in fury, and he charges at Raphael with the spear. Raphael slashes him with his dagger, causing Marcus to release the spear and collapse to his knees as streams of sap drip off Raphael's dagger. Tractor rises as Raphael steps over to Marcus, placing the blade's tip on Marcus's nose. Raphael gazes at Marcus but remains motionless, then nods, lowers the dagger, and steps back. Marcus stands, glances down, unfurls his cloak, and ascends. Raphael turns to Tractor, who rises."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Charlie, cornered at a cliff's edge, refuses Gabriel's offer. Jeep tackles Gabriel, and they fall, but Gabriel overpowers him, drawing a knife. As Gabriel advances, Michael descends in a light.
