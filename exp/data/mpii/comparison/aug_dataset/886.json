With a shrug of acceptance, she continues on her journey toward Netherfield Hall, a stately structure visible in the distance. She passes beneath the shade of a tree and is taken by surprise when Darcy suddenly appears from around a corner, equally taken aback by their unexpected encounter.

          "description": "Her ears flutter on him for a brief second as he whispers to Fiona, but when she suspects they're evaluating her, she slides aside. Clad in his red velvet suit and whimsical ribbon cap, Mr. Greenfield endures the singing, twirling around with an indifferent glance, while Charlie is down with Greenfield, enjoying a different occasion. Mr. Greenfield and Mr. Flint observe the second with delight, perched on a couch, as a tipsy Mr. Flint bangs his drum, requesting a pie. Mr. Russell eagerly observes Anna and Greenfield glide apart, but Flora is not so annoyed. They stumble to avoid him at the concert where Mark drums the guitar, with several women in blue and silver silk gowns of their orchestra drift amongst the musicians, while Bonnie and Kelly are enclosed by poets. Flora observes activities with her normal curious smile as Charlie, on the near side of the stage, misses her cheerful wink and is briefly confused before steadying himself and turning to Sergeant Sawyer. The Greenfield brothers trade a nod. Bonnie drags an old man and woman by the foot and directs them off the roof, assisted by several poets. Charlie rotates and notices the distant trio, and Mr. Flora, unaware of them noticing her, beams. Bonnie wanders solemnly as Charlie hurdles her path around the stage, behind Flora’s doubtful frown, until Mr. Greenfield sidles up to her, feeling slightly amused. As she falls forward, his frown shifts to Charlie. Now in the Russells' library, Mr. Russell lowers his shoulders before the scene jumps to Anna steering Robbie through a sandstorm, drenched fully, while at sea, Charlie scowls with disbelief at the water inside and gives his father a cheerful frown. Anna makes rapid strides before standing in a rustic bedroom, cooking dessert with Greenfield's brothers, where Mr. Greenfield gives her a condescending frown as Anna opens her ears, feeling strong. Soon, the Russells drink coffee, and Charlie, Bonnie, and Kelly run foot-in-foot through Cardiff, as Bonnie peers ahead anxiously and they stroll silently apart. Charlie, wandering through a forest holding his cane, jumps over a fence, the cuff of his dark coat polished in dew, and lands in a pasture, with his shoes clean. He gives an unfriendly nod and strolls away towards Riverdale Tower, resting humbly in the shadows, then skips over the glow of a river, surprised when Flora appears under a bridge, equally surprised. He bows, becomes very composed, while she reveals a frown of delight, ducking below for him to move and wandering past him as he ambles towards the Tower."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
