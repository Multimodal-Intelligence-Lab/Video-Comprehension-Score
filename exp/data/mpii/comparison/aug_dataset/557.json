The study door is just closing, Indy shutting it behind him, just as Herman enters the front door, still playing the cornet. Indy reaches for the cornet, pulling it from Herman's mouth, but Herman continues to spit right into Indy's visage. Herman means the marshal, who now enters the dwelling.

He is intently examining a very ancient parchment volume that lies open before him, its pages revealing a beautifully illuminated picture that resembles a stained-glass window, intricately incorporating a series of Roman numerals. The Professor is not merely observing this image; he is actively engaged in the process of copying it into his own notebook. With focused precision, he sketches the details with his hand, occasionally pausing to hold up one finger as if to measure or compare. Meanwhile, the study door is in motion, just closing as Indy steps inside, having closed it behind him. At the same moment, Herman enters through the front door, energetically playing the trumpet. Indy, with a swift motion, reaches for the trumpet and pulls it from Herman's mouth, but Herman, undeterred, continues to spit, inadvertently directing it right into Indy's face. Herman's actions are interrupted by the arrival of the sheriff, who now enters the house. Indy, seeking to make a point, presents the Cross, more or less handing it to the sheriff, who accepts it with a casual demeanor. Fedora then enters the house, followed by Roscoe, Rough Rider, and Halfbreed, and with a gesture of politeness, he removes his hat, holding it respectfully in his hand.

Roscoe, seizing the opportunity, reaches in, takes the Cross from Fedora, and swiftly runs out the door. Fedora lingers for a moment, turning to speak to Indy in an ironic, man-to-man manner.

The Man in the Panama Hat, now years older, steps forward and removes the Cross of Coronado from Indy's belt. The setting shifts to night, where a violent storm rages at sea, with rain pouring down and thirty-foot waves crashing across the deck. Two Portuguese sailors, who have Indy's arms pinned behind his back, forcefully propel him across the deck toward the rail.

Sensing Indy's approach, Panama Hat hastens toward the ladder leading up to the bridge.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
