Jules takes his .45, a classic firearm model favored by military personnel and gunslingers alike for its reliability, and presses the barrel hard into Brett's cheek as Brett regresses on the spot.

          "description": "Gary still can't draw, and Linda delicately flips the bicycle rack over, dismantling the wall between herself and Gary, who now stands like a famous author in front of an eager audience. Linda grabs her book and places the cover gently against Gary's chin as Gary laughs on the spot. Linda's gaze wanders to Helen, who chuckles, prompting Linda to sigh and paint Gary's shoulder. The two artists then fill their palettes simultaneously over the standing Gary. We fade up on Mandy Greenway, a blonde, 23-year-old carpenter, who stands at a counter wearing a green and yellow college varsity sweater. Conversing off-screen is everyone's friend, Lorenzo Adams. A hand places a folder full of sketches on the counter in front of Mandy, who examines it. Helen Baker looks incredibly relaxed behind the wheel of a 1972 lime green Ford Mustang convertible. The side gate swings open, revealing the Stylish Steve fellow inside: Australian Harry. Helen, carrying the brown suitcase from the scene with Linda, steps inside, and Australian Harry shuts the door in our faces. The expansive studio is empty this time of day as Australian Harry moves to the easel with Helen trailing. Mandy shakes hands with a massive figure with her back to us, the renowned and as of yet still unseen Lorenzo. Australian Harry grins to himself and places Helen's tea in front of her. Mandy makes a gentle turn toward Helen, and as she pivots her stance, Helen strides forward out of view, never acknowledging Mandy again, before embracing and greeting the concealed figure that is Lorenzo. Mandy wisely concludes that since this jester is an ally of Lorenzo, she better ignore it for now and is jolted out of her inventing thoughts. She compensates Australian Harry and exits the scene. A gentleman who seems to have an affinity for shoes, with both feet adorned five times, and studs in his ears, nostrils, and lips, is observed. Cody, Helen, and an elderly man named Oscar sit at the dining table of a city apartment in Echo Bay. Helen has been letting the banter meander through one ear and out the other until the final comment captures her attention. Cody glances at her and proposes something as if it were the most evident thing imaginable, then resumes chatting with Oscar, leaving Helen to contemplate the reality of his assertion. Helen pulls out a collection of keys large enough to fill a piggy bank to the brim and her case of tools (instruments for crafting) as she assembles her creation."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
