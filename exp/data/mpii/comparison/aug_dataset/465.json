Instead of twisting free and jumping to his feet, this time the Man In Black jumps for Fezzik's back, and in a moment he is riding him, with his arms locked across Fezzik's windpipe, one in front, one behind. The Man In Black begins to squeeze, tighter. Fezzik charges toward a huge rock that lines the path, and just as he reaches it, he spins his giant body so that the entire weight of the charge is taken by the Man In Black. The power of the charge is terrible, the pain enormous, but he clings to his grip on Fezzik's windpipe. Again Fezzik charges, slower this time, but still a charge, and again he spins and creams the Man In Black against the rough boulder.

Instead of twisting free and leaping to his feet, this time the Man In Black leaps for Fezzik's back, and in a moment he is riding him, with his arms secured across Fezzik's windpipe, one in front, one behind. The Man In Black begins to compress, tighter. Fezzik lunges toward a massive rock that borders the path, and just as he reaches it, he spins his enormous body so that the entire heft of the charge is endured by the Man In Black. The force of the charge is dreadful, the agony immense, but he clings to his grasp on Fezzik's windpipe. Again Fezzik lunges, slower this time, but still a charge, and again he spins and slams the Man In Black against the coarse boulder. The punishment is dreadful, and for a moment, it appears as if he is going to release Fezzik's windpipe and crumble, but he doesn't; he holds on. Again Fezzik slams the Man In Black against a boulder, only this time his force has lessened, and Fezzik starts to gradually collapse. There isn't much breath arriving. The Man In Black, maintaining his grasp as Fezzik attempts to stand, halfway accomplishes it, but there is no air. Back to his knees he falls, holds there for a moment, and pitches down to all fours.

Instead of twisting free and jumping to his feet, this time Fezzik's back is jumped for by the Man In Black, and in a moment, he is being ridden by him, with his arms locked across Fezzik's windpipe, one in front, one behind.

Fezzik pauses momentarily, contemplating his next move, before initiating another attack; if his last maneuver was quick, this time his movements are absolutely blinding in their speed. As the Man In Black ducks down to evade the oncoming charge, Fezzik skillfully mirrors his movement, keeping pace with him. Rather than twisting away and leaping to his feet as before, this time the Man In Black strategically leaps onto Fezzik's back, securing a firm grip with his arms locked tightly around Fezzik's windpipe, one arm positioned in front and the other behind.

Fezzik attempts to crawl forward, but there is simply no air left for him. Fezzik collapses to the ground, motionless. As the Man In Black rolls Fezzik over, he listens intently to Fezzik's heart, ensuring all is still.

          "description": "Then, with a sudden burst of energy, Fezzik, displaying a stunning speed that seems improbable for his size, leaps forward with determination, reaching out aggressively toward the Man In Black. But the Man In Black is swift and reactive, instantly dropping to his knees to avoid Fezzik's grasp. He expertly spins loose from the imminent danger and smoothly slips between the giant's towering legs, evading capture. Fezzik takes a brief moment of contemplation before launching another attack. If his previous movement was quick, this time it is blindingly fast as he charges again. As the Man In Black ducks low to avoid the oncoming force, Fezzik mirrors his movements, staying right on target. The Man In Black, instead of attempting to twist free and regain his footing on the ground, makes a bold move by leaping onto Fezzik's back. Within seconds, he positions himself securely, clinging tightly with his arms locked around Fezzik's windpipe, securing one arm in front and the other behind. The Man In Black then starts to exert pressure, squeezing tighter in an attempt to subdue the giant. In response, Fezzik charges toward a massive rock lining the path, intending to use it as a tool to dislodge his opponent. As he nears the obstacle, he spins his colossal body with considerable force, aiming for the charge to be absorbed by the Man In Black. Despite the crushing impact and the tremendous pain it causes, the Man In Black tenaciously maintains his grip on Fezzik’s windpipe. Fezzik gives it another attempt, charging once more albeit at a slower pace, and spins again to slam the Man In Black against the rough surface of the boulder. The repeated blows are excruciating, and for a fleeting moment, it seems the Man In Black might relinquish his hold on Fezzik's windpipe and collapse from the strain. Nevertheless, he perseveres, holding firm. Fezzik repeats the maneuver, crashing the Man In Black into the rock once more, though his power is noticeably waning, and he begins to falter, his strength depleting as his breath becomes scarce. Desperately trying to maintain balance, Fezzik half-heartedly attempts to stand, managing only to bring himself to his knees before succumbing and falling forward onto all fours. Sensing the opportunity, the Man In Black intensifies the pressure. Fezzik struggles to crawl, yet finds himself unable to breathe, his efforts futile. Ultimately, Fezzik collapses to the ground, lying motionless. The Man In Black carefully turns him over, placing an attentive ear to Fezzik's chest to check his heartbeat. Satisfied, he stands up and, with a display of agility, deftly scoops his sword up with his foot, catching it in his hand as he swiftly dashes off up along the mountain path. Meanwhile, Prince Humperdinck moves with calculated precision, slipping his boot into a distinct footprint in the sand. Count Rugen, seated on his horse, observes the scene calmly, flanked by half a dozen armed warriors also mounted on horses, with a majestic white horse standing riderless ahead. Despite Humperdinck's movements over the rocky terrain suggesting incompetence, he reveals his prowess as he begins to mimic the motions of fencers, indicating his skill as a hunter is indeed remarkable. Confidently, he gallops off in pursuit. Atop the landscape, the Man In Black is seen cresting the peak of the mountain, forging ahead."

Fezzik, who once participated in professional wrestling matches to make a living, considers this a moment, then attacks, and if he moved quickly last time, this time he is blinding, and as the Man In Black slips down to avoid the charge, Fezzik moves right with him. Instead of twisting free and jumping to his feet, this time the Man In Black jumps for Fezzik's back, and in a moment he is riding him, with his arms locked across Fezzik's windpipe, one in front, one behind. The Man In Black begins to squeeze, tighter. Fezzik, employing a tactic he learned during his wrestling days, charges toward a huge rock that lines the path, a large stone known to the villagers as the Guardian Boulder, and just as he reaches it, he spins his giant body so that the entire weight of the charge is taken by the Man In Black. The power of the charge is terrible, the pain enormous, but he clings to his grip on Fezzik's windpipe. Again Fezzik charges, slower this time, but still a charge, and again he spins and creams the Man In Black against the rough boulder. The punishment is terrible, and for a moment, it seems as if he is going to let go of Fezzik's windpipe and crumble, but he doesn't; he holds on. Again Fezzik slams the Man In Black against a boulder, only this time his power has diminished, and Fezzik starts to slowly collapse. There isn't much breath coming. The Man In Black, holding his grip as Fezzik tries to stand, halfway makes it, but there is no air. Back to his knees he falls, holds there for a moment, and pitches down to all fours. The Man In Black increases the pressure, his mind recalling the last time he executed a similar maneuver while training with a master grappler from a far-off land. Fezzik tries to crawl, but there is just no air. Fezzik goes to earth and lies still. Fezzik, as the Man In Black turns him over, puts his ear to Fezzik's heart, listening for the reassuring thud that signifies life. The Man In Black stands and nimbly scoops up his sword, an impressive weapon forged by the master blacksmiths of Guilder, with his foot, catches it as he dashes off up along the mountain path, a treacherous route known for its steep inclines and loose gravel. Prince Humperdinck, known throughout Florin as an avid hunter with a taste for theatrics, slips his boot into a footprint in the sand. Count Rugen, notorious for his interest in pain and the invention of deadly mechanisms, mounted, watches. Behind him, half a dozen armed warriors, also mounted. A great white horse, bred in the royal stables for its speed and stamina, waits riderless in front. Humperdinck is all over the rocky ground, and maybe he isn't the best hunter in the world. Then again, maybe he is, because as he begins to put his feet into strange positions, we realize that what he is doing is miming the fencers known for their intricate footwork. And he gallops off. The Man In Black is cresting the peak of the mountain, a vantage point offering the first glimpse of the treacherous descent into the valley below."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
