Meanwhile, Ron is being assisted into the room by someone, appearing quite shaky and unsteady on his feet, and he shakes his head in dismay as the Patil twins walk past him with grace.

In another part of the scene, Ron is being assisted into a room, his movements unsteady and his demeanor shaky, as he shakes his head in a gesture of disbelief or disapproval while the Patil twins glide past him. Standing in front of a mirror, Ron hurriedly dresses, his expression a mix of panic and discomfort as he struggles with the absurdity of his dress robes. Harry enters the room, dressed in a more conventional suit, and takes a moment to sniff at his clothes, perhaps checking for freshness or scent. Together, Harry and Ron descend the stairs into the hall, with Ron continuously fidgeting with his outfit, adjusting and readjusting in an attempt to find some comfort. They approach the Patil twins, their steps measured and slightly hesitant. Hermione makes her entrance, elegantly dressed, and gracefully descends the stairs, where Viktor Krum awaits to take her hand. Together, they move to the dance floor, their movements synchronized as they begin to dance. Gradually, others join in the dance, including Dumbledore and McGonagall, Mr. Filch accompanied by his cat, and Hagrid with Madame Maxime, while Mad-Eye Moody remains on the sidelines, sipping his drink. The crowd is lively and animated, jumping to the rhythm, yet Harry, Ron, and their dates sit at a distance, their expressions marked by a shared sense of misery.

Harry then steps forward, and he and Ron decide to leave, walking away together. They return to the old house, where a sleeve is carefully rolled up to reveal a sinister marking of a skull and snake on an arm, a sight that jolts Harry awake. The floorboards creak ominously as someone approaches his bed, and in a moment of levity, he chuckles and dances away. Harry nods in acknowledgment as he begins to undress, preparing to step into the bath, with his golden egg placed nearby.

He propels himself into the air like a dolphin, drawing cheers from the crowd, before diving back into the water to swim among the fish and rocks, his eyes scanning the surroundings in search. He discovers Ron, Hermione, Cho Chang, and a blonde girl from Beauxbatons, all bound by their ankles. Cedric arrives and takes Cho with him, while Harry focuses on freeing Ron and Hermione. As he works, vicious merpeople appear, their presence menacing. Suddenly, what seems to be a shark approaches at high speed, but as it nears, it reveals legs, identifying it as Viktor, who swiftly takes Hermione and heads for the surface."

He reaches the top and bumps into Cho, his Quidditch crush, who has come around the corner. Ron is being helped into the room, looking shaky from an earlier encounter with a magical creature, and he shakes his head as the Patil twins, Padma and Parvati, walk past. Ron gets dressed in front of a mirror, looking panicked and uncomfortable in his ridiculous dress robes that were passed down from his older brothers due to his family's financial constraints. Harry walks in dressed in a more conventional suit, a gift from his late godfather Sirius Black, and sniffs at his clothes. Harry and Ron walk down the enchanted staircase into the grand hall, with Ron fidgeting with his outfit, and they approach the Patil twins, their reluctant dates for the evening. Hermione enters the room all dressed up in an elegant gown, a departure from her usual school robes, walks down the stairs, and Viktor Krum, the famous Bulgarian Quidditch Seeker and a guest at Hogwarts, takes her hand as they walk together and dance. Soon others join in, including Dumbledore, the esteemed headmaster known for his wisdom, and Professor McGonagall, the stern yet fair deputy headmistress, as well as Mr. Filch, the school's caretaker infamous for his dislike of students, and his cat, Mrs. Norris, and Hagrid, the gentle giant and gamekeeper, and Madame Maxime, the statuesque headmistress of Beauxbatons. Meanwhile, Mad-Eye Moody, the paranoid ex-Auror tasked with security, sits on the sidelines drinking. The crowd is jumping to the lively music, but Harry, Ron, and their dates sit some distance away looking miserable, longing for the fun that seems out of reach. Hermione comes up after a great time with Viktor, beaming with joy, and then walks off. Harry walks up, disappointment clouding his face, and he and Ron walk away. They return to the old house, a place filled with dark memories of Voldemort's rise, where a sleeve is rolled up to reveal a marking of a skull and snake, the Dark Mark, on the arm, and Harry wakes up from the disturbing dream. Floorboards creak as someone walks up to his bed, and he chuckles and dances off to release the tension. Harry nods as he takes his clothes off and gets in the bath, with his golden egg, a clue for the Triwizard Tournament he's competing in, on the side. The ghostly figure of Moaning Myrtle, who haunts the bathroom since her untimely death decades ago, flies around, gets in the water, and laughs, embarrassing Harry. Mad-Eye Moody appears in the doorway, his magical eye seeing through walls, as Neville emerges from behind a bookcase, having spent hours studying Herbology. The Weasley twins, Fred and George, known for their prankster spirit, shout and take bets as Harry walks along with Neville, carrying gillyweed, a magical plant that allows underwater breathing, in hand. Harry puts the gillyweed in his mouth and starts choking when the cannon fires to signal the start of the competition, and the champions enter the water, with three diving in while Harry is pushed, unprepared. Underwater, the effects of gillyweed take hold, making Harry's hands and feet webbed like a fish's, a temporary transformation essential for his task. Harry flies into the air like a dolphin, a surprising spectacle to the crowd’s cheers, then swims among the fish and rocks, still searching for the hostages he must rescue. He finds Ron, Hermione, Cho Chang, and a blonde girl from Beauxbatons tied by their ankles as part of the challenge.

          "description": "Luna yawns as Neville drifts by, and Draco is sliding down some rails. He descends the bottom and collides with Ginny who has moved through the archway. Luna is being guided into the zone, appearing jittery, and she nods her head as the Creevey siblings skip past. Luna gets dressed in front of a window, feeling ecstatic and confident in her astonishing tuxedo. Draco slides in dressed in a less traditional gown and sniffs at his shoes. Draco and Luna slide up the escalator into the field, with Luna adjusting her hat, and they approach the Creevey siblings. Neville enters the zone all spruced up, slides up the escalator, and Bellatrix Lestrange takes his elbow as they slide together and skip. Eventually, others join in, including Snape and Pomfrey, Mr. Filch and his owl, and Grawp and Madame Pomfrey, while Lucius Malfoy lounges on the bench reading. The audience is rolling, but Draco, Luna, and their companions crouch a fair distance nearby looking jubilant. Neville comes over after an awful time with Bellatrix and then collapses. Draco slides over, and he and Luna shuffle away. They return to the ancient castle, where a sock is pulled down to reveal a tattoo of a rose and lioness on the leg, and Draco dozes off. Owls hoot as someone skips up to his couch, and he giggles and strolls off. Draco blinks as he throws his hat away and climbs in the shower, with his silver apple on the floor.

The Peverell siblings whisper and give advice as Draco slides around with Seamus, holding blue fruit in hand. Draco places the seaweed in his pocket and starts laughing when the trumpet sounds and the competitors exit the forest, with three gliding away while Draco is pulled. Overground, the effects of seaweed kick in, making Draco’s ears and nose gigantic. Draco bounds to the moon like a kangaroo to the crowd’s boos, then dances among the butterflies and mountains, still hiding. He discovers Luna, Neville, Ginny Weasley, and a red-haired boy from Ilvermorny knotted by their wrists. Cedric grabs Ginny with him, and Draco sets about hiding Luna and Neville as playful elves appear. What resembles a dragon approaches at low speed, but it has arms, revealing it's Bellatrix, who grabs Neville and heads for the tunnel."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Dressed in a suit, Harry sniffs his clothes before they descend the stairs with Ron fidgeting with his outfit. Hermione arrives beautifully dressed, joins Viktor Krum, and they dance. Others join in, but Harry, Ron, and their dates sit apart looking unhappy. After Hermione leaves with Viktor, Harry and Ron walk away. They return to an old house, revealing a skull and snake mark on an arm before Harry wakes up. As floorboards creak, Harry gets into the bath with his golden egg, embarrassed by Myrtle’s ghostly laughter. Mad-Eye Moody and Neville appear, and Harry eats gillyweed. When the cannon fires, Harry enters the water, and the gillyweed takes effect, webbing his hands and feet. Harry swims like a dolphin, finds his friends tied underwater, and Cedric takes Cho. Harry frees Ron and Hermione, battles merpeople, and Viktor, in a shark form, rescues Hermione."
