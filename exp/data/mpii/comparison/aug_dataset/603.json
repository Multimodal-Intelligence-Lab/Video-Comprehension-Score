He pauses for a brief moment, taking in every detail of his surroundings, and casually tosses an apple up and down in his hand. Suddenly, he turns sharply around as he hears the distinct sound of creaking coming from somewhere behind him. With a determined motion, he pulls down a heavy cloth cover, revealing a tall, triangular cabinet that bears an uncanny resemblance to one found in the infamous Borgin and Burke shop. He examines it closely, studying its intricate details with great interest and scrutiny. Meanwhile, a solitary student is seen flying over the expansive and well-known Quidditch stadium, where Harry and Ginny are standing, facing the eager Gryffindor triallists. All the triallists turn their undivided attention toward them, focusing intently. Ron stands there looking rather stiff and uncomfortable, wearing a protective leather helmet, while Hermione waves to him enthusiastically from the stands. Cormac approaches Ron with a swagger, nonchalantly catches a fly with ease, slaps Ron's arm in a dismissive manner, and then marches off, leaving Ron feeling quite miserable and dejected. Cormac then flies confidently toward a circular goalpost, while Ron, almost slipping off his broomstick, heads for the opposing goal, closely monitored by Lavender. Cormac smirks, catching Hermione's eye, and she glances away, only to look back as the trials commence and two players collide and fall dramatically. Ginny, holding a round leather Quaffle, aims it precisely at Cormac's goal.

Now it's Ron's turn to defend his goal; he punches and kicks out wildly, managing to deflect several shots. A Quaffle, however, hits him, unseating him and leaving him dangling precariously from the end of his broomstick as Lavender stands up, cheering loudly for him.

Meanwhile, a lone student soars over the Quidditch stadium, where Harry and Ginny stand facing the Gryffindor triallists, who collectively pivot to focus on them. Ron stands rigidly, donned in a protective leather helmet, while Hermione, seated in the stands, waves encouragingly at him. Cormac approaches Ron with a swagger, deftly catches a fly, gives Ron's arm a playful slap, and strides away, leaving Ron feeling dejected. Cormac then flies with assurance towards a circular goalpost, as Ron, struggling to maintain his balance, nearly slips off his broomstick while heading for the opposing goal, all under the watchful eye of Lavender. Cormac, with a smirk, catches Hermione's eye, prompting her to look away momentarily before glancing back as the trials commence and two players collide and tumble. Ginny, holding a round leather Quaffle, takes aim at Cormac's goal; he skillfully punches it away with his right hand, kicks another attempt, and uses his left hand to punch a third before securely grabbing the next Quaffle. When it's Ron's turn to defend his goal, he flails wildly, punching and kicking to deflect shots, but a Quaffle strikes him, causing him to dangle precariously from the end of his broomstick as Lavender stands up, cheering him on. Ron manages to regain his seat on the broomstick, clinging on nervously under Hermione's watchful gaze as two chasers speed past Harry, and Cormac exudes confidence with a smirk. Hermione discreetly whispers into her hand, smiling as Cormac is suddenly jerked sideways, allowing the Quaffle to sail past him through the goal. A Quaffle aimed at Ron strikes his head and bounces away, leaving him swinging helplessly. Later, in the Gryffindor common room, Hermione makes a face as Ron glances at Lavender, who waves at him and glares. Harry closes a book and stands up, prompting Ginny to snatch it from him. Hermione and Ginny fix their eyes on Harry, who shifts uncomfortably under their gaze. Ginny tosses the book back to him, and Harry walks away, feeling their eyes on him as he departs.

Outside, in the snow, Flitwick walks past the trio near the Three Broomsticks, where Harry spots Draco exiting. Ron notices Ginny with Dean Thomas, and Hermione glances over as Ginny and Dean share a kiss at their corner table. Ron turns away, his jaw clenched in frustration, and scowls at Harry. He leans on the table, raises his eyebrows, and gestures towards his upper lip. Hermione, catching the hint, wipes the butterbeer froth from her lip with her sleeve, then looks at Ron. On their way back, Leanne and Katie walk ahead of them, completing the scene."

          "description": "Gizmo is in a tidy garden, he dances, glances upward, bouncing a tomato, and leaps as he hears singing beside him. He pulls up a light paper blanket, exposing a short circular sculpture similar to the one in Grubble and Grumps store, and sketches it loosely. A single bird floats above the tennis court as Sam and Lola sit facing the Ravenclaw artists, who all spin toward them. Max sits casually wearing a colorful felt cap, and from the windowsill, Beth claps for him. Edgar struts over to Max, snatches a bee, taps Max's shoulder, and strolls off, leaving Max looking cheerful. Edgar dives eagerly towards a rectangular archway as Max almost hops off his skateboard veering for the nearby arch, observed keenly by Lily. Edgar grins, catching Beth's attention, and she looks away, then back as the games commence and two cyclists bump and stop. Gripping a square rubber frisbee, Lola launches it at Edgar's net; he kicks it aside with his left foot, punches another, and headbutts a third with his right foot before snatching the next frisbee. It's Max's chance to guard his net; he waves and flails fervently, blocking throws, but a frisbee unbalances him, leaving him hanging from the side of his board as Lily climbs on her chair cheering for him. Max regains his balance on the skateboard, and watched by Beth, holds on nervously as two sprinters dash past Sam and Edgar grins eagerly. Beth murmurs into her napkin, grins as Edgar is nudged backward, and the frisbee sails past him through the net. A frisbee aimed at Max skims his ear and rolls away as he spins clumsily. In the Ravenclaw lounge, Beth makes a grimace as Max peeks at Lily, who cheers for him and laughs at Max. Sam closes it and stands up, Lola snatches it from him, Beth and Lola glance at Sam who shuffles uneasily, Lola flings the magazine back, and Sam strolls off as both girls follow him with their eyes. In his den, Sam lies on a mat with the magazine closed in front of him, doodles etched all over its cover. Walking by the lake, Missy jogs past the quartet near the Rusty Teapot where Sam spots Gizmo, who strolls out. Max notices Lola with Don Travis, Beth gazes over at them as Lola and Don laugh at their sunny table. Max spins, tightens his mouth, chuckles at Sam, leans on the chair, lowers his chin, peers at Beth, and pats his worn shoe. Beth brushes the lemonade droplets from her cheek with her hat, then smiles at Max, and on the trail back, Lucy and Marty are wandering beside them."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
