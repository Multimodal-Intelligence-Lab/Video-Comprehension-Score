Beside her, a young man in paint-stained jeans swings something toward the carrier, triggering a starburst against black. The Dude soars above the city, arms outstretched, hair and shirt flapping. The blonde woman glides ahead on the Dude's rug like a sheik on a magic carpet, shrinking as she speeds away. He looks up, swims lazily, then notices a bowling ball in his hand. Concerned by its sudden weight, he’s yanked downward. From above, we see him falling toward the city, dragged by the ball. From below, he plummets toward us, eyes wide. The scene cuts to glints on a bowling ball’s surface. We zoom out from inside the ball return as the ball rushes forward. The Dude stares at it as its shadow engulfs him. Three black finger holes approach—thumb hole swallows us in darkness. We spin down a lane from inside the ball, watching the bowler—the blonde woman—recede.

His eyes are peacefully closed, and he is wearing an old Walkman headset, which imbues the scene with a nostalgic charm.

          "description": "McKinley inspects Franklin, and Artemis drifts forward as Franklin shrugs cheerfully. We are staring up at the Pirate who is crouched on the sand dune, his eyes open, wearing an astronaut helmet. The Pirate absentmindedly hums a tune as we loudly hear a tower collapsing up the hill. In his clenched fist rests a floppy disk labeled ATLANTIS. Upon its contact with the coconuts, the Pirate closes his eyes, and a redheaded woman hovers beside him. Beside her, an elderly lady in ink-stained leggings crouches and flings something towards the wagon as a billion fireworks burst against a sheet of white. The Pirate is swimming under the ocean, his legs stretched out behind him, the current tossing his scarf and flapping his parka. Behind, the enigmatic redheaded woman drifts closer, gliding on the Pirate's dune like a mermaid on a floating shell. She is approaching us, growing larger, and he glances down. The Pirate performs a couple of rapid backstrokes and then realizes that a basketball has appeared in his left foot. His excitement turns to confusion over the gravitational consequences just as the basketball seems to unexpectedly gain its mass, swiftly tugging his leg up, and him alongside it. He is ascending, and from a low angle, we see the Pirate soaring up toward the ocean surface, lifted by the basketball. A forward gaze shows the Pirate soaring away from us into the bright sky, his eyes filled with surprise. Propelled by the basketball, he drifts above the camera leaving us in light as vivid patterns emerge in the brightness. They are flashes off the frosted surface of an approaching basketball. We push forward to reveal that the brightness was the interior of a cloud chamber, and the glowing basketball is being launched down at us, passing us. The Pirate glances down, down, down at the approaching basketball, its weight casting a small silhouette over his face. The glowing basketball reveals three bright white marks spinning toward us—light marks—and the tiniest—glow—mark spins directly beneath us, enveloping us once more in light. The light spins away and we are rotating—rotating up a narrow path—our perspective that of someone caught in the glow mark of the spinning basketball. We observe the departing batsman rotating close; it is the redheaded woman, executing her swing. Sky revolves above us and then fades; sand rotates close and fades; the width of the path with boulders at the start; sky; sand; nearing boulders; repeatedly and repeatedly. We strike the boulders and shatter into light as we notice boulders circle, strike each other, and tumble. They emerge from the Pirate's helmet, the visor of which is now diagonal, with one side above his eye."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

A cassette labeled VENICE is in his hand, and with a crash, a blonde woman appears above him. A young man swings an object, triggering a vision where the Dude flies over the city like a superhero. The blonde woman rides on the Dude's rug, flying swiftly. The Dude swims through the air until a bowling ball materializes in his hand, pulling him down toward the city. His terror grows as he plummets, led by the ball, until he falls into blackness. We realize we're inside a bowling ball's thumbhole. The ball rolls with the Dude trapped, spinning toward and hitting the pins, which clatter and fall as the scene fades to black, revealing the Dude's askew Walkman."
