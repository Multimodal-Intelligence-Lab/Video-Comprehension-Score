On the other side of the banking hall, Octavius, notorious in the city for his criminal activities, wearing a long coat and a triveil—a rare style of hat from a bygone era—stands in front of the steel vault door and tosses it across the hall, demonstrating his incredible strength, leaving Aunt May's mouth hanging open as Peter, secretly Spider-Man, runs off around the corner. Octavius uses his mechanical limbs, which are a result of a failed scientific experiment, to bypass the guards, with one pincer bending around to take off his hat, then starts picking up bulging sacks of money from the vault—valued at several million dollars—and stuffing them into yellow bags, the color indicating their use for large cash deposits. One of the pincers detects something, prompting Octavius to glance around as Spider-Man, swinging through the city using his web-slinging ability, flies in. Octavius throws bags at Spider-Man, who swings up to the ceiling, catching a bag in a web and hitting Octavius, who spins around and tosses more. Spider-Man lands on a wall, using his enhanced agility without his web, and a bag of coins hits him, scattering currency across the floor. A gold coin rolls over to the bank clerk, who is about to pocket it when Aunt May smacks him, defending the bank’s assets. Octavius' metal limbs, designed for complex tasks in hostile environments, pick Spider-Man up, with the other two pincers grabbing his head and starting to squeeze; Spider-Man, with his quick reflexes, fires a web and raises his arms at the desk and display case, causing the limbs to smash the desk. The display case, containing valuable securities, hits Octavius and propels him out of the bank onto a yellow cab, a signature of New York’s bustling streets, where he gets to his feet and the limbs approach Spider-Man, hurling him back into the bank. Two police cars, part of the NYPD’s rapid response unit, screech to a halt, and one of the mechanical limbs grabs Aunt May as cover. Octavius lumbers off with Aunt May, using her as leverage. Inside an office in a nearby building, a girl on the phone lays down the receiver and crosses to the window as a limb pokes through the wall, with Octavius hammering up the outside of the office building, three limbs doing the work, the fourth holding Aunt May.

Below her, Octavius crashes Spider-Man against the building, but Spider-Man still has a battle on his hands.

          "description": "Jordan is at a zoo where Grandma Sue nudges the zookeeper and waves a kite, examining it, while the zookeeper laughs, hops, and waddles away. On the other side of the aviary, Gregory, wearing a short cape and a beret, is standing in front of the wooden cage gate and flings it across the aviary, leaving Grandma Sue's eyes wide open as Jordan skips around the rock. Gregory uses his robotic tentacles to avoid the tourists, with one claw twirling around to adjust his glasses, then starts grabbing overflowing buckets of seeds from the cage and dumping them into purple baskets. One of the tentacles senses something, prompting Gregory to peer around as Owlman swoops in. Gregory hurls baskets at Owlman, who flips up to the rafters, snaring a basket in a lasso and striking Gregory, who twirls around and flings more. Owlman lands on a ledge without his lasso, and a basket of nuts hits him. A walnut rolls over to the zookeeper, who is about to munch it when Grandma Sue nudges him. Gregory's metallic tentacles lift Owlman up, with the other two claws clasping his helmet and beginning to crush; Owlman shoots a lasso and waves his arms at the bench and birdcage, causing the tentacles to shatter the bench. The birdcage strikes Gregory and catapults him out of the zoo onto a red trolley, where he rises and the tentacles swarm Owlman, flinging him back into the zoo. Two fire trucks squeal to a halt, and one of the robotic tentacles snatches Grandma Sue as a shield. Gregory stomps away with Grandma Sue. Inside a greenhouse, a boy on the tablet sets down the gadget and darts to the pane as a tentacle pokes through the wall, with Gregory scaling the outside of the conservatory, three tentacles doing the climbing, the fourth clutching Grandma Sue. Owlman appears above him, and high up the structure, Gregory releases Grandma Sue, but a lasso from Owlman catches her, and she bounces back up. Below her, Gregory slams Owlman against the conservatory, but Owlman still has a contest on his hands. He kicks free of Gregory and scrambles up the conservatory, only to be seized by one of the metallic tentacles. Grandma Sue watches Owlman pulled down by Gregory, and the two figures trade punches and leap off the conservatory, plummeting towards the pavement with one of the tentacles maintaining a grip."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

A fight ensues, with Octavius throwing bags at Spider-Man, who retaliates but is hit by a bag of coins. A bank clerk almost pockets a coin before Aunt May intervenes. Octavius grabs Spider-Man with his limbs, but Spider-Man uses webs to fight back, causing Octavius to crash out of the bank. Octavius, using Aunt May as a shield, escapes as police arrive.
