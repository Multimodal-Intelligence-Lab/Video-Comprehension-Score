Meanwhile, Jeff, clutching his glass firmly, directs his gaze out the window, his expression softening with a sympathetic understanding, while behind him, Lisa, having just delicately placed a pair of gleaming candlesticks upon the sleek table, turns and starts to move gracefully back toward the kitchen. Both individuals slightly shift their eyes toward the left in unison. Within the apartment's inviting kitchen-living room space, belonging to the ballet dancer, the ambiance has been tastefully enhanced—particularly by the large Chinese screen that cleverly conceals the ice box. Responding to the empty cocktail glass spotted in the hands of the third man, Miss Torso glides over with an air of attentiveness and takes it upon herself to refill the glass by the window. She exudes the qualities of an impeccable hostess, radiating charm and vivacity, ensuring each guest feels a touch of her personal attention. Every move she makes is attentively followed by the enthusiastic eyes of her three guests: one, an elegant man donning a black tie, who carries a hint of grey in his hair, identifying him as a Long Island socialite; another, a young, rather striking actor dressed in a grey flannel suit; and lastly, a bright, pleasant young man likely hailing from Wall Street, identified by his blue-pin-striped suit. Miss Torso conducts herself with a sophisticated grace, markedly different from her earlier morning demeanor. Dressed in a striking cocktail dress that flatters her figure, particularly as she leans engagingly toward the men to offer a tempting array of hors d'oeuvres, she completes the transformation of the space by replacing kitchen utensils with more appealing decorations, basking everything in a gentle lamplight glow. The man in the tuxedo nonchalantly follows her movements with a casual glance at his counterparts, positioning himself beside her as she expertly mixes the drink, casting an impatient look at his watch, muttering a playful comment about the late hour in her direction. Meanwhile, the other two guests are deeply immersed in a lively conversation. She swivels around, placing a light, reassuring kiss on his cheek as a playful gesture for him to ease his impatience, but this only ignites his romantic inclinations, prompting him to wrap an arm around her shoulders and plant a more intense kiss on her cheek. Facing him directly, they share a moment of mutual eye contact, and she permits him to kiss her on the lips, though just briefly enough to capture the interest of the other two men, giving them a dose of intrigue. With a slightly reproachful look, she disentangles herself and nudges him back toward the other two, signaling him with a meaningful look. He takes her last comment to heart, briefly contemplating it as he shifts his focus elsewhere. As this intricate dance unfolds, the camera steadily zooms in until it captures Jeff in semi-closeup, leaving him isolated in the frame."

She is acting with an innocence not visible when last heard in the afternoon. Miss Moonbeam is now wearing a festival outfit that conceals her shape to mild disadvantage, particularly when she reclines beside the seven dogs to offer them a cup of broth. All musical instruments have been hidden, replaced by less elegant items, and moonlight hardens the decoration. The dog in the raincoat trails her across, with a sluggish blink behind the others, kneels opposite her as she lights the torch, and checks his compass with confusion, making a direct statement to her about the earliness of the moment. The earlier six are entangled in a tranquil daydream. She shifts, offers him a firm nudge on his paw as if instructing him to be silent, but rather than calming him, it makes him more forgetful, and he swings a leg past her ear and plants a gentle nuzzle on her paw. She rotates to face him, they peer into each other's whiskers for a century, and she renounces herself to be patted on the tail, but barely short enough to lose the attention of the other six dogs. With a small scolding toe, she drifts away from him and has him rejoin the other six, throwing him an indifferent toe. It reflects on her previous shout, then realizes his nose in another tangent.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
