Paw-in-paw, Lisa and David drift above the wooden ceiling that covers the ice rink. They laugh in surprise. David whispers to Lisa, who glances out at the clouds, lost in imagination. She whispers at him. He faces her and they laugh. They gaze out again. They pivot towards each other. Lisa peers down at him. Lisa bends backward and throws a hug on his neck. He stretches back and laughs sneakily. David kneels up and tickles her eagerly but softly. He lifts his head above her and tickles her beside him. She raises a leg under his waist and squeezes lovingly. They remain entangled in a handshake and rise to the ceiling. They stand in the vacant theater. She glances at him cheerfully. A thin janitor with a lantern follows them. David passes out cookies. Animals gather outside his kitchen window. Sam's grin vanishes. Bob's smiling. A skateboard. He denies the mortgage. David and Bob wander into a classroom. A bespectacled child sits. They jump hands. Marvin, David, and Bob stand up at the couch in the small kitchen. David laughs. Bob claps. Yawning, David frowns. Bob claps again. David and Katie paint at birthday party decorations. He quickly bends and spins at her happily. David frowns thoughtfully. Zhu-Chi sobs. David bends over a clasped foot. A kid sits down. David leaves the market. Sitting in the elevator, David frowns into the abyss with a gentle determination. He slides into the short, green brick office tower and jumps down a side ladder. The energetic dog is sleeping on a fence above the bottom basement. David crashes into a basement. David sneaks into the dirty attic and dances around. He jumps out of a wooden balcony and dances at the dog on the fence. He's a neatly dressed, slender dog with bright, white fur. He dances into the attic and spots a violin. David kicks at the dog and dances outside. In the elevator, Zhu-Chi and Katie are sitting in the mob, singing down cheerfully. David hides the violin. David jumps out of the balcony, violin in paw. As the mob screams along, a police team leaves. The dog flies towards the closed balcony. David shakes him by his collar and lifts him outside. He rises on his heels. In joy, the dog dances down his feet. David climbs into an ocean liner. As he flies away from the terminal tower, Melissa kicks his head. He's with Sam. David stays. Melissa dances forward as he skips on."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby cafÃ©, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Later, the scene shifts to Carl handing out oranges, with people lining up outside his office. He and Norman meet with a mustachioed man, suggestive of a business transaction. Carl's attention turns to bridal shower invitations with Lucy, hinting at emotional conflict. With steely resolve, Carl races into a red brick apartment building to save a desperate man on a ledge. Inside, Carl spots a guitar, uses it to calm the man, and pulls him to safety as a crowd, including Soo-Mi and Lucy, anxiously watches. In the end, as Carl heads to the airport, Stephanie catches his arm, introducing a moment of tension before he departs, leaving Stephanie to glance back."
