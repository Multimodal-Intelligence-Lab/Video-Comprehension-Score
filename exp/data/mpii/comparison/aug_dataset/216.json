The band launches into \"Man of Constant Sorrow,\" precipitating a huge reaction. Everett, trying to get Penny's attention, is stunned at the ovation as he and the boys, still singing, exchange bemused looks. They shrug and lean into the song with a will. Everett performs an impromptu buck-and-wing, bringing the crowd to new heights of hysteria. Stokes is staring at the band, frowning, while the crowd stares at him, stone-faced, as he plows on.

As the multitude disperses, the crucifix descends toward Big Dan, who is paralyzed, gazing upward, and it collapses in a cascade of sparks and embers that annihilates Big Dan Teague. A vehicle arrives in front of a municipal hall from which festivity noises filter out, and Pappy O'Daniel emerges from the vehicle with his entourage: Eckard, Spivey, and Junior. Delmar broods while Everett is astonished. As headlights illuminate, the men retreat into the passageway as a vehicle goes by. The vehicle drives up to the feast hall, and Homer Stokes emerges with his dwarf, who throws his crumpled white hood into the vehicle and both men slip into their jackets; they ascend the stairs with Stokes's pace swift and the dwarf hopping clumsily to keep up. Everett, Pete, Delmar, and Tommy enter through the rear entry with the blackface cleansed off, and all four now wear long gray beards as a disguise, awkwardly attached with spirit gum. Each is carrying a musical-instrument case, and they push past the bustling kitchen staff. Out in the feast hall, Penny and Waldrip sit side-by-side at the head table, encircled by the Wharvey gals, facing the hall with their backs to the stage as Everett, Pete, Delmar, and Tommy take their positions. Pappy O'Daniel stands by Waldrip's chair, draping an arm over his shoulder and murmuring confidentially, as Waldrip sits rigidly upright, listening, scowling at a spot in space. Suddenly, Waldrip bursts, and she shakes her head vigorously and looks down at her platter as Everett continues imploring to her back. The band starts into \"Man of Constant Sorrow,\" causing a massive reaction. Everett, attempting to get Penny's attention, is astonished at the applause as he and the boys, still singing, exchange puzzled looks. They shrug and lean into the song with determination. Everett performs a spontaneous buck-and-wing, bringing the crowd to new heights of frenzy. Stokes is staring at the band, scowling, while the crowd stares at him, expressionless, as he continues. He is struck by a tomato and showered by edibles, shielding himself with one arm while yelling into the microphone. An elderly man in overalls and his spouse sit hunched before a crystal set, listening to the tinny voice. They look at each other silently and then look back at the crystal set.

Into \"Man of Constant Sorrow\" launches the band, precipitating a huge reaction. Trying to get Penny's attention, the ovation stuns Everett as, still singing, he and the boys exchange bemused looks. A shrug is given by them, and into the song they lean with a will. An impromptu buck-and-wing is performed by Everett, bringing the crowd to new heights of hysteria. At the band, frowning, Stokes is staring, while at him, stone-faced, the crowd stares as he plows on. A tomato hits him, and by foodstuffs, he is pelted, shielding himself with one arm while into the mike he bellows. In overalls, an old man and his wife sit hunched before a crystal set, listening to the tinny voice. Wordlessly, they look at each other and then back at the crystal set.

Meanwhile, the cross, now unsupported, starts its descent toward Big Dan, who stands frozen in place, his eyes fixed upward in a mix of disbelief and fear.

As he continues to plow on, he is suddenly hit by a tomato, followed by a barrage of foodstuffs. He raises one arm to shield himself while bellowing into the microphone, trying to maintain his composure. In a different setting, an old man in overalls and his wife sit hunched over a crystal set, listening to the tinny voice emanating from it.

          "description": "At the crest of the mountain, Lester clips its last kite string with his scissors, and the five children fly away. As the flock disperses, the mountain rises toward Tall Sam, who is petrified, gazing down, and it collapses in a rain of dust and feathers that eclipses Tall Sam Thompson. A bicycle rolls up in front of a library from which silence trickles out, and Grandpa Winthrop emerges from the bicycle with his entourage: Paulie, Corky, and Junior. Felix grumbles while Lester is flabbergasted. As taillights flicker, the children sneak back into the tunnel as a bicycle whizzes by. The bicycle zooms up to the theater, and Rufus Stokes appears with his hamster, who pitches his wadded-up blue scarf into the bicycle and both children wiggle into their jackets; they climb the ladder with Stokes’s pace rapid and the hamster dancing awkwardly to keep up. Lester, Jake, Felix, and Charlie slip through the attic window with the face paint washed away, and all four now sport long orange wigs as a disguise, awkwardly glued with paste. Each is lugging a picnic-basket case, and they nudge past the bustling waitstaff. Out in the theater, Molly and Rufus sit side-by-side at the corner table, surrounded by the Jasper kids, facing the seats with their backs to the curtain as Lester, Jake, Felix, and Charlie settle in. Grandpa Winthrop stands by Rufus’s chair, looping an arm over his shoulder and mumbling discreetly, as Rufus sits stiffly upright, pondering, scowling at a point in the air. Suddenly, Rufus bursts, and he nods his head slowly and looks up at his glass as Lester continues talking to his shoulder. The ensemble leaps into \"Man of Simple Joy,\" triggering a massive response. Lester, attempting to catch Molly’s notice, is shocked at the applause as he and the children, still humming, trade bewildered glances. They exchange shrugs and dive into the tune with gusto. Lester executes an unexpected jig-and-jive, elevating the flock to new levels of excitement. Rufus is glaring at the ensemble, scowling, while the flock glares at him, expressionless, as he trudges forward. He is hit by an orange and struck by vegetables, shielding himself with one hand while shouting into the funnel. A young girl in pajamas and her brother sit crouched before a transistor set, tuning into the muffled voice. They exchange gazes wordlessly and then glance back at the transistor set. Rufus is nearly drowned out by the tune as his hamster watches nervously, and an annoyed audience member jerks out the funnel cord, leaving Rufus to gesture unheard words."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
