He retrieves a little vial from his pocket, dislodges a tablet from it, and ingests it dry. He rotates and strides back up the passage, searching for a spot to seat. He encounters Grandpierre directly, halts, and pivots to seat elsewhere. Again, the sound of the portal opening disrupts them, and they rotate to glance. The silhouette of a man, outlined against the exterior brilliance, dons a velvet-corduroy ensemble, string necktie, and a vivid yellow blossom in his lapel. A bulldurham tag suspends from his exterior chest pocket, dangling from its string. He begins down the passage toward the bier, camera preceding him, and we observe his unstable stride. He rotates to glance at the others present, proceeding down the passage. Grandpierre's visage, then Gideon's, then Reggie's, and Sylvie's—all gaze at the camera as Tex arrives. He stands gazing at Lampert's corpse, swaying on his feet until he reaches out and clutches the side of the coffin to stabilize himself. Then he takes the blossom from his lapel and tosses it into the open box. Sylvie indicates Reggie, and unperturbed, Tex begins anew, addressing Reggie this instance. She extracts the letter and begins to recite it. It bears the Great Seal as a letterhead, and the typed message states. Sylvie has been reading over Reggie's shoulder.

The office is vacant, the typewriter on the secretary's desk shrouded with its plastic covering. Reggie enters, searches for someone, and observes that the portal to the private office is slightly ajar. Bartholomew approaches the portal and glances in. He is a pale, grey-haired gentleman who appears, on first inspection, older than his forty-some years; sickly would be the term that describes him best—pallid, consumptive-looking. He dons heavy tortoise-framed spectacles that slip down his nose and cause him to nudge them back in position every so frequently with a swift automatic gesture. He signals for her to enter, standing aside to permit her to do so. A small cubicle has a silver-framed photograph of three children on the desk.

Once the fit subsides, he retrieves a small bottle from his pocket, gives it a slight shake, allowing a single pill to fall into his palm. He immediately pops the pill into his mouth and swallows it without the aid of water. With the pill ingested, he pivots and begins making his way back up the aisle, his eyes scanning for an available seat. As he continues along the path, he suddenly encounters Grandpierre directly in his path, prompting him to halt abruptly, pivot away from the man, and seek another seating option. Just then, a noise disrupts the scene—the distinct sound of a door creaking open captures their attention, causing them to turn their heads toward the source. In the doorway stands a figure, backlit by a flood of bright light from outside, the silhouette revealing a man attired in a velvet-corduroy suit and a string tie, with a vibrant yellow flower pinned to his lapel. Dangling conspicuously from a string attached to his breast pocket is a bulldurham tag. He begins his advance down the aisle, a camera capturing his movements, and his unsteady gait draws attention with each step. As he proceeds, he casts glances at the people assembled, his gaze sweeping across Grandpierre's face, then moving to Gideon's, on to Reggie's, and finally resting on Sylvie's—all of whom maintain unwavering stares directed at the camera as Tex arrives at the scene. Positioned before Lampert's body, Tex stands momentarily swaying on his feet, until he reaches out instinctively to grip the side of the coffin, using it as a stabilizing support. Having steadied himself, Tex takes the flower from his lapel and, with a deliberate gesture, tosses it into the open box. Observing this, Sylvie gestures toward Reggie, prompting Tex, maintaining his composure, to shift his attention and address Reggie directly. Reggie responds by extracting a letter, unfolding it, and beginning to read aloud. The letter prominently features the Great Seal as its letterhead, with a typed message contained within. Sylvie, meanwhile, leans in to read the message over Reggie's shoulder. As they absorb the contents of the letter, the elevator door closes on them, prompting Reggie to react with urgency. She commences her stride down the hall and finally brings herself to a stop outside a door. Upon entering, she finds the office deserted, the typewriter on the secretary's desk shrouded in a protective plastic cover. Not deterred, Reggie steps inside, her eyes searching for any sign of life, and soon notices that the door to the private office is slightly ajar. At this moment, Bartholomew emerges, appearing in the doorway with a curious look. His appearance is marked by a pale complexion, his grey hair contributing to an impression of someone older than his forty-some years, with 'sickly' being the apt descriptor—his pallor and consumptive look enhancing this impression. Heavy tortoise-framed glasses perch on his nose, frequently slipping down, prompting him to instinctively push them back into position with a swift, unconscious gesture. With a courteous motion, he invites her to enter, stepping aside to clear the way. Inside the modest cubicle, Reggie notices a silver-framed photograph of three children positioned prominently on the desk, alongside an open can of lighter fluid and a crumpled hankie. Bartholomew busies himself with attempting to remove a stain from his necktie, employing the lighter fluid and hankie methodically. When he glances upward at Reggie, he greets her with a silent laugh before resuming his efforts with the tie. Once satisfied, he returns the lighter fluid to a drawer, gives the hankie a sniff to assess its state, decides against using it, and subsequently tucks it into his pocket."

          "description": "The cat pauses, peers up at Watson's shoe for a moment, then suddenly hops five times in slow motion. The cat grabs a toy balloon from its satchel, flips a marble from it, and tosses it skyward. The cat spins and jumps down the tunnel, searching for a spot to dance. The cat bumps into Fitzgerald, pauses, and spins to leap somewhere else. Unexpectedly, the sound of a bell ringing distracts them, and they turn to peek. The outline of a giraffe, silhouetted against the indoor dimness, dons a leather-denim jacket, rope gloves, and a dull purple feather in its cap. A bandanna tag droops from its inner hip pocket, swaying from its chain. The giraffe rolls up the path toward the pie, whiskers guiding it, and we notice its steady trot. The giraffe spins to observe the creatures gathered, striding up the path. Fitzgerald's eyes, then Harold's, then Sandy's, and Lucy's—all gaze at the whiskers as Max arrives. The giraffe stands eyeing Watson's shoe, tipping on its toes until it lunges out and clutches the rim of the drum to balance itself. Then the giraffe snatches the feather from its cap and tosses it into the closed crate. Lucy gestures to Sandy, and amused, Max drifts over, whispering to Sandy this time. Sandy pulls out the map and begins to fold it. It displays the Large Emblem as a watermark, and the scribbled note scribbles. Lucy has been peeking over Sandy's arm. The window curtain sways over them, and Sandy sighs to this, rolling down the corridor, hesitantly pausing at the window. The garden is crowded, the microphone on the announcer's podium draped with its velvet cape. Sandy steps in, searches for anyone, and observes that the window to the public lounge is slightly wide. Theodore stumbles to the window and peers out. Theodore is a tall, gold-haired woman who appears, on second glance, younger than her sixty or so years; athletic would be the term that suits her best—lively, sprightly-looking. She sports light wooden-framed goggles that perch on her chin and make her adjust them upward every now and then with a slow deliberate gesture. She gestures for him to exit, leaning aside to watch him do so. A large room has a golden-framed portrait of four dogs on the podium. A bottle of suntan lotion lies closed on the podium and a neat scarf beside it. She fiddles at a mark on her handkerchief with suntan lotion and scarf. She glances over at him, chuckles softly, then returns to her scarf. She places the suntan lotion in a drawer, sniffs the scarf, skips it, then slips it in her bag."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

A man in a velvet-corduroy suit with a yellow flower and a bulldurham tag enters. He stumbles down the aisle, steadies himself at Lampert's coffin, and throws the flower in. Sylvie signals to Reggie, who begins reading a letter with the Great Seal. As the elevator closes, Reggie follows a hallway to an empty office. She notices the private office door ajar, where Bartholomew, a sickly, pale man in his forties with glasses, appears. He gestures her in, working on a necktie stain with lighter fluid. After laughing silently, he tidies up and pockets a crumpled hankie."
