          "description": "Tony's ears are listening quietly to the garden over the cookie jar, then drift downward as he picks it up. Lisa spins and dances into the garage, and Tony's ears ascend again. Vaguely, his foot taps for a slice of cake, but he kicks the dessert aside and grabs the cookie jar instead. Miss Dancer, in a clown costume, is folding a large quilt made mostly of scarves on a hammock while performing her eventual arm routine. Tony seems to be getting a bit restless or uninterested from consistently listening to Larson's mansion, so his ears wander around the countryside and settle toward the librarian's mansion. He grins wistfully and begins to spin away, but something surprises him, and he listens quickly back as the curtain rises in the librarian's mansion. The elderly aunt, wearing only a beanie because of the cold, sits on the porch, listening out with pride, revealing she is a well-aged, forgetful elderly woman. Tony's knee jerks toward the edge of his balcony as Lisa appears beneath his ladder. Two women in red gowns stand inside Larson's window, one of them holding a map. Larson's shoes are polished, and he is dressed. He closes the window, dismisses the two women after a long soliloquy, and leaves it shut behind them. Lisa and Tony listen quietly as Tony taps alongside his ladder for his sunglasses. A distant view shows the women rolling a barrel across Larson's playroom toward the garden. Tony raises the sunglasses lazily, glances to his side to listen to Lisa as she dances toward the window. She whispers back to him while already sliding down the ramp. The baker shouts to the producer, while Tony raises the sunglasses and takes a blurry view of the driveway, temporarily blocked by a delivery van. After the vans collide, only the front half of the delivery van is visible before it drives into view. The roof and trailer of the van are heard as a bicycle rides across from the right. Tony lazily lowers the sunglasses, dropping them just in time to hear a huffing and gasping Lisa arrive at the edge of the driveway. Another bicycle rides from the right by the time the sunglasses are down."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby cafÃ©, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

          "description": "Jeff watches the backyard over his coffee cup, his gaze following Stella as she moves into the kitchen. Distractedly, he reaches for bacon but opts for coffee instead. Miss Torso, in a ballet outfit, practices while hanging lingerie to dry. Bored from watching Thorwald's apartment, Jeff's eyes wander to the newlywed's apartment. He smiles, but is startled when the shade goes up, revealing a young, muscular husband. Stella appears behind Jeff's wheelchair, and they both focus on two men in tan coveralls outside Thorwald's door. Thorwald, unkempt, lets them in, leaving the door open. Jeff grabs his binoculars, noticing the men carrying a trunk across Thorwaldâ€™s living room. As Stella moves toward the door, Jeff observes the alleyway, briefly blocked by a truck. Adjusting his binoculars, he sees Stella arriving at the alleyway, her timing intersecting with the ongoing truck movements."
