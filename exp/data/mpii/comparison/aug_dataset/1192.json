  "ground_truth": "Each singer in the front row holds a huge toad as Professor Lupin stands and nods to the students, while Hagrid, the huge giant, stands up, knocking into the table and extinguishing a candle that relights itself before he leaves the Hall. Harry and his friends climb the moving staircase towards a portrait of a fat lady holding a glass and singing, which she smashes against a pillar. The portrait swings back, and they go into the common room where a ghost walks through them, and the boys try magic sweets. Neville chews the sweet, Ron tries one, and steam shoots from Harry's ears. Outside the window, the rain lashes down and lightning flashes as the storm rages around Hogwarts Castle, with black-cloaked Dementors hovering outside the school grounds. A small bird flies along the stone cloister, swoops down a grassy slope towards a crooked willow tree, which pulls back a branch and thwacks the bird, causing feathers to fly. In a classroom, she recoils, then outside the school, the students follow Hagrid around the edge of the sunlit forest to a grassy clearing surrounded by a low wall where Malfoy strokes his monster book, which purrs contentedly. Malfoy slowly approaches Harry, stares at him arrogantly, then, looking terrified, points over Harry's shoulder, and Harry spins round as his cronies pull up their hooded cloaks. Neville looks bedraggled next to a magnificent creature that stands in front of them, and all but Harry step back as Ron gives Harry a push. Nervously, Harry moves forward and bows to the creature, which flaps its huge wings and bows its birdlike head. Hagrid throws a tidbit while Malfoy pushes to the front, and Harry stretches out his hand as Hermione clutches Ron's hand and they both look embarrassed. Harry pats the creature, and as Hagrid smacks its hindquarters, it raises its huge wings and takes off while Harry hangs on desperately to Buckbeak's feathery neck, the four-legged creature, half-horse, half-eagle, rising above the trees. In the distance, Harry sees a river winding its way down the valley, the strong wings of the hippogriff carrying them even higher as they sail between the towers and turrets of Hogwarts School and soar above the craggy hillside. The silvery sun filters down through the storm clouds, turning the waters of a vast lake below them to a steely gray as Harry, clinging to the creature's neck, sees his reflection in the water while Buckbeak skims low over the lake, one huge claw just touching the surface. Harry relaxes, enjoying the sensation with a huge smile crossing his face, and spreads his arms wide but then grabs hold of the feathery neck once more as the huge wings lift them up and away from the lake. At last, Hagrid calls them back, and the hippogriff soars down through the treetops, flaps its wings as a brake, and lands in a clearing.",

          "description": "Every vocalist in the front line grips a colossal frog as Professor Lupin stands and acknowledges the pupils, while Hagrid, the enormous titan, rises, colliding with the desk and snuffing a taper that rekindles itself before he exits the Hall. Harry and his companions ascend the shifting staircase towards a depiction of a corpulent woman clasping a chalice and crooning, which she shatters against a column. The depiction swings back, and they enter the shared chamber where a phantom traverses them, and the lads attempt magical candies. Neville masticates the confection, Ron samples one, and vapor bursts from Harry's ears. Outside the pane, the downpour lashes down and lightning bursts as the tempest rages around Hogwarts Fortress, with black-robed Dementors lingering outside the school precincts. A diminutive bird glides along the stone arcade, swoops down a verdant incline towards a bent willow, which retracts a limb and swats the bird, causing plumes to scatter. In a classroom, she recoils, then outside the school, the scholars trail Hagrid around the verge of the sunlit woodland to a grassy glade encircled by a low parapet where Malfoy caresses his monstrosity tome, which purrs contentedly. Malfoy gradually advances towards Harry, gazes at him haughtily, then, looking petrified, indicates over Harry's shoulder, and Harry whirls around as his adherents draw up their hooded mantles. Neville appears disheveled next to a splendid entity that stands before them, and all but Harry retreat as Ron propels Harry. Apprehensively, Harry proceeds and inclines towards the entity, which flaps its immense pinions and inclines its avian cranium. Hagrid throws a morsel while Malfoy pushes to the forefront, and Harry extends his palm as Hermione grips Ron's palm and they both appear abashed. Harry pats the entity, and as Hagrid smacks its hindquarters, it elevates its immense pinions and ascends while Harry clutches desperately to Buckbeak's plumose neck, the quadrupedal entity, half-equine, half-aquila, rising above the timberland. In the remoteness, Harry perceives a brook meandering its course down the vale, the robust pinions of the hippogriff bearing them even loftier as they glide between the spires and turrets of Hogwarts School and soar above the rugged hillside. The argent sun filters down through the storm clouds, turning the waters of a vast lake below them to a steely-gray as Harry, clinging to the entity's neck, observes his reflection in the water while Buckbeak skims low over the lake, one immense talon merely brushing the surface. Harry relaxes, savoring the sensation with a colossal grin spanning his countenance, and extends his arms wide but then clutches the plumose neck once more as the immense pinions elevate them up and away from the lake. Ultimately, Hagrid summons them back, and the hippogriff soars down through the treetops, flaps its pinions as a brake, and lands in a glade."

Nervously, the creature is moved forward to and bowed to by Harry, which flaps its huge wings and bows its birdlike head. A tidbit is thrown by Hagrid while the front is pushed to by Malfoy, and Harry stretches out his hand as Ron's hand is clutched by Hermione and they both look embarrassed.

Harry, along with his friends, ascends the moving staircase, making their way towards a portrait of a plump lady who is holding a glass and singing melodiously.

Nearby, Professor Lupin stands with a gentle demeanor, nodding approvingly at the gathered students who hang onto every nod. Meanwhile, Hagrid, the enormous giant of a man, towers over the scene. He rises awkwardly to his feet, accidentally bumping into the table as he does so, which causes a candle to be extinguished. However, the candle, as if by magic, relights itself effortlessly before he makes a slightly clumsy exit from the Hall. Harry, along with his close-knit group of friends, ascends the moving staircase with determination, making their way toward a portrait of a plump lady. She is depicted holding a glass, singing melodiously with great passion. In a moment filled with dramatic flair, she suddenly smashes the glass against a nearby stone pillar. This action causes the portrait to swing open, granting them entry into the common room where a ghostly figure eerily passes through them. The boys eagerly experiment with an assortment of magical sweets. Neville begins to chew on one of the sweets, while Ron tries another, and in an unexpected turn, steam bursts out from Harry's ears. Outside the window, rain pours down relentlessly and mercilessly, with lightning illuminating the sky as a fierce storm rages around the majestic Hogwarts Castle. Meanwhile, ominous black-cloaked Dementors hover menacingly just outside the school grounds. A small bird flits along the ancient stone cloister, swooping down a grassy slope toward a crooked willow tree. The tree reacts by pulling back a branch and thwacking the unsuspecting bird, sending its feathers flying in every imaginable direction. Inside a classroom, she recoils in surprise, and outside the school, the students follow Hagrid as he leads them carefully around the edge of the sunlit, enchanting forest to a grassy clearing encircled by a low stone wall. Here, Malfoy is seen stroking his monstrous book, which purrs contentedly under his gentle touch. Malfoy then slowly approaches Harry, his eyes fixing on him with an arrogant stare before, looking suddenly terrified, he points over Harry's shoulder. Harry spins around quickly, curious, as Malfoy's cronies pull up their hooded cloaks for dramatic effect. Neville appears bedraggled and slightly disheveled next to a magnificent creature standing before them, and all but Harry take a cautious step back as Ron gives Harry a gentle push forward. With a sense of nervousness and anticipation, Harry steps forward and bows politely to the creature, which responds by flapping its enormous wings and bowing its birdlike head in return. Hagrid tosses a tidbit, and Malfoy pushes his way to the front, eager to see what happens, while Harry extends his hand as Hermione clutches Ron's hand, both looking slightly embarrassed by the whole situation. Harry gently pats the magnificent creature, and as Hagrid gives its hindquarters a firm smack, it raises its massive wings and takes off into the air, with Harry clinging desperately to Buckbeak's feathery neck.

In the distance, Harry catches sight of a winding river that snakes its way down the valley, the powerful wings of the hippogriff carrying them ever higher as they gracefully glide between the towers and turrets of Hogwarts School and soar above the rugged hillside. The silvery sunlight filters down through the storm clouds, casting a steely gray hue over the rippling waters of a vast lake below them. As Harry clings to the creature's neck, he sees his reflection mirrored in the water while Buckbeak skims low over the lake, one enormous claw just grazing the surface. Harry relaxes into the moment, relishing the exhilarating sensation with a broad smile spreading across his face, and he spreads his arms wide, only to grab hold of the feathery neck once more as the immense wings lift them up and away from the lake. Finally, Hagrid calls them back, and the hippogriff descends smoothly through the treetops, flapping its wings to slow down, and lands gracefully in a clearing, completing their adventure."

Harry and his friends climb the moving staircase, an architectural marvel enchanted to change directions, towards a portrait of a fat lady holding a glass and singing a tune from a popular wizarding opera, which she smashes against a pillar in frustration. The portrait swings back, revealing the entrance, and they go into the common room where a ghost named Nearly Headless Nick walks through them, and the boys try magic sweets from Honeydukes, a famous wizarding sweet shop. Neville chews the sweet, Ron tries one, and steam shoots from Harry's ears, a side effect of the magical confection. Outside the window, the rain lashes down and lightning flashes as the storm rages around Hogwarts Castle, renowned for its magical defenses, with black-cloaked Dementors, dark creatures known for feeding on human happiness, hovering outside the school grounds. A small bird flies along the stone cloister, part of the ancient school's architecture, swoops down a grassy slope towards a crooked willow tree, which pulls back a branch and thwacks the bird, causing feathers to fly, a testament to the tree's magical and protective nature. In a classroom, she recoils, then outside the school, the students follow Hagrid around the edge of the sunlit Forbidden Forest to a grassy clearing surrounded by a low wall where Malfoy strokes his monster book, a notoriously difficult book called \"The Monster Book of Monsters,\" which purrs contentedly. Malfoy slowly approaches Harry, stares at him arrogantly, then, looking terrified, points over Harry's shoulder, and Harry spins round as his cronies pull up their hooded cloaks, a common tactic to intimidate others. Neville looks bedraggled next to a magnificent creature that stands in front of them, a hippogriff named Buckbeak known for its proud demeanor, and all but Harry step back as Ron gives Harry a push. Nervously, Harry moves forward and bows to the creature, which flaps its huge wings and bows its birdlike head, a sign of mutual respect. Hagrid throws a tidbit, a reward for Buckbeak, while Malfoy pushes to the front, and Harry stretches out his hand as Hermione clutches Ron's hand and they both look embarrassed by Malfoy's antics. Harry pats the creature, and as Hagrid smacks its hindquarters, it raises its huge wings and takes off while Harry hangs on desperately to Buckbeak's feathery neck, the four-legged creature, half-horse, half-eagle, rising above the trees. In the distance, Harry sees a river winding its way down the valley, the strong wings of the hippogriff carrying them even higher as they sail between the towers and turrets of Hogwarts School, an institution steeped in magical history, and soar above the craggy hillside. The silvery sun filters down through the storm clouds, turning the waters of the Black Lake, known for its mysterious depths, below them to a steely gray as Harry, clinging to the creature's neck, sees his reflection in the water while Buckbeak skims low over the lake, one huge claw just touching the surface. Harry relaxes, enjoying the sensation with a huge smile crossing his face, and spreads his arms wide but then grabs hold of the feathery neck once more as the huge wings lift them up and away from the lake.

Susan and her cousins climb the rotating ladder towards a portrait of a thin gentleman holding a bottle and humming, which he smashes against a sculpture. The picture swings back, and they go into the gallery where a shadow floats through them, and the girls try enchanted chocolates. George chews the chocolate, Sam tries one, and confetti bursts from Susan's nose. Outside the chimney, the snow falls down and thunder flashes as the blizzard rages around Avalon Fortress, with red-cloaked wraiths hovering outside the library grounds. A tiny butterfly glides along the wooden corridor, swoops down a sandy slope towards a twisted maple tree, which pulls back a twig and swats the butterfly, causing petals to scatter. In a conservatory, he recoils, then outside the mansion, the scholars follow Gandalf around the edge of the sunlit orchard to a sandy clearing surrounded by a tall hedge where Bellamy strokes his enchanted scroll, which hums contentedly. Bellamy slowly approaches Susan, glares at her arrogantly, then, looking petrified, points over Susan's shoulder, and Susan spins round as her sidekicks pull up their hooded vests. George looks drenched next to a magnificent sculpture that stands in front of them, and all but Susan step back as Sam gives Susan a push. Cautiously, Susan moves forward and bows to the sculpture, which flaps its large banners and bows its fishlike head. Gandalf throws a morsel while Bellamy shoves to the front, and Susan stretches out her hand as Petunia clutches Sam's elbow and they both look flustered. Susan pats the sculpture, and as Gandalf pats its hindquarters, it lifts its giant banners and takes flight while Susan clings on desperately to Smaug's scaly neck, the three-headed sculpture, half-reptile, half-finch, rising above the buildings. In the distance, Susan sees a stream winding its way down the meadow, the strong gusts of the drake carrying them even higher as they sail between the steeples and spires of Avalon University and soar above the knobby outcrop. The pale moon filters down through the blizzard clouds, turning the waters of a vast pond below them to a shiny blue as Susan, holding onto the sculpture's neck, sees her reflection in the water while Smaug skims low over the pond, one giant talon just touching the surface. Susan relaxes, enjoying the thrill with a wide grin crossing her face, and spreads her arms wide but then grabs hold of the scaly neck once more as the giant banners lift them up and away from the pond. At last, Gandalf summons them back, and the drake swoops down through the branches, flaps its banners as a brake, and lands in a meadow."

Draco and his enemies slide down the frozen waterfall towards a painting of a skinny gentleman throwing a coin and laughing, which he hurls against a wall. The painting spins forward, and they leave the secret chamber where a wizard floats around them, and the girls mix science potions. Luna swallows the potion, Hermione swirls one, and glitter pours from Draco's fingers. Through the door, the snow settles down and thunder claps as the blizzard swirls around Gotham City, with red-caped superheroes darting inside the ancient mansion. A large butterfly flutters along the marble hallway, glides up a lush hill towards a leaning cedar tree, which pushes forward a branch and flicks the butterfly, sending scales to drift. In a greenhouse, he crouches, then within the building, the acrobats guide Gandalf through the center of the moody desert to a sandy arena lined by a high fence where Daphne tickles her dragon scroll, which hums softly. Daphne quickly approaches Draco, grins at him confidently, then, feeling shocked, whispers over Draco's shoulder, and Draco spins around as his allies pull down their woolen scarves. Luna looks disheveled next to a shabby monster that lays beside them, and everyone but Draco steps forward as Hermione gives Draco a shove. Boldly, Draco charges backward and waves to the monster, which flutters its tiny toes and nods its animal-like snout. Gandalf tosses a pebble while Daphne pushes to the back, and Draco retracts his foot as Luna grabs Hermione's foot and they both look elated. Draco taps the monster, and as Gandalf strokes its forelimbs, it stretches its massive toes and lands while Draco clings persistently to Aragog's scaly tail, the two-headed beast, half-lion, half-bat, gliding across the meadows. Nearby, Draco glimpses a path traversing its way up the mountain, the frail claws of the chimera hoisting them even faster as they drift amidst the chimneys and spires of Gotham University and plunge beneath the rocky canyon. The golden moon rises up through the misty skies, shifting the rivers of a tiny pond above them to a coppery glow as Draco, holding on to the beast’s tail, observes his silhouette in the mist while Aragog dives below the pond, one tiny talon barely grazing the mist. Draco loosens up, savoring the transport with a small grin spreading over his face, and folds his knees softly but then tightens grip on the scaly tail once more as the tiny toes propel them away from the pond. Finally, Gandalf urges them home, and the chimera hovers up above the shrubs, flutters its toes for balance, and rests in a meadow."

Harry and his friends hop onto the rotating escalator towards a painting of a plump gentleman holding a spoon and whistling, which he hurls against a column. The painting swivels aside, and they step into the lounge where a phantom glides past them, and the boys sample magical pastries. Neville nibbles the pastry, Ron eats one, and bubbles float from Harry's nostrils. Outside the door, the wind howls and thunder booms as the tempest crashes around Hogwarts Fortress, with red-hooded Pixies darting near the school gates. A tiny squirrel scurries along the wooden corridor, dives down a sandy bank towards a twisted oak tree, which swings a branch and flicks the squirrel, scattering leaves. In a laboratory, she jumps back, then outside the school, the students trail Hagrid around the edge of a sunlit lagoon to a sandy nook bordered by a tall fence where Malfoy pets his gremlin book, which coos happily. Malfoy hesitantly approaches Harry, glances at him disdainfully, then, looking startled, gestures over Harry's shoulder, and Harry pivots around as his cronies lower their pointed hoods. Neville looks drenched next to a majestic statue that looms before them, and all but Harry retreat as Ron gives Harry a nudge. Timidly, Harry steps forward and kneels to the statue, which shakes its immense antlers and tilts its animal-like head. Hagrid tosses a pebble while Malfoy shoves to the fore, and Harry extends his arm as Hermione grasps Ron's arm and they both appear abashed. Harry rubs the statue, and as Hagrid taps its side, it lifts its massive antlers and leaps while Harry clings tightly to Buckbeak's woolly mane, the two-legged creature, half-stag, half-falcon, ascending above the branches. In the distance, Harry sees a trail winding its way down the meadow, the sturdy feathers of the griffin transporting them even higher as they glide among the spires and minarets of Hogwarts Institute and hover above the jagged hillside. The golden light peeks down through the rain clouds, tinting the waters of an enormous ocean beneath them to a glimmering silver as Harry, holding onto the creature's mane, sees his silhouette on the surface while Buckbeak glides low across the ocean, one large foot merely grazing the water. Harry unwinds, relishing the feeling with a broad grin spreading across his face, and stretches his arms wide but then grips the woolly mane once again as the massive antlers elevate them up and away from the ocean. Finally, Hagrid beckons them back, and the griffin dives down through the canopies, flaps its antlers as a brake, and touches down in a meadow."

          "description": "Every baker in the last bush carries a tiny spoon as Detective Morse lies down and winks to the builders, while Griff, the small elf, sits down, bumping into the shelf and igniting a bonfire that extinguishes itself before he arrives at the Cave. Larry and his cousins crawl under the stationary bathtub towards a drawing of a thin gentleman holding a laptop and whispering, which he tosses against a fence. The drawing pushes forward, and they exit from the secret closet where a bat flies over them, and the girls taste alien soup. Tony chews the soup, Pete throws one, and bubbles pop from Larry's elbows. Inside the pantry, the snow swirls up and fireworks glow as the parade marches around Neverland Village, with white-draped wizards playing inside the castle turrets. A large cat trots past the glass manor, hops up a dusty path toward a bent coral reef, which pushes down a trunk and flicks the cat, causing leaves to flutter. In a dining hall, she sneezes, then inside the fortress, the travelers chase Griff near the center of the cloudy ocean to a rocky peninsula bordered by a high mountain where Gordon taps his glowing wand, which floats sleepily. Gordon swiftly departs from Larry, glares at him silently, then, feeling ecstatic, dances beside Larry's knee, and Larry twists around as his assistants pull up their striped jackets. Tony looks delighted beside a timid passenger that hides beneath them, and everyone except Larry jumps forward as Pete gives Larry a tug. Slowly, Larry skips backward and dances to the passenger, which waves its tiny arms and shakes its lion-like mane. Griff drops a pebble while Gordon nudges to the rear, and Larry reaches out his tongue as Penelope hugs Pete's leg and they both appear amused. Larry strokes the passenger, and as Griff rubs its beak, it lowers its tiny arms and rests while Larry climbs up quickly to Michael's silky back, the unicycle-riding creature, part-camel, part-dragon, rising through the clouds. In the corner, Larry spots a canyon meandering its way up the cliff, the weak visions of the griffin pulling them even lower as they drift beneath the bridges and chimneys of Neverland Castle and glide below the misty meadow. The golden moon shines bright through the breezy winds, turning the currents of a narrow stream above them to a fiery orange as Larry, hopping over the creature's back, observes his shadow in the underbrush while Michael dives high over the meadow, one tiny knee just brushing the grass. Larry tenses, fearing the motion with a tiny frown crossing his nose, and folds his elbows tight but then releases hold of the silky back once more as the tiny arms lift them down and towards the canyon. At last, Griff whispers them forward, and the griffin hovers above the bushes, folds its arms as a brake, and rests in the field."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

          "description": "Professor Lupin nods to students as Hagrid accidentally extinguishes a re-lighting candle. Harry and friends approach a singing portrait, smashing her glass, then enter the common room. They experiment with magic sweets, causing steam to shoot from Harry's ears. Outside, a storm rages with Dementors hovering nearby. A bird flies to a willow tree, which swats it. In class, Hagrid leads students to a clearing where Malfoy smugly approaches Harry but turns frightened. With Ron's push, Harry bows to a magnificent creature, Buckbeak, who bows back. Malfoy tries to intervene, but Harry successfully pats Buckbeak, who takes off with Harry clinging on. They fly above Hogwarts, the lake turning steely gray beneath them. Harry eventually relaxes and enjoys the flight. Hagrid calls them back, and Buckbeak lands in a clearing."
