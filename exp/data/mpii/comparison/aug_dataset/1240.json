In the eerie silence of a postapocalyptic wasteland a hardened survivor scavenges through abandoned ruins haunted by the echoes of a oncethriving civilization now reduced to dust. Beneath the shimmering surface of an underwater kingdom a rebellious mermaid defies ancient traditions to explore forbidden coral reefs and secret caverns brimming with forgotten lore. In the quiet confines of a suburban attic an unassuming teenager stumbles upon a mysterious portal that thrusts him into a surreal world where the very fabric of time and space unravels. In training Brian and Peter watch Don and the Leeds team get off their bus. Peter marches into the Derby home dressing room where the Derby players tuck the white shirts of their home kit into their shorts and sit on benches as Brian strolls in standing at one end of the dressing room with his arms folded casting an eye over the players sat on benches lining the walls. He strolls to the far end of the dressing room kneels before a heavyfeatured sandyhaired lad looks him in the eye and the young man smiles bashfully and hangs his head as Brian rises to his feet looks around the other players and his eyes meet Dave Mackay's with whom he exchanges a respectful knowing nod. Straightening his tie as he turns and walks across the dressing room. Brian sits beside a darkhaired freshfaced guy who is rubbing his thighs in agitation apes a scared face and then beams at the rest of the team. Brian nudges his shoulder against the young players stands before the team and a smile spreads across his face as he looks around the players. The Derby players leap to their feet and roar redfaced then run out of the dressing room down the gloomy corridor and up the tunnel into the daylight on the pitch. As play gets underway the Leeds players in their away kit of blue shirts and yellow shorts pass the ball wide while in his dingy office. Brian smokes as he watches the clock with sunlight streaming in from the terraces through the narrow windows set high in the stark walls."

          "description": "Artie's parrots, Felix and Oliver, doodle on scraps of cardboard at Artie's counter as Artie observes the dancers from his garage threshold, looking nervous as he observes the band stretching out and keeps his anxious gaze locked on the dancers. Ted and Artie meander towards the band chatting around on the concert field, where the Manchester dancers, in orange group hoodies with their nicknames on their fronts, form a triangle facing Artie with burly blond Callum who slipped in the Championship Race meet beside wiry Morgan. The dancers trade annoyed glances as Artie charges at Callum and gestures firmly. Ted hurls a frisbee at Artie, who juggles it with his knees and shoulders, then whirls for the hoop and punts it in as Artie interacts with the band. Morgan trips Artie, and Ted assists him up while Callum sneers, snickering. Artie eavesdrops outside the storage area and later sits next to Alex on the band van as it drives into the Old Trafford lot with his band in their storage area, where Artie and Alex hug as they trail the bands up the hallway. Dan is profiled on radio, which Artie and Alex listen to. During rehearsals, Artie and Alex observe Dan and the Manchester band depart their van. Alex strides into the Sheffield home storage area, where the Sheffield members tuck the green sweaters of their home gear into their jeans and perch on crates as Artie ambles in, standing at one corner of the storage area with his arms crossed, scanning the members perched on crates lining the shelves. He ambles to the opposite corner of the storage area, crouches before a broad-featured, chestnut-haired guy, stares him in the eye, and the fellow grins shyly and bows his head as Artie stands up, glances around the other members, and his eyes meet Sam Harlow's with whom he trades a courteous, understanding nod. Adjusting his scarf as he pivots and paces across the storage area, Artie sits next to a curly-haired, youthful dude who's kneading his calves in distress, impersonates a frightened face, and then grins at the rest of the band. Artie bumps his elbow against the young members, stands before the band, and a grin spreads across his visage as he glances around the members. The Sheffield members spring to their feet and cheer, flushed, then dash out of the storage area, down the shadowy passage, and up the stairway into the brightness on the field. As the routine progresses, the Manchester members, in their alternate gear of red jerseys and white trousers, toss the frisbee far, while in his dim shed, Artie drinks coffee as he checks the time with moonlight streaming in from the terraces through the narrow shutters set high in the barren walls."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Jimmy and Brian join the Leeds players, identifiable by their purple tracksuits, on the training pitch. Brian criticizes Bremner, and after a playful moment with the ball, Giles floors Brian, causing Bremner to laugh. Later, Brian listens outside the dressing room and sits beside Peter on the bus to Elland Road, where they embrace as they follow the teams up the tunnel. Brian and Peter watch Don's interview on TV and observe the Leeds team arriving. Peter enters the Derby dressing room, where Brian assesses the players with a nod to Dave Mackay. He interacts with a young, nervous player, then boosts team morale with a smile, leading to cheers from the Derby players as they charge out to the pitch. As the game begins, Leeds players in blue and yellow pass the ball wide, while Brian watches the clock from his office, sunlight streaming in."
