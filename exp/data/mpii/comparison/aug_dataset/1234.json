After a few silent moments pass, he turns and departs from the unassuming clapboard house. Later, Ben abruptly cuts off his brother in mid-sentence. In the seclusion of his motel bathroom, he lies down fully clothed in a bathtub that is notably too short for his long frame. He tries to wriggle down into the water, but his head persistently remains well above the edge of the bath. Meanwhile, Emily is at home diligently working at her kitchen table, where she has documents stacked in various piles. She takes notes as she thoughtfully studies her writing pad.

Outside, Ben pauses momentarily, standing in front of the door with a noticeably dejected look on his face. After a few quiet moments pass, he turns away and departs from the modest clapboard house. Subsequently, Ben abruptly interrupts his brother in mid-sentence. In the privacy of his motel bathroom, he lies fully clothed in a bathtub that is uncomfortably too short for his tall stature. He wriggles his body in an attempt to submerge into the water, yet his head persistently remains above the bath's edge. Meanwhile, Emily is at her home, intently working at her kitchen table, where a variety of documents are neatly arranged in different piles. She takes meticulous notes as she attentively examines her writing pad. She reviews one document, then searches through other papers, methodically scribbling out a number on her pad before deliberately encircling another. Gazing down at the heap of documents with a look of despondency, Emily lets out a gentle sigh. She opens her Filofax and extracts Ben's business card, examining it with concern. Within the hospital ward, a doctor, clad in a spotless white coat, enters the room and approaches both the ice hockey coach and Ben before directly addressing Ben.

Ben gazes down despondently at his feet before lifting his eyes to stare straight ahead, his face etched with profound sorrow as he recalls a poignant memory. He envisions a man and a woman's hands bathed in radiant light, their fingers intertwined, lovingly caressing one another’s skin. Lying serenely in bed, the beautiful, dark-haired Sarah looks up warmly at Ben, who is beside her.

Once back, Connie appears visibly terrified as she forcefully pushes the door to a close in Ben's face, the sound echoing in the tense air, and hastily engages the lock, leaving Ben standing outside. He remains there for a moment, facing the door with a heavy heart and a look of dejection. After a brief pause, he turns away and departs from the modest clapboard house, his footsteps heavy with resignation. Later, Ben decisively interrupts his brother during a conversation, not allowing him to continue speaking. Subsequently, while in his motel bathroom, Ben lies down fully clothed inside a bathtub that is clearly too small for his tall frame. He futilely attempts to slide further down into it, but the length of the tub prevents him, leaving his head awkwardly protruding above the edge. Meanwhile, Emily is situated at home, diligently working at her kitchen table. The table is cluttered with documents piled in a small stack, and she is deeply focused, making notes. She pores over her pad with a thoughtful expression, then shifts her attention to a document, flipping through more papers in search of information. She scribbles out a number on her pad and carefully circles another, her brow furrowed in concentration. After studying the documents with a forlorn look, Emily lets out a sigh of frustration, opens her Filofax, retrieves Ben's business card, and examines it closely. In a different location, a doctor clad in a white coat strides into a hospital ward, walks over to where the ice hockey coach and Ben are seated, approaches Ben, and extends a hand in greeting, which Ben reciprocates, before the doctor exits the scene. George, standing nearby, responds to Ben's kind gaze with a slight, appreciative smile. In another hospital room, Ben uses his mobile to make a call while, in a different setting, Emily is finishing up drying the dishes in her kitchen. Holding his mobile tightly to his ear, Ben stands with a distressed expression overtaking his features. He then lowers the mobile slowly, closing it with a sense of resignation, before sitting down engulfed in deep, somber reflection. A nurse appears to call for him, and after acknowledging her presence, she departs. Ben lowers his gaze gravely, then gradually lifts his eyes to stare ahead, his face contorted with anguish as memories flood back—he envisions a man and woman's hands illuminated in bright light, their fingers gently interlaced as they tenderly caress each other’s skin. In another memory, the beautiful, dark-haired Sarah lies beside him in bed, casting a gentle smile up at Ben. Simultaneously, images of metal debris twirl and scatter in slow motion, a woman is tossed violently, and a van collapses on its side on a shadowy road. Ben suddenly regains awareness while lying on his stomach on the motel bed; he looks groggy, and a hand softly reaches from behind him to stroke his cheek. The ethereal figure of Sarah, dream-like, gradually reclines back down, leaving Ben in solitude on the bed, his mouth slightly ajar as he blinks sleepily. Meanwhile, Emily's neighbor is immersed in gardening activities when Emily approaches with Duke on a lead, proceeding to walk deliberately past her neighbor’s abundant display of colorful roses. Suddenly, she begins to struggle for breath, her face showing signs of distress. As Duke bounds energetically into her garden, Emily, appearing faint, blinks several times and moves towards her steps, but before she can reach them, she collapses forward onto the path, lying utterly still with her eyes closed. Meanwhile, Ezra Turner, utilizing a long white stick, methodically feels his way down a wide and lengthy flight of stairs. Once on the street, he carefully navigates along the pavements, the stick extended ahead of him to detect obstacles, moving with practiced precision."

Emily looks faint as Duke, her loyal golden retriever, bounds into her garden. Emily blinks and walks towards her steps, but she falls flat on her face on the path, motionless, with her eyes closed as her breathing becomes shallow.

He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
