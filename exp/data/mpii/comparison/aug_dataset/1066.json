Sarah and Drover are bathing in a basin in each other's embrace when Nullah leaps in, and they all feast contentedly outside in the evening dusk. Later, Sarah and Drover stand together in each other's embrace, kissing, and Sarah observes him ride away while a herd of steeds rumbles past the dwelling, driven by Drover. He dashes up to Sarah, waiting on the porch, and propels himself into her embrace, and they kiss fervently. Fletcher shoves Carney into a marsh with his firearm, and a crocodile attacks the cattle magnate. At dusk, Drover, in the saddle, leans down and kisses Sarah. The home and tidy, vibrant gardens of Faraway Downs are bathed in sunlight as a figure in crocodile footwear ties thread around a fly. Fletcher is sitting with a boot up on the dining table, and Sarah gazes at him in consternation. He sidles up and murmurs to her, then gestures to an array of javelins before she frowns as he departs. Bandy returns gradually back into the room, and Sarah turns worriedly to her. Nullah stands up on top of a water tower as Sarah observes his arrival from the verandah. He halts his steed, inspects his herd, then gallops off, and she awakens in bed, frowns, and then looks across at Drover lying next to her and smiles, running a hand down his bearded cheek and then down his hirsute, muscular torso. A wild steed is ridden, bucking, around a training ring, and he frowns at the boy while Nullah cringes behind a gate. Drover observes him depart, followed by his canine, and he frowns pensively while trimming his beard. Sarah is sitting in the tub, looking distressed as she listens morosely, frowning as he stands impassively on the verandah while birds glide over a rocky rise and Drover works a brumby in the paddock. He twirls a lariat as the wild steed canters around him and hurls the rope, which slips around the steed's neck; the brumby bucks wildly, attempting to get away. Bandy heats a brand in the fire and passes it to Sarah, who brands a bullock being held down, while Nullah, tending the steeds, looks up and sees his grandfather, exchanging hand gestures with him. In the paddock, Drover works the wild steed, hauling on the rope to prevent it from bucking, while Nullah looks at Sarah, then into her eyes, and across at his grandfather.

A wild horse is being ridden, bucking, around a training ring, and at the boy, frowns are made by him while behind a gate Nullah cowers.

A lariat is whirled by him as around him, a wild horse is cantered and a rope is launched, which is slipped around the horse's neck; the brumby bucks wildly, trying to get away. A brand is heated by Bandy in the fire and he passes it to Sarah, so that a steer being held down is branded by her, while looking up at his grandfather, Nullah exchanges hand gestures with him. In the paddock, Drover works the wild horse, the rope is hauled on by him to prevent bucking, while Sarah is looked at by Nullah, then her eyes are looked into by him, and his grandfather is looked across at.

          "description": "Insects drift over a desert which has turned blue as the snowy mountains have been replaced by streams, oceans and hills, and fireflies rise up the cliffs of the previously wet valley. Lucy and Baker are dancing in a garden in each other's hands when Tim leaps in, and they all sing joyfully inside in the morning dawn. Later, Lucy and Baker sit together in each other's hands, laughing, and Lucy observes him swim away while a pack of wolves howls past the cabin, led by Baker. He struts up to Lucy, resting on the hammock, and dives into her hands, and they laugh joyfully. Harper nudges Carter into a cave with his hat, and a shark approaches the farmer. At sunrise, Baker, on the tractor, reaches up and hugs Lucy. The cottage and vast, vibrant flowers of Neverland Meadows are drenched in rain as a silhouette in leather boots wraps yarn around a kite. Harper is reclining with a shoe up on the kitchen counter, and Lucy glares at him in disbelief. He strolls over and murmurs to her, then gestures to a collection of shields before she winces as he vanishes. Riley comes quickly back into the hall, and Lucy turns eagerly to them. Tim stands up on top of a watchtower as Lucy observes his departure from the balcony. He pauses his bicycle, inspects his flock, then cycles off, and she drifts off in a hammock, smiles, and then peers over at Baker resting next to her and grins, tracing a finger down his smooth cheek and then down his lean, delicate chest. A wild cat is wrestled, leaping, around a training circle, and he smiles at the child while Tim peers from behind a curtain. Baker observes him depart, followed by his cat, and he smiles thoughtfully while painting his hair. Lucy is sitting in the shower, feeling confused as she listens calmly, smiling as he stands excitedly on the balcony while insects crawl over a sandy dune and Baker plays a melody in the meadow. He swings a baton as the wild cat prowls around him and releases the tie, which wraps around the cat's leg; the feline leaps furiously, trying to escape. Riley cools a spoon in the water and hands it to Lucy, who spoons a calf being held down, while Tim, watching the cattle, looks up and sees his aunt, sharing nods with her. In the meadow, Baker plays with the wild cat, tugging on the tie to prevent it from leaping, while Tim looks at Lucy, then into her smile, and across at his aunt. The feline prances towards Baker, who extends his foot to it, while holding on to Tim, Lucy glances around, and the ocean behind her is full."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Sarah and Drover bathe together until Nullah joins them, and they later share a peaceful outdoor meal. Drover rides away, returning to passionately kiss Sarah as horses thunder by. Fletcher pushes Carney into a swamp, leading to a crocodile attack. The sunlight shines on Faraway Downs, where Fletcher whispers to Sarah, unsettling her. Nullah, atop a water tower, arrives as Sarah watches, and she later wakes beside Drover, smiling tenderly at him. A bucking wild horse is trained by Drover, who frowns thoughtfully. Sarah, upset in the bath, listens while Drover works a brumby, expertly looping a lariat around its neck to train it. Bandy gives Sarah a brand to mark a steer, as Nullah exchanges gestures with his grandfather. Nullah and Sarah watch Drover tame the horse, while Sarah glances at Nullah and his grandfather. The brumby approaches Drover as he extends his hand, with Nullah and Sarah by his side, observing an empty plain."
