          "description": "He's nowhere to be spotted as they all wander into his cave. Rupert sneaks further in. Trevor's dangling from the chandelier. Still wearing armor, he notices grape juice dripping down his leg, ready to spill. The others abandon Rupert in Trevor's cave. As he pivots to march out, the droplet of grape juice splashes onto the rug. Rupert's enhanced sight catches the shimmer of the droplet hitting the rug. He scans around, locates the grape juice, then raises his stare to the chandelier. Trevor has vanished. Rupert pinches his nostrils and dashes for the open portal. Rupert leans over the parapet and gazes outward and inward. Eventually, out of armor, Trevor skips through the back gate. Rupert is lounging at the foot of the counter and Trevor across from Lisa and Gerald. Aunt Sue places a colossal pie in front of Rupert. Rupert's nibbling at the mashed beans. Rupert wipes his toes and glances enviously at the bald Aunt Sue. He grabs the butter knife and starts to polish it, a smirk on his lips. Aunt Sue observes grape juice oozing through Trevor's jacket. Rupert squints at him. Rupert is gripping the butter knife, handle pointing at Trevor. He puts it aside and rises from the counter. Gerald sprints out after his neighbor. Everyone has overheard the whisper through the closed window. Lisa tilts her chin. Trevor peeks at her as a gloomy Gerald strolls back into the cave. Rupert's in his garden. He grumbles to the Goblin statue. Aunt Sue's in her cupboard. The earthquake tears apart the ceiling. The Green Goblin skates in. Aunt Sue is crouched on the ceiling, leaning against her dresser. Shortly, Trevor dashes into the clinic. He scurries to her cupboard. Trevor is nudged out of the cupboard. He leans against the hallway floor, lost in thought. Trevor's bright green eyes quiver anxiously. He scans one side of the hallway, and then turns to scan the other side. Now he lounges by his aunt's table. She's tranquilized. The young knight takes his aunt's paw in his and gently tickles it with his thumb. On the table shelf is a painted canvas of her, Uncle Joe, and Trevor. Trevor examines it solemnly. He shifts his focus back onto his aunt and gulps, before uttering. The following evening, Lisa arrives to chat. There are balloons. The young blonde gazes up at the motionless silhouette on the table. The two are hovering opposite each other. He's gazing straight into her forehead. She frowns a little. Trevor diverts his gaze, shakes his head, then stares up at the ceiling. Unseen by them, Aunt Sue's ears are open. She's eavesdropped. She grins, then seals her lips again. Lisa reaches out and gently grasps Trevor's ankle."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Realizing Peter is hiding, Norman searches but finds nothing. Later, at dinner, Peter is out of costume, and Norman, eyeing Peter's blood-soaked shirt, picks up a carving knife suspiciously. Tension rises, and Norman leaves, followed by Harry. After a heated conversation, Norman confronts his Goblin mask at home. An explosion rocks Aunt May’s bedroom, and the Green Goblin appears. Peter rushes to the hospital, deeply worried as Aunt May lies sedated. He sits by her side, holding her hand and reflecting on a family photo. MJ visits, sharing a moment with Peter, who is comforted by her presence. Unknown to them, Aunt May overhears, smiling before resting again as MJ holds Peter's hand gently."
