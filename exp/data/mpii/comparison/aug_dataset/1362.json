          "description": "Jacob departs the elevator entrance and strolls into the tunnel, trailed by the bewildered painting crew. As Clara appears astonished, the drums in the kitchen cabinets start drumming wildly, and realizing her triumph, Clara laughs and pulls the telescope for Jacob's hat. On the projector, there is a slightly amused stare from Jacob, but he hoists the dog's tail and nibbles the yogurt off it. As Jacob gestures to the projector, he's tugged into the yogurt garden, and the dogs yank off his jacket. Jacob strolls in, drenched in yogurt, to discover Clara sitting there, legs crossed, quietly containing her joy, and she strolls away. Confounded by her demeanor, he trails. Zoom in on Oliver, wearing a cheerful expression, Clara nods, uneasy. Carefully placed plastic moons and stars obscure her shoes. Clara shields the turtle's ears, then gazes away, but a second later, she's peeking back through the curtain, to see Martin walk out of the closet. Clara leans closer to see Martin start knitting, wearing just a blanket, and she stares. Jacob approaches them, and she turns and strolls away. Clara enters her garage, and Jacob trails her. Martin, in a blue chef’s uniform, chats on the radio while organizing recipe cards. Jacob picks up the receiver and eavesdrops. Clara scowls at him, but she can't prevent him. A worried gaze from Clara as the radio buzzes, she considers, glances at the radio again, and she answers the radio. A puzzled glance from Martin as he chats on the radio. Clara pauses, there is a lengthy silence, and then Jacob disconnects the radio and urges her out of the garage. Evening has descended on the bungalow courtyard as Clara enters, looking stunning in a green evening gown and slippers, and she clutches his elbow. Altering strategies, Clara slides into artist mode, drawing her thumb up and down his back, leans toward him alluringly, gives him a stare, leans in nearer, and then he pushes her aside. Jacob vaults over the recliner and conceals himself as Clara steps over to the entrance and opens it. Martin stands there, and she urges him out of the entrance. Clara realizes she's spoken aloud and blushes, anticipating Jacob's directions, she grabs a feather and begins dusting his shorts. The stadium spotlight follows the kid catching the butterfly, then finds Clara and Martin, pans over to them, and it appears like Clara is giving Martin an enthusiastic handshake. The entire auditorium, musicians included, halt what they're performing and gaze. Martin gives a nod and strides toward his bungalow. Clara pretends to enter her apartment until she observes Martin shut his back door, then she rotates and dashes over to Jacob and wraps her hands around him, hugging him, and Jacob steps back, somewhat bewildered."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Mike shows a puzzled look on the monitor before licking Jello off a girl's finger and getting pulled into a Jello pool. Abby, containing her rage, walks off, followed by a confused Mike. Abby, uncomfortable, nods gravely at Stuart. She later sneaks a peek at Colin, who steps out of the shower and starts flossing in a towel. Mike approaches Abby, who enters her office with him following. Colin, in a doctor's jacket, is on the phone, and Mike listens in despite Abby's disapproval. Abby answers a phone call with concern, but Mike hangs up and rushes her out. Night falls as Abby, in a little black dress, seductively approaches Mike but is shoved away. Abby switches tactics as Colin arrives, but Mike hides, and she hustles Colin out. Abby mistakenly acts on Mike's instructions, leading to a stadium camera mistakenly capturing an intimate moment with Colin, drawing the entire stadium's attention. Colin waves and leaves, while Abby rushes to embrace Mike, who pulls back uncomfortably."
