Jay and Kay get out, appearing as very undercover cops working for a secretive government agency that deals with extraterrestrial matters, and Jay starts up the driveway while Kay pulls a black card, marked with the insignia of the Men in Black organization, from his wallet and extends it to Beatrice as she draws close.

It's Dr. Laurel Weaver, the former forensic pathologist who tried to speak to Jay before. Laurel signs his clipboard, which is standard procedure for documenting autopsies, gives him a dirty look, but he laughs and leaves. She goes to the stretcher, bends down, and gently pets Rosenberg's cat, which has been unusually calm despite the chaos, indicative of its extraterrestrial origin. She looks up to see Jay and Kay standing there, then goes to the Arquillian's body on a table under the lights, throws back a sheet revealing the fully dissected Arquillian, a species known for its delicate political ties to Earth, and begins to examine it. Jay and Laurel cross the room to where Rosenberg's corpse, known as a respected jeweler in New York City who secretly brokered peace between alien factions, lies on another gurney, and she snaps her rubber gloves and reaches down, sinking her hands into the body as she moves things aside, which by Jay's expression, is very disgusting.

Beatrice looks much better than before more nicely dressed with a touch of makeup and a smile on her face.

Kay is in the hole where the ship landed investigating with a pocket spectral analyzer over a section of scorched earth and above him. A tiny little green man gravely wounded but not quite dead staggers up out of a small control room inside Rosenberg's head with gearshifts and viewing screens all around the inside of the skull.

          "description": "The rhinoceros rolls to a halt at the base of the escalator leading to Fiona's lighthouse, where the pirate ship docked, and the damaged scooter is still present. Max and Leo hop out, appearing as rather obvious lifeguards, and Max prances up the escalator while Leo fishes a purple feather from his satchel and presents it to Fiona as she drifts near. Fiona appears much happier than before, splendidly dressed, with a touch of glitter and a grin on her lips. In the workshop, Max slurps some of her iced tea and grimaces as a small chuckle slips past her at the notion. Leo is in the crater where the ship docked, inspecting with a handheld kaleidoscope over a patch of singed sand, and above him, Max peers over, gazing down as Leo glances up at him and the kaleidoscope changes hues from blue to orange, then pink, and teal. It's Dr. Clara Sands, the lady who attempted to sing to Max earlier. Clara sketches on his notepad, shoots him a scornful glare, but he chuckles and departs. She approaches the hammock, leans over, and tenderly strokes Galileo's dog. She glances up to spot Max and Leo standing there, then heads to the Martian's torso on a counter beneath the lamps, flips back a quilt revealing the fully unraveled Martian, and starts to scrutinize it. Max and Clara wander across the space to where Galileo's dummy rests on another dais, and she flicks her velvet mitts and bends down, plunging her fingers into the dummy as she shifts items aside, which by Max's expression, is quite revolting. From across the chamber, Leo clears his nose, and Max strolls across the pantry to Leo, who is still scrutinizing the Martian. Max pivots and sprints across the area to reunite with her, leans down, and notices peculiar threading around the edge of Galileo's shoe. He stretches out, prods the shoe, rotates it, and with a gentle tug, the shoe detaches from the foot like a clasp. Max pulls once more, and Galileo's entire visage ejects with a robotic whirr and pivots open, the entire face swiveling away from the rest of the artificial cranium. A minute violet alien, gravely injured but not entirely lifeless, totters up out of a tiny cockpit inside Galileo's head, with joysticks and display panels all around the inside of the cranium. The Zeptonian nods enthusiastically, nods again, collapses, and perishes. Leo and Max are not observing Clara when ZAP! Without even glancing at her, Leo whips out his illuminator and erases her memory."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

          "description": "The LTD stops at Beatrice's farmhouse, where an alien ship landed. Jay and Kay, appearing as undercover cops, approach Beatrice, who looks better dressed and smiles. Inside, Jay sips lemonade while Kay analyzes scorched earth where the ship landed. Dr. Laurel Weaver, who previously spoke to Jay, examines Rosenberg's dissected body. She pets his cat and continues her examination despite Jay's disgust. Jay notices strange stitching around Rosenberg's ear and discovers a mechanical latch. He pulls it, revealing a small, wounded green man operating Rosenberg's mechanical skull. The alien nods before collapsing and dying. Without noticing Laurel, Kay flashes his neuralyzer, erasing her memory."
