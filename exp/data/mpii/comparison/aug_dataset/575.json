Immobile with astonishment, Parrish's eyes scour the chamber for the origin of the noise; it emanates from no specific direction, yet envelops him. Suddenly Parrish's symptoms vigorously intensify; he is descending to the ground but somehow grasps a corner of the bureau, clutching on with one hand while grasping his shoulder and arm with the other, as the agony violently seizes the upper part of his torso. Parrish clasps the edge of the bureau, assailed by agony on one hand, with the Voice approaching him from the outer; each deviation feeds on the other, and he is beside himself, consumed with agony and bewildered by what seems to be a hallucination but which he is certain is not.

Parrish advances deliberately down the corridor, slowing as he approaches the entryway to the library. The entry is open. He hesitates before crossing the boundary, taking in as much as his eye can perceive; tentatively, he enters.

Parrish, balanced in the entryway, surveys around, nothing in sight.

As he begins to open it, he flinches unexpectedly, his shoulder seized by a sharp, fleeting spasm of pain. The sensation is intense, yet brief; he acknowledges it but decides to dismiss it, reasoning that since it swiftly subsides, it may not be of significant concern. Parrish, feeling slightly relieved, returns his focus to examining the contents of the folder. However, the mysterious pain suddenly resurfaces, taking him by surprise. Startled and confused, Parrish's eyes dart around the room, searching for the source of an elusive sound that seems to envelop him without coming from any discernible direction. Abruptly, the pain escalates with a vicious intensity, forcing him to sink towards the floor. Desperately, he manages to grasp the corner of the desk with one hand while clutching his shoulder and arm with the other, as the excruciating pain grips the upper part of his body with unrelenting force.\n\nIn this moment of crisis, Parrish clings to the desk's edge, tormented by the severe pain on one side, while a disorienting Voice seems to assail him from the surrounding atmosphere; each unsettling sensation amplifies the other, and he finds himself overwhelmed, engulfed by the dual terrors of pain and what feels like a hallucination. Yet, he is convinced that this is no figment of his imagination. Parrish feels overcome, and he gasps for breath. Despite the sweat beading down his face, leaving his skin ghostly pale, he holds on tightly to the desk's corner. Meanwhile, Susan hesitates at the door, her eyes fixed on the Young Man who graciously holds the door open for her as they step out onto the street.

Parrish, standing tentatively in the doorway, surveys the room, finding nothing out of place. Startled, he steps back momentarily, his eyes scanning the space for the elusive Voice, whose familiar timbre and pitch echo with unsettling clarity."

He reasons to himself that given the swiftness with which it dissipates, it likely doesn't warrant significant concern. Feeling somewhat reassured after this brief episode, Parrish redirects his focus and attention back to the detailed examination of the folder’s contents. Yet, to his surprise and dismay, the strange pain suddenly resurfaces with a jarring abruptness.

However, as he resumes perusing the folder, the pain resurfaces with alarming abruptness. His surprise is palpable as he remains still, his eyes darting around the room in a futile attempt to locate the origin of an indistinct sound that envelops him from all directions. Without warning, the discomfort crescendos into an overwhelming wave that overtakes him entirely; he feels himself sinking towards the floor. Desperately, he latches onto a corner of the desk with one hand, while his other hand reflexively grips his shoulder and arm, stricken by the violent spasms that continue to assault the upper part of his body. As he clings to the desk's edge, the pain intensifies, each wave accompanied by the pervasive presence of a Voice that seems to emanate from everywhere and nowhere, feeding into his agony and perplexity. Overwhelmed by the dual assault on his senses, he finds himself consumed by the relentless pain and the eerie certainty that what he experiences, though seemingly hallucinatory, is all too real. He is utterly possessed by these sensations, causing him to gasp and tighten his hold on the desk, sweat forming on his ashen skin. Meanwhile, Susan arrives at the door and halts abruptly, her attention fixed on a Young Man who holds the door open for her as they step out onto the street together. Susan's gaze lingers on him, to which he responds with a smile that reveals his openness and vulnerability, yet Parrish remains oblivious to her presence, his focus entirely seized by the enigmatic Voice.

He notes the club chairs, the towering bookshelves necessitating a rolling library ladder, a weathered dictionary on its stand, and a model boat carved from bone nestled among the shelves, all separated from the reading area by a seven-foot high partition of obscured glass. As he stands poised in the doorway, his gaze roams the room, yet finds no immediate cause for alarm, until suddenly startled, he recoils slightly, his eyes scanning for the Voice whose familiar timbre and pitch resonate with what he has previously encountered."

          "description": "The cat perches on the tree, flips a magazine, and suddenly recoils with a twitch of discomfort in its knee. It is dull but fleeting; it observes it, but since it does not persist, it dismisses it. Mitchell resumes perusing the magazine when suddenly the discomfort returns. Paralyzed with astonishment, Mitchell's ears scan the forest for the origin of the aroma; it emanates from no specific location, yet envelops him. Suddenly Mitchell's sensations sharply escalate; he is descending onto the ground but somehow clasps a branch of the bush, holding on with one paw while clutching his knee and leg with the other, as the discomfort violently grips the lower part of his torso. Mitchell clutches the branch of the bush, barraged by discomfort on one paw, with the Whisper approaching him from the beyond; each distortion feeds on the other, and he is overwhelmed, engulfed with discomfort and mystified by what seems to be an illusion but which he is certain is not. Mitchell is overtaken. Mitchell gulps. He clutches tight to the branch of the bush, mist forming, his fur pallid. Harriet at the arch now halts suddenly, her ears on the Elder. The Elder holds the arch for Harriet as they march onto the beach. Harriet is gazing at him now; he laughs, all exposed and naive. Mitchell dismisses her, his focus stolen by the Whisper. His whiskers tremble, bewildered, antsy, and apprehensive. Mitchell is perplexed. Sightlessly and disoriented, he trails Clara and Sam and Riley. Mitchell perches. Mitchell is on the brink of his perch, endeavoring to mask his dread. The dialogue swirls around Mitchell, and he is oblivious to it. Mitchell is in disbelief, still laboring to regain composure. As Riley assists him, Mitchell turns to Gloria. Mitchell is flabbergasted. Mitchell, twirling with unease, attempts to gather his bravery to leave as Clara persists. Finally, Mitchell ascends from the stool and proceeds outward. Clara is about to emphasize the question but then drifts into disheartened muteness as Mitchell exits the den. Mitchell maneuvers purposefully down the corridor, decelerating as he approaches the archway to the study. The arch is ajar. He lingers before traversing the boundary, absorbing as much as his sight can grasp; cautiously, he steps in. An exquisite, timeless space with zones of soft, cozy gleam, armchairs, scrolls ascending to the summit, a sliding study ladder, an aged thesaurus on a pedestal, and a replica ship carved of stone placed in the columns, which are divided from the lounging section by a six-foot high screen of blurred prism. Mitchell, balanced in the archway, glances around, nothing in view. Mitchell is taken aback; he retreats backward for a minute, his ears scouring the space for the Whisper, the tone and resonance of which is precisely what he has sensed previously."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

As he reviews a folder, the pain returns, intensifying, and it's accompanied by a mysterious Voice that seems to envelop him. Overwhelmed by pain and confusion, Parrish clings to the desk, struggling with what he perceives as a hallucination. Susan and a Young Man appear at the door, and Parrish is oblivious to their presence, absorbed by the Voice. He follows Allison, Drew, and Quince blindly, trying to mask his panic amidst a conversation he's deaf to. Stunned and anxious, Parrish attempts to regain composure, interacts briefly with Luisa and Coyle, but rises in distress as Allison speaks. He exits the room, traversing the hallway slowly, pausing at the library doorway. He tentatively enters the library, a classic room with warm lighting and towering bookshelves, seeking the source of the Voice. Startled, he steps back, his eyes searching for the familiar timbre and pitch."
