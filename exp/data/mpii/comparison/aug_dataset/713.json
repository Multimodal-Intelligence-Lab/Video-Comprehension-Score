Smiling, her head is lowered by Rose, and her lips are licked. The top of his sketchpad is peered over by Jack, a line is drawn, and, looking from the paper to Rose, sketches are made by him.

Jack smiles as a shadow under Rose's breasts is darkened by him, while Jack is gazed at by Rose as he draws.

Rose stares expressionless, and gradually, wrinkles form around her eyes, and her older self is transformed into by her. Her is stared at by the crew members and Rose's granddaughter, Lizzie, and smiles are exchanged by Brock and Lizzie. The drawing is signed and dated by Jack, then it is blown on, his sketchbook is closed, and it is handed to Rose. A kiss is shared by them. Later, a sheet of paper is written on by Rose, and Jack steps up to her. The case holding the Heart of the Ocean is handed to him by her. The next room is walked into by Jack, and the case is slid into the safe by him. In the first-class smoking room, Lovejoy approaches Cal, who stands, as the Titanic moves slowly.

A door is opened by Lovejoy, and glimpses of Jack and Rose are caught by him, who walk faster, prompting them to be followed by him. The elevator is run to by Jack and Rose, the elevator is dashed into, and the grate is slid shut by the operator. Lovejoy runs up to the elevator, his hands are slammed against the grate by him, and as the elevator descends, they are glared at through glass by Lovejoy.

Jack's expression lights up with satisfaction as he darkens the shadow beneath Rose's breasts, his gaze meeting hers as she watches him work. With a deft touch, Jack uses his finger to rub and soften areas of the charcoal drawing, paying special attention to Rose's hand, forehead, and face. As Rose sits, her gaze fixed and unchanging, delicate wrinkles begin to emerge around her eyes, gradually transforming her into her older self. Observing this shift, the crew members and Rose's granddaughter, Lizzie, turn their attention toward her. Brock and Lizzie share a knowing smile.

Fleeing quickly, Jack and Rose make a beeline for an elevator, racing inside just as the operator slides the grate shut. Lovejoy reaches the elevator too late, slamming his hands against the metal barrier as he watches them descend, his glare piercing through the glass. In defiance, Rose raises her middle finger at him, following it with a wave. Undeterred, Lovejoy hurries toward the staircase.

          "description": "Tom gestures toward the hammock, and Lily glides to the hammock, then hops onto it. Lily hangs one arm along the edge of the hammock, rests her hand on the cushion behind her head, and taps her left hand near her nose. Grinning, Lily tilts her head and nibbles her nails. Tom squints over the top of his tablet, scribbles a curve, and, glancing from the screen to Lily, he doodles.

Tom grins as he emphasizes a line under Lily's necklace, while Lily watches Tom as he doodles. With his palm, Tom smudges various parts of the pastel drawing, including Lily's wrist, chin, and nose. Lily gazes blankly, and gradually, creases form around her cheeks, and she morphs into her elder version. The team members and Lily's nephew, Carrie, gaze at her, and Doug and Carrie swap grins. Tom initials and dates the doodle, then blows on it, snaps his tablet shut, and offers it to Lily. They hug. Later, Lily scrawls on a piece of parchment, and Tom approaches her.

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
