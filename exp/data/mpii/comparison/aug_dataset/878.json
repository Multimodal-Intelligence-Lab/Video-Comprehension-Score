She makes her way purposefully to the kitchen, where her eyes fall upon a plate littered with cigarette ends, carelessly left on the table. With a sigh, she picks up the plate, diligently disposing of the cigarette butts into the trash bin.

With tenderness, Kate kisses her fingertips and gently touches Zoe's forehead, then lowers the valance sheet, concealing Zoe once more. Rising to her feet, Kate walks slowly out of the bedroom, pausing as she reaches the door. She hesitates, decides against closing it, and leaves it ajar.\n\nThe following day, Kate and Zoe are seen walking together down the bustling street towards a nearby restaurant.

Placing the bowl nearby, he inhales the fresh scent of the basil before he begins to meticulously pick the leaves. Offering the enticing bunch to Zoe, he encourages her to smell it herself. Noticing this interaction, Kate pauses in her conversation to watch as Nick hands a portion of the basil to Zoe. Though hesitant at first, the young girl eventually joins in, assisting him in picking the leaves.

          "description": "Kate arrives home and, upon opening the door, immediately casts her gaze around the room with a frown etched on her face. Her eyes scan her surroundings as she moves purposefully toward the kitchen, where she is greeted by the sight of a plate filled with cigarette ends casually resting on the table. She approaches the table, reaches out to grab the plate, and methodically carries it over to the bin. With a decisive motion, she tips the plate, allowing the cigarette butts to cascade into the bin. Satisfied with her small act of tidiness, Kate's attention is then drawn to the clock positioned above the stove. She observes the time, mentally noting it, then departs from the kitchen, making her way down the hall. Her destination is Zoe's bedroom, where upon arrival, she discovers that Zoe has ingeniously created a den for herself underneath the bed. Kate gives a nod of acknowledgment, her eyes narrowing slightly as she bends down to peer into the cozy space. Her gaze takes in the collection of several stuffed toys clustered around Zoe. Zoe, in response to her aunt's presence, gives a brief nod before shifting her gaze away, avoiding further eye contact. Observing this, Kate's hopeful smile gradually fades, replaced by a look of sadness as she gazes down at her niece. In an unexpected moment of connection, Zoe turns her attention back to Kate and offers a faint, tentative smile. In a gesture filled with tenderness, Kate kisses her own fingers and gently taps them against Zoe's forehead, a silent sign of affection and reassurance. With that, she reaches for the edge of the valance sheet and carefully pulls it down, effectively obscuring Zoe from view. Standing up with deliberate slowness, Kate turns and begins to walk out of the bedroom, her steps measured and intentional, and pauses at the doorway, initially intent on closing the door. However, at the last moment, she reconsiders, changes her mind, and leaves the door ajar. The transition to the next day finds Kate and Zoe walking side by side down the street, their destination a nearby restaurant. As they step inside, Paula glances up, acknowledging their entrance with a nod. Kate gently leads Zoe through the restaurant and into the bustling kitchen. Inside the kitchen, Zoe finds herself seated on a worktop, her legs swinging back and forth in unison with her growing boredom, while Kate engages in animated conversation with Leah. Meanwhile, Nick, having overheard Kate and Leah's chat, turns his attention to a shelf located behind Zoe and begins a search. He soon discovers a bowl and a bunch of basil, which he retrieves with a sense of purpose. Approaching Zoe, he places the bowl beside her and sniffs the aromatic basil before methodically picking the leaves off. With a friendly gesture, he offers the bunch to Zoe, who leans in and takes a tentative sniff. Observing this interaction from a distance, Kate notices Nick speaking to Zoe and carefully watches as he hands her a small handful of basil leaves. Although Zoe hesitates initially, she soon joins in the activity, helping him pick the remaining leaves. As this unfolds, Paula briefly enters the kitchen, surveys the scene, and then retreats back into the restaurant. The day progresses, and later, Nick stands by the stove, emptying a pan brimming with spaghetti and tomato sauce into a large pasta bowl, which he then carries over to join Zoe, who continues to sit in her perch. Zoe watches Nick with a mix of curiosity and shyness as he sprinkles the basil leaves over his portion of pasta, expertly winds the spaghetti around his fork, and begins to eat. Her eyes linger on the meal with a hunger that is unmistakable. As a waiter calls out to the kitchen, Nick, sensing the opportunity, hands the inviting bowl of spaghetti to Zoe before returning to his duties. He remains watchful, observing her as she gazes down at the pasta, longing evident in her expression. Zoe glances over at Nick briefly before returning her focus to the dish in front of her, finally summoning the courage to gingerly pick up the fork and take a hesitant mouthful. As she tastes the spaghetti, her initial caution gives way to enthusiasm, and she begins to eat hungrily, her face lighting up with delight as she grins at Nick. As this heartwarming scene unfolds, Kate re-enters the kitchen, securing her apron around her waist, only to gape in surprise as she witnesses Zoe enthusiastically devouring the bowl of spaghetti, a sight that fills the room with an unexpected and heartening sense of normalcy and joy."

          "description": "Samantha stumbles into the park and glances around with a grin, skipping her way to the library where a mountain of crayons piles on the bookshelf. She grabs them and tosses the crayons into the trashcan. Samantha gazes at a painting above the fireplace and then dances her way down the path to Oliver's tent, where Oliver has constructed himself a fort inside the closet. Samantha shakes her head, then peers into the closet to see that Oliver has several rubber ducks with him. Oliver gives a slight shake of his head and looks toward his uncle, and Samantha's grin widens as she looks upward victoriously. Oliver turns back to Samantha and gives a broad grin. Samantha claps her hands and touches Oliver's cheek before pulling the curtain shut, hiding Oliver from sight. Samantha leaps up, skips joyfully out of the tent, and pretends to close the gate behind her but rethinks it and leaves it open. The following morning, Samantha and Oliver skip through the meadow towards the museum. Parker gazes down as they invade the museum, and Samantha guides Oliver towards the gallery. Inside, a restless Oliver balances on a stool, kicking his feet, while Samantha jokes with Liam, and Chris, who has eavesdropped, rummages on a cabinet behind Oliver and pulls out a vase and sprig of mint. He sets the vase next to Oliver, sniffs the mint, and starts to pluck the twigs, then hands the sprig out to Oliver, who inhales it. Samantha notices Chris interacting with Oliver and observes as he offers her a handful of mint, and although the child stalls, she begins to assist him in plucking the twigs. Parker rushes in and then retreats to the museum. Subsequently, Chris pours a bowl of cereal and honey into a massive salad platter and hops over to where Oliver is perching, joining him with the cereal. Oliver observes him a little awkwardly as Chris scatters some of the mint sprigs over his dish, twirls the cereal around his spoon, and starts to munch. Oliver eyes the snack eagerly, and when a janitor interrupts the gallery, Chris passes the platter of cereal to Oliver and resumes his task, eyeing her as she glances down wistfully at the salad. Oliver glances over at Chris, then back at the cereal and hesitantly grabs the spoon to take a bite. Chris keeps an eye on her as she digs in eagerly to the cereal and beams at him. Wandering back into the gallery, Samantha grabs her scarf and wraps it around her neck, marveling in amusement as she spots Oliver devouring the platter of cereal."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby cafÃ©, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

She checks the clock before visiting her niece, Zoe, who has made a den under her bed with stuffed toys. Kate's initial smile fades as Zoe briefly acknowledges her, but a faint smile from Zoe prompts Kate to tenderly touch Zoe's forehead before leaving the door open. The following day, Kate and Zoe head to a restaurant. In the kitchen, Zoe, initially bored, becomes engaged when Nick offers her basil to smell and pick. Later, Nick shares his spaghetti meal with Zoe, who eagerly begins to eat, showing a newfound enthusiasm. When Kate returns, she's surprised to see Zoe enjoying the food."
