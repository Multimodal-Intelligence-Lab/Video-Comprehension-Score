          "description": "Daphne shuffles her way over to Samuel, and he leads her into a cupboard where Samuel and Daphne are left isolated again. Samuel guides Daphne into the kitchen and strolls over to the cupboard. Later, Daphne is lounging knitting in her cupboard when Nancy darts to peer out the cupboard at a tractor that's appeared. The gathering is later navigating its ascent up a narrow hill leading to a humble cottage with wildly overgrown hedges. Mistress Eleanor is holding court in her kitchen, reclining on a plain, stool-like chair, and glances at Daphne, who is squeezed between Nancy and Master Arthur on a bench. Mistress Eleanor tilts one nostril and shifts her gaze to Samuel, and as she turns to Daphne, her smirk vanishes and she frowns intensely. Nancy, Samuel, and Daphne are shown wandering outside in the hedges, in the cottage, Jonathan rises from his lump, comes to hover over Daphne, makes no attempt to make any further inquiries, and traipses slowly and deliberately over to the cupboard, where he stands with his knees to the blanket. Daphne glances at Hawkins as Jonathan turns to peer at her and grins, but then Jonathan pivots back to the cupboard, blank-faced. It's a dim, rainy morning with the jagged rocky cliffs of the Scottish highlands spreading out to the fog line, as Daphne ambles alone absorbing the bleak scene. She absentmindedly taps the branch of a small shrub as she passes by, proceeds on under the sparse canopy of twigs, and gazes up into the boughs that shield her from the moon's glare. Jonathan, sailing his carriage through the desert, is a picture of chaos in his beanie and denim jacket, and upon spotting Daphne, brings his carriage to a standstill, never diverting his eyes from her. Daphne halts, casually folding her legs in front of her, glaring up rebelliously at Jonathan, who appears clumsy and jolts his carriage on. They proceed down the boulevard of shrubs at a gallop, as Daphne observes them, not quite comprehending what to make of the meeting. Later, Hawkins reclines with Daphne as she sketches the sculpture, while in a neighboring cupboard, Mistress Eleanor is observing, with Jonathan, Samuel, and Nancy leaning on a counter close to her. Jonathan heads in to accompany Daphne and Hawkins, and they exchange an intense smile. At the chiming of the rear doorbell, Daphne places down her brush, rises from the craft table, and checks that her shoes are fastened as the gardener brings Jonathan in. He salutes awkwardly, the gardener bows and exits the cupboard, and Daphne reclines on a cushion. A rather uneasy pause follows between them, with neither quite managing to meet the other's gaze, until eventually, Jonathan slides out a stool and perches down."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
