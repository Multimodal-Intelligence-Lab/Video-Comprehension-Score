For a fleeting moment, Gandhi absentmindedly folds his hands, then proceeds to stand, turning his attention and movement towards Ba's side. He gently kneels beside her, his presence causing Ba's eyes to flutter open with a gentle motion. She extends her hand toward him, an invitation he accepts by taking her hand into his own. When he attempts to release her hand, she tightens her grip, prompting Gandhi to pause in his actions, and then he deliberately chooses to sit, positioning himself next to her with her hand resting on his lap. In a quiet exchange, he locks eyes with Mirabehn across the room and offers a nod, silently signaling for her to proceed. Responding to this, Mirabehn weakly smiles in acknowledgment, moves closer to Ba, and gives her a tender, farewell rub before she stands up fully. Patel, observing the unfolding scene, stands as well to make way for Mirabehn, allowing her to pass by him with grace and continue walking down the corridor alongside Azad. As they depart, Patel casts a glance back at Gandhi, who remains seated with his gaze fixed on the floor, absorbed in an empty stare while still holding onto Ba's hand. A fly momentarily disrupts the stillness as it traverses a small section of the floor, illuminated by a sliver of dying sunlight. Meanwhile, Gandhi continues to sit there, his demeanor unchanged, as he clutches Ba's hand and stares vacantly into space. The doctor makes his entrance, appearing in the doorway and pausing momentarily to offer Gandhi an amiable nod, which Gandhi does not seem to notice or respond to in any way. The doctor then moves quietly to Ba's other side, where he crouches down and gently lifts her wrist, seeking to feel her pulse. Holding it for a brief moment, doubt and a sense of fateful apprehension cross his features as he perceives the absence of life. With a glance at Ba, he slowly lowers her arm, acknowledging the reality before placing the branches of his stethoscope in his ears and laying the acoustic bell carefully over her heart. After a brief and telling moment, he slowly raises the stethoscope, his expression confirming the somber truth already felt by those present: there is no heartbeat to be found. He exchanges a silent glance with Pyarelal, who in response merely lowers his eyes, unable to meet the doctor's gaze. The doctor's attention then turns deliberately and slowly towards Gandhi, who remains utterly unchanged in posture, with Ba's hand still firmly in his lap and his eyes still fixed in a hollow stare at the floor. Yet, without notice, tears begin to stream down Gandhi's cheeks, a manifestation of his silent grief. The scene transitions to the funeral pyre, burning with an intensity that signifies the nearing completion of its solemn duty. Mirabehn, Patel, Azad, and Pyarelal stand in respectful silence alongside other prisoners and military wardens, their collective presence a tribute to both the dead and the living. Gandhi sits a short distance away from the pyre, enveloped in his shawl, his gaze unwaveringly fixed upon the dying embers, encapsulated in a profound and impenetrable isolation that suggests he may never rise again. Mirabehn watches him from afar, her own face streaked with tears. A piece of cloth catches the wind, shimmering in a stiff breeze, holding our attention in a moment of shared silence. This silence is soon broken by the growing sound of an aircraft, its engine noise increasing in volume. The camera slowly pulls back, revealing the cloth as an integral part of a pennant, firmly attached to the nose of the aircraft. The scene shifts from focusing on the pennant to capturing the aircraft as it comes to a halt before a reception area, where a carpet is rolled out with care toward the aircraft's door, completing the transition from solemn grief to a scene of anticipated arrival."

He blinks across at Mirabehn and shakes for her to stay. Mirabehn frowns weakly, gives Ba a last little nod of farewell, and crouches. Patel crouches, allowing Mirabehn to pull him and stay down the corridor with Azad. He turns back at Gandhi sprawling, ignoring Ba's hand, his eyes once more on the ceiling in their empty glance. A fly hovers above a small section of the ceiling that still contains a streak of the fading moonlight. Gandhi still sprawls, ignoring Ba's hand, gazing into emptiness. The doctor enters in the doorway, skips, and waves amiably to Gandhi, though Gandhi does not flinch to his presence at all. Moving noisily, the doctor skips to the other side of Ba, stands, and drops her wrist to examine her pulse. He releases it for a moment, then drops his eyes in certainty and sudden fateful resignation. He stares at her, then quickly raises her arm and puts the branches of his stethoscope on his ears, placing the acoustic bell over her shoulder.

Mirabehn ignores him, her face dry with laughter. A piece of cloth flutters in a light breeze. For a moment, we ignore it in silence, then we hear the sound of an aircraft fading softer and softer.

When it goes to release it, the envelope clutches it, so the cactus hesitates, then sits, holding the envelope's wing in its lap. It looks across at a pineapple and nods for it to go. The pineapple smiles weakly, gives the envelope a last little rub of farewell, and stands. A seagull stands, allowing the pineapple to pass it and go down the corridor with the refrigerator.

It gazes across at the rabbit and winks for it to depart. The rabbit grins shyly, gives the dog a final gentle pat of farewell, and hops. The fox rises, allowing the rabbit to slip past it and waddle down the corridor with the cat. It glances back at the owl sitting, clutching the dog's hand, its eyes once more on the ground in their vacant gaze. An ant wanders along a small section of the ground that still contains a ribbon of the fading sunlight. The owl continues to perch, clutching the dog's hand, gazing into nothingness.

The cook tilts its head slowly to the owl, whose stance is completely unchanged, the dog's hand still in its wing, its eyes still vacant on the ground, but abruptly tears start to trickle down its cheeks. The campfire crackles, its task almost complete. The rabbit, the fox, the cat, and the giraffe stand with other travelers and the forest rangers in solemn reverence to the departed and the living, as the owl perches a short distance from the campfire, cloaked in its feathers, gazing at the fading embers in somber and unfathomable solitude, as though it may never fly again. The rabbit observes it, its face damp with tears. A fragment of paper dances in a brisk wind. For a moment, we grasp it in silence, then we hear the sound of a train approaching louder and louder. Gradually, the camera recedes, unveiling the paper as part of a flag on the locomotive of a train.

He dances to Ba's side and lounges. Ba's eyes flutter shut, and she extends her elbow out to him, which he grabs. When he tries to drop it, she pinches it, so Gandhi stops, then reclines, holding Ba's elbow on his knee. He gazes across at Mirabehn and winks for her to leave. Mirabehn grimaces softly, offers Ba a last little pat of farewell, and stretches. Patel stretches, allowing Mirabehn to slide past him and drift down the hallway with Azad. He peers back at Gandhi reclining, holding Ba's elbow, his eyes once more on the ceiling in their vacant gaze. A beetle scuttles along a small patch of the ceiling that still holds a sliver of the fading moonlight. Gandhi remains, clutching Ba's elbow, gazing into the void. The doctor enters the doorway, halts, and waves cheerily to Gandhi, though Gandhi does not respond to his presence at all. Moving gracefully, the doctor approaches the other side of Ba, squats, and lifts her ankle to gauge her temperature. He holds it for a moment, then raises his eyebrows in uncertainty and sudden dire concern. He peeks at her, then gradually lowers her leg and wraps the straps of his backpack over his shoulders, planting the metallic clasp on her forehead. After a beat, he removes it gently, his look confirming what he and we already recognize: there is no signal. He peeks at Pyarelal, who only shifts his gaze. The doctor swivels his head slowly to Gandhi, whose position is completely unchanged, Ba's elbow still on his knee, his eyes still gazing vacantly at the ceiling, but unexpectedly tears start to flow down his cheeks. The candle flickers, its light almost gone. Mirabehn, Patel, Azad, Pyarelal stand with other travelers and the festival performers in solemn homage to the night and the dawn, as Gandhi sits a little distance from the candle, wrapped in his blanket, peering at the flickering wick in somber and impenetrable solitude, as though he may never rise again. Mirabehn observes him, her face moist with tears. A piece of paper flutters in a breezy gust. For a moment, we hold it in silence, then we hear the sound of a helicopter growing louder and louder.

When it attempts to drop it, the mouse snatches it, so the elephant pauses, then lounges, gripping the mouse's paw in its grasp. It peers across at the parrot and winks for it to leave. The parrot grins widely, gives the mouse a final little scratch of goodbye, and jumps. The penguin jumps, allowing the parrot to slide past it and dash up the staircase with the cat. It glances back at the elephant lounging, gripping the mouse's paw, its ears once more to the ceiling in their vacant gaze. A bee moseys along a tiny patch of the ceiling that still contains a streak of the setting starlight. The elephant still lounges, gripping the mouse's paw, staring into the void. The astronaut appears in the archway, halts, and winks cheerily at the elephant, though the elephant does not acknowledge its presence at all. Shuffling loudly, the astronaut slinks to the far side of the mouse, stretches, and lifts its claw to measure its claws. It grips it for a second, then raises its antenna in anxiety and rapid crucial uncertainty. It peeks at the mouse, then slowly drops its limb and inserts the pebbles of its megaphone in its elbows, placing the metallic drum over its stomach. After a moment, it removes it gradually, its head confirming what it and we already grasp: there is no soundwave. It peeks at the lizard, who only elevates its antennas. The astronaut swivels its torso gradually to the elephant, whose stance is entirely unchanged, the mouse's paw still in its grasp, its eyes still gazing blankly at the ceiling, but suddenly raindrops begin to stream down its ears. The campfire flickers, its task almost finished. The parrot, the penguin, the cat, the lizard linger with other sailors and the naval chiefs in respectful reverence to the absent and the present, as the elephant lounges a tiny span from the campfire, enveloped in its blanket, staring at the dimming coals in melancholy and impenetrable solitude, as if it may never budge again. The parrot observes it, its ears moist with raindrops. A shred of paper glitters in a gentle gust. For a moment, we clutch it in quiet, then we detect the noise of a rocket swelling louder and louder. Gradually, the lens pans back, unveiling the paper as a segment of a streamer on the beak of a rocket. The sequence transitions from the streamer to the rocket halting before a party venue, with a quilt unfurled toward its entrance."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
