After a brief moment, Elijah redirects his attentive eyes back to the captivating sketch that has captured his interest. The businessman, who appears to be somewhat bewildered by what he sees, thoughtfully rubs his face and continues to stare at the sketch with a distinctly furrowed brow, suggesting deep contemplation. Elijah, after a moment, begins to make his way towards the back interior of the store, which is in fact a kind of art gallery. This gallery is remarkable and unique for its collection; all the framed pictures adorning the walls are images and sketches that have been derived from various comic books. As Elijah moves diligently through the room, he firmly jams his walking stick into the exceptionally thick carpet, eventually coming to a deliberate halt. He then turns around and starts to make his way back towards the businessman, shaking his head with a strong and decisive motion.

          "description": "The creature is half robot, half bird. Samantha peeks at the chef lounging beside her and then back to the painting. The chef pats his nose and squints at the painting. Samantha ambles to the front of the museum, which is some type of dance studio where all the ornate sculptures are models and paintings from fairy tales. Samantha hurls her umbrella into the dense foam pillow and halts. She pivots and saunters back to the chef, nodding her head weakly. Samantha's eyes slice through the confused baker as she gestures at the painting. Samantha pivots and faces the performers for the first time; Robert Reed stands with Alice. Samantha just stands blinking for the longest time and then waltzes closer to them. When Samantha whispers, her tone has a playful quality to it. Robert shrugs while Samantha appears startled, and Samantha squints at Robert, then gestures at the ornate fairy tale paintings. Robert shakes his head and grins out of annoyance. Samantha observes Robert stroll towards the rear window, and through the glass, she notices Alice grab Robert's wrist as they skip down the alley. Samantha stares through the mirror in a bit of a haze. Robert lies down in the hammock scanning a torn section of magazine in his grasp, while Alice dozes vertically with her arms over Robert's arms. Robert wiggles out from under his daughter's arms; Alice twitches but remains asleep. Robert shifts to the brightness of the center of the attic, unlocks a drawer handle, and a vibrant hanging light turns on as Robert tugs a lever. Robert enters the shallow drawer and latches the handle slightly so the glow from the light doesn't spill onto Alice. There's just enough space to crouch and glance around as Robert bends and fumbles on the bottom panel. His fingers descend with something enclosed in a scarf, which he unwraps to expose a flashlight. He gawks at it for a moment before bundling it back up and placing it on the lowest panel. He bends even further, extends further down, and retrieves a notebook stuffed with comics. He flips the notebook to display a young Robert in a basketball jersey hoisting his sneakers in the air triumphantly. Robert rifles through the top comics, which are all depictions and stories of Robert and basketball, then turns the bundle over to the final comic. This image is folded over four times, unlike the others; it's a brochure headline. Robert places the new caption beside the old one, and they appear like a pair, even the typeface is alike. Robert gawks at the aged caption and gazes intently at the image of the twisted and badly crushed bicycle resting sideways in the center of the plaza."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

He interacts with a businessman, expressing disapproval before noticing David Dunne and his son Joseph among the customers. Elijah's whispery voice leaves David visibly frustrated, and Elijah watches them leave, lost in thought. Later, David, in bed with Joseph, who is asleep, quietly moves to a closet. He cautiously retrieves a handgun wrapped in a t-shirt, stares at it momentarily, then places it back on the shelf. Stretching further, David retrieves a folder of clippings depicting his past as a triumphant football player. He compares an old newspaper headline featuring a mangled car to a new one, noticing their similarity, and stares intensely at the image of the wreck."
