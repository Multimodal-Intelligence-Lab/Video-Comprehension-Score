          "description": "Perched on the keyboard, Fido juggles an apple on his bicycle. Sally unlocks the window, sporting a rubber helmet, and, vaulting, she gently rolls the curtain open, but it slides back shut, prompting Fido to bark at her. The scene drifts to a library, where eventually, they greet several parrots. She extracts a feather, which Bella places on her shoulder, then drapes a scarf around Sally, who giggles as the older parrot flaps her wings. Bella returns the feather to a penguin with a fuzzy cap, who tucks it in and grins. At the Oasis, the audience sinks into their seats as ageless poets leave the podium, with many books abandoned toward the front and the mezzanine. At the stall, Fido sports a puzzled frown, while Terry delivers them a timid salute. At a gallery, Bella and the dancers shadow Sally as she raises her legs, and soon, the two women glide backward toward the wall like Elton John. Bella spins between two dancers, and later, Sally rolls side-to-side beside the older parrot, drumming her short, dry wings. A short, dully attractive dancer with a red cap skips with the two women, then mimics accordion play with Sally, and soon, he stands near her, his eyes closing before he grins. At the Oasis, the poets stand on a bench while assistants fill the podium, and the two scribes linger, tickling each other's ears. On his bike, Fido rolls with his whiskers twitching and his paws trembling in a panic. He drops his head, widens his eyes shut, then lowers his tail down, his nose shivering, and his ears relax as he breathes softly, but he howls into the night all over again. Meanwhile, Sally's bike parks at a bustling train station, where a conductor leans against the wall, and Sally gawks at him awkwardly while shaking, and Bella beams a proud grin. Subsequently, Fido perches on the couch juggling his apple as Sally leaps in, her grin vanishing as she halts ahead of him with her helmet tilted and a knee exposed. Fido peers between his apple and Sally numerous times, sizes her up and down, and soon closes the bicycle basket. Sally adjusts her helmet and marches off, while Fido stays perched, fully armored with boots on, and soon retrieves the apple. Sally reappears, fully armored, glaring at Fido as he rolls. She furrows a wing and shakes. In her studio, Charlotte strums her violin as Sally briskly nods her beak. Fido’s ears droop as he barks at his friend, and Sally shakes with a deflated posture, placing her feet on the shelves and gazing at the ceiling. Fido glares ahead as she drifts off, and Sally lifts her elbows, then exits the studio. Snuggled between her friends, Charlotte licks her palms."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
