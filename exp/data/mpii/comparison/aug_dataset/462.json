These remnants of the past suggest that they may once have formed a formidable and imposing fortification. Yet, in their current condition, they bear a certain resemblance to the mysterious and iconic Stonehenge, invoking a sense of wonder and intrigue. The Man in Black finds himself positioned at an approximate distance of 75 feet from the top of the steep cliff, though it could very well be even less—perhaps a mere 50 feet. His pace remains as remarkably dazzling and impressive as it was before, showcasing his unwavering determination.\n\nMeanwhile, Vizzini, filled with resolve and determination, slices through the final section of the rope. This severed rope then moves across the ground like a serpent, disappearing out of sight toward the Channel, much like a great snake finally returning to its home. Fezzik stands steadily alongside Inigo and Buttercup, all positioned at the very edge of the precipice. The Man in Black dangles precariously, suspended hundreds of feet in the air, clinging desperately to the jagged rocks, trying to hold onto life with every ounce of strength he possesses.\n\nVizzini, visibly taken aback, turns toward his companions, casting his gaze downward at the Man in Black. The Man in Black is slowly but steadily making his arduous ascent upward, at times advancing by a foot, at other times only inching forward. The group at the cliff's summit is intently staring down, and Inigo acknowledges the situation with a nod. The Man in Black continues his laborious climb upwards.\n\nFezzik approaches Inigo, nodding in agreement, and subsequently hurries after Vizzini. Inigo watches them depart, then turns his attention back to the cliff, peering over the edge, watching for a moment before he resumes pacing, shaking his hands to loosen them. He practices a few of his well-honed fencing skills, being a tense and nervous fellow who is not inclined to wait idly. The Man in Black climbs onward, now noticeably six inches closer to the top than when he was last observed. Inigo watches intently but then begins to walk away. Finally, he returns to the edge of the cliff and starts to speak.\n\nThe situation is dire, with instant death looming if the Man in Black should fall, yet neither of them seriously considers that grim possibility. This moment marks the first encounter between our two heroes. The Man in Black glances upward, emitting a slight grunt, as Inigo steps away, drawing his sword with a flourish and executing a few precise thrusts before re-sheathing it. He then eagerly looks over the edge once more. The Man in Black remains suspended in the air, taking a moment to rest and gather his strength.\n\nAs these events unfold, the camera zooms into a close-up of Inigo, who raises his right hand high, his eyes ablaze with intensity, and his voice takes on a tone not previously heard. He quietly dashes toward the giant rock where the rope had originally been tied. The Man in Black briefly loosens his grip, trying to maintain his hold on the cliffside. Inigo, now with a small coil of rope in hand, hurries back to the edge and tosses it over the side. The rope swings close to the Man in Black, who releases the rocks, grabs the rope, and hangs momentarily helpless in space before looking up at Inigo.\n\nInigo strains with effort, pulling his body away from the cliff's edge, as the Man in Black slowly rises through the early morning light. As the top of the cliff finally comes within reach, Inigo watches closely as the Man in Black crawls to safety, then looks to Inigo with an expression of shared determination and relief."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

The Man in Black ascends a cliff, clinging to jagged rocks, while Vizzini watches in disbelief. Fezzik stands by Inigo and Buttercup, observing the struggle. Despite Vizzini's cutting of a rope, the Man in Black perseveres, inching upward. Inigo, eager and restless, practices fencing while waiting. The Man in Black continues his climb, slowly nearing the top. Inigo, seeing him struggle, tosses a rope to assist. The Man in Black grabs the rope as Inigo strains to pull him up. Eventually, the Man in Black reaches the top, meeting Inigo in a moment of mutual respect."
