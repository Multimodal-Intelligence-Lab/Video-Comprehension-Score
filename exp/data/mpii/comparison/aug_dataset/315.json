Suddenly, the sharp trilling of the phone shatters the moment, prompting him to reach automatically for the receiver, lifting it to his ear with a practiced motion. Meanwhile, Evan, finding a moment of joy amidst the chaos, lets a smile play on his lips and pulls her even closer, tightening his hug as if to reassure himself. Around him, the pledges of Theta Chi begin to gather with a chaotic energy, their appearances a testament to their recent trials, covered in smudges of dirt, remnants of food, and even traces that suggest an encounter with vomit. Evan, having transformed back to his usual look, grips a wooden spoon firmly in his hand and brings it down with a loud clang on a metal salad bowl, worn incongruously on the head of an unfortunate Theta Chi pledge, the sound ringing out in the air. She steps forward, her attention captured, only to be greeted by a flurry of flower petals cascading gently down upon her. Her gaze lifts upward, eyes widening as she spots two more pledges perched precariously on ladders, deftly scattering petals that float down around her in delicate arcs. Overwhelmed by the unexpected spectacle, Kayleigh lowers herself into a chair, her body tingling with a mix of surprise and emotion. Her hand reaches instinctively for his, fingers intertwining with a fierce urgency, as they both lean in, their lips meeting in a kiss so filled with wonder and magic that it evokes the memory of a first-ever shared moment. In a sudden burst of action, Hunter propels himself up the stairs with athletic vigor, taking them two at a time, a sense of urgency propelling him forward, prompting Evan and Kayleigh to exchange glances filled with concern and alarm. Reacting swiftly, Evan bolts out the door, sprinting across the front lawn towards his car, a Honda sitting at rest at the bottom of the hill. Upon reaching his vehicle, his heart sinks as he takes in the vandalism; the car is a wreck, surrounded by shards of broken glass that glint menacingly in the sunlight. The seats inside are slashed open, spilling foam, while the tires lie deflated, and the hood is conspicuously missing, as if ripped away by some force, leaving the steering wheel absurdly perched on the roof. But it's the spiked leather dog collar, ominously suspended from the rearview mirror, that truly unnerves him, casting a shadow over the brazen destruction. As a curious crowd gathers, she finds her gaze fixated on the collar, a foreboding symbol hanging silently. Leading her away from the scene, Evan guides Kayleigh into the quiet, private confines of his bedroom. Once inside, he closes the door with a soft click and secures it by turning the lock, creating a sanctuary from the chaos outside. Moving with purpose, he reaches into his desk drawer, fingers brushing over clutter, until they close around a tiny canister of Pepper Spray, which he retrieves with a calculated sense of preparation. Sitting in contemplative silence for a moment, Evan lets the weight of the situation settle over him like an unwelcome cloak. Together, Kayleigh and Evan traverse the near-deserted campus, a palpable tension hanging in the air. Without warning, Tommy rushes at Evan with aggression, wielding a tire thumper and delivering brutal blows to Evan's shoulder and ribs, sending him sprawling to the ground in pain. As Tommy stands poised to deliver a catastrophic blow, Evan acts with desperate swiftness, drawing the Pepper Spray and unleashing it into Tommy's face with precision. Tommy cries out, recoiling in agony, his free hand flying up to shield his burning eyes. Summoning every ounce of strength, Evan struggles back to his feet, maneuvering around Tommy while maintaining a wary distance, continuing to spray him with the incapacitating liquid. Disoriented and blinded, Tommy staggers about, swinging the tire thumper wildly. She flees to the relative safety of a blue streetlight on the quad, watching the scene unfold with heart pounding. Seizing the opportunity, Evan delivers a powerful kick to Tommy's ribs, forcing him to the ground, as he raises the tire thumper high above his head. With a swift, decisive motion, he brings it crashing down, the final act taking place just out of the camera’s view. The reality of his actions hits Evan with brutal clarity, and he lets the weapon fall from his grasp, a look of horror overtaking his features. As sirens wail, racing with urgency towards the quad, Kayleigh witnesses the aftermath of Evan's violence towards her brother. Evan, filled with remorse, turns his gaze away from Tommy's unmoving form, unable to face the consequences. Meanwhile, a security vehicle rolls to a halt in front of the foreboding metal gates of the large state prison, a grim setting that looms in the distance. The vehicle's doors open, and Evan, now constrained by leg and hand restraints, steps out alongside nine other convicts, his movements dictated by the clink of chains. Dressed in the standard issue inmate uniform, Evan is escorted into the General Population area of the prison, the heavy door closing behind him with an irrevocable finality."

          "description": "The cat chuckles and burrows into the cactus, and though it's pleased for the sunlight, it still feels jittery. The toaster dings and it instinctively taps it. Oliver grins to himself and squeezes the cactus tighter. The explorers of Zeta Delta eagerly swarm around Oliver, their hats covered in paint, candy, and what might be honey. Oliver, now dressed like a librarian, clinks a silver fork on a ceramic pasta dish that an unfortunate Zeta Delta explorer wears as a mask. As the fish glides closer to the shelf, confetti rains down on it. The fish glances up to notice two additional explorers perched on chairs, gently scattering confetti. Leslie appears flabbergasted as the fish settles down. Its fin stretches out toward the cactus and clasps it firmly, and they edge closer for a nuzzle so magical it could be their inaugural one. Parker races down the hallway, three at a time, and Oliver and Leslie swap anxious glances. Oliver darts across the garden to his scooter, the Vespa stationed at the base of the mound. Oliver's scooter has been vandalized and is encircled by shredded paper. The handlebars and pedals have been dented, the seat has been inexplicably detached, and the bell rests on the ground. The most unsettling item, however, is a rusted iron chain that dangles off the side mirror. By now a swarm has assembled, and the cat gawks at the chain. Oliver guides Leslie into his study and secures the entrance. He then bolts the entrance, reaches into his closet, and locates a tiny vial of Clove Oil. Oliver pauses in silence for a moment, pondering this. Leslie and Oliver stroll through the nearly-empty market. Mason dashes towards Oliver and wallops him with the broomstick on the knee and torso, and Oliver collapses. As Mason readies to shred his thoughts, Oliver pulls out the Clove Oil and spritzes Mason in the nostrils. Mason staggers back in agony, clutching his nose with his free paw. Oliver stumbles upright and sidesteps around Mason, keeping a gap as he sprinkles Mason with Clove Oil. Mason aimlessly zigzags, wildly flailing the broomstick. The cat dashes to a green lamppost on the meadow. Oliver jabs Mason hard in the torso and lifts the broomstick for a final strike, sweeping down off camera. Oliver notices what he's accomplished and abandons the tool, aghast. Leslie observes what Oliver's done to her sibling, and patrols come racing to the meadow. Oliver averts his gaze from Mason's still form. A patrol car cruises through the foreboding wooden gate of the immense regional zoo. The car halts, and Oliver, together with nine other animals, exits in collar and leash restraints. Oliver, now sporting his usual zoo resident attire, enters the Public Exhibits section of the zoo."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

The car has been vandalized, with seats slashed and a spiked leather dog collar ominously hanging from the mirror. This unsettling incident escalates: later, as Evan and Kayleigh walk through campus, they're attacked by Tommy, who assaults Evan with a tire thumper. In a desperate move, Evan uses Pepper Spray on Tommy, leading to a violent confrontation where Evan ultimately incapacitates Tommy. Horrified by his actions, particularly as Tommy is Kayleigh's brother, Evan faces the consequences.
