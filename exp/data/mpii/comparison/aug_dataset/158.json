As Gandhi nears the car, a Hindu youth with a black flag calls to him. They are all awed, timid even in his presence, and the mood of their gathering has changed altogether. Gandhi looks at the youth and the line of others, sweeping them sternly with his eyes, showing all his fatigue and strain. He lowers his head and moves on to the car, where Kallenbach holds the door for him, with Nehru, Azad, and Pyarelal following. As they get into the car, we see the car that sits by the two trucks that have brought the youths. In the back seat are two men, one of whom is Prakash. Jinnah is on the small balcony of an elaborate room, looking down in a slightly supercilious manner, impeccably dressed as usual. He has been looking at Gandhi, who sits on the floor of the large room some distance from him, just lifting his head from prayers. Nehru, Patel, and Azad are on the same side of the room as Gandhi. They rise from prayer as Jinnah comes down the steps to them. Gandhi hesitates, then begins, and Jinnah has drawn himself up, his vanity too great not to be touched by that prospect. He measures Gandhi to see that he is sincere, and when satisfied, turns slowly to Nehru, Patel, and Azad. Nehru glances at Patel, all taken by surprise by the offer and not feeling what Gandhi feels. Nehru looks hesitantly at Gandhi. It bears the stamp of undeniable truth. Gandhi's eyes sag with despair, as if his last hope, his faith, has crumbled around him. Gandhi stares numbly at him. On a platform in the foreground, Mountbatten and Nehru are present as a band plays the Indian National Anthem loudly, and there's the roar of a tremendous crowd as India's flag is raised on the flagpole. On another platform, Jinnah and a British plenipotentiary are present as a band plays the new Pakistani National Anthem loudly, and there's the roar of a tremendous crowd as Pakistan's flag is raised. The little flagpole is empty, the rope dangling, flapping loosely down the pole. Gandhi sits on the porch of his bungalow, spinning, the hum of the spinning wheel audible.

The entire group is filled with awe, and they seem timid, almost reverent, in his presence, as the atmosphere of their gathering has shifted completely.

Azad and Pyarelal then proceed out onto the porch, trailing just behind Nehru in a slightly staggered formation. As Gandhi approaches with purposeful steps toward the patiently waiting car, a young Hindu man, who is clutching a black flag, calls out to him in a bold manner. The entire assembly of people is filled with a sense of awe, and they seem almost timid, if not wholly reverent, in his commanding presence, for the atmosphere of their gathering has shifted dramatically. Gandhi casts a stern, unwavering gaze upon the youth and the line of others, his eyes sweeping over them deliberately, revealing all the fatigue and strain etched on his face. He lowers his head thoughtfully and continues moving toward the car, where Kallenbach stands prepared, holding the door open for him with readiness. Nehru, Azad, and Pyarelal follow closely behind him. As they all settle into the car, it becomes noticeable that the vehicle is parked beside two sizable trucks that have transported the enthusiastic youths. In the back seat of the car, there are two men, one of whom is specifically identified as Prakash. Meanwhile, Jinnah stands on a small, elevated balcony of an elaborate room, gazing down with a slightly supercilious expression, impeccably dressed with his usual attention to sartorial detail. He has been intently observing Gandhi, who is seated on the floor of the spacious room a bit of a distance away, just lifting his head from a moment of silent prayer. Nehru, Patel, and Azad are stationed on the same side of the room as Gandhi, sharing the same space. They rise from their prayer positions as Jinnah begins to descend the steps toward them. Gandhi hesitates briefly, then begins, and Jinnah draws himself up with a sense of dignity, his vanity too great not to be stirred by the prospect. He measures Gandhi with care to ensure the sincerity of his intentions, and once he is satisfied, he slowly turns to Nehru, Patel, and Azad. Nehru exchanges a significant glance with Patel, all of them taken aback by the suddenness of the offer, not fully sharing in Gandhi's feelings of the moment. Nehru looks hesitantly at Gandhi, recognizing the undeniable truth of the situation they find themselves in. Gandhi's eyes droop visibly with despair, as if his last hope and his faith have crumbled entirely around him. He stares numbly at Jinnah, who seems unfazed. On a platform in the immediate foreground, Mountbatten and Nehru are present as a band plays the Indian National Anthem loudly and proudly, and the roar of a tremendous crowd fills the air as India's flag is raised high on the flagpole with pride. On another platform, Jinnah and a British plenipotentiary are present as a band plays the newly composed Pakistani National Anthem loudly, and the roar of a tremendous crowd echoes as Pakistan's flag is raised alongside it. The little flagpole stands empty, with the rope dangling and flapping loosely down the pole, devoid of any flag. Gandhi sits quietly on the porch of his secluded bungalow, engaged in the meditative act of spinning, with the gentle hum of the spinning wheel audible in the background as a soothing constant. Inside, it is possible to just make out Mirabehn spinning as well, but aside from that, he is alone; the entire ashram seems deserted, bereft of its usual activity and liveliness."

As they move forward, Azad and Pyarelal step out onto the porch, trailing behind Nehru, who leads the way. As Gandhi draws nearer to the car, a Hindu youth holding a black flag calls out to him, capturing his attention. The group surrounding Gandhi is visibly awed, their demeanor shifting to one of timidity in his presence, and the atmosphere of their gathering transforms entirely. Gandhi directs his gaze at the youth and the line of others, his eyes sweeping over them with a stern expression that reveals the fatigue and strain etched on his face. He then lowers his head, signaling his intent to move forward, and proceeds towards the car, where Kallenbach stands ready, holding the door open for him. Nehru, Azad, and Pyarelal follow closely behind, preparing to enter the vehicle.

Nehru, Patel, and Azad are positioned on the same side of the room as Gandhi, and as Jinnah descends the steps towards them, they rise from their prayerful positions. Gandhi hesitates momentarily before beginning to speak, while Jinnah, with his vanity too great to ignore the situation, draws himself up, assessing Gandhi to determine the sincerity of his words. Once satisfied with Gandhi's earnestness, Jinnah turns slowly to face Nehru, Patel, and Azad. Nehru exchanges a glance with Patel, both caught off guard by the unexpected offer and not fully sharing in Gandhi's sentiments. Nehru then looks hesitantly at Gandhi, recognizing the undeniable truth in the situation. Gandhi's eyes reflect a deep despair, as if his last hope and faith have crumbled around him, leaving him to stare numbly at the unfolding events. On a platform in the foreground, Mountbatten and Nehru stand as a band plays the Indian National Anthem loudly, accompanied by the roar of a tremendous crowd as India's flag is ceremoniously raised on the flagpole. On another platform, Jinnah and a British plenipotentiary are present as a band plays the new Pakistani National Anthem loudly, with a similar roar from the crowd as Pakistan's flag is hoisted.

Inside, Mirabehn can be seen spinning as well, but apart from her presence, Gandhi is alone, and the entire ashram appears deserted, adding to the sense of solitude."

Azad and Pyarelal come out on the porch behind Nehru. As Gandhi nears the car, a Hindu youth with a black flag, a symbol of protest, calls to him. They are all awed, timid even in his presence, and the mood of their gathering has changed altogether. Gandhi looks at the youth and the line of others, sweeping them sternly with his eyes, showing all his fatigue and strain from his relentless struggle for independence and peace. He lowers his head and moves on to the car, where Kallenbach, his friend and a devoted supporter of the Satyagraha movement, holds the door for him, with Nehru, Azad, and Pyarelal following. As they get into the car, we see the car that sits by the two trucks that have brought the youths, likely members of a political group. In the back seat are two men, one of whom is Prakash, a fictional character representing the young activists of the time. Jinnah, the leader of the Muslim League and a key figure in the partition of India, is on the small balcony of an elaborate room, looking down in a slightly supercilious manner, impeccably dressed as usual in his characteristic sherwani. He has been looking at Gandhi, who sits on the floor of the large room some distance from him, just lifting his head from prayers, a practice Gandhi often undertook for inner peace. Nehru, Patel, and Azad are on the same side of the room as Gandhi. They rise from prayer as Jinnah comes down the steps to them. Gandhi hesitates, then begins, and Jinnah has drawn himself up, his vanity too great not to be touched by that prospect. He measures Gandhi to see that he is sincere, and when satisfied, turns slowly to Nehru, Patel, and Azad. Nehru glances at Patel, the architect of India's political integration, all taken by surprise by the offer and not feeling what Gandhi feels. Nehru looks hesitantly at Gandhi. It bears the stamp of undeniable truth, a moment steeped in historic significance. Gandhi's eyes sag with despair, as if his last hope, his faith in non-violence and unity, has crumbled around him. Gandhi stares numbly at him. On a platform in the foreground, Mountbatten, the last Viceroy of India, and Nehru are present as a band plays the Indian National Anthem loudly, and there's the roar of a tremendous crowd as India's flag is raised on the flagpole, marking the birth of a new nation. On another platform, Jinnah and a British plenipotentiary are present as a band plays the new Pakistani National Anthem loudly, and there's the roar of a tremendous crowd as Pakistan's flag is raised, symbolizing the partition. The little flagpole is empty, the rope dangling, flapping loosely down the pole, a poignant reminder of change and loss. Gandhi sits on the porch of his bungalow, spinning, the hum of the spinning wheel audible, a symbol of self-reliance and simplicity. Inside, we can just see Mirabehn, Gandhi’s devoted British disciple, spinning too, but apart from that, he is alone; the whole ashram seems deserted, a silent testament to the turbulent times."

On a sundappled afternoon in a quaint European village an eccentric inventor unveils a groundbreaking contraption that defies conventional physics igniting wonder and skepticism in equal measure. and Jinnah has drawn himself up his vanity too great not to be touched by that prospect. He measures Gandhi to see that he is sincere and when satisfied turns slowly to Nehru Patel and Azad. Nehru glances at Patel all taken by surprise by the offer and not feeling what Gandhi feels. Nehru looks hesitantly at Gandhi. It bears the stamp of undeniable truth. Gandhi's eyes sag with despair as if his last hope his faith has crumbled around him. Gandhi stares numbly at him. On a platform in the foreground Mountbatten and Nehru are present as a band plays the Indian National Anthem loudly and there is the roar of a tremendous crowd as India's flag is raised on the flagpole. On another platform Jinnah and a British plenipotentiary are present as a band plays the new Pakistani National Anthem loudly and there is the roar of a tremendous crowd as Pakistan's flag is raised. The little flagpole is empty. the rope dangling flapping loosely down the pole. Gandhi sits on the porch of his bungalow spinning the hum of the spinning wheel audible. Inside we can just see Mirabehn spinning too but apart from that he is alone. the whole ashram seems deserted."

As Gandhi nears the car a Hindu youth with a black flag calls to him. They are all awed timid even in his presence and the mood of their gathering has changed altogether. Gandhi looks at the youth and the line of others sweeping them sternly with his eyes showing all his fatigue and strain. He lowers his head and moves on to the car where Kallenbach holds the door for him with Nehru Azad and Pyarelal following. As they get into the car we see the car that sits by the two trucks that have brought the youths.

          "description": "Beyonce is drifting away with Swift and Timberlake, with Drake hopping close behind. Timberlake and Drake leap out on the balcony behind Swift. As Beyonce skips toward the plane, an Elvis impersonator with a red kite whispers to her. They are all elated, jubilant even in her shadow, and the vibe of their shindig has twisted unexpectedly. Beyonce glances at the impersonator and the line of others, scanning them indifferently with her gaze, showcasing all her vigor and zest. She lifts her shoulders and skips on to the plane, where DiCaprio props the door open for her, with Swift, Timberlake, and Drake trailing. As they leap into the plane, we notice the plane that rests beside the two bicycles that have carried the performers. In the cockpit are two clowns, one of whom is Mario. Eastwood is on the small terrace of a rustic hut, gazing out in a slightly haughty fashion, lavishly garbed as always. He has been gazing at Beyonce, who lounges on the rug of the expansive lawn some distance from him, just raising her head from meditation. Swift, Lopez, and Timberlake are on the same corner of the lawn as Beyonce. They hop from meditation as Eastwood strides up the path to them. Beyonce wavers, then sings, and Eastwood has drawn himself up, his pride too hefty not to be stirred by that possibility. He assesses Beyonce to ensure she is genuine, and once convinced, spins slowly to Swift, Lopez, and Timberlake. Swift peeks at Lopez, all taken aback by the gesture and not sensing what Beyonce senses. Swift peers cautiously at Beyonce. It carries the mark of undeniable authenticity. Beyonce's gaze droops with resignation, as if her last aspiration, her belief, has shattered around her. Beyonce peers vacantly at her. On a dais in the background, Ronaldo and Swift are present as a choir performs the Galactic Anthem softly, and there's the hush of a colossal audience as Pluto's pennant is hoisted on the tower. On another dais, Eastwood and a Martian delegate are present as a choir performs the new Martian Anthem softly, and there's the hush of a colossal audience as Mars's pennant is hoisted. The tiny tower is barren, the string fluttering, dangling softly down the tower. Beyonce rests on the terrace of her lodge, knitting, the drone of the knitting needles palpable. Nearby, we can just glimpse Shakira knitting too, but apart from that, she is solitary; the entire lodge seems silent."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

          "description": "Gandhi approaches with Nehru, Azad, and Pyarelal. As they near the car, a Hindu youth waves a black flag, awed by Gandhi's presence, who, despite his fatigue, sternly acknowledges them before entering the car with his companions. Nearby, Jinnah observes from a balcony, dressed impeccably, as Gandhi rises from prayer. Nehru, Patel, and Azad are alongside, surprised by Gandhi's genuine demeanor, while Jinnah assesses Gandhi's sincerity. Nehru hesitantly communicates with Gandhi, who feels despair as if his faith has crumbled. Later, Mountbatten and Nehru oversee the Indian flag's raising amid roars and anthems, paralleled by Jinnah and a British official raising Pakistan’s flag. Gandhi, now at his bungalow, spins, with Mirabehn visible inside, while the ashram appears deserted."
