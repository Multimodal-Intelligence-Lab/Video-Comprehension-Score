Quirrell flies through the air and detects Harry, who falls over backwards, causing the glowing philosopher's stone to drop from his hand. He stretches out desperately to reach it, but Quirrell is trying to choke him. Harry grabs Quirrell's hand, which surprises him, causing Quirrell to pull away. Quirrell holds out his hand in front of him and sees it crumble into grey dust. Quirrell lurches towards the stone, and Harry's hands push against Quirrell's face, which also disintegrates into dust. Harry stares at his own hands in horror as Quirrell reaches out towards him and then crashes to the ground, his whole body turned to a pile of dust, and Voldemort has also disappeared. Puzzled, Harry stares at his hands again, then looks around for the philosopher's stone, seeing the dark red crystal lying on the stairs with a small flame flickering inside it. Harry picks it up, looks at it for a moment, smiles with relief, and clutches it tightly in his hand. He turns quickly as the cloud of swirling dust gathers behind him, and Voldemort's face appears and screams towards Harry in a violent rushing wind, knocking him off balance. The wind seems to pass through Harry's body, which whirls away like a tornado up the stone steps and disappears, leaving Harry unconscious but still holding in his hand the philosopher's stone, which flickers and glows a rich, deep red. When Harry wakes, he's in bed in the hospital wing. He rubs his eyes, with his face pale and a bandage on one hand.

A sheet of blaze obstructs his path, and they materialize in the mirror. Harry takes the crimson gem in his pocket and gazes at it as his guardians vanish. Quirrell soars through the air and perceives Harry, who tumbles backward, causing the luminous philosopher's stone to plummet from his grip. He extends out urgently to grasp it, but Quirrell is attempting to throttle him. Harry seizes Quirrell's hand, which startles him, causing Quirrell to recoil. Quirrell extends his hand in front of him and witnesses it crumble into gray ash. Quirrell lunges towards the stone, and Harry's hands press against Quirrell's face, which also disintegrates into dust. Harry gazes at his own hands in horror as Quirrell reaches out towards him and then crashes to the ground, his entire form transformed to a heap of dust, and Voldemort has also vanished. Perplexed, Harry gazes at his hands again, then glances around for the philosopher's stone, observing the dark red crystal lying on the stairs with a small flame flickering within it. Harry retrieves it, looks at it for a moment, smiles with relief, and clasps it tightly in his hand. He turns swiftly as the cloud of swirling dust accumulates behind him, and Voldemort's visage appears and shrieks towards Harry in a fierce rushing gale, knocking him off equilibrium. The gale seems to move through Harry's form, which spins away like a cyclone up the stone steps and vanishes, leaving Harry insensate but still clutching in his hand the philosopher's stone, which flickers and glows a rich, deep red. When Harry wakes, he's in bed in the infirmary wing. He rubs his eyes, with his face pale and a bandage on one hand. He sits up, reaches for his spectacles, puts them on, and smiles as he sees the get-well cards and the table at the foot of his bed stacked high with boxes of candies. Professor Dumbledore walks in, sees the candies, picks up an empty box, sits on Harry's bed, and Harry touches his scar. Dumbledore touches Harry's head, rises, and chews pensively. Clad in his black cloak, Harry walks along a passageway and sees Ron and Hermione conversing together on an upper landing. Smiling joyfully, he halts and gazes up at them. They catch sight of him, and Harry's smile becomes even broader. At a bench within the great hall, the students are wearing their robes and pointed hats. At the high table, Professor Dumbledore rises to his feet and looks around, while Malfoy sneers and the Gryffindors join in the applause unenthusiastically."

A sheet of ice blocks its path, and they reflect in the window. The lamp takes the blue marble in its drawer and gazes at it as its neighbors disappear. The violin floats through the sky and detects the lamp, which tumbles over backward, causing the shining opal to drop from its grip. It stretches out desperately to reach it, but the violin is attempting to hug it. The lamp snatches the violin's bow, which surprises it, prompting the violin to yank away. The violin extends its bow in front of it and watches it dissolve into white powder. The violin lunges towards the opal, and the lamp's cords push against the violin's surface, which also disintegrates into powder. The lamp stares at its own cords in horror as the violin reaches toward it and then collapses to the floor, its entire body turned to a heap of powder, and the trumpet has also vanished. Confused, the lamp gazes at its cords again, then scans around for the opal, observing the bright blue gem lying on the carpet with a tiny spark flickering inside it. The lamp picks it up, examines it briefly, grins with relief, and clutches it firmly in its cords. It spins swiftly as the mist of swirling powder collects behind it, and the trumpet's giggling emerges and echoes toward the lamp in a wild rushing gust, unbalancing it. The gust seems to slice through the lamp's frame, which spins away like a cyclone up the marble staircase and vanishes, leaving the lamp unconscious but still clutching the opal, which flickers and glows a rich, deep blue. When the lamp awakens, it's placed in a chair within the music room. It blinks its lenses, with its shade pale and a ribbon on one cord. It sits up, reaches for its glasses, puts them on, and grins as it notices the greeting cards and the table at the end of its stand piled high with tubs of popcorn. Professor Stork waddles in, observes the popcorn, picks up an empty tub, sits on the lamp's stand, and the lamp touches its screen. Stork strokes the lamp's frame, stands up, and munches thoughtfully. Wearing its striped jacket, the lamp strolls down a hallway and spots a toaster and a kettle chatting together on a raised deck. Grinning joyfully, it pauses and gazes at them. They catch sight of it, and the lamp's grin grows even wider. At a pantry within the grand chamber, the ornaments are wearing their aprons and feathered caps.

A curtain of mist hinders his way, and they vanish in the painting. Neville places the blue pebble in his shoe and gazes at it as his cousins vanish. Narcissa glides through the garden and identifies Neville, who trips forward awkwardly, causing the shimmering sorcerer's pebble to tumble from his grip. He lunges out playfully to grasp it, but Narcissa is attempting to tickle him. Neville seizes Narcissa's ankle, which confounds him, prompting Narcissa to hop away. Narcissa thrusts out her ankle in front of her and watches it transform into pink feathers. Narcissa staggers towards the pebble, and Neville's elbows nudge against Narcissa's chin, which also transforms into feathers. Neville gawks at his own elbows in amusement as Narcissa reaches out towards him and then lands on the carpet, her entire form turned to a mound of feathers, and Grindelwald has also vanished. Bewildered, Neville gawks at his elbows again, then scans for the sorcerer's pebble, spotting the deep blue gem resting on the stools with a tiny spark flickering inside it. Neville scoops it up, examines it for a moment, laughs with joy, and hugs it tightly in his elbow. He pivots suddenly as the whirling feathers assemble behind him, and Grindelwald's mask emerges and cheers towards Neville in a gentle rolling breeze, lifting him off his feet. The breeze seems to drift through Neville's soul, which spins away like a hurricane up the carpeted ramps and vanishes, leaving Neville dreaming but still cradling in his elbow the sorcerer's pebble, which flickers and glimmers a vivid, lush blue. When Neville starts, he's in a chair in the lounge. He pats his cheeks, with his mouth pale and a patch on one elbow. He stands up, reaches for his lenses, wears them, and chuckles as he notices the congratulation notes and the shelf at the foot of his chair piled high with stacks of fruits. Professor Snape strolls in, notices the fruits, picks up an empty basket, lounges on Neville's chair, and Neville taps his chin. Snape taps Neville's shoulder, stands up, and munches thoughtfully.

Quirrell glides through the water and locates Harry, who tumbles forward, causing the shimmering philosopher's crystal to tumble from his grasp. He lunges out eagerly to grasp it, but Quirrell is attempting to tickle him. Harry snatches Quirrell's arm, which startles him, causing Quirrell to leap back. Quirrell stretches out his arm beside him and watches it dissolve into silver ash. Quirrell stumbles towards the crystal, and Harry's fingers press against Quirrell's mask, which also vanishes into ash.

Henderson sails through the garage and uncovers Lucas, who tumbles forward, causing the shimmering explorer's feather to slip from his grip. He lunges out reluctantly to grasp it, but Henderson is trying to tickle him. Lucas clutches Henderson's elbow, which shocks him, causing Henderson to jerk aside. Henderson holds out his shoulder in front of him and watches it crumble into blue ash.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
