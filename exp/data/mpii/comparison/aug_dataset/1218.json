She gazes at him, then turns away and disembarks from the vessel. On the shore, Michael lifts a hefty black backpack onto his shoulders as Sarah walks up the gangway and joins Michael. The group marches away with the rustic carriers, heading inland over the crest of a cascade, with two porters carrying a pole between them, from which a large box hangs. Rambo’s vessel meanders its way back down the river as Michael’s group crosses a still body of water bordered by stones and boulders, led by a man using a camcorder at the front of the group. Rambo’s vessel rounds a promontory and comes upon the buccaneers' motorboat, drifting near a shore. Rambo gazes cautiously at it as they pass, noticing a single cadaver lying on the deck near the deserted machine gun. He grips the tiller firmly and steers his vessel towards the buccaneer boat. The volunteers and porters traipse over the brow of a hill, overlooking a settlement in the valley below, near a rice field.

Rambo flips the top of one of the cans, holds it above his head, and soaks the machine gun and buccaneer cadavers with gasoline. The villagers make Michael’s group welcome as Rambo opens up another can, saturates the deck in more gasoline, and the liquid washes pools of blood over the side of the vessel.

She regards him with a sad expression, then manages to muster a faint smile. With deliberate care, she places a small crucifix on a necklace into Rambo's large hand. His fingers curl around the delicate gift, closing securely over it. After holding his gaze for a moment longer, she turns away and makes her way off the boat. On the riverbank, Michael readjusts his stance as he hefts a bulky black rucksack onto his shoulders. Sarah strides up the gangplank to join Michael, and together, the group sets off. They march with the peasant porters alongside them, moving inland towards the waterfall's edge. Two bearers among the group carefully balance a pole between them, from which a large carton is suspended. Meanwhile, Rambo maneuvers his boat back down the river. Michael’s party progresses across a tranquil body of water, flanked by rocks and boulders, led by a man at the front of the group who holds a camcorder. As Rambo's boat rounds a headland, it encounters the pirates' motorboat, which floats idly near a bank. Rambo narrows his eyes at it suspiciously as they pass, noting the lone corpse sprawled on the deck near an abandoned machine gun. Firmly grasping the tiller, he directs his own boat towards the pirate vessel. Meanwhile, the volunteers and bearers press on, cresting a hill that offers a view of a settlement nestled in the valley below, adjacent to a paddy field. Rambo continues to pilot the pirate boat further up the river, with his own vessel trailing behind, now guided by one of his men. Upon the pirate boat, one of the corpses has turned an unsettling mottled purple as the boat nudges into the riverbank. Rambo secures the motor and stops the boat, grabbing petrol cans and ropes as he maneuvers through the scattered pirate corpses. Meanwhile, the volunteers draw close to the village, where they are warmly welcomed by both small children and the adults of the community. The village huts, standing tall on high wooden foundations, reflect the local architectural style. Rambo pops open the lid of one petrol can, lifts it high above his head, and liberally douses the machine gun and the pirate corpses with petrol. The villagers extend a warm welcome to Michael's party as Rambo unscrews another can, inundating the deck once more with the flammable liquid, which mingles with pools of blood and spills over the boat's edge. He discards the empty can into the boat's hold, then flicks open and ignites a cigarette lighter. From the safety of his own boat, he arches the lighter through the air towards the pirate boat, igniting it in a sudden rush of flame. Below the village, rice plants stand tall and orderly in a paddy field. Outside one of the huts, Sarah presents a book to a child who looks on with curiosity. One of the volunteers engages in an oral examination with a woman, while nearby an old man strums a stringed instrument, adding a melodic note to the scene."

The group dashes away with the artist assistants, sprinting uphill over the mouth of a waterfall, with two painters dragging a lasso between them, from which a giant pumpkin dangles. Tango's plane drifts its path back up the lake as Victor's group strolls across a still expanse of sand bordered by trees and hills, led by a woman using a kaleidoscope at the back of the group. Tango's plane glides around a peninsula and encounters the farmers' canoe, bobbing near a tree. Tango glares eagerly at it as they sail, spotting a lone mannequin lounging on the cabin near the silent drum set. He grips the broom tightly and steers his plane towards the farmer canoe.

Tango flicks the lid of one of the barrels, carries it over his foot, and drenches the drum set and farmer mannequins with fuel.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
