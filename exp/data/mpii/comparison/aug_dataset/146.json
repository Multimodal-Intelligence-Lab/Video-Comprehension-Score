Two police officers have a man on the ground, and one policeman looks up. Patel leans with one arm on a table, feeling as devastated as Gandhi, while looking at an Indian paper on the table by his hand. It is a New York Times, and a picture of a severed head lying in smoldering ashes is glimpsed. Nehru and Azad are in the background with Desai, and Jinnah, dressed in a finely cut European suit, is among others who are dressed in tunics of homespun. They turn to Jinnah with a sense of surprise but do not really believe he means his statement. Patel looks up hopelessly at Jinnah, while Azad senses and fears what is going to happen, keeping his eyes fixed on Gandhi. Patel looks at him with mounting annoyance as Gandhi listens, withdrawn into himself. Jinnah turns away in anger, Patel sighs, and Nehru feels helpless but continues to try. Gandhi stares into nothing, mulling things over, while Nehru is surprised. Nehru ignores the thought and, like Azad, focuses on the real danger. Gandhi looks up at him with resigned fatalism.

He looks up at Mirabehn as she mounts the steps and nods. Mirabehn reaches the doorway and is stopped. In the shadows, Ba sits by Gandhi's mat bed, holding him as he experiences a spasm of dry retching, his face to the wall. When he finishes, he lies almost limp in her arms, and she gently lowers him to the mat, stroking his head. Mirabehn stiffens herself, not yet a devotee and nurse, removes her sandals, and walks across the room. She strokes Gandhi's sweating head again, touches his shoulder, and then gets up. For a moment, the two women hold each other's gaze. Ba smiles weakly, leaning her head into the taller Mirabehn's shoulder, then straightens and leaves without looking back.

          "description": "The scenario commences with another perspective where some of the demonstrators pivot at a yell, while a few of the stragglers are observing, some sprinting free of the constabulary, and some being struck. Two constables have a man on the terrain, and one officer glances upward. Patel reclines with one limb on a desk, feeling as shattered as Gandhi, while observing an Indian journal on the table by his hand. It is a New York Times, and a photograph of a decapitated head resting in smoldering embers is discerned. Nehru and Azad are in the backdrop with Desai, and Jinnah, attired in a finely tailored European suit, is among others who are attired in tunics of homespun. They turn to Jinnah with a sense of astonishment but do not really deem he intends his assertion. Patel glances up despairingly at Jinnah, while Azad perceives and dreads what is going to transpire, keeping his eyes fixed on Gandhi. Patel gazes at him with escalating irritation as Gandhi listens, secluded into himself. Jinnah pivots away in rage, Patel exhales, and Nehru senses powerless but persists to attempt. Gandhi gazes into nothingness, pondering matters, while Nehru is astounded. Nehru disregards the notion and, like Azad, concentrates on the genuine peril. Gandhi glances up at him with resigned fatalism. Mirabehn strides across the grounds toward Gandhi’s cottage, bearing a small tray with a jug and a glass. In the background, a few individuals labor while a multitude of individuals camp near the entrance, all awaiting. The steps of Gandhi's bungalow are shown, where a physician in a white smock sits on the veranda, perusing, with a stethoscope and blood pressure instruments on a small table beside him. He glances up at Mirabehn as she ascends the steps and acknowledges. Mirabehn reaches the threshold and is halted. In the shadows, Ba sits by Gandhi's mat bed, holding him as he experiences a spasm of dry heaving, his face to the partition. When he concludes, he lies almost limp in her arms, and she gently lowers him to the mat, caressing his head. Mirabehn stiffens herself, not yet a devotee and caregiver, removes her sandals, and strides across the chamber. She caresses Gandhi's sweating head again, touches his shoulder, and then rises. For a moment, the two women hold each other's gaze. Ba smiles feebly, inclining her head into the taller Mirabehn's shoulder, then straightens and departs without glancing back. Mirabehn bends and sits by Gandhi's side."

One arm is leaned on a table by Patel, who feels as devastated as Gandhi, while an Indian paper on the table by his hand is looked at by him. It is a New York Times, and a picture of a severed head lying in smoldering ashes is glimpsed by them. Nehru and Azad stand in the background with Desai, and Jinnah, dressed in a finely cut European suit, stands among others who dress in tunics of homespun. A sense of surprise turns them to Jinnah, but he is not really believed to mean his statement. Jinnah is hopelessly looked up to by Patel, while Azad senses and fears what is going to happen, and his eyes are kept fixed on Gandhi by him. Mounting annoyance is directed at him by Patel as Jinnah is listened to by Gandhi, withdrawn into himself. In anger, Jinnah turns away, a sigh is given by Patel, and helplessness is felt by Nehru but he continues to try. Nothing is stared into by Gandhi, mulling things over, while surprise is felt by Nehru. The thought is ignored by Nehru and, like Azad, the real danger is focused on by him. Resigned fatalism is looked up to Nehru with by Gandhi. Across the grounds, Mirabehn is walked by toward Gandhi’s bungalow, a small tray with a pitcher and a glass being carried by her.

Meanwhile, a few individuals at the end of the procession are observing the unfolding events, with some swiftly evading the advancing police officers, and others unfortunately becoming victims of beatings. Two officers have a man pinned to the ground, and at that instant, one of the policemen raises his head to look around. Patel, feeling a deep sense of devastation akin to that of Gandhi, leans heavily with one arm propped on a table as his eyes rest on an Indian newspaper positioned nearby. This paper is none other than the New York Times, and within its pages, there is a glimpse of a photograph showing a grisly image of a severed head lying amidst smoldering ashes. In the background, Nehru and Azad stand alongside Desai, with Jinnah, distinguished in a finely tailored European suit, amongst others clad in tunics woven from homespun fabric. There is a moment when they all turn to Jinnah with expressions of surprise, yet their disbelief lingers regarding the sincerity of his statement. Patel tragically casts a hopeless glance towards Jinnah, while Azad, sensing the looming danger, cannot shake off his foreboding feeling and keeps his eyes steadfastly on Gandhi. Patel’s irritation visibly grows as Gandhi listens, absorbed within his own thoughts. Jinnah, with rising anger, turns away, prompting Patel to release a heavy sigh, while Nehru, feeling powerless, soldiers on trying to find a solution. Gandhi gazes into the void, deep in contemplation, even as Nehru remains bewildered. Nehru decides to dismiss the thought and, like Azad, centers his focus on the pressing threat. Gandhi, with a resigned expression of fatalism, lifts his gaze to meet Nehru’s concerned eyes. Meanwhile, Mirabehn is seen walking across the expansive grounds towards Gandhi’s bungalow, carefully carrying a small tray with a pitcher and a glass neatly arranged on it. In the distant background, a handful of individuals work diligently, while a large gathering of people encamps near the entrance, all eagerly waiting. The steps leading up to Gandhi’s bungalow come into view, where a doctor dressed in a pristine white tunic sits leisurely on the porch, engrossed in reading. Beside him is a small table with a stethoscope and blood pressure equipment. He looks up momentarily as Mirabehn ascends the steps and acknowledges her with a nod. Upon reaching the doorway, Mirabehn is momentarily halted. In the dimly lit interior, Ba is seated close to Gandhi's mat bed, offering comfort as he endures a painful spasm of dry retching, his face turned towards the wall. After the spasm subsides, he collapses almost lifelessly in her supportive arms, allowing her to gently lower him back onto the mat, soothingly stroking his head. Mirabehn, not yet fully acclimatized to her role as a devotee and nurse, gathers her composure, removes her sandals, and quietly crosses the room. She tenderly strokes Gandhi's perspiring head once more, lightly touches his shoulder, and then stands. For a brief moment, the two women lock eyes, sharing an unspoken connection. Ba offers a faint, weary smile, resting her head briefly against the taller Mirabehn's shoulder, then straightens her posture and departs without a backward glance. Mirabehn then bends down to sit by Gandhi's side, quietly assuming her place next to him."

Concurrently, a few individuals situated at the tail end of the procession are observing the events as they unfold in front of them. Some among these individuals quickly maneuver to evade the rapidly advancing police officers, while others, unfortunately, find themselves becoming victims of harsh beatings. Two police officers have a man pinned forcefully to the ground, and at that precise moment, one of the policemen raises his head to survey the surroundings. Patel, experiencing a profound sense of devastation that mirrors that of Gandhi's, leans heavily, with one arm propped on a nearby table, his eyes fixed on an Indian newspaper placed nearby. This newspaper is, in fact, the New York Times, and nestled within its pages is a shocking photograph, depicting a grisly image of a severed head lying amidst smoldering ashes. In the backdrop, Nehru and Azad stand alongside Desai, with Jinnah, who is distinguished by his finely tailored European suit, among others dressed in tunics crafted from homespun fabric. There is a moment when they all turn their attention to Jinnah with expressions of surprise, yet their disbelief persists concerning the sincerity of his statement. Patel, in a tragic manner, casts a hopeless glance towards Jinnah, while Azad, feeling the sense of looming danger, cannot rid himself of his foreboding feeling and keeps his eyes steadfastly focused on Gandhi. Patel’s irritation visibly grows as Gandhi listens, seemingly absorbed within his own contemplative thoughts. Jinnah, with anger gradually rising, turns away, prompting Patel to emit a heavy, frustrated sigh, while Nehru, feeling a sense of powerlessness, soldiers on, continuing in his attempts to find a viable solution. Gandhi, appearing lost in deep contemplation, gazes into the void, while Nehru remains bewildered. Nehru ultimately decides to dismiss the distracting thought and, much like Azad, centers his focus on addressing the pressing threat. Gandhi, with an expression that exudes resigned fatalism, raises his gaze to meet Nehru’s concerned eyes with understanding. Meanwhile, Mirabehn is observed walking gracefully across the expansive grounds towards Gandhi’s bungalow, carefully balancing a small tray with a neatly arranged pitcher and a glass. In the far background, a handful of individuals labor diligently, while a large gathering of people sets up camp near the entrance, waiting eagerly. The steps leading up to Gandhi’s bungalow gradually come into view, where a doctor dressed in a pristine white tunic sits leisurely on the porch, utterly engrossed in reading. Beside him, there is a small table equipped with a stethoscope and blood pressure equipment. He momentarily lifts his gaze as Mirabehn ascends the steps and acknowledges her presence with a polite nod. Upon reaching the doorway, Mirabehn is momentarily halted. In the dimly lit interior, Ba is seated close to Gandhi's mat bed, providing comfort as he endures a painful spasm of dry retching, his face turned sorrowfully towards the wall.

Mirabehn, not yet fully acclimatized to her role as a devoted follower and nurse, gathers her composure, removes her sandals with care, and quietly crosses the room. She tenderly strokes Gandhi's perspiring forehead once more, lightly touches his shoulder in reassurance, and then stands. For a brief moment, the two women lock eyes, exchanging an unspoken connection of shared understanding. Ba offers a faint, weary smile, resting her head briefly against the taller Mirabehn's shoulder, then straightens her posture and departs without casting a backward glance. Mirabehn, then bends down to sit attentively by Gandhi's side, quietly assuming her place next to him in a gesture of silent support."

In the midst of this, two police officers are seen having a man pinned on the ground, and one of the policemen pauses to look up. Simultaneously, Patel leans heavily with one arm supporting him on a table, conveying his devastated state much like Gandhi's as he fixes his gaze on an Indian newspaper positioned on the table beside his hand. The paper is identified as a New York Times, and there is a fleeting glimpse of a haunting image—a severed head resting amidst smoldering ashes. In the background, Nehru, Azad, and Desai are present, while Jinnah stands among them, distinguished in a finely cut European suit, contrasting with others who are clad in tunics of homespun fabric. As they collectively turn to Jinnah with surprise etched on their faces, they struggle to fully embrace the gravity of his statement, not truly believing its implications. Patel directs a hopeless glance towards Jinnah as Azad, sensing impending doom, keeps his anxious eyes fixed on Gandhi. Patel's gaze shifts towards Gandhi, and he is filled with growing annoyance as Gandhi listens, enveloped in his own thoughts. Jinnah, fueled by anger, turns away, prompting Patel to release a weary sigh. Meanwhile, Nehru, feeling helpless yet persistent, continues to engage. Gandhi, deep in thought, stares blankly into space, contemplating the situation, while Nehru, taken aback, chooses to dismiss the thought, sharing Azad's focus on the genuine threat at hand. Gandhi eventually looks up at Nehru with a sense of resigned fatalism. In another part of the grounds, Mirabehn walks purposefully towards Gandhi’s bungalow, balancing a small tray bearing a pitcher and a glass. Around her, a few individuals are diligently working, while a larger group camps near the entrance, all waiting in anticipation.

Two police officers have a man on the ground, and one policeman looks up. Patel, the prominent leader in the Indian independence movement and often referred to as the \"Iron Man of India\" for his leadership in uniting the nation, leans with one arm on a table, feeling as devastated as Gandhi, while looking at an Indian paper on the table by his hand. It is a New York Times, renowned for its international coverage, and a picture of a severed head lying in smoldering ashes is glimpsed, likely reflecting the violence and turmoil of the partition. Nehru, India's first Prime Minister, and Azad, India's first Minister of Education after independence, are in the background with Desai, another key figure in the movement, and Jinnah, who would later become the founder of Pakistan, dressed in a finely cut European suit, is among others who are dressed in tunics of homespun, the traditional khadi favored by Gandhi as a symbol of Indian self-reliance.

Amid the vibrant chaos of a South American carnival a fearless dancer twirls through streets bursting with color and rhythm each graceful move challenging the rigid boundaries of tradition. During a clandestine meeting in a snowcovered mountain lodge two rival spies exchange cryptic messages hinting at an imminent global conspiracy. their whispered words carried off by the howling wind.

Amidst the chaos of a raging civil war a compassionate medic races through bombedout streets. Gandhi looks up at him with resigned fatalism. Mirabehn walks across the grounds toward Gandhi’s bungalow carrying a small tray with a pitcher and a glass. In the background a few people work while a mass of people camp near the entrance all waiting. The steps of Gandhi's bungalow are shown where a doctor in a white tunic sits on the porch reading with a stethoscope and blood pressure equipment on a small table beside him. He looks up at Mirabehn as she mounts the steps and nods. Mirabehn reaches the doorway and is stopped. In the shadows Ba sits by Gandhi's mat bed holding him as he experiences a spasm of dry retching his face to the wall. When he finishes he lies almost limp in her arms and she gently lowers him to the mat stroking his head. Mirabehn stiffens herself not yet a devotee and nurse removes her sandals and walks across the room. She strokes Gandhi's sweating head again touches his shoulder and then gets up.

          "description": "The episode commences with an alternative perspective where a few divers pivot at a whisper, while several of the tagalongs are observing, some swimming away from the gardeners, and some getting tickled. Two gardeners have a squirrel on the sidewalk, and one gardener glances upward. Thompson slouches with one leg on a bench, feeling as amused as Einstein, while gazing at an Australian magazine on the bench by his knee. It is a Washington Post, and an image of a broken vase lying in scattered petals is peered at. Churchill and Darwin are in the foreground with Tesla, and Newton, dressed in a sharply tailored Japanese kimono, is among others who are dressed in robes of silk. They turn to Newton with a sense of curiosity but don’t really comprehend he intends his gesture. Thompson gazes upward hopelessly at Newton, while Darwin perceives and dreads what is about to occur, keeping his gaze locked on Einstein. Thompson glances at him with growing bewilderment as Einstein listens, lost in thought. Newton spins around in frustration, Thompson yawns, and Churchill feels aimless but persists in trying. Einstein gazes into the distance, pondering, while Churchill is taken aback. Churchill dismisses the notion and, like Darwin, concentrates on the present threat. Einstein glances up at him with accepting defeatism. Mopsa strolls across the orchard toward Einstein’s hut, gripping a large basket with a jug and a mug. In the foreground, several individuals toil while a throng of individuals gather near the exit, all waiting. The steps of Einstein's hut are illustrated, where an artist in a black cloak perches on the deck, drawing, with a paintbrush and watercolor set on a tiny stool beside him. He glances up at Mopsa as she climbs the steps and smiles. Mopsa approaches the threshold and is halted. In the sunlight, Ada rests by Einstein's hammock, embracing him as he endures a bout of giggling, his face to the tree trunk. When he concludes, he lies almost still in her arms, and she gently lowers him to the hammock, patting his shoulder. Mopsa steels herself, not yet a disciple and artist, slips off her boots, and strides across the space. She pats Einstein's trembling shoulder again, touches his ankle, and then rises. For a moment, the two artists hold each other's glance. Ada grins faintly, leaning her head into the shorter Mopsa's elbow, then adjusts and departs without glancing back. Mopsa bends and lounges by Einstein's hammock."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

          "description": "The scene opens with marchers reacting to a shout; some evade police while others aren't as fortunate. Two officers restrain a man as chaos unfolds. Patel, feeling devastated, leans on a table beside an Indian newspaper displaying a grim image. Jinnah, in a sharp suit, is in the company of Nehru, Azad, and Desai. Patel's hopelessness contrasts with Azad's fearful intuition focused on Gandhi, who remains withdrawn despite Nehru's efforts. Jinnah, frustrated, leaves, while Gandhi contemplates the situation with resigned fatalism. Mirabehn approaches Gandhi’s bungalow with refreshments, observing a doctor on the porch. Inside, Ba supports Gandhi through a dry retching episode, then gently comforts him before departing. Mirabehn, not yet fully a caregiver, shares a brief, understanding gaze with Ba before taking her place by Gandhi's side."
