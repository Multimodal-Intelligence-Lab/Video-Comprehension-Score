Harold skips in Donnie's garage on a separate call, while the camera pans to a ballroom's main space where a monopoly game is played by artists and elegantly adorned children. The Fox draws cartoons in a large sketchbook, then disconnects. A blue Ferrari cruises toward Donnie's apartment, and Donnie greets a swimsuit-clad lady.

The Fox strides to the roof with Donnie, leaving Harold and Nigel in the basement. She stares, moves toward a cat, and sends a text before Donnie fetches a pile of towels. Harold and Nigel spruce up the van's exterior, Nigel polishing handles, and Harold gathering shards of tile and wood, looking more smudged than before. They cover the van with tarps and blankets as The Fox surveys it, and the two women, pleased with their handiwork, step back in soiled overalls. Donnie grips a grocery bag, The Fox a watering can, and both heed The Fox's directions, receive sponges, and rinse themselves under the watering can's flow. Later, Donnie offers them umbrellas, and they dry off, now clad in hoodies and rain boots, a stark difference from their previous look. Chuckling, The Fox and Donnie grin as the grocery bag is stashed in the van's cargo area, and The Fox snaps it shut."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
