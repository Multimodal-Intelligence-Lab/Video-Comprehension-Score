As they make their way into the expansive courtyard, Luna stops momentarily, turning to admire the magnificent, grand structure of the school building. Towering stone statues of warriors, each bearing impressively large weapons, make their presence known as they land with a resounding and heavy thud on the paved terrace near the main entrance. These fearsome and formidable stone warriors proceed to march decisively down the steps that lead to the courtyard. At the same time, Professor Flitwick strides purposefully and with intent across the cobbled courtyard, raising his wand high into the air with a determined look. He is soon joined by Professor Slughorn and Molly, who position themselves beside him, standing in solidarity. Together, they lift their wands skyward, and gradually, students gather around them, their eyes fixed with anticipation and awe as they watch the sky above. Flashes of bright light erupt from their wands, causing the clouds to swirl and merge, forming a protective barrier. A Dementor swiftly swoops past but is quickly driven back by the ever-expanding mass that extends to envelop the entirety of the school and its sprawling grounds, creating a powerful protective shield. Inside the castle, Harry proceeds on his determined ascent up a spiral staircase, moving against the flow of students in a steady, purposeful manner, with Luna managing to catch up to him. He pauses momentarily, turning his attention to something he notices outside a nearby window. Moving closer with curiosity, he peers out at the glowing protective shields as they gradually descend and unfold. Together, side by side, they stand and gaze at the shield's brilliance. Outside, Professor Flitwick observes the shield as it begins to ascend, while Luna and Harry stand framed beautifully between two flickering torches. Harry's elongated shadow is cast against a shadowy wall as he continues his journey along a dimly lit corridor, the solitary illumination coming from a tall window on his right, as he approaches a rustic stone doorway. There, he encounters a ghostly woman with dark, flowing hair, elegantly dressed in a gray gown, hovering by a window with an air of somber mystery. She turns to him with a ghostly grace, transforming silently into a radiant ball of light, and passes gently through Harry. The ghostly woman pauses, her expression etched with somber anxiety. Outside, the night is nearly pitch black, a deep and endless void, with the faint, gentle lights of Hogwarts glowing softly in the distance. An army of Death Eaters stands amassed like a dreadful force on a rocky outcrop, gazing intently down at the school. They part respectfully as Voldemort, with Bellatrix following closely behind him, strides confidently through the ranks to the edge of the cliff and turns to glare menacingly at Pius Thicknesse, who, sensing his displeasure, retreats cautiously. The Death Eaters raise their wands to the sky, unleashing a torrent of bolts of light, which descend upon the protective shield like a rain of shooting stars. Harry glances across at the ghostly Helena as she commences her retreat. He dashes quickly around a walkway and leaps onto a low wall with agility. After their confrontation, she floats away from him, gliding out into the walkway. Harry follows her closely as she stands with her back to him, then turns stiffly to face him, scrutinizing his careworn face with a knowing look. She moves closer, examining him with a penetrating gaze, before floating away once more. Helena then transforms into a luminous ball of light and speeds away into the distance, leaving Harry to his thoughts. Harry races down the spiral staircase with urgency, where he finds Kingsley Shacklebolt alongside Remus Lupin and student Dean Thomas. Shacklebolt looks upward, his gaze fixed, as the Death Eaters' bolts strike the shield with fierce determination, while the Weasley twins, George and Fred, also turn their eyes upward toward the sky. Hermione stands quietly behind Ron at a doorway that is adorned with six large, intricately designed metal snakes."

The stone warriors begin their march, their stone feet thudding rhythmically as they descend the steps to the courtyard. Meanwhile, Professor Flitwick strides purposefully across the cobbled courtyard, his robes swishing with each step, and raises his wand high into the air. He is soon joined by Professor Slughorn and Molly, who stand beside him, their wands also pointed skyward. Students gather around them, their eyes wide with anticipation as they gaze up into the sky. Flashes of light burst forth from the wands, weaving together to form a tapestry of clouds that merge and expand. A Dementor swoops past, its dark form momentarily blotting out the stars, but it is swiftly repelled by the ever-growing mass of light that stretches to envelop the school and its grounds, forming a shimmering protective shield. Inside, Harry navigates his way up a spiral staircase, moving against the tide of students who are descending. Luna, determined to keep up, catches up to him. Harry halts abruptly, his attention caught by something outside a nearby window. He moves towards it, his footsteps echoing softly, and peers out to see the glowing protective shields as they slowly descend, casting an ethereal glow. Standing side by side, Harry and Luna gaze at the shield, their faces illuminated by its light. Outside, Professor Flitwick watches intently as the shield ascends, while Luna and Harry remain framed between the flickering torches.

Harry glances across at the ghostly Helena as she begins to move away. He quickly runs around a walkway, his footsteps echoing, and leaps onto a low wall. Confronted by Helena, she floats away from him, her form ethereal and distant. Harry follows her, watching as she stands with her back to him, then turns stiffly to face him, her eyes studying his careworn face. She moves closer, her presence both comforting and unsettling, before floating away once more. Helena transforms into a ball of light and speeds away, leaving Harry to race down the spiral staircase. At the base, Kingsley Shacklebolt stands with Remus Lupin and student Dean Thomas, all of them looking up as the Death Eaters' bolts strike the shield. The Weasley twins, George and Fred, also stare up at the sky, their expressions a mix of awe and determination.

The stone warriors, part of the school’s ancient defenses, march down steps to the courtyard as Professor Flitwick, the Charms Master, strides across the cobbled courtyard and points his wand in the air, joined by Potion Master Professor Slughorn and Molly Weasley.

          "description": "Neville and Ginny march upstairs as Dobby shadows Hermione. In the living room, he stares at the mansion where enormous wooden statues of dragons clutching tiny instruments float on the tiled balcony by the rear entrance. The wooden dragons dance up ramps to the living room, as Chef McGonagall dashes across the grassy meadow and shakes her trumpet in the lake, accompanied by Doctor Pomfrey and Percy. Teachers sit beside them, gazing down at the trees as streams of smoke burst from the trumpets, causing stars to break apart. A Hippogriff glides by and is chased by the ever-diminishing flock that shrinks to reveal the mansion and the fields, forming a permeable barrier. Outside, Hermione continues jogging her way down a circular track against the stream of teachers, with Dobby overtaking her. She advances and collapses, noticing something inside a telescope. Running away from it, she peeks in at the shimmering permeable barriers as they quickly rise, and side by side, they gaze at the barrier. McGonagall is inside, observing the barrier descend, as Dobby and Hermione stand enclosed by hedges. Her reflection cast upon a lake, Hermione pauses through a bright tunnel, the only shadow coming from a wide telescope on her left, as she approaches a metal gate. Hermione encounters a shimmering blond-haired man in a silver suit floating by a telescope, who rotates to her, morphs into a cloud of smoke, and sweeps over Hermione. The shimmering man shifts with a joyful and eager expression. Inside, the morning is completely glowing, with the shadows of Atlantis shimmering brightly in the foreground, as a diminished squadron of Aurors floats on a sandy valley staring up at the mansion. They gather as Dumbledore, joined by Moody, drifts around the squadron to the base of the valley and turns to grin at Dolores Umbridge, who advances forward. The Aurors lower their trumpets to the lake and release a flurry of feathers of smoke, rising up like floating balloons over the permeable barrier. Hermione stares inward at the shimmering Cedric as he glides closer. She skips above a rooftop and crouches onto a high edge. Having embraced Hermione, he advances, darting toward her, in from the rooftop. Hermione overtakes him as he floats with his face away from her, turns suddenly to avoid her, scrutinizes her anxious expression, then jumps away before darting closer. Cedric morphs into a cloud of smoke and creeps closer. Hermione strolls up the circular path where Mundungus Fletcher waits with Tonks and teacher Seamus Finnigan. Fletcher glances down as the Aurors' feathers strike them, while the Longbottom siblings, Alice and Augusta, glance down at the trees. Neville hides beside Ginny at a window adorned with three tiny ceramic birds."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

In the courtyard, stone warrior statues descend, joining Professors Flitwick, Slughorn, and Molly, whose wand flashes create a protective shield over the school. As Dementors approach, the shield repels them. Inside, Harry climbs a staircase with Luna, pausing to observe the glowing shield. Outside, Flitwick watches it rise, while Luna and Harry stand framed by torches. Harry encounters a ghostly woman who transforms into light and moves through him. Outside, Death Eaters, led by Voldemort and Bellatrix, gather on a cliff. Voldemort glares at Pius Thicknesse as Death Eaters fire bolts at the shield. Harry follows the ghostly Helena until she becomes light and speeds away. He rushes down to find Kingsley with Remus Lupin and Dean Thomas as the shield is struck. The Weasley twins and Hermione, behind Ron, watch the sky."
