          "description": "Misty dawn sunlight bathes over the New York cityscape as Peter stands on a payphone at his shabby quarters. Meanwhile, at her abode, Mary Jane is gazing at her handset. Mary Jane picks up the handset, but Peter has disconnected. Peter swivels around and picks up the handset. Captain Stacy places a mugshot down in front of Aunt May, and Peter grabs it. In a monochrome reminiscence, Peter observes his uncle sitting in his vehicle on a dim avenue, where Flint taps at the operator's pane with a firearm. Flint shoves Uncle Ben to the terrain as his partner rushes up, but Flint pushes him away, permitting the partner to leap into Uncle Ben's vehicle. Flint shoots Uncle Ben in cold blood, causing a tear to descend from Peter's eye as he imagines the scenario, and Uncle Ben collapses to the terrain, lifeless while the partner speeds away, abandoning Flint. Peter hurls the image of Flint down on the desk. Later in his shabby quarters, Peter taps his finger and broods as the radio ignites. Peter yanks up the door, lowers the volume, and Mary Jane gives him a wounded, irate look, purses her lips, and goes to the door, pulling at it. Peter, his visage unmasked and his eyes frigid, turns up the radio and stands brooding. Later, he changes into his Spider-Man suit and gazes intently at the radio on the chest of radios, beside which are images of Mary Jane, Uncle Ben, and Aunt May. He leans his head sorrowfully against the doorpost as lightning flashes and he lies on his bed, reliving the assault on his uncle. Something creeps across the floor, causing Peter to stir, lift his head, and then recline again. The invisible presence glides across the door and onto the bed, casting a knotted black shadow on the partition. In his slumber, Peter sees Uncle Ben gazing into his killer's eyes as glossy black tendrils latch onto Peter's hand. Flint shoots Ben, and the tendrils spread up Peter's arm, enveloping the Spider-Man suit like black ivy suffocating a tree. Peter's hands clutch the sheet spasmodically as the alien growth spreads down his torso, and in his reverie, Peter shoves Flint's partner out the window. The tendrils cover his face and his eyes open in terror. Peter, now with his Spider-Man suit totally black, hangs upside down from a skyscraper, gazing at his reflection in a dark-mirrored pane. He drops onto his feet on a ledge, takes a close look at his reflection, and clenches his digits. He flips up the side of the edifice and leaps into the air, swinging from a strand, sweeping low between the line of vehicles and up to a high roof adorned with lanterns. He clings to one massive lantern, looks out over the metropolis, and pulls off his black hood."

Meanwhile, in the cozy comfort of her own well-decorated home, Mary Jane is intently staring at her phone, caught in a moment of contemplation. She makes the decision to pick it up, but by that precise moment, Peter has already hung up the call. In a swift and fluid motion, Peter spins around and picks up the phone once more. Captain Stacy places a mugshot down assertively in front of Aunt May, and Peter quickly snatches it up, taking a keen interest. In a haunting, vivid black-and-white flashback, Peter envisions his beloved uncle sitting helplessly in his car on a dimly lit street, where Flint taps menacingly at the driver’s window with a threatening gun. Flint then forcefully pushes Uncle Ben to the ground, as his accomplice dashes forward, but Flint shoves him away, allowing the accomplice to jump into Uncle Ben’s car. Flint then shoots Uncle Ben in cold blood, causing a solitary tear to fall from Peter’s eye as he imagines the heart-wrenching scene, with Uncle Ben slumping lifelessly to the ground while the accomplice speeds away, leaving Flint behind. Peter, filled with anger and grief, flings the photo of Flint down hard on the desk. Later on, back in his rundown digs, Peter taps his finger in mounting frustration and broods as the radio suddenly comes to life with a jarring sound. He wrenches open the door, turns down the volume with a sharp twist, and Mary Jane gives him a deeply hurt, angry look, pursing her lips tightly as she moves toward the door, tugging at it impatiently. Peter, his face unmasked and his eyes cold and distant, turns up the radio once more and stands there brooding, lost in thought. Later, he changes into his Spider-Man suit and directs an intense stare at the radio perched on the chest of radios, beside which are cherished photos of Mary Jane, Uncle Ben, and Aunt May. He leans his head despondently against the doorpost, as lightning flashes outside, and he lies on his bed, reliving the traumatic attack on his uncle. Something unseen slithers across the floor, prompting Peter to stir, raise his head momentarily in curiosity, and then lie back down in reluctant acceptance. The unseen presence glides eerily across the door and onto the bed, casting a tangled black shadow ominously on the wall. In his restless sleep, Peter envisions Uncle Ben looking intently into his killer’s eyes as shiny black tendrils coil around Peter’s hand. Flint shoots Ben, and the tendrils spread ominously up Peter’s arm, enveloping the Spider-Man suit like black ivy smothering a tall, sturdy tree. Peter’s hands grip the sheet convulsively as the alien growth spreads down his torso, and in his vivid dream, Peter pushes Flint’s accomplice out of the window. The tendrils cover his face completely, and his eyes snap open wide with horror. Peter, now with his Spider-Man suit turned completely black, hangs precariously upside down from a towering skyscraper, gazing at his startling reflection in a dark-mirrored window. He drops onto his feet on a narrow ledge, takes a close, scrutinizing look at his reflection, and clenches his fingers tightly in resolve. He flips agilely up the side of the building and leaps boldly into the air, swinging from a delicate thread, sweeping low between the orderly line of cars and up to a high roof adorned beautifully with lanterns. He clings to one huge lantern, looks out pensively over the sprawling cityscape, and pulls off his black hood with a determined gesture."

Meanwhile, at her home in Queens, a neighborhood known for its diverse communities, Mary Jane is staring at her phone. Mary Jane picks up the phone, but Peter has rung off, his voice lost in the city's constant hum. Peter spins around and answers the phone, his surroundings cluttered with the remnants of his daily life. Captain Stacy, a dedicated officer known for his integrity, puts a mugshot down in front of Aunt May at the precinct, and Peter snatches it up, his fingers trembling with urgency. In a black and white flashback, Peter sees his uncle, Uncle Ben, a guiding figure in his life, sitting in his car on a dark street notorious for its criminal activity, where Flint, a small-time crook turned major threat, taps at the driver's window with a gun. Flint pushes Uncle Ben to the ground as his accomplice, known only in the records as a shadowy figure, runs up, but Flint pushes him away, allowing the accomplice to jump into Uncle Ben's car. Flint shoots Uncle Ben in cold blood, a tragedy that haunts Peter daily, resulting in a tear to fall from Peter’s eye as he imagines the scene, and Uncle Ben slumps to the ground, dead while the accomplice drives away, leaving Flint behind. Peter flings the photo of Flint down on the desk, frustration etched across his face. Later in his rundown digs, Peter taps his finger and broods, consumed by thoughts of revenge and justice, as the radio fires up, the familiar voices of New York's morning talk show hosts filling the room. Peter wrenches up the door, turns down the volume, and Mary Jane gives him a hurt, angry look, purses her lips, and goes to the door, tugging at it with a sense of finality. Peter, his face unmasked and his eyes cold, turns up the radio and stands brooding, feeling the weight of the city’s unending battle between good and evil. Later, he changes into his Spider-Man suit, a symbol of hope and responsibility he both cherishes and resents, and stares intently at the radio on the chest of radios, beside which are photos of Mary Jane, Uncle Ben, and Aunt May, reminders of his dual life. He leans his head morosely against the doorpost as lighting flashes, casting sharp shadows, and he lies on his bed, reliving the attack on his uncle. Something, perhaps a creature so foreign it feels like a waking nightmare, crawls across the floor, causing Peter to stir, raise his head, and then lie back down. The unseen presence, an otherworldly symbiote seeking a host, glides across the door and onto the bed, casting a tangled black shadow on the wall. In his sleep, Peter sees Uncle Ben looking into his killer’s eyes as shiny black tendrils, part of the alien symbiote, latch onto Peter’s hand. Flint shoots Ben, and the tendrils spread up Peter’s arm, covering the Spider-Man suit like black ivy smothering a tree, a metaphor for how it amplifies his darker instincts. Peter’s hands grip the sheet convulsively as the alien growth spreads down his torso, and in his dream, Peter pushes Flint’s accomplice out the window, driven by a primal need for vengeance. The tendrils cover his face and his eyes open in horror, reflecting his internal struggle. Peter, now with his Spider-Man suit completely black, hangs upside down from a skyscraper, a position that reflects his inverted moral standing, looking at his reflection in a dark-mirrored window. He drops onto his feet on a ledge, takes a close look at his reflection, and clenches his fingers, grappling with the power and rage within. He flips up the side of the building and leaps into the air, swinging from a thread, an agile movement that showcases his heightened abilities, sweeping low between the line of cars and up to a high roof adorned with lanterns, reminiscent of a traditional New York City rooftop garden. He clings to one huge lantern, looks out over the city, and pulls off his black hood, revealing a face set with determination."

          "description": "Foggy evening moonlight brushes over the Chicago horizon as a bookshelf leans on a calculator at its dilapidated kitchen. Meanwhile, at his garage, a violin is fumbling with its blender. The violin picks up the blender, but the bookshelf has signed off. The bookshelf swivels around and responds to the blender. A compass places a sketch in front of a tire, and the bookshelf grabs it up. In a sepia-toned memory, the bookshelf observes its fence lounging on a skateboard on a dim stairway, where a marker taps at the passenger's mirror with a shovel. The marker shoves the fence to the sidewalk as its partner sprints over, but the marker shoves it aside, allowing the partner to leap into the fence's skateboard. The marker strikes the fence in cold blood, causing a raindrop to fall from the bookshelf's page as it envisions the scenario, and the fence collapses to the sidewalk, lifeless while the partner skates away, leaving the marker behind. The bookshelf tosses the sketch of the marker down on the mat. Later in its dilapidated kitchen, the bookshelf taps its elbow and sulks as the television ignites. The bookshelf cranks up the hatch, dials down the noise, and the violin casts it a hurt, resentful glance, ruffles its leaves, and approaches the hatch, yanking at it. The bookshelf, its cover unlatched and its pages chilly, dials up the television and stands sulking. Later, it morphs into its Android outfit and squints intently at the television on the crate of televisions, beside which are illustrations of the violin, the fence, and the tire. It drops its head gloomily against the archway as thunderstorms and it rests on its mattress, replaying the assault on its fence. Something slides across the rug, prompting the bookshelf to shift, lift its head, and then recline. The invisible entity sails across the hatch and onto the mattress, casting a knotted white silhouette on the bricks. In its slumber, the bookshelf perceives the fence staring into its attacker's whiskers as silver tendrils grip the bookshelf's hinge. The marker strikes the fence, and the tendrils extend up the bookshelf's spine, enveloping the Android outfit like silver vines strangling a bush. The bookshelf's hinges clutch the fabric spasmodically as the extraterrestrial expansion travels down its beam, and in its nightmare, the bookshelf ejects the marker's partner out the chimney. The tendrils envelop its cover and its pages snap open in terror. The bookshelf, now with its Android outfit fully silver, dangles upright from a clocktower, inspecting its likeness in a shaded pane. It lands onto its hinges on a balcony, scrutinizes its likeness, and locks its hinges. It flips over the edge of the monument and vaults into the atmosphere, swinging from a yarn, sweeping close between the line of bicycles and up to a high spire decorated with flags. It clings to one enormous flag, gazes out over the landscape, and strips off its silver helmet."

John places down the tablet, but Sarah has signed off. Sarah twirls around and reads the tablet. Detective Rogers slides a dossier across to Grandma Lucy, and Sarah grabs it eagerly. In a sepia-toned memory, Sarah recalls her grandfather reclining in his boat on a misty river, where Zack taps at the paddle's edge with a stick. Zack nudges Grandpa Joe overboard as his friend bicycles up, but Zack pulls him away, allowing the friend to sail away in Grandpa Joe's boat. Zack punches Grandpa Joe into oblivion, causing a frown to crease Sarah's brow as she relives the memory, and Grandpa Joe drifts lifelessly while the friend sails away, abandoning Zack. Sarah hurls the image of Zack across the room. Later in her pristine villa, Sarah drums her fingers and ponders as the television crackles to life. Sarah yanks open the window, mutes the sound, and John gives her a betrayed, sorrowful glance, crosses his arms, and heads to the window, sliding it open. Sarah, her demeanor unveiled and her gaze icy, increases the volume and stands contemplating. Later, she dons her Catwoman costume and glowers at the television on the cabinet of screens, next to which are depictions of John, Grandpa Joe, and Grandma Lucy. She rests her head despondently against the window frame as thunder rumbles and she reclines on her chaise, replaying the incident with her grandfather. Something scuttles along the wall, prompting Sarah to lift her gaze, then recline once more. The mysterious entity sweeps across the window and onto the chaise, casting a twisted obsidian silhouette on the drapes. In her slumber, Sarah envisions Grandpa Joe staring into his assailant's gaze as shiny black threads wind around Sarah's wrist. Zack punches Joe, and the threads snake up Sarah's arm, enveloping the Catwoman costume like dark vines enveloping a structure. Sarah's fingers clutch the pillow erratically as the foreign growth creeps down her figure, and in her vision, Sarah shoves Zack's friend out the porthole. The threads wrap around her face and her eyes snap open in shock. Sarah, now with her Catwoman costume entirely midnight, dangles upside down from a pagoda, surveying her likeness in a dimly lit glass. She descends onto her hands on a ridge, scrutinizes her appearance, and flexes her toes. She cartwheels up the façade and vaults into the sky, gliding from a silk cord, gliding low past the row of rickshaws and onto an elevated terrace adorned with pagodas. She grips one massive pagoda, surveys the metropolis, and sheds her dark veil."

In a sepia-toned dream, Oliver watches his grandfather riding his bike on a bright avenue, where Carl knocks on the passenger's door with a crowbar. Carl shoves Grandpa Joe off the bike as his partner ambles over, but Carl shoves him aside, allowing the partner to hop onto Grandpa Joe's bike. Carl strikes Grandpa Joe with a cruel blow, causing a sob to escape from Oliver's mouth as he reimagines the moment, and Grandpa Joe collapses to the pavement, lifeless while the partner pedals away, abandoning Carl. Oliver hurls the sketch of Carl down on the table. Later in his cluttered attic, Oliver taps his toe and sulks as the gramophone crackles.

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

          "description": "As Peter stands at a payphone in his rundown New York apartment, a black-and-white flashback haunts him: Flint kills Uncle Ben in cold blood, leaving Peter devastated. Captain Stacy shows Aunt May a mugshot, which Peter takes, and Peter broods over his past, surrounded by photos of Mary Jane, Uncle Ben, and Aunt May. Despite Mary Jane's hurt, Peter immerses himself in music, later changing into his Spider-Man suit. As he sleeps, black tendrils envelop him, transforming his suit into a black version. Dreaming of revenge, Peter's transformation symbolizes his inner turmoil. Now clad in the black suit, he swings across the city, confronting his reflection and grappling with his dark transformation."
