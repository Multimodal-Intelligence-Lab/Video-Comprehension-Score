Max pivots and jogs with the others, then halts. He ascends a scaffold and peers over the troupe. Max peers down at a shouting old woman, then strides away.

Farnsworth shoves Max. A boy bounds toward the carriage. Farnsworth aims at him. A boy shoves Benny onward. Farnsworth aims at Benny. Giovanni crouches by Benny. Farnsworth gazes upward and steps back toward the brink of the raft. He glances to his left, then at the troupe of travelers. Max scowls at Farnsworth. Farnsworth stands at alert and waves, then holds the pen to his own chest. He scribbles and tumbles into the puddle. Max pivots and then jogs to the troupe. On the far side of the raft, workers tilt another carriage onto the ground below. Max lifts a sobbing woman, then strides toward the troupe of travelers. Max rushes forward. Max hands the woman to a lady, climbs into the carriage, and settles. The lady hands the woman to Max. John and Lily sprint for the lounge. Randolph stands by the hearth, examining a statue. Randolph gives Lily his coat. She embraces Randolph. Lily dashes through a swinging gate. John peers back, bows, then trails Lily. Elsewhere, an attendant clutching two coats dashes toward the Grand Hallway. Outdoors, a seaman rotates a crank as others toil to flip over the top of the carriage. Admiral Jones observes, then pivots as a boy wades through shallow soup on the roof. A lady clutching a doll steps toward the admiral. Admiral Jones observes her, then pivots and strides away. A boy with a coat rushes up to the admiral. The admiral pauses, glances at the coat, then strolls away. Waist-deep in stew, he strides onto the balcony. Admiral Jones examines a helm and various gadgets, then steps into the pilothouse and closes the gate. The brass band finishes performing. Bearing their gadgets, three of the band members stroll away as travelers dash past. Marley, the trumpet player, positions his gadget against his shoulder and continues performing."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Murdoch, rushing to a stairwell, witnesses chaos as Cal runs with the crowd, only to stop and look over a crying girl before leaving her. Rose and Jack race up a staircase amid falling and dangling people. Cal encounters Murdoch, who rejects his bribe and pushes him aside. A man leaps for a lifeboat, and Murdoch shoots, ultimately firing at Tommy. Distressed, Murdoch salutes and ends his life. Cal, turning back to the crowd, aids a crying girl, eventually securing a place in a lifeboat with her. Jack and Rose head to the smoking room, where Andrews gives Rose a lifebelt before they leave. Meanwhile, Captain Smith watches a lifeboat operation, then solemnly retreats to the bridge, shutting himself in the wheelhouse. The string quartet plays on, with Hartley continuing to perform as chaos surrounds them."
