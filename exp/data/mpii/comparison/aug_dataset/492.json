Within the expansive interior, a sparse number of people are seated in prayer, scattered throughout the vast sea of elegant oak pews that fill the space. Malcolm scans the grand and majestic interior, searching thoroughly until his eyes settle on what he is seeking. It is at the very back row of the church that he spots his intended target. He moves steadily down the central aisle toward the rear, observing as he goes. There, he sees Cole, who is seated in his pew, deeply engrossed in playing with a set of small, green, and beige plastic soldiers. Cole animates the soldiers with whispered conversations, even as he remains quite rigid, his hands tightly clutching the little plastic riflemen with determination. Malcolm acknowledges the unfolding scene before him by nodding at the information it presents, then allows a warm smile to spread across his face as he looks at Cole. His eyes then shift downward, noticing the small array of tiny cuts and bruises that cover Cole's arms. The silent exchange of stares between Cole and Malcolm carries an unspoken understanding. Meanwhile, Lynn approaches Cole, keenly checking to ensure his tie is in place, and then carefully unclasping it. Cole takes his seat at the kitchen table as Lynn makes her way back into the adjoining laundry room. The dog, once a familiar presence, is now conspicuously absent.

The old stone faÃ§ade and towering spires sharply contrast with the surrounding modern buildings, creating a striking image that captivates him. Gathering all his strength, Malcolm leans into the highly ornate doors, pushing them open with effort before slipping inside the church's welcoming interior. Within the expansive room, only a few individuals are scattered among the sea of oak pews, each engaged in silent prayer. His eyes sweep across the majestic space until they settle on what he's seeking in the last row. Moving deliberately down the center aisle, he approaches the back to find Cole engrossed in play, sitting in his pew with a set of green and beige plastic soldiers. The young boy is absorbed in making the soldiers converse, yet remains rigid, his small hands tightly clutching a handful of plastic riflemen. Observing this, Malcolm nods to himself, processes the information, and offers Cole a warm smile. His gaze drifts downward to note the tiny cuts and bruises that mark Cole's arms. A silent exchange unfolds as Cole and Malcolm stare at each other, their eyes locked in unspoken communication. Meanwhile, Lynn approaches Cole, briefly checking and unclipping his tie with practiced ease. Cole takes his place at the kitchen table, waiting as Lynn returns to the laundry room. The absence of the dog goes unnoticed as she reaches into the dryer, searching through the contents for a fresh tie. With one in hand, she confidently steps back into the kitchen, only to be met with a shocking sight that draws a scream from her lipsâ€”every cabinet and drawer is flung wide open. Cole, seated at the table with his hands pressed flatly upon its surface, appears shaken but remains silent. An unspoken pause hangs in the air before Lynn's attention shifts to an open cabinet near the sink, where pop tarts are visibly stored. As Lynn leans down, Cole mirrors the action, looking into her eyes. A moment later, Cole turns to see Lynn holding the pop tarts, which he accepts from her hands before leaving. Lynn's gaze lingers on the kitchen table, where it halts on the sight of two tiny handprints of sweat imprinted on the surface. Outside, Tommy Tammisimo, an imposing eight-year-old Italian boy dressed in his school uniform, waits patiently at the bottom of the brownstone stairs. As Cole emerges from the building, he descends the steps and joins Tommy, the two boys beginning their walk to school. Tommy throws an arm around Cole, prompting a reciprocal wave. Once they turn the corner and slip out of Lynn's view, Tommy swiftly withdraws his arm. Cole, undeterred, starts to smile as he processes his thoughts. The silent camaraderie between Cole and Lynn is evident as they exchange smiles, and Lynn dutifully collects Cole's school bag and jacket before proceeding to the kitchen. Within the den, which also serves as a playroom, boxes of old toys are tucked in the corner alongside a small, plastic, multi-colored table resting on the rug. Cole appears in the doorway, prompting Malcolm to sit up and smile in recognition."

He has to use all his strength to push open the highly ornate doors, crafted in the late 19th century by skilled artisans, and slips inside. Only a few people sit and pray in the sea of oak pews, some of which have been polished by generations of worshippers. Malcolm scans the majestic room, its stained-glass windows depicting biblical scenes, and finds what he's looking for in the last row of the church. He moves down the center aisle towards the back and finds Cole playing in his pew with a set of green and beige plastic soldiers, toys that were popularized during the mid-20th century as inexpensive children's playthings. Cole makes the soldiers talk to each other but stays rigid, hands clutching a handful of plastic riflemen that resemble figures from World War II. Malcolm nods at the information, smiles at Cole, and his eyes drift down to Cole's arms, which are covered in tiny cuts and bruises that suggest a recent encounter with bullies. Cole and Malcolm just stare at each other. Lynn walks over to Cole, checks his tie, part of his neatly pressed school uniform, and unclips the tie. Cole takes a seat at the kitchen table as Lynn walks back into the laundry room. The dog, which used to be a rambunctious presence, is gone now, and Lynn reaches into the dryer, digging for a new tie. She finds one, noticing it's patterned with stripes in school colors, then turns and steps back into the kitchen and screams at the top of her lungs, as every cabinet and every drawer is wide open, an eerie occurrence they have been experiencing lately. Cole sits at the kitchen table, his hands pressed flat on the tabletop, looking shaken. Neither says anything for a beat. Lynn looks over to the open cabinet near the sink, where the pop tarts, a quick breakfast favorite first introduced in the 1960s, are clearly visible. Lynn leans down, Cole does, and he looks at her eyes. Cole turns to see Lynn holding the pop tarts, takes them from her, and leaves. Lynn glances to the kitchen table, and her gaze stops on the two tiny handprints of sweat formed on the table's surface, evidence of Cole's distress. Tommy Tammisimo, a tough-looking, eight-year-old Italian kid known for being the class clown, in his neatly pressed school uniform, waits at the bottom of Cole's brownstone stairs. Brownstones, iconic to East Coast cities like Philadelphia, are known for their distinctive sandstone facade. Cole emerges from the brownstone, moves down the steps, and the two boys begin their walk down the street to school. Tommy puts his arm around Cole, a gesture mimicking camaraderie, and Cole waves back. When the two boys turn the corner and are out of Lynn's sight, Tommy rips his arm away, revealing a shift in his outward friendliness. Cole starts to smile too and thinks about the complexities of school friendships. Cole and Lynn smile at each other, and Lynn takes Cole's school bag and jacket before moving to the kitchen. The den doubles as a playroom, filled with memories as boxes of old toys sit in the corner, and a small, plastic, multi-colored table on the rug where Cole used to play much as a toddler. Cole appears in the doorway, and Malcolm, who has taken a keen interest in Cole's well-being, sits up and smiles."

          "description": "Victor glances up at the ancient Madrid library noiselessly, with its crumbling brick and massive spires making it blend into the prehistoric structures all around it. He has to muster all his courage to pull open the intricately simple windows and creeps inside. Only a handful of shadows stand and dance in the ocean of metal benches. Victor examines the grand hallway and locates what he's searching for in the first row of the library. He glides up the left aisle towards the front and spots Alex jumping in his bench with a stack of orange and purple wooden blocks. Alex makes the blocks float near each other but stays frozen, fingers gripping a pile of wooden pilots. Victor shakes at the misunderstanding, grins at Alex, and his gaze floats up to Alex's hands, which are hidden in small feathers and petals. Alex and Victor just blink at one another. Emma wanders over to Alex, fixes his hat, and snaps the hat. Alex stands up at the dining chair as Emma strolls back into the study. The cat is present now, and Emma pulls from the drawer, searching for an old book. She finds one, then spins and jumps back into the dining room and whispers at the bottom of her throat, as every curtain and every blind is shut tight. Alex stands at the dining chair, his feet pressed softly on the floor, appearing eager. Neither whispers anything for a moment. Emma glances over to the closed window near the mirror, where the crackers are slightly obscured. Emma kneels down, Alex rises, and he squints at her lips. Alex turns to notice Emma holding the crackers, grips them from her, and stays. Emma peers to the dining chair, and her sight freezes on the two tiny footprints of dust etched on the floor's texture. Danny Divincenzo, a cheerful-looking, twelve-year-old French girl in her gym uniform, hopes at the middle of Alex's white picket gate. Alex descends from the white gate, strolls up the ramp, and the two girls halt their drive down the alley to practice. Danny flicks her hair around Alex, and Alex waves forward. When the two girls twist the bend and are within Emma's vision, Danny pulls her hair outward. Alex begins to frown slightly and wonders. Alex and Emma frown at each other, and Emma places Alex's gym shoes and cap before sliding to the dining room. The attic triples as an art studio, with piles of new books lying in the cabinet and a large, wooden, single-colored canvas on the shelf. Alex stands in the corridor, and Victor slides down and frowns."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby cafÃ©, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Gathering his strength, he enters and spots Cole, playing with toy soldiers in the pews. Malcolm notes Cole's bruised arms as they share a silent moment. Later, at home, Cole sits at the kitchen table while his mother, Lynn, fetches a tie. She screams upon finding all cabinets open, with Cole looking startled. She hands him pop tarts before he leaves. Coleâ€™s friend, Tommy, initially shows support as they walk to school but then distances himself, leaving Cole contemplative. Back home, Cole and Lynn exchange smiles, creating a warm family moment."
