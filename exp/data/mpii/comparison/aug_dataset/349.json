The Witch-King swoops down on his Fell-Beast, and the Fell-Beast lands on Theoden's dead horse. The Fell-Beast opens its wicked jaws, and a Rohan soldier stands before the beast. The Witch-King laughs. The Fell-Beast lifts Eowyn from her feet. Suddenly, with a mighty sword blow, the Fell-Beast's head is severed, crumpling the creature to the ground with its vast wings outstretched, sending the Witch-King sprawling. The Witch-King rises from the wreckage. Eowyn stands before him, the Fell-Beast's blood dripping from her sword. With a shrill shriek of hatred, he knocks Eowyn backward with his mace. Stunned, Eowyn tries to stand and is hit once again with a crippling blow. Eowyn tries to block the blow, but her shield shatters into many pieces as the Witch-King towers over her. Meanwhile, an Orc commander hurries to the Anduin River docks, close to the city. Large black shadows slide across the docks as sailing ships approach. A sinister black sailed ship glides into the docks, followed by nine other Corsair ships. Aragorn leaps from the leading ship and charges across the docks, roaring at the top of his lungs, followed by Legolas and Gimli. The Orcs are surprised by the three charging towards thousands of them. Suddenly, the Army of the Dead leaps straight out of the sides of the ships. They charge across the surface of the water with frightening speed, overtaking Aragorn. The Orcs scream at the sight of 5000 spectral warriors. The spectral warriors swarm into the flank of the Orc army, creating a rolling mountain of ghouls that sweep all before them away. The Orcs have no defense as their weapons cannot make contact with the ghosts. Meanwhile, Merry is on the ground and sees the Witch-King standing over Eowyn, pulling her to her feet. Merry drives his sword into the back of the Witch-King's knee, causing his sword to burst into flame and his arm to be shot with pain. Eowyn struggles to her feet, pulling off her helmet, and her long hair tumbles onto her shoulders. With her last strength, Eowyn thrusts her sword into the Witch-King's face. Eowyn's sword shatters into many shards, and the Witch-King topples back dead, with black ooze leaking from his robes and armor. A shuddering cry, fading into a shrill wail, passes with the wind. Meanwhile, Aragorn and Legolas battle the Orcs, and Legolas jumps onto the back of a giant Mumakil, bringing it down. He lands on his feet in front of Gimli.",

The Witch-King plunges down on his Fell-Beast, and the Fell-Beast descends on Theoden's lifeless steed. The Fell-Beast opens its malevolent jaws, and a Rohan warrior stands before the creature. The Witch-King chuckles. The Fell-Beast hoists Eowyn from her feet. Suddenly, with a powerful sword strike, the Fell-Beast's head is decapitated, collapsing the creature to the ground with its immense wings outspread, sending the Witch-King sprawling. The Witch-King rises from the debris. Eowyn stands before him, the Fell-Beast's gore dripping from her sword. With a piercing cry of animosity, he knocks Eowyn backward with his mace. Dazed, Eowyn attempts to stand and is struck once again with a debilitating blow. Eowyn attempts to block the blow, but her shield shatters into many fragments as the Witch-King towers over her. Meanwhile, an Orc commander rushes to the Anduin River piers, close to the metropolis. Large black silhouettes glide across the piers as sailing vessels approach. A menacing black-sailed vessel slides into the piers, followed by nine other Corsair vessels. Aragorn springs from the leading vessel and charges across the piers, shouting at the top of his lungs, followed by Legolas and Gimli. The Orcs are astonished by the three charging towards thousands of them. Suddenly, the Army of the Dead vaults straight out of the sides of the vessels. They charge across the surface of the water with terrifying speed, overtaking Aragorn. The Orcs screech at the sight of 5000 ghostly warriors. The ghostly warriors swarm into the side of the Orc army, creating a rolling mountain of specters that sweep everything before them away. The Orcs have no defense as their weapons cannot make contact with the phantoms. Meanwhile, Merry is on the ground and perceives the Witch-King standing over Eowyn, pulling her to her feet. Merry drives his sword into the back of the Witch-King's knee, causing his sword to ignite and his arm to be shot with agony. Eowyn struggles to her feet, pulling off her helmet, and her long hair cascades onto her shoulders. With her last strength, Eowyn thrusts her sword into the Witch-King's visage. Eowyn's sword shatters into many fragments, and the Witch-King collapses back deceased, with black ooze leaking from his robes and armor. A trembling cry, fading into a sharp wail, passes with the breeze. Meanwhile, Aragorn and Legolas battle the Orcs, and Legolas leaps onto the back of a giant Mumakil, bringing it down.

The Fell-Beast is swooped down upon by the Witch-King, and Theoden's dead horse is landed on by the Fell-Beast. Its wicked jaws are opened by the Fell-Beast, and the beast is stood before by a Rohan soldier. Laughter comes from the Witch-King. Eowyn is lifted from her feet by the Fell-Beast. Suddenly, with a mighty sword blow, the head of the Fell-Beast is severed, crumpling the creature to the ground with its vast wings outstretched, and the Witch-King is sent sprawling. The wreckage is risen from by the Witch-King. Before him stands Eowyn, with the Fell-Beast's blood dripping from her sword. With a shrill shriek of hatred, Eowyn is knocked backward by his mace.

Beneath the weight of the animal, Theoden lies gravely injured and dying. The ominous Witch-King swoops down menacingly on his daunting Fell-Beast, which soon lands heavily on the lifeless body of Theoden's horse. The Fell-Beast, with its sinister and wicked jaws, opens wide, and a brave Rohan soldier stands defiantly in front of the terrible creature. The Witch-King emits a chilling laugh. The Fell-Beast suddenly lifts Eowyn off her feet into the air. Without warning, a mighty sword strike severs the head of the Fell-Beast clean off, causing the enormous creature to crumple to the ground with its vast and tattered wings spread wide, forcing the Witch-King to be thrown sprawling into disarray. Rising from the aftermath and wreckage, the Witch-King stands before Eowyn, who is resolute, her sword dripping with the Fell-Beast's dark blood. With a sudden and shrill shriek of intense hatred, he hammers Eowyn backward with a crushing blow from his mace. Momentarily stunned, Eowyn makes an attempt to rise, only to be struck down again by a crippling blow. Eowyn tries desperately to block the fearsome attack, but her shield shatters into countless pieces as the Witch-King towers ominously above her. Meanwhile, near the city, an Orc commander rushes towards the docks of the Anduin River. Large, foreboding black shadows stretch across the docks as menacing sailing ships approach.

Abruptly, the scene reveals the lifeless form of the horse, under which Theoden lies gravely injured and nearing death. At that moment, the ominous figure of the Witch-King descends from the skies on his menacing Fell-Beast. The creature lands heavily upon Theoden's dead horse, its weight causing the ground to tremble. With a bone-chilling anticipation, the Fell-Beast opens its maw, displaying rows of wickedly sharp teeth, as a Rohan soldier steels himself before the monstrous entity. The Witch-King's laughter reverberates through the air, thick with malice. In a swift motion, the Fell-Beast grasps Eowyn, lifting her from the ground with an effortless strength. Suddenly, in an unexpected turn, the mighty force of a sword severing the Fell-Beast's head sends the creature crashing to the ground, its vast wings sprawling lifelessly, which in turn throws the Witch-King from his perch. The Witch-King, undeterred, rises from the chaotic wreckage, locking eyes with Eowyn who now stands defiantly before him, her sword glistening with the creature's blood. Unleashing a piercing shriek filled with venomous hatred, the Witch-King swings his mace, knocking Eowyn backward with brutal force. Dazed, Eowyn struggles to regain her footing, only to be struck again by another powerful blow. Her attempt to block the attack results tragically in her shield fragmenting into countless pieces as the Witch-King looms threateningly over her. Meanwhile, an Orc commander makes haste to the Anduin River docks, located near the besieged city. The scene shifts as vast black shadows slide ominously across the docks, heralding the arrival of imposing sailing ships. A sinister vessel draped in black sails glides into the docks, closely followed by nine more Corsair ships. Aragorn makes a dynamic leap from the lead ship and charges determinedly across the docks, his voice raised in a loud battle cry, with Legolas and Gimli swiftly following. The unexpected sight of these three warriors charging boldly towards an overwhelming horde of Orcs catches the enemy off guard. Suddenly, the ethereal Army of the Dead emerges dramatically from the very sides of the ships, their spectral forms dashing across the water's surface with terrifying speed, outpacing Aragorn and stunning the Orcs with their ghostly presence. The sight of 5000 spectral warriors fills the air with terror, as these otherworldly soldiers pour into the flank of the Orc army, transforming into an unstoppable wave that sweeps away all it encounters. The Orcs, in a panic, find themselves defenseless, their weapons passing harmlessly through the incorporeal forms of the ghostly warriors. Meanwhile, Merry, lying on the ground, witnesses the dire situation as the Witch-King looms over Eowyn, pulling her to her feet. With a sudden determination, Merry drives his sword into the vulnerable spot at the back of the Witch-King's knee, causing an explosive surge of flame along his sword and a searing pain to shoot through his arm. Eowyn, despite her injuries, pulls herself up, removing her helmet to reveal her long hair cascading onto her shoulders. Summoning her remaining strength, she drives her sword with precision into the Witch-King's face. The sword shatters into countless shards upon impact, and the Witch-King collapses backward, lifeless, as thick black ooze seeps from his robes and armor. A shuddering cry escapes into the air, fading gradually into a shrill wail carried by the wind. Meanwhile, Aragorn and Legolas continue to engage in fierce combat with the Orcs. In a display of acrobatic prowess, Legolas leaps onto the back of a towering Mumakil, bringing the giant beast down single-handedly before landing agilely on his feet in front of Gimli."

Theoden, King of Rohan and leader of his people in this momentous battle, lies dying beneath it. The Witch-King, the feared leader of the Nazgûl who has plagued Middle-earth for centuries, swoops down on his Fell-Beast, a monstrous creature bred in the dark lands of Mordor known for its terrifying presence in battle, and the Fell-Beast lands on Theoden's dead horse. The Fell-Beast opens its wicked jaws, and a brave Rohan soldier, fiercely loyal to his king, stands before the beast. The Witch-King, confident in his otherworldly powers, laughs. The Fell-Beast lifts Eowyn, Theoden’s niece who secretly joined the battle disguised as a man, from her feet. Suddenly, with a mighty sword blow from Eowyn, the Fell-Beast's head is severed, crumpling the creature to the ground with its vast wings outstretched, sending the Witch-King sprawling. The Witch-King, undaunted by the fall, rises from the wreckage. Eowyn stands before him, the Fell-Beast's blood dripping from her sword. With a shrill shriek of hatred, he knocks Eowyn backward with his mace, a feared weapon of destruction in the dark arts. Stunned, Eowyn tries to stand and is hit once again with a crippling blow. Eowyn tries to block the blow, but her shield, an heirloom of her family, shatters into many pieces as the Witch-King towers over her. Meanwhile, an Orc commander hurries to the Anduin River docks, a strategic location vital for supply lines to the city. Large black shadows slide across the docks as sailing ships approach, signaling an unexpected turn in the battle. A sinister black sailed ship, part of a fleet of Corsairs allied with Sauron, glides into the docks, followed by nine other Corsair ships. Aragorn, the exiled heir to the throne of Gondor and leader of the free peoples, leaps from the leading ship and charges across the docks, roaring at the top of his lungs, followed by Legolas, a skilled Elven archer from the Woodland Realm, and Gimli, a stout Dwarf warrior from the Lonely Mountain. The Orcs are surprised by the three charging towards thousands of them, their confidence shaken. Suddenly, the Army of the Dead, bound to Aragorn by an ancient oath, leaps straight out of the sides of the ships. They charge across the surface of the water with frightening speed, overtaking Aragorn. The Orcs scream at the sight of 5000 spectral warriors, their ghostly forms a terrifying sight. The spectral warriors swarm into the flank of the Orc army, creating a rolling mountain of ghouls that sweep all before them away. The Orcs have no defense as their weapons cannot make contact with the ghosts, rendering them powerless. Meanwhile, Merry, a hobbit far from his peaceful Shire and fighting bravely alongside his friends, is on the ground and sees the Witch-King standing over Eowyn, pulling her to her feet. Merry drives his sword, a weapon blessed by ancient Elf-magic, into the back of the Witch-King's knee, causing his sword to burst into flame and his arm to be shot with pain. Eowyn struggles to her feet, pulling off her helmet, and her long hair tumbles onto her shoulders, revealing her true identity. With her last strength, Eowyn thrusts her sword into the Witch-King's face. Eowyn's sword shatters into many shards, and the Witch-King topples back dead, with black ooze, a sign of his otherworldly corruption, leaking from his robes and armor. A shuddering cry, fading into a shrill wail, passes with the wind as the Witch-King's essence is vanquished. Meanwhile, Aragorn and Legolas battle the Orcs, and Legolas jumps onto the back of a giant Mumakil, an enormous war beast used by the enemies of Gondor, bringing it down with unmatched agility and skill. He lands on his feet in front of Gimli, much to the dwarf's astonishment."

Boromir vaults from the advance carriage and sprints across the docks, bellowing at maximum volume, accompanied by Frodo and Pippin. The Goblins are confounded by the trio advancing towards droves of them. Unexpectedly, the Legion of Phantoms vaults directly out of the walls of the carriages. They dash across the skin of the pond with terrifying haste, outpacing Boromir. The Goblins howl at the vision of 5000 apparition fighters. The apparition fighters swarm into the abreast of the Goblin legion, concocting a rolling hill of specters that push all in their path away. The Goblins possess no protection as their blades cannot connect with the apparitions.

He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

As the Witch-King laughs, the Fell-Beast lifts Eowyn, but she severs its head with a sword blow, causing the Witch-King to fall. Rising from the wreckage, the Witch-King knocks Eowyn down with his mace, shattering her shield. Meanwhile, an Orc commander rushes to the Anduin River docks as black-sailed Corsair ships arrive. Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli charge the Orcs, with the Army of the Dead following, overwhelming the Orcs with spectral warriors. Merry sees the Witch-King over Eowyn and stabs him, enabling Eowyn to thrust her sword into the Witch-King's face, killing him. Meanwhile, Aragorn and Legolas fight the Orcs, with Legolas taking down a giant Mumakil."
