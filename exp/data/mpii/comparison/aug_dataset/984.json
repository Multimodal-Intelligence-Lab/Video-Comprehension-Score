Benjamin opens his hotel room door to Daisy, who lowers her eyes as she steps over the threshold, and he closes the door of room 325. They stand in profile, silhouetted against the low light of his hotel room, and she nods. Daisy reaches out and gently strokes Benjamin's smooth cheek, and he tenderly massages her left shoulder.

Daisy is followed by Benjamin through a bright corridor to the back entrance, where outside, a look is shared by them. Robert's beige SUV is strolled to by Daisy, and she is watched by Benjamin as she gets in. Benjamin is fixed on by her eyes as the road is reversed onto by Robert, and beneath a concrete canopy studded with lights, Benjamin stands, watching as the vehicle drives away. The hospital is buffeted by a strong wind as the diary is returned to by Caroline. Daisy is opened the hotel room door by Benjamin, who lowers her eyes as the threshold is stepped over by her, and room 325's door is closed by him. In profile, they stand, silhouetted against the low light of his hotel room, and she nods. Benjamin's smooth cheek is gently stroked by Daisy, and her left shoulder is tenderly massaged by him. Her coat is slid off her shoulders by him as he draws her closer, and they are held tightly by each other. In the eye, she is looked by him, and her coat is gently slid off by him. The room contains a TV set, and with only a bra and knickers worn, Daisy stands with her back to Benjamin, who's propped up in bed. She is watched by him as her black leotard is pulled on, her coat is put on, and she is faced by him.

The building is entered by Daisy via the back door, where she is beckoned into the room by Queenie's daughter. The diary is given to her by a bearded man with a name tag after he rises. Looking down, she turns on hearing a piano. Into the communal living area, she walks, where the keyboard of the piano is hunched over by a figure. Daisy approaches the figure as David and Queenie's daughter hover, and a vacant stare is given by him. About 12, he's a child, and Benjamin is reached out to by her, but he recoils. At her, he turns and looks, with cropped, sandy hair and acne. An inward breath is slowly taken by Daisy as she blinks and takes a seat beside him, and her eyes are narrowed by him. Shaking her head, she recalls drying his hair with a towel, and on the high, gray-slate rooftop, little Benjamin stands."

Benjamin, with measured steps, follows Daisy through a brightly lit corridor that leads to the back entrance, where they momentarily lock eyes once more, sharing an unspoken connection before Daisy turns away.

Moving purposefully toward the noise, she walks into the communal living area where a figure sits hunched over the piano keyboard. As David and Queenie's daughter linger nearby, Daisy approaches the figure, who turns to stare vacantly at her, revealing himself to be a child of about 12 years old. Daisy reaches out tentatively, but Benjamin draws back, a reflexive gesture of hesitation. As their eyes meet, she observes his cropped, sandy hair and the acne dotting his skin. Daisy blinks slowly, taking a deep inward breath, and quietly takes a seat beside him. He narrows his eyes, scrutinizing her as she shakes her head, lost in a memory of a time when she was drying his hair gently with a towel and little Benjamin stood on a high, gray-slate rooftop, a distant scene now vividly recalled."

They gaze at each other, and a smile plays on Benjamin's lips as Daisy frowns, her usual cheerful demeanor clouded by the day's events. She strides past him to the windowed office, a space once used by the building's original architects, turns to him, and closes the door, the sound echoing in the quiet corridor. Benjamin follows Daisy through a bright corridor decorated with paintings from local artists to the back entrance, where outside, they share a look that speaks volumes about their shared past. Daisy turns and strolls to Robert's beige SUV, a model known for its reliability and spaciousness, and Benjamin watches as she gets in. Her eyes remain fixed on Benjamin as Robert reverses onto the road, and Benjamin stands beneath a concrete canopy studded with lights, which had been installed to guide evening visitors safely, watching as the vehicle drives away. A strong wind, typical of the coastal area, buffets the hospital as Caroline returns to the diary, a well-worn leather-bound book filled with years of memories. Benjamin opens his hotel room door to Daisy, who lowers her eyes, contemplating the significance of this meeting as she steps over the threshold, and he closes the door of room 325, a standard room in the mid-range hotel chain. They stand in profile, silhouetted against the low light of his hotel room, which flickers with the glow from the busy street below, and she nods, understanding the unspoken words between them. Daisy reaches out and gently strokes Benjamin's smooth cheek, reminiscent of their younger days, and he tenderly massages her left shoulder, feeling the tension that life had placed there over the years. He draws her closer, and they hold each other tightly, a silent promise shared between them. He looks her in the eye and gently slides her coat off her shoulders, the fabric whispering as it falls. A TV set is in the room, casting a muted blue glow, and wearing only a bra and knickers, Daisy stands with her back to Benjamin, who's propped up in bed reflecting on the complexity of their relationship. He watches as she pulls her black leotard on, an outfit from her days as a dancer, puts her coat on, and turns to face him with eyes that speak of both love and regret. He looks at her with an air of sadness as she strolls to his hotel room door and leans on the windowsill, contemplating the city skyline, as she walks to a taxi. Daisy gets into a yellow taxi outside her large, white house, the garden blooming with flowers she tended herself, and the cab pulls away. Now in her late 60s, Daisy addresses the cab driver, a familiar face from many journeys, as the taxi approaches the stately, white-clapboard edifice of the retirement home, a place known for its caring staff and serene environment. An elderly black man sits at a table in the courtyard, sketching scenes from his childhood, as wrapped in a shawl, Daisy ambles up nearby and smiles weakly as she looks around, recognizing faces from her past. Daisy enters the building via the back door, where Queenie's daughter, who manages the daily activities there, beckons her into the room. A bearded man with a name tag rises and gives her the diary, a token of her long and eventful life. Daisy looks down, then turns on hearing a piano playing a familiar tune. She walks into the communal living area, where a figure is hunched over the keyboard of the piano, music filling the air like the memories it evokes. David and Queenie's daughter hover as Daisy approaches the figure, who turns and stares vacantly, lost in his own world. He's a child of about 12, and she reaches out, but Benjamin recoils, the recognition stirring old emotions. He turns and looks at her, with cropped, sandy hair and acne, signs of his awkward transition into adolescence. Daisy blinks and takes a slow, inward breath as she takes a seat beside him, her heart heavy with nostalgia, and he narrows his eyes, the confusion of youth clear on his face. She shakes her head, recalling when she was drying his hair with a towel, and little Benjamin stands on the high, gray-slate rooftop, a place where he often escaped to dream of adventures beyond his reach."

          "description": "Eleanor and George march along to the garden as Violet heads to the attic windows. They smirk at each other, and a grin dances on Oliver's cheeks as Violet scowls. She glides past him to the glass-laden workshop, pivots to him, and slams the gate. Oliver chases Violet through a dim alley to the front porch, where outside, they exchange a glance. Violet pivots and marches to Eleanor's red bike, and Oliver observes as she hops on. Her eyes remain glued on Oliver as George pedals onto the trail, and Oliver stands underneath a wooden arch adorned with vines, watching as the bicycle rolls away. A gentle breeze tickles the gymnasium as George turns to the painting. Oliver opens his dorm room window to Violet, who averts her gaze as she climbs over the railing, and he latches the window of room 105. They stand in silhouette, outlined against the warm glow of his dorm room, and she agrees. Violet reaches out and softly pats Oliver's rugged jaw, and he lightly rubs her right elbow. He pulls her nearer, and they embrace closely. He gazes into her face and softly removes her scarf from her neck. A stereo rests in the room, and clad only in a shirt and jeans, Violet faces away from Oliver, who's reclined in the hammock. He observes as she tugs her gray cloak on, dons her scarf, and turns to confront him. He gazes at her with a hint of sorrow as she marches to his dorm room window and leans on the radiator as she strides to a bicycle. Violet climbs onto a red bicycle outside her small, gray cottage, and the wheels roll onward. Now in her early 40s, Violet chats with the cyclist as the bicycle nears the grand, brick-walled structure of the nursing center. An elderly white woman rests on a bench in the courtyard, painting, as wrapped in a blanket, Violet wanders over nearby and smiles faintly as she scans the environment. Violet passes through the building via the side gate, where Geraldine's cousin waves her into the hall. A clean-shaven teenager with glasses rises and hands her the painting. Violet peers down, then pivots on hearing a violin. She strolls into the social gathering space, where an individual is slumped over the strings of the violin. Charles and Geraldine's cousin linger as Violet nears the figure, who turns and glares blankly. He's a girl of about 14, and she extends her hand, but Oliver flinches. He swivels and gazes at her, with long, curly hair and freckles. Violet blinks and takes a deep, outward sigh as she settles beside him, and he widens his eyes. She nods, recalling when she was tying his shoes with laces, and young Oliver stands on the low, red-brick terrace."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

She and Benjamin share a look at the back entrance before she departs in Robert's SUV, watching Benjamin as they drive away. A strong wind hits the hospital. Later, Daisy enters Benjamin's hotel room, where they embrace intimately. After dressing, Daisy leaves, and Benjamin watches sadly as she departs. In her late 60s, Daisy takes a taxi to a retirement home. Inside, she meets Queenie's daughter and receives a diary from a bearded man. Drawn by piano music, she finds a 12-year-old boy who resembles Benjamin. Daisy sits beside him, recalling moments from his childhood, including drying his hair, as he reacts warily to her presence."
