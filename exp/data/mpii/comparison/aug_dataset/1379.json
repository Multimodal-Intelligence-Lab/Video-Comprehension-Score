The covers blossom again when, down the corridor, a lavatory flushes. Instantly, the silhouette stiffens, the covers darken, and the shelter compresses just as the bedroom entrance opens, revealing Uncle Vernon. He peers within, eyes gleaming suspiciously, then retreats. The shelter elevates, and as the covers blaze, we cut inside to discover a skinny lad with a crow's nest of dark hair, thick spectacles resting crookedly atop his nose: Harry Potter. Open before him is Violeta Stitch's Extreme Spells. Once more, he utters. A blinding burst of luminance flashes from the second story casement of Number Four. The luminance in the corridor snaps on, Harry's shelter droops once more, and seconds afterward, Harry's portal eases open. Uncle Vernon peers in and switches on the luminance. Gradually, he closes the portal and eyes the parchment in Harry's hand suspiciously. Just then, Dudley, sitting comatose before the TV, emits a hollow, brain-dead chortle. Marge flashes a thick fan of pound bills. Dudley blinks, waddles forward, and extends his plump palm obediently. Harry looks on, then perceives Ripper snuffling about his ankle.

Aunt Marge starts to respond when a button on her gown sails into the air with a zing. Thread snaps. Aunt Marge's eyes widen. Her cheeks billow. Her whole form billows, and she begins to swell like a monstrous balloon. To his dismay, Uncle Vernon himself begins to ascend. Aunt Marge looks fearfully into his eyes, and he lets go, falls to his knees, and watches Aunt Marge float away. Harry crashes inside, takes his chest, then puts his heel to a loose floorboard and removes his wand from its hiding spot. Turning, he grabs the snapshot of his parents. BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! Harry tows the chest down the stairs and finds Uncle Vernon waiting for him. Uncle Vernon eyes Harry's wand nervously, then grins with knowing malice. As Harry storms out with his chest, we dolly to the boulevard with him. High in the sky, a plump speck ascends. Harry walks and walks and walks, then halts, glancing about. An empty playground, swings creaking gently on rusted chains, and a tiny carousel, kissed gently by the breeze, turning slowly. Harry drops the chest, sits, still as a statue.

The tent is risen, and as the blankets are blazed, we cut inside to find a skinny boy with a crow's nest of black hair, thick glasses sitting crookedly atop his nose: Harry Potter.

The hallway light switches on abruptly, causing Harry's tent to droop once more, and moments later, Harry's door opens carefully. Uncle Vernon peers inside, flipping on the light as he does so. Slowly and deliberately, he closes the door, casting a suspicious glance at the parchment clutched in Harry's hand. Just then, in stark contrast, Dudley emits a hollow, brain-dead chuckle as he sits in a comatose state before the television. Marge flashes a thick fan of pound notes.

          "description": "The tent, in a manner reminiscent of a delicate flower unfurling softly at the break of dawn, gently blooms with a subtle glow, briefly casting a warm light upon a nearby bedside photograph of the beloved faces of James and Lily Potter. Before long, the tent naturally returns to its former state of darkness. Meanwhile, the blankets emit another glow when, farther down the hall, the unmistakable sound of a toilet flushing echoes. Instantly, the shadow becomes rigid and tense, as if taken by surprise, and the blankets promptly lose their illuminating glow, while the tent flattens just as the bedroom door swings open to reveal none other than Uncle Vernon. He peers inside the room, his eyes flashing with deep suspicion, and then retreats. Immediately, the tent rises once more, and as the blankets blaze brightly with light again, we are taken inside to discover a slender boy with a wild, unruly crow's nest of black hair, his thick glasses perched somewhat crookedly upon his nose: Harry Potter. Laid open before him is Violeta Stitch's \"Extreme Incantations.\" Once more, Harry articulates the incantation. A brilliant and blinding flash of light erupts from the second-story window of Number Four. The hallway light flicks on without warning, causing Harry's tent to droop yet again, and moments after, Harry's door opens slowly and carefully. Uncle Vernon peers inside, flipping on the light as he does so, casting a keen eye over the scene. He then closes the door slowly and deliberately, giving a suspicious glance at the parchment clutched tightly in Harry's hand. In stark contrast to the tension, Dudley, seated in a comatose state before the television, releases a hollow, brain-dead chuckle. Marge waves a thick fan of pound notes. Dudley blinks dumbly, waddles forward, and obediently extends his plump, grasping palm. Harry observes this scene, taking it all in, then notices Ripper snuffling curiously around his ankle. As Harry diligently clears the dishes, Uncle Vernon brandishes a bottle of brandy with a certain flair. Upon realizing this, Harry frowns and casts a cautionary glance at Uncle Vernon, who returns his look with a dark, menacing glare. Aunt Marge, pausing in her indulgence of wine, fixes her eyes on Harry, narrowing them with suspicion. POP! The glass in Aunt Marge's hand abruptly shatters in an explosion of tiny fragments. Harry stares, momentarily taken aback by the shattered glass. Aunt Marge attempts to respond when suddenly, with a zing, a button on her dress flies sharply into the air. Threads snap with a foreboding sound. Aunt Marge's eyes widen in shock as her cheeks begin to puff out; her entire body starts to swell and inflate uncontrollably, akin to a monstrous balloon. To his horror, Uncle Vernon finds himself rising along with her. Aunt Marge looks fearfully into his eyes, and in his shock, he releases his grip, falling to his knees as he helplessly watches Aunt Marge float away, rising higher and higher. Harry rushes back inside, grabs hold of his trunk, and places his heel on a loose floorboard, retrieving his wand carefully from its secret hiding place. With a swift turn, he snatches the cherished photograph of his parents. BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! Harry makes his way down the stairs, towing his trunk behind him, only to find Uncle Vernon ominously waiting for him. Uncle Vernon watches Harry's wand with nervous apprehension and then displays a grin filled with cruel, knowing malice. As Harry storms out with determination, trunk in tow, we follow alongside him down the street. High up in the sky above, a plump dot continues its ascent. Harry walks determinedly, making his determined way forward until he eventually comes to a halt, pausing to cast a glance around. He sees an empty playground, its swings creaking gently on rusted chains, with a tiny carousel, delicately kissed by the wind, turning slowly and methodically. Harry drops his trunk, sits down quietly and still, resembling a solemn statue. In the trees above, leaves tremble gently in the soft, quiet breeze. Harry turns to observe the rhythmic swaying of the swings and the slow, methodical turn of the carousel."

This gentle light reprise occurs when, down the hallway, the sound of a toilet flushing fills the air. Immediately, this prompts a swift reaction—the shadow within the tent freezes, the dim glow of the blankets fades, and the tent itself collapses back into its original shape just as the bedroom door swings open to reveal Uncle Vernon. He peers suspiciously into the room, his eyes darting around, before he retracts back into the darkness. The tent, rejuvenated, rises again, and as the blankets illuminate with a warm glow, the scene shifts inside to reveal a slender boy with a wild tangle of black hair and thick glasses perched unevenly on his nose: it is Harry Potter. In front of him lies an open book titled Violeta Stitch's Extreme Incantations. With determination, he articulates a spell once more. A sudden, dazzling burst of light erupts from the window on the second story of Number Four. Almost instantaneously, the hallway light switches on, causing Harry's tent to droop lifelessly once again. Moments later, Harry's door creaks open, and Uncle Vernon gazes inside, flicking on the light switch. Deliberately, he closes the door, his gaze landing suspiciously on the parchment clutched in Harry's hand. Just then, a sound diverts attention—Dudley, ensconced in front of the television, releases a vacant, mindless chuckle. Meanwhile, Marge brandishes a thick fan of pound notes. Dudley, reacting with a blink, lumbers forward and obediently stretches out his pudgy hand to receive them. Harry observes the scene, then notices Ripper sniffing inquisitively at his ankle. Tasked with clearing the dishes, Harry moves about the room, while Uncle Vernon uncaps a bottle of brandy, a sight that prompts Harry to frown and glance sharply at him. Uncle Vernon, in turn, casts a menacing glare back at Harry. Aunt Marge pauses mid-sip of her wine, her gaze sharp and narrowing upon Harry. Suddenly, with a loud POP!, the glass in Aunt Marge's hand shatters, sending shards flying. Harry fixes his eyes on the shattered remnants, surprise etched on his face. Aunt Marge attempts to respond, but before she can, a button from her dress breaks free with a zing, soaring through the air. Threads begin to unravel. Aunt Marge's eyes widen in shock as her cheeks start to balloon outwards, her entire body swelling as if she were turning into a massive balloon. In horror, Uncle Vernon finds himself involuntarily rising from the ground. Aunt Marge captures a glimpse of fear in his eyes, and as he releases his grip, he collapses to his knees, helplessly watching as she ascends and floats away into the sky. Quickly, Harry rushes back inside, retrieves his trunk, and nudges a loose floorboard with his heel to reveal his wand concealed beneath it. Turning swiftly, he grabs the treasured photograph of his parents. Suddenly, loud, resounding BOOMs echo as Harry drags his heavy trunk down the stairs, where he encounters Uncle Vernon waiting ominously. Uncle Vernon eyes Harry's wand with nervous apprehension, yet a sinister grin of cruel understanding spreads across his face. Unfazed, Harry storms out, his trunk in tow, and the scene shifts to follow him into the street. Up above, a small, round shape is visible high in the sky. Harry walks on and on, traversing the neighborhood before he finally halts, casting a searching look around him. He finds himself at an empty playground, where swings gently sway on creaky, rusted chains, and a diminutive carousel slowly turns, nudged by the tender breeze. Allowing his trunk to fall to the ground, Harry sits down, as still as a statue, the scene around him imbued with silence. In the canopy above, leaves rustle softly. Harry turns his focus to the swaying swings and the slowly revolving carousel."

The blankets bloom again when, down the hall of Number Four, Privet Drive, a typical suburban house located in the fictional town of Little Whinging, Surrey, a toilet flushes. Instantly, the shadow stiffens, the blankets dim, and the tent flattens just as the bedroom door opens, revealing Uncle Vernon, notorious for his dislike of anything out of the ordinary. He peers inside, eyes flashing suspiciously, then withdraws. The tent rises, and as the blankets blaze, we cut inside to find a skinny boy with a crow's nest of black hair, thick glasses sitting crookedly atop his nose: Harry Potter, the famous young wizard known for surviving a deadly curse as an infant. Open before him is Violeta Stitch's Extreme Incantations, a fictional book detailing powerful spells not typically taught to students. Once again, he speaks. A blinding blast of light flashes from the second story window of Number Four, which the neighbors always regard with a mix of curiosity and gossip. The light in the hallway snaps on, Harry's tent droops once more, and seconds later, Harry's door eases open. Uncle Vernon peers in and switches on the light. Slowly, he closes the door and eyes the parchment in Harry's hand, a magical document, suspiciously. Just then, Dudley, sitting comatose before the TV, emits a hollow, brain-dead chuckle, revealing his tendency to be easily amused. Marge, the overbearing relative holding disdain for Harry, flashes a thick fan of pound notes. Dudley blinks, waddles forward, and extends his plump palm obediently, indicative of his spoiled nature. Harry looks on, then sees Ripper, Marge's aggressive bulldog, snuffling about his ankle. As Harry clears the dishes, a chore imposed on him by the Dursleys, Uncle Vernon brings out a bottle of brandy, an indulgence often used to enhance his bravado. Hearing this, Harry frowns and glances at Uncle Vernon, who glares darkly at him, Harry's mere existence a challenge to Uncle Vernon's sense of normalcy. Aunt Marge pauses on her wine, eyes narrowing on Harry with suspicion. POP! The glass in Aunt Marge's hand explodes, a sign of uncontrolled magical reaction. Harry stares at the shattered glass in surprise. Aunt Marge starts to reply when a button on her dress sails into the air with a zing. Thread snaps. Aunt Marge's eyes widen. Her cheeks billow. Her whole body billows, and she begins to inflate like a monstrous balloon, her arrogance and disdain fueling the magic. To his horror, Uncle Vernon himself begins to rise. Aunt Marge looks fearfully into his eyes, and he lets go, falls to his knees, and watches Aunt Marge float away, disbelief marking his face. Harry crashes inside, takes his trunk, then puts his heel to a loose floorboard where he keeps his magical belongings hidden and removes his wand from its hiding place. Turning, he grabs the photograph of his parents, a cherished memento of his lost family. BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! The sound echoes as Harry tows the trunk down the stairs and finds Uncle Vernon waiting for him, his face a mask of veiled threats. Uncle Vernon eyes Harry's wand nervously, aware of its potential power, then grins with knowing cruelty. As Harry storms out with his trunk, we dolly to the street with him. High in the sky, a plump dot rises, Aunt Marge continuing her unplanned ascent. Harry walks and walks and walks, then stops, glancing about. An empty playground, swings creaking gently on rusted chains, tells of forgotten childhood innocence, and a tiny carousel, kissed gently by the wind, turning slowly, evokes a sense of timeless solitude. Harry drops the trunk, sits, still as a statue, pondering his uncertain future. In the trees above, leaves tremble as if mirroring his inner turmoil. Harry turns and studies the swaying swings, the carousel, signs of a world moving on without him."

          "description": "The flower glows fleetingly with brightness, momentarily revealing a distant painting of Ella and Tom Smith, then fades away. The rugs illuminate once more when, down the corridor, a sink gurgles. Suddenly, the silhouette twitches, the rugs dim, and the flower withers just as the kitchen gate swings, exposing Aunt Julie. She squints inside, gaze flickering with doubt, then retreats. The flower stands tall, and as the rugs gleam, we shift inside to see a frail girl with a bird’s nest of blonde curls, oversized spectacles perched awkwardly atop her head: Luna Lovegood. Open in front of her is Marcus Shine’s Grand Potions. Once more, she whispers. A dazzling burst of brightness erupts from the attic skylight of Number Twelve. The light in the corridor flicks on, Luna's flower droops once again, and moments later, Luna's gate slides ajar. Aunt Julie peers in and flicks on the brightness. Gradually, she shuts the gate and examines the scroll in Luna's grasp cautiously. Just then, Benny, lounging mindlessly before the radio, emits a hollow, vacant chuckle. George waves a thick stack of euro bills. Benny squints, waddles forward, and extends his chubby paw compliantly. Luna observes quietly, then notices Max snuffling around her shoe. As Luna clears the glasses, Aunt Julie fetches a pitcher of cider. Hearing this, Luna scowls and peers at Aunt Julie, who glowers menacingly at her. Uncle George pauses on his juice, gaze tightening on Luna. POP! The goblet in Uncle George's grip shatters. Luna gapes at the broken goblet in astonishment. Uncle George starts to retort when a coin from his vest propels into the ceiling with a twang. Fabric tears. Uncle George's eyes widen. His cheeks puff up. His whole body swells, and he begins to balloon like an enormous sphere. To her alarm, Aunt Julie herself begins to rise. Uncle George looks nervously into her gaze, and she releases, drops to her shins, and observes Uncle George drift away. Luna dashes inside, grabs her suitcase, then nudges her heel against a hidden tile and retrieves her cape from its secret location. Turning, she seizes the painting of her family. BANG! BANG! BANG! Luna drags the suitcase along the hallway and discovers Aunt Julie waiting for her. Aunt Julie examines Luna's cape anxiously, then smirks with cynical malice. As Luna storms out with her suitcase, we glide to the avenue with her. High in the clouds, a rotund speck ascends. Luna strolls and strolls and strolls, then halts, scanning her surroundings. An abandoned courtyard, swings groaning softly on rusted ropes, and a tiny merry-go-round, caressed gently by the breeze, rotating slowly. Luna places the suitcase down, sits, motionless as a sculpture. In the branches above, twigs shake. Luna turns and examines the swinging swings, the merry-go-round."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

When Uncle Vernon checks the room suspiciously, it reveals Harry Potter reading \"Violeta Stitch's Extreme Incantations.\" A flash of light from the window draws attention, and Uncle Vernon enters to inspect Harry's parchment. Dudley chuckles in front of the TV, distracted by Marge's money. As Harry watches the dog Ripper, Aunt Marge's wine glass explodes. Her body inflates, and she floats away, much to Uncle Vernon's horror. Harry, shocked, collects his belongings and sneaks his wand from beneath a floorboard along with a photo of his parents. As he leaves, Uncle Vernon watches him with a cruel grin. Harry ventures down the street with his trunk, and a floating Marge disappears into the sky. He stops at a deserted playground, contemplating the swaying swings and carousel, as the leaves rustle above."
