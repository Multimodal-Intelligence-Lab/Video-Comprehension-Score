Laurie moves from the door to the telephone. She picks it up, dials a number, and waits. She puts down the phone and stands very still. Slowly, Laurie moves around the couch. Slowly, Laurie sinks down to her knees by the couch. Her hand brushes against the knitting needles protruding from her tote bag. She reacts to the feel of the knitting needles and pulls one out. She begins crying softly, her eyes wide with fear. Suddenly, the shape leaps up from behind the couch! He springs at her, plunging the butcher knife.

Tommy rotates and sprints upstairs weeping. Laurie shifts from the doorway to the phone. She lifts it up, dials a numeral, and pauses. She places down the receiver and stands very stationary. Gradually, Laurie shifts around the sofa. Gradually, Laurie descends down to her knees by the sofa. Her hand grazes against the knitting needles jutting from her carryall. She responds to the sensation of the knitting needles and tugs one out. She starts sobbing gently, her eyes broad with terror. Abruptly, the figure vaults up from behind the sofa! He lunges at her, thrusting the cleaver. The edge of the cleaver bumps into the sofa. Laurie abruptly leaps backward, elevating her arm reflexively. Reflexively, Laurie elevates the knitting needle and drives it in, straight into the figure's throat! The figure springs backward, clawing at the needle, rolling his head back and forth. Then abruptly he freezes, hands outstretched, motionless, and collapses into a heap on the floor. Laurie sits there. The figure doesn't move. She gazes at it. The camera shifts with Loomis as he moves along the road. Abruptly two headlights strike him, and a patrol car veers to a stop adjacent to him. Standing there is the figure, the cleaver elevated. Both youngsters yell. Laurie shoves them into the washroom and pulls the door closed, leaving herself outside in the chamber. There is a click as the washroom door is locked. Laurie bounds away from the door and circles around the bed. The figure keeps advancing. The figure moves toward her, slowly now, but unyielding, the blade gleaming. Laurie rushes to a wardrobe and crouches inside. Laurie pulls the sliding doors shut and crawls back into the small, dark space of the wardrobe. Abruptly the doors begin to distort as the figure pounds on them. The door distorts inward as the figure crashes against it. She reaches up and grabs a wire hanger from the top of the wardrobe. She twists the top of the hanger, unwinding the wire. The door shatters in. The figure steps inside, pushing aside the garments. She unhooks the hanger and bends it out straight. The figure leans in, peering down at Laurie in the corner, raising the blade. Holding the hanger with both hands, she thrusts it forward with all her strength. The wire hanger flashes into the figure's right eye. He leaps back in agony, dropping the cleaver, grabbing his eye with both hands. She grasps the cleaver with both hands and jabs it upward. The cleaver plunges into the figure's abdomen, right down to the hilt."

Upstairs, Tommy is turned and run to by him while crying. The telephone is moved to by Laurie from the door. It is picked up by her, a number is dialed, and then it is waited on by her. The phone is put down by her, and very still she stands. Slowly, around the couch it is moved by Laurie. Slowly, down to her knees by the couch, Laurie is sunk. Against the knitting needles protruding from her tote bag, her hand brushes. The feel of the knitting needles is reacted to by her, and one is pulled out by her. Softly crying is begun by her, her eyes widened with fear. Suddenly, up from behind the couch the shape is leaped! At her, he is sprung by him, and the butcher knife is plunged. Into the couch, the blade of the butcher knife is thumped. Laurie is suddenly jumped back by herself, and instinctively she raises her arm. Instinctively, the knitting needle is raised by Laurie, right into the shape's neck, and it is driven home! The needle is clawed at by the shape, who rolls his head back and forth. Then suddenly, he is frozen by him, hands outstretched, and motionless he falls into a heap on the floor. Laurie is there sitting. By the shape, movement is not made. It is stared at by her. With Loomis, the camera moves as along the street, he moves. Suddenly, Loomis is hit by two headlights, and to a stop next to him, a police car is swerved. There, standing, is the shape with the butcher knife raised. By both children, a scream is made. Into the bathroom, they are shoved by Laurie, and the door is shut by her, leaving outside herself in the bedroom. As the bathroom door is locked, a click is heard. Away from the door, Laurie leaps, and around the bed, she is circled. The shape is kept coming. For her, the shape is moved by him, now slowly, yet relentless, the knife glistening. To a clothes closet, Laurie dashes, and inside, she is ducked. The sliding doors are pulled closed by Laurie, and into the small, dark interior of the closet, she is crawled back. Suddenly, as the shape pounds on them, the doors are buckled. Inward, the door is buckled as against it, the shape smashes. Upward, she reaches and grabs from the top of the closet a wire hanger. The top of the hanger is twisted by her, and the wire is unwound. The door is broken in. Inside, the shape steps, and the clothes are pushed aside. The hanger is unhooked by her, and it is bent out straight. Down at Laurie in the corner, the shape leans in, and the knife is raised. Holding the hanger with both hands, it is thrust forward by her with all her might. Into the shape's right eye, the wire hanger is flashed. Back in pain, he leaps, and the butcher knife is dropped, and with both hands, his eye is grabbed. With both hands, the butcher knife is grasped by her, and upward it is jabbed. Into the shape's mid-section, the butcher knife is plunged by her, right down to the hilt."

Laurie gently moves away from the door, making her way toward the telephone situated nearby. She lifts up the receiver with care, slowly and meticulously dials a number, then waits in utter silence. After a short moment, she gently places the phone back onto the cradle and stands completely still, as if frozen in place by an unseen force. With slow and deliberate movements, Laurie navigates her way around the couch, each step measured and cautious. Gradually, and with a sense of purpose, Laurie lowers herself down to her knees beside the couch. Her hand lightly brushes against the knitting needles that protrude from her tote bag. Reacting to the sensation of the knitting needles, she instinctively pulls one out. She begins to cry softly, her eyes wide open and brimming with fear. Suddenly, with startling speed, a shape leaps up from behind the couch! He lunges toward her, aiming to plunge the butcher knife into her. The blade of the butcher knife thumps heavily into the couch with a dull sound. Laurie jumps backward in sudden shock, raising her arm instinctively in defense. With instinct taking over, Laurie thrusts the knitting needle forward with force, driving it into the shape's neck!

Suddenly two headlights hit him and a police car swerves to a stop next to him. Standing there is the shape the butcher knife raised. Both children scream. Laurie shoves them into the bathroom and pulls the door shut leaving herself outside in the bedroom. There is a click as the bathroom door is locked. Laurie leaps away from the door and circles around the bed. The shape keeps coming. The shape moves for her slowly now but relentless. the knife glistening. Laurie dashes to a clothes closet and ducks inside. Laurie pulls the sliding doors closed and crawls back into the small dark interior of the closet.

          "description": "The young boy squints at him joyfully for an hour, then twirls from the window and skips closer. His foot stretches out and kicks it. Sarah twirls and dances downstairs laughing. Kevin leaps from the window to the megaphone. He snatches it up, punches a button, and listens. He drops the megaphone and lies very still. Quickly, Kevin leaps across the chair. Quickly, Kevin floats down to his toes by the chair. His foot taps against the paintbrushes poking from his backpack. He recoils at the touch of the paintbrushes and yanks one out. He starts laughing loudly, his mouth wide with surprise. Abruptly, the shadow spins out from under the chair! It lunges at him, thrusting the fishing rod. The tip of the fishing rod taps into the chair. Kevin quickly flips sideways, lifting his leg instinctively. Instinctively, Kevin lifts the paintbrush and plants it firmly, directly into the shadow's arm! The shadow flips sideways, scratching at the brush, shaking its arm up and down. Then abruptly it goes limp, arms raised, motionless, and sprawls into a jumble on the carpet. Kevin lies there. The shadow doesn't stir. He squints at it. The shot tracks with Parker as he glides along the sidewalk. Abruptly two flashlights spot him, and a firetruck careens to a halt beside him. Standing there is the shadow, the fishing rod thrust high. Both dogs bark. Kevin pushes them into the kitchen and swings the entry shut, leaving himself outside in the hallway. There is a clank as the kitchen entry is latched. Kevin skips away from the entry and spirals around the table. The shadow keeps advancing. The shadow strides towards him, quickly now, yet relentless, the rod gleaming. Kevin bolts to a pantry and squeezes inside. Kevin slides the folding panels shut and burrows back into the cramped, dim corner of the pantry. Abruptly the panels begin to bow as the shadow kicks against them. The panel bows outward as the shadow crashes into it. He stretches up and yanks a rope from the ceiling of the pantry. He wraps the top of the rope, unraveling the twine. The panel snaps in. The shadow marches inside, shoving past the coats. He unhooks the rope and bends it out straight. The shadow leans down, gazing at Kevin in the cubby, thrusting the rod. Grasping the rope with both feet, he jabs it outward with all his strength. The rope lashes into the shadow's left ear. It flips away in agony, dropping the fishing rod, clutching its ear with both feet. He clutches the fishing rod with both feet and stabs it downward. The fishing rod pierces into the shadow's chest, straight down to the base."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Laurie picks up the phone but then puts it down, feeling the knitting needles in her bag. Suddenly, the shape leaps from behind the couch with a butcher knife, but Laurie instinctively drives a knitting needle into its neck. The shape freezes and falls. Laurie, terrified, stares as the shape doesn't move. Loomis arrives on the street when a police car swerves to a stop. The shape, knife raised, causes Laurie to shove two kids into the bathroom, locking it behind them. She leaps away and hides in a closet. As the shape smashes the door, Laurie grabs a wire hanger, straightens it, and thrusts it into the shape's eye, causing it to recoil and drop the knife. Laurie then grasps the knife and plunges it into the shape's mid-section."
