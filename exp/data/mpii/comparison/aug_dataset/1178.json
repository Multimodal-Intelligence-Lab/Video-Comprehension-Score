The snake continues its journey, moving smoothly and purposefully until it reaches the door, where it slips out and escapes to freedom. Meanwhile, Dudley, dripping wet from his encounter with the snake, scrambles awkwardly to his feet, only to find that the glass window has reappeared, effectively trapping him inside the snake house. In a state of panic, he begins to bang desperately on the glass, his fists making loud thuds as his mother screams in horror at the sight. Uncle Vernon, standing nearby, notices Harry laughing at the situation and glares at him with suspicion. Later, back at 4 Privet Drive, Vernon, filled with anger, grabs Harry by the hair and forcefully locks him into the cupboard under the stairs, ensuring the door is securely shut. Outside, a tawny owl flies low over Privet Drive, its wings flapping silently as it drops a letter onto the doorstep. Inside Number 4, Harry retrieves the post from the doormat, picking up two letters and a postcard. As he examines the mail, he notices that one of the letters is sealed with wax, and his eyes widen with surprise as he reads the address written in emerald green ink. Still staring at the envelope in disbelief, he walks slowly into the kitchen, where Dudley suddenly snatches the letter from his hand. Uncle Vernon, now holding the letter, turns it over to inspect the coat of arms on the back, his expression shifting to one of horror as he exchanges a worried glance with his wife, while Harry stands by, looking confused. Outside, another owl drops a letter, which sails through the air and lands in the letterbox at Number 4, joining two more owls perched on the TV aerial. Uncle Vernon, determined to prevent Harry from receiving the letters, tears up three identical ones addressed to him. Harry, peeking out from his cupboard, watches as his uncle blocks up the letterbox, stuffing it with various materials to stop any more letters from getting through. Aunt Petunia, seeing Uncle Vernon off to work, glances up at the owls perched on the car roof rack, her eyes following their every move. She touches Vernon's arm as they both notice five more letters lying on the path at their feet. Inside the house, Harry watches helplessly as his uncle burns the envelopes one by one, the flames consuming the paper while Vernon smiles at him with a sadistic satisfaction, poking the fire to ensure the letters turn to ashes. Later, Harry, trying to maintain a semblance of normalcy, hands around a plate of biscuits as Vernon relaxes in his armchair. Harry then peers through the net curtains, observing the hundreds of owls perched on the rooftops and cars in Privet Drive, their presence a constant reminder of the letters. Suddenly, a letter shoots down the chimney, flying past Harry's nose, causing Vernon to blink in surprise and cover his ears as a rushing wind fills the room. In an instant, a flurry of letters cascades down the chimney, spilling out into the sitting room and terrifying Dudley, who jumps onto his mother's lap for safety. Harry, unable to contain his excitement, chortles with glee as even more letters hurtle down the chimney, resembling a snowstorm as the envelopes cover the carpet and spread around the room, swirling above their heads. Seizing the opportunity, Harry captures a letter and makes a dash for the cupboard under the stairs, but Uncle Vernon, quick to react, grabs him around the waist, preventing his escape. Dudley and his mother, seeking refuge, escape into the hall, where they are met with more letters bursting through the letterbox, and they turn to stare at Vernon in horror, overwhelmed by the chaos."

Dripping wet from his unexpected encounter, Dudley scrambles to his feet, but the glass window has reappeared, trapping him in the snake house, a well-secured enclosure designed to safely display the reptiles. He bangs desperately on the glass as his mother, known for her high-pitched screams, shrieks with horror, and Uncle Vernon spots Harry laughing, glaring at him suspiciously, suspecting mischief despite Harry's innocent expression. Back at their home on 4 Privet Drive, a quintessential suburban street in Little Whinging, Surrey, Vernon grabs Harry by the hair and locks him into the cupboard under the stairs, a cramped and dusty storage space where Harry spends much of his time. A tawny owl, typically associated with delivering messages in the wizarding world, flies low over Privet Drive and drops a letter, and inside Number 4, Harry picks up the post from the doormat—two letters and a postcard, a regular part of the morning routine. One of the letters is sealed with wax, a traditional method for securing important correspondence, and Harry's eyes widen with surprise as he reads the address written in emerald green ink, an unusual and striking choice for such a mundane delivery. As he walks slowly into the kitchen, still staring at the envelope as if it might reveal its secrets, Dudley snatches the letter out of his hand, eager to assert his dominance. Uncle Vernon turns the letter over and looks at the coat of arms on the back, a mysterious emblem that sparks fear, staring at his wife with horror, while Harry looks confused, unaware of the significance. An owl drops another letter, which flies into the letter box at Number 4, and the big bird joins two more perched on the TV aerial, a peculiar sight unnoticed by the typical residents of Privet Drive. Uncle Vernon tears up three identical letters addressed to Harry, determined to prevent any communication, and Harry peeps out of his cupboard and sees his uncle blocking up the letter box with determination. Aunt Petunia sees Uncle Vernon off to work and stares at the owls perched on the car roof rack, bewildered by their persistence. She touches his arm as five more letters lie on the path at their feet, a testament to the sender's determination. Inside the house, Harry watches helplessly as his uncle burns the envelopes one by one in the fireplace, Vernon smiling at him sadistically as he pokes the fire and the flames turn the letters to ashes, a futile attempt to stop the inevitable. Harry hands round a plate of biscuits, a typical British teatime treat, as Vernon relaxes in his armchair, then peers through the net curtains, where hundreds of owls are perched on the rooftops and cars in Privet Drive, creating a surreal scene. A letter shoots down the chimney and flies past his nose, evoking a rare moment of wonder, and Vernon blinks with surprise, then covers his ears as a rushing wind seems to fill the room, a magical phenomenon beyond his comprehension. Suddenly, a flurry of letters cascades down the chimney and out into the sitting room, terrifying Dudley, who jumps onto his mother's lap for protection. Harry chortles with glee as even more letters hurtle down the chimney, and like a snowstorm, the envelopes cover the carpet and spread around the room above their heads, transforming the mundane space into a chaotic spectacle. Harry captures a letter and makes a dash for the cupboard under the stairs, hoping to keep at least one of the mysterious messages, but Uncle Vernon grabs him around the waist, intent on maintaining control.

          "description": "Tourists march in all directions as the giant turtle hops across the ceiling and glides to captivity through the window of the Fish Tank. Bone-dry, Marvin crawls to his knees, but the wooden door has vanished, freeing him in the rabbit den. He whispers happily on the wooden door as his cousin giggles with delight, and Aunt Petunia notices Lisa crying, smiling at her joyfully. Back at 3 Baker Lane, Petunia pushes Lisa by the elbow and unlocks her into the attic above the basement. A gray cat leaps high above Baker Lane and grabs a package, and inside Number 3, Lisa drops the box on the windowsill—four packages and a flyer. One of the packages is wrapped with fabric, and Lisa's nose crinkles with confusion as she hears the message sung in sapphire blue notes. As she runs quickly into the garage, still touching the package, Marvin throws the package into her mouth. Aunt Petunia turns the package over and laughs at the family crest on the front, laughing at her brother with terror, while Lisa feels excited. A cat grabs another package, which crashes into the chimney at Number 3, and the small kitten joins seven more perched on the satellite dish. Aunt Petunia rips open four different packages addressed to Lisa, and Lisa inches out of her attic and hears her aunt opening up the chimney. Uncle Vernon waves Aunt Petunia off to the mall and laughs at the cats hiding under the garden fence. He brushes his leg as eight fewer packages rest on the bench at their hands. Outside the home, Lisa plays cheerfully as her aunt tosses the boxes one by one, Petunia laughing at her lovingly as she hugs the stove and the embers transform the packages to dust. Lisa passes around a tray of cupcakes as Petunia dozes in her swing, then leans through the wooden blinds, where dozens of cats are buzzing around the lampposts and fences on Baker Lane. A package crashes down the roof and lands on her toe, and Petunia yawns with boredom, then opens her eyes as a gentle breeze seems to empty the house. Instantly, a collection of packages bounces up the roof and in through the back door, thrilling Marvin, who dances onto his father's shoulders. Lisa claps with surprise as even fewer packages bounce up the roof, and like a thunderstorm, the boxes cover the furniture and gather around the house beneath their shoulders. Lisa drops a package and makes a leap for the attic above the basement, but Aunt Petunia pulls her around the leg. Marvin and his father sneak into the garage, where fewer packages hover above the chimney, and they fight with Petunia in delight."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Back at 4 Privet Drive, Vernon angrily locks Harry in the cupboard under the stairs after seeing him laugh. An owl delivers a letter addressed to Harry in emerald green ink, surprising him. Dudley snatches the letter, leaving Harry confused as Uncle Vernon tears it up, horrified by the coat of arms. More letters arrive, and Vernon blocks the letterbox and burns them, while Harry watches helplessly. As hundreds of owls perch outside, a letter shoots down the chimney, followed by a cascade of letters filling the room. Terrified, Dudley jumps onto his mother's lap, while Harry gleefully captures a letter. As he attempts to escape, Vernon grabs him, and more letters burst through the letterbox, causing panic."
