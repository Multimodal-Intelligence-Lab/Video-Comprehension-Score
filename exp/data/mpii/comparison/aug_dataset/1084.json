Aron dashes up to his sibling's cabin as Chaya carries platters brimming with food to Arkady's table. Tuvia emerges and observes Asael's blackened eye. Asael glances over to Arkady, who's standing with his back to them both, consuming his large portion of food. Arkady feigns not to hear, takes another spoonful, then slowly hands his plate to a comrade and turns towards Tuvia with an insolent sneer. Arkady scans around at the apprehensive expressions of the remainder of the individuals. Tuvia looks at him in incredulity, and Asael drops his head in disgrace. Tuvia turns round to face the populace, Arkady behind him, grinning. Tuvia spins around and shoots him point-blank, and aims his gun at Arkady's comrade, then lowers the weapon.

In the camp, a fever is being struggled with by Tuvia in his cabin, while outside, the food queue is being patiently formed by people. A joke is shared by Arkady and his friend. Aron's brother's cabin is run up to by him as plates full of food are brought to Arkady's table by Chaya. Asael’s black eye is noticed by Tuvia as he appears. Arkady is looked over by Asael, who is standing with his back to both of them, and is tucking into his large portion of food. Arkady doesn't pretend to hear, takes another spoonful, and then his plate is slowly handed to a cohort by him, and Tuvia is turned towards with an insolent scowl. At the fearful expressions of the rest of the people, Arkady glances around. In disbelief, Tuvia looks at him, and Asael’s head is dropped in shame by him. The community is faced by Tuvia with Arkady behind him, smirking. Around spins Tuvia and Arkady is shot point-blank by him, and then his gun is pointed at Arkady's cohort, subsequently lowered. Nervously, Asael swallows as Arkady’s lifeless body is jumped to their feet and bent down to be carried off by the men at the table. Past Lilka, Chaya, and Rachel, he is carried away. Defiantly, Tuvia looks at the silent huddle of people watching him, with his two younger brothers near him. Later, he lies in bed, and a blanket is pulled up over him. His eyes flicker open, and Lilka is seen looking down at him by him. Softly, she smiles, and for a brief moment, his face lights up before his eyes are shut. Near to the bed, she sits down in a chair to watch him as the log cabin is bathed in soft golden light by a ray of sunshine. Armed with his machine gun, an early morning watch is kept by Tuvia. A curtain is unhooked from his cabin window, and Asael peers out. Icicles are beginning to thaw as Lilka stands with her face raised towards the sun, luxuriating in its warmth. Through the softening snow, Tuvia treads and the hazy sunshine is wandered off into by him. A camera lens is set on a tripod, and a group photograph is assembled for by the whole Bielski camp. In the creek, some of the women are washing as Chaya is splashed by Bella. Despite the sunshine, Tamara, huddled in her black coat, looks nervous and frightened. Out of the water, Lilka steps to meet her. Around, Tamara glances, then Lilka is taken by the hand and led out of the earshot of the others by her. Her coat is opened and her belly is touched. Searchingly, Lilka's clear blue eyes look at Tamara, whose face crumples. Tamara’s clasped hands are gently squeezed by Lilka as Tuvia comes down through some trees, his gun held loosely in his hand."

Meanwhile, Zus and all the other soldiers follow behind them, steadily and resolutely marching on foot. Meanwhile, back at the camp, Tuvia remains confined to his cabin, engaged in a difficult struggle against a relentless and persistent fever. Outside, a line of people waits patiently in the food queue with a sense of calm anticipation. At the same time, Arkady and his friend are absorbed in a moment of sharing a lighthearted joke, adding a touch of levity to the scene. Aron hastily dashes up to his brother's cabin just as Chaya arrives, carrying plates that are generously heaped with food, setting them down on Arkady's table. Tuvia emerges from the cabin and immediately notices the striking black eye sported by Asael. Asael glances over at Arkady, who is standing with his back turned to both of them, eagerly and voraciously devouring his large portion of food. Arkady feigns ignorance, nonchalantly takes another spoonful, and then, with deliberate and exaggerated slowness, hands his plate to a companion before turning to face Tuvia with a defiant scowl. Arkady glances around at the fearful and apprehensive expressions on the faces of the people surrounding them. Tuvia stares in disbelief at Arkady, while Asael lowers his head in shame and discomfort. Tuvia then turns to face the community, the people of the camp, all the while with Arkady subtly smirking behind him. In a swift and unexpected motion, Tuvia spins around and shoots Arkady at point-blank range, then aims his gun at Arkady's companion, only to lower it without firing.

Back at the camp, Tuvia is inside his cabin, battling a fever that leaves him weak and perspiring, while outside, a line of people waits patiently for their turn in the food queue, their eyes scanning the surroundings. Arkady and his friend stand together, sharing a lighthearted joke that momentarily lifts the somber mood. Meanwhile, Aron dashes up to his brother's cabin with urgency, just as Chaya carefully balances plates full of food and brings them over to Arkady's table, setting them down with a gentle clatter. Tuvia emerges from his cabin, his eyes immediately catching the sight of Asael's black eye, a silent testament to a recent altercation. Asael's gaze shifts towards Arkady, who stands with his back turned, engrossed in his large portion of food. Arkady feigns ignorance, deliberately taking another spoonful before slowly passing his plate to a nearby cohort, then turns to face Tuvia with a defiant scowl etched on his face. Arkady's eyes dart around, taking in the fearful expressions of the onlookers, while Tuvia stares at him in disbelief, and Asael lowers his head, overwhelmed with shame. Tuvia pivots to address the community, Arkady smirking behind him, but in a swift motion, Tuvia spins back around and fires his gun at Arkady point-blank, the sound echoing through the camp. He then points the gun at Arkady's cohort, who freezes in place, before Tuvia lowers the weapon, the tension in the air palpable. Asael swallows hard, his nerves on edge, as the men at the table leap to their feet, bending down to lift Arkady's lifeless body and carry it away, their footsteps heavy as they pass by Lilka, Chaya, and Rachel. Tuvia stands resolute, his two younger brothers by his side, as he meets the silent, watchful eyes of the gathered people with a defiant look. Later, Tuvia lies in bed, the weight of the day's events pressing down on him, as a blanket is gently pulled up over his weary body. His eyes flutter open, and he sees Lilka gazing down at him, her smile soft and reassuring, causing his face to momentarily brighten before his eyes close again. She settles into a chair near the bed, her presence a comforting vigil, as a ray of sunshine filters through the window, casting a warm, golden glow across the log cabin. In the early morning, Tuvia, armed with his machine gun, stands watch, his eyes scanning the horizon for any signs of danger. Asael quietly unhooks a curtain from his cabin window, peering out at the world beyond. The icicles hanging from the eaves begin to drip as the sun's warmth reaches them, and Lilka stands outside, her face turned upwards, basking in the sun's gentle embrace. Tuvia walks through the softening snow, his footsteps leaving a trail as he wanders into the hazy sunshine. A camera lens is carefully positioned on a tripod, and the entire Bielski camp gathers together, arranging themselves for a group photograph that captures their unity. Nearby, some of the women are at the creek, washing clothes, as Bella playfully splashes Chaya, laughter mingling with the sound of water. Tamara, wrapped in her black coat despite the sunshine, stands apart, her demeanor nervous and frightened. Lilka steps out of the water, her feet leaving wet prints as she approaches Tamara. Tamara glances around cautiously, then takes Lilka's hand, leading her away from the others to speak in private. She opens her coat, revealing her secret by touching her belly, and Lilka's clear blue eyes meet hers with understanding. Tamara's face crumples with emotion, and Lilka responds with a gentle squeeze of Tamara's clasped hands, offering silent support. Meanwhile, Tuvia descends through the trees, his gun held loosely in his hand, as he returns to the camp, the weight of leadership evident in his stride."

In the camp, Tuvia is in his cabin struggling with a fever common among those living in such harsh conditions, while outside, people are patiently in the food queue, a daily ritual that keeps the community going. Arkady and his friend are sharing a joke, lifting spirits in the otherwise somber environment. Aron runs up to his brother's cabin as Chaya, a stalwart supporter of the group's communal effort, brings plates full of food to Arkady's table. Tuvia appears and notices Asael's black eye, a testament to recent conflicts within the group. Asael looks over to Arkady, who's standing with his back to them both, tucking into his large portion of food as if claiming a victory. Arkady pretends not to hear, takes another spoonful, then slowly hands his plate to a cohort, an act of camaraderie within his faction, and turns towards Tuvia with an insolent scowl. Arkady glances around at the fearful expressions of the rest of the people, who are unsure of the consequences of the escalating tension. Tuvia looks at him in disbelief, and Asael drops his head in shame, aware of the undesired attention on his family. Tuvia turns round to face the community, Arkady behind him, smirking in his misplaced confidence. Tuvia spins around and shoots him point-blank, an act of ultimate judgment for defiance, and points his gun at Arkady's cohort, then lowers the gun, allowing the message to be received without further violence. Asael swallows nervously as the men at the table, accustomed to following orders, jump to their feet and bend down to carry off Arkady's lifeless body. They carry him away past Lilka, Chaya, and Rachel, whose somber faces reflect the gravity of the situation. Tuvia, with his two younger brothers near him, looks defiantly at the silent huddle of people watching him, asserting his authority. Later, he lies in bed, and a blanket is pulled up over him, providing comfort in his weary state. His eyes flicker open, and he sees Lilka looking down at him with compassion. She smiles softly, restoring, albeit briefly, a sense of peace and normalcy in his turbulent life, and his face lights up for a brief moment before his eyes shut. She sits down in a chair near to the bed to watch him as a ray of sunshine, a rare sight in their wooded refuge, bathes the log cabin in soft golden light. Tuvia, armed with his machine gun, a constant reminder of the ever-present danger, is on an early morning watch. Asael unhooks a curtain from his cabin window and peers out, vigilant like his brother. Icicles are beginning to thaw as Lilka stands with her face raised towards the sun, luxuriating in its warmth and the promise of spring. Tuvia treads through the softening snow and wanders off into the hazy sunshine, seeking solace in solitude. A camera lens is set on a tripod, a precious possession for commemorating their existence, and the whole Bielski camp, named after Tuvia and his brothers who lead this Jewish partisan group during World War II, assembles for a group photograph. Some of the women are washing in the creek, where water is both life-sustaining and cleansing, as Bella splashes Chaya in a moment of playful reprieve. Tamara, huddled in her black coat despite the sunshine, looks nervous and frightened, haunted by memories of the past. Lilka steps out of the water to meet her, aware of Tamara's distress. Tamara glances around, fearing unseen dangers, then takes Lilka by the hand and leads her out of the earshot of the others. She opens her coat and touches her belly, revealing a secret too big to bear alone. Lilka's clear blue eyes look searchingly at Tamara, whose face crumples, overwhelmed by her reality. Lilka gently squeezes Tamara's clasped hands, offering support as Tuvia comes down through some trees, his gun held loosely in his hand, a sign of vigilance even in these quiet moments."

Nigel glances over to Jasper, who's sitting with his back to them both, munching on his massive serving of pie.

Jasper peers around at the optimistic expressions of the rest of the crew. Byron stares at him in amazement, and Nigel bows his head in embarrassment. Byron pivots to confront the crowd, Jasper behind him, grinning. Byron swivels around and applauds him fervently, and offers his mic to Jasper's associate, then raises a baton.

Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Asael looks to Arkady, who smugly eats, prompting Tuvia to shoot Arkady and confront the community. The men carry Arkady's body away as Tuvia stands defiantly with his brothers. Later, Tuvia is comforted by Lilka's presence as sunshine fills the cabin. As the morning progresses, Tuvia patrols with his machine gun, and the camp assembles for a group photo. Lilka comforts a nervous Tamara, who reveals her pregnancy. Tuvia strolls through the trees, gun in hand."
