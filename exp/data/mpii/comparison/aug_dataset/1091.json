Inside, Berniski, his wife, and two sons who were with him at Koscik's house, are having dinner. They all look towards the door as Tuvia walks into the room. Berniski jumps up, and Tuvia draws the gun. Berniski shrugs lamely. Cowering, Berniski sinks to his knees. One son stands up. Tuvia dispatches both sons, then Berniski, and then Berniski dies. Tuvia looks at the woman without remorse as she mourns before him, her hands splattered with blood, and he goes, stumbling through the dark forest, making his escape. At dawn, Zus, sleeping in a makeshift tent, awakes with a start, a bottle of vodka by his legs. Groggily, he looks at the sleeping people all around him, picking up the bottle, he staggers to his feet, then notices smoke from a small fire. Tuvia sits broodily staring into space, and Zus hands his brother the bottle. Tuvia takes a slug, and Zus examines the revolver, counting the number of bullets. A fleeting smile passes between them. Zus hands back the gun. Sharpening a spear, Zus looks up in surprise as Tuvia comes back to the camp with more refugees. A pretty brunette walks by and gives Tuvia a long look. Later, two men are sawing a log, another lays branches onto the roof of a shelter, and Zus hammers a beam. Malbin, hammering a nail, drops the log he's holding, narrowly missing Zus. Malbin turns to Tuvia. Zus frowns at the girl with a beret. Lazar and Laila walk off, everyone looks around. Two young men enter the camp, one wielding a rifle. Zus puts his hands up. The brothers stiffen, and Zus eyes them steadily. Peretz meets his gaze and slowly shakes his head. Zus walks away, stumbling into the undergrowth. He throws up by a tree and sinks to his knees. Tuvia follows him and watches his brother convulsing with grief. Zus bangs his head against the tree trunk, and Tuvia grabs him from behind and wrestles him to the ground. Blood seeps from the wound on Zus’s head. He frees himself from his brother's grasp. The two newcomers, Peretz and Jacov, are talking to Asael. Tuvia runs off to Zus. Tuvia looks at Asael, who averts his gaze, and then back at Zus. A full moon gleams in the dark sky. Zus shoots the man. Zus shouts. An elderly Russian runs out to his blazing truck, and Zus dispatches him. Together with Tuvia, Asael, Peretz, and Jacov, he tosses the old man's body into the burning bed of the truck.

Inside, Berniski, his spouse, and two offspring who were with him at Koscik's residence, are having supper. They all glance towards the entrance as Tuvia strides into the chamber. Berniski leaps up, and Tuvia draws the pistol. Berniski shrugs weakly. Cringing, Berniski sinks to his knees. One son rises. Tuvia dispatches both sons, then Berniski, and then Berniski expires. Tuvia looks at the woman without regret as she laments before him, her hands splattered with blood, and he goes, stumbling through the dark forest, making his flight. At dawn, Zus, sleeping in a makeshift tent, awakes with a start, a bottle of vodka by his legs. Groggily, he looks at the slumbering individuals all around him, picking up the bottle, he staggers to his feet, then notices smoke from a small blaze.

He gazes intently at a solitary cottage in the clearing, his lips firmly pursed in contemplation. Within the cozy confines of the cottage, Berniski is seated with his wife and their two sons who had been accompanying him earlier at Koscik's house, all gathered around the dinner table for a meal. Their attention collectively shifts towards the door as Tuvia, with a determined step, enters the room. Berniski quickly jumps to his feet, apprehensively, while Tuvia draws his gun with resolve. Berniski merely shrugs, a gesture overwhelmed with helpless resignation. In a state of fear, Berniski sinks down to his knees, cowering. One of his sons rises to his feet, attempting to confront the situation. Tuvia, with swift and decisive action, executes both sons and then Berniski, leaving him lifeless. Tuvia meets the eyes of the woman, who is overcome with grief, without a shred of remorse. Her hands, smeared with blood, testify to the brutal scene as Tuvia makes his departure, stumbling through the dense, forbidding forest, seeking his escape route. \n\nAs the first light of dawn begins to break, Zus, nestled within a makeshift tent and surrounded by the tranquility of sleeping companions, awakens abruptly. A bottle of vodka lies by his legs, a testament to the night's previous indulgence. With bleary eyes, he surveys the sleeping figures around him before picking up the bottle, struggling to his feet. It is then that he notices the smoke wafting up from a small fire nearby. Tuvia is seated, lost in thought, staring into the emptiness of space. Zus hands the bottle over to his brother, offering silent camaraderie. Tuvia accepts, taking a swig, as Zus picks up the revolver with curiosity, carefully counting the bullets within. A fleeting smile, a silent communication of understanding, passes between the two brothers. Zus then returns the gun to Tuvia. As Zus busies himself sharpening a spear, he looks up in surprise when Tuvia reemerges from the surrounding woods, bringing with him a group of additional refugees. A striking brunette walks past, offering Tuvia a lingering glance full of meaning.\n\nLater on, two men are engaged in the laborious task of sawing a log, while another individual painstakingly places branches onto the roof of an emerging shelter. Zus, with focused determination, hammers away at a beam with rhythmic precision. Meanwhile, Malbin, who is hammering a nail at that moment, accidentally drops the log he is holding, narrowly avoiding hitting Zus. Malbin then turns his attention to Tuvia. Zus frowns, observing the girl donning a beret with scrutinizing eyes. As Lazar and Laila stroll off together, everyone casts looks around the camp. Suddenly, two young men make their entrance into the camp, one of them holding a rifle with a steady grip. Zus instinctively raises his hands in a gesture of cautious surrender. The brothers tense up, observing the newcomers warily as Zus maintains a steady gaze. Peretz meets Zus's eyes and slowly shakes his head in silent communication. Feeling the weight of the moment, Zus retreats, stumbling into the undergrowth. There, by the base of a tree, he succumbs to his anguish, throwing up and collapsing onto his knees. Tuvia follows closely behind, watching his brother's convulsions of grief with a heart heavy with sympathy. Zus, overcome by emotion, bangs his head against the rough tree trunk. Tuvia intervenes, grabbing Zus from behind, wrestling him to the ground in a bid to offer solace. Blood trickles from the fresh wound on Zus’s head, yet he manages to free himself from Tuvia's grasp. Meanwhile, the new arrivals, Peretz and Jacov, are engaged in conversation with Asael. Upon seeing this, Tuvia hastily makes his way to Zus, casting glances at Asael, who avoids meeting Tuvia's gaze, and then back to Zus. The night sky above is illuminated by the gleam of a full moon, casting its light upon the scene below. In a climactic moment, Zus fires his weapon, the sharp retort echoing in the night. His shout rings out, filled with raw emotion. An elderly Russian man rushes out to his truck, which is now ablaze, and Zus swiftly dispatches him. United in a grim task, Tuvia, Asael, Peretz, and Jacov join Zus as they fling the old man's lifeless body into the fiery bed of the truck. In the enveloping darkness, a tiny pinprick of light pierces through, serving as a beacon.

          "description": "At night, amidst the pouring rain, Tuvia stands alone with the collar of his jacket pulled up tightly against the cold. He stares intently at a cottage nestled in the clearing, lips pursed in contemplation. Inside the cottage, Berniski, his wife, and their two sons, who had been present at Koscik's house, are in the middle of having dinner. As Tuvia enters the room, the family turns their attention toward the door. Berniski jumps up in alarm as Tuvia draws a gun with deliberate intent. Berniski, showing a gesture of helplessness, shrugs feebly before cowering to the ground, sinking to his knees in submission. One of the sons rises in response, prompting Tuvia to act, methodically dispatching both sons and then turning his attention back to Berniski, who succumbs to his fate. Tuvia, devoid of remorse, fixes his gaze on the grieving woman, who mourns in front of him with her hands stained with blood. Making his escape, Tuvia stumbles through the dark forest, his steps uncertain yet determined. As dawn breaks, Zus is abruptly awakened from his slumber in a makeshift tent, a bottle of vodka resting beside his legs. He groggily surveys the sleeping figures around him before picking up the bottle and staggering onto his feet, only to be drawn to the sight of smoke rising from a small fire. There, Tuvia sits, lost in brooding contemplation. Zus extends the bottle towards his brother, who takes a long swig. Observing the revolver with interest, Zus methodically counts the bullets. A fleeting smile crosses between the brothers before Zus returns the gun. Later, while sharpening a spear, Zus looks up in surprise as Tuvia comes back to the camp, accompanied by more refugees. Among them, a pretty brunette catches Tuvia's eye and shares a lingering gaze with him. Meanwhile, two men are occupied with sawing a log, and another places branches onto the roof of a shelter while Zus hammers a beam into place. Malbin, distracted while hammering a nail, accidentally drops the log he's holding, narrowly missing Zus, and turns towards Tuvia, seeking guidance. Zus notices a girl with a beret and frowns in disapproval. Elsewhere, Lazar and Laila walk off together, prompting everyone to look around curiously. The camp is then disrupted by the arrival of two young men, one brandishing a rifle. As tensions rise, Zus instinctively raises his hands in surrender. Both brothers tense up, with Zus maintaining a steady gaze at the newcomers. Peretz, one of the newcomers, meets Zus’s eyes and slowly shakes his head, signaling an unspoken understanding. Burdened by emotions, Zus walks away, stumbling into the thick underbrush where he succumbs to his distress, vomiting beside a tree before collapsing to his knees. Tuvia silently trails his brother, witnessing Zus's raw convulsions of grief. As Zus begins to bang his head against the tree trunk in despair, Tuvia acts swiftly, grabbing him from behind and wrestling him to the ground. Blood trickles from the wound on Zus’s head, and with effort, he frees himself from Tuvia's grip. Nearby, the newcomers, Peretz and Jacov, engage in conversation with Asael. Seeing this, Tuvia runs off in pursuit of Zus. Tuvia glances at Asael, who, unable to meet his brother's eyes, looks away. Tuvia then turns his attention back to Zus. Under the illumination of a full moon in the dark sky, an intense series of events unfolds. Zus, seizing an opportune moment, shoots the man in front of him, and in the ensuing chaos, shouts ring out. An elderly Russian bursts out to his truck, now engulfed in flames, only to be swiftly dispatched by Zus. Alongside Tuvia, Asael, Peretz, and Jacov, he works to throw the old man's lifeless body into the bed of the burning truck. In the midst of this turmoil, a small pinprick of light punctuates the darkness, and Peretz, sprinting along a dirt track, quickly joins the others who are lying low, concealed in the shadows of a ditch."

          "description": "At night in pouring rain with the collar of his jacket pulled up against the relentless weather, Tuvia, a man hardened by survival, stands staring at a dimly lit cottage in the clearing of a dense forest, his lips pursed. Inside, Berniski, a known collaborator with occupying forces, his wife, and two sons who were with him at Koscik's house, are having dinner. They all look towards the door as Tuvia walks into the room with the intent gaze of someone on a mission. Berniski jumps up, recognizing the man with a reputation for taking justice into his own hands, and Tuvia draws the gun, a symbol of the violence that has torn through their lands. Berniski shrugs lamely, a gesture of fatalistic surrender. Cowering, Berniski sinks to his knees as if pleading for a life he knows is forfeit. One son stands up, trying to protect his family. Tuvia, shaped by tragedy, dispatches both sons, then Berniski, and then Berniski dies. Tuvia looks at the woman without remorse, a soldier of circumstance, as she mourns before him, her hands splattered with blood, and he goes, stumbling through the dark forest that has become his sanctuary and his prison, making his escape. At dawn, Zus, sleeping in a makeshift tent within a hidden camp, awakes with a start, a bottle of vodka, his solace and vice, by his legs. Groggily, he looks at the sleeping people, fellow refugees who share his plight, all around him, picking up the bottle, he staggers to his feet, then notices smoke from a small fire, their lifeline in the wilderness. Tuvia sits broodily staring into space, his thoughts as clouded as the morning mist, and Zus hands his brother the bottle. Tuvia takes a slug, seeking temporary relief, and Zus examines the revolver, counting the number of bullets, each a testament to their resolve. A fleeting smile passes between them, a rare moment of brotherly connection. Zus hands back the gun, a tool of survival in these desperate times. Sharpening a spear, an ancient weapon for a primal fight, Zus looks up in surprise as Tuvia comes back to the camp with more refugees, their numbers growing like a rising tide against oppression. A pretty brunette walks by and gives Tuvia a long look, a hint of humanity in a world stripped of it. Later, two men are sawing a log for much-needed shelter, another lays branches onto the roof of a shelter, and Zus hammers a beam, building with determination what life has tried to strip away. Malbin, hammering a nail, drops the log he's holding, narrowly missing Zus, revealing the tension and urgency of their situation. Malbin turns to Tuvia, whose leadership holds them together. Zus frowns at the girl with a beret, a symbol of resistance. Lazar and Laila walk off, everyone looks around, each assessing their fragile security. Two young men enter the camp, one wielding a rifle, a potent emblem of both threat and protection. Zus puts his hands up cautiously. The brothers stiffen, and Zus eyes them steadily, his resolve unbroken. Peretz meets his gaze and slowly shakes his head, signifying a shared understanding. Zus walks away, stumbling into the undergrowth, overcome by the burden of their reality. He throws up by a tree, the stress manifesting physically, and sinks to his knees in despair. Tuvia follows him and watches his brother convulsing with grief, the weight of their choices heavy on their shoulders. Zus bangs his head against the tree trunk, an outcry of anguish, and Tuvia grabs him from behind, wrestling him to the ground, an act of protection. Blood seeps from the wound on Zus’s head, the price of his torment. He frees himself from his brother's grasp, a symbol of his internal struggle. The two newcomers, Peretz and Jacov, are talking to Asael, sharing news and strategies. Tuvia runs off to Zus, his commitment to his brother unwavering. Tuvia looks at Asael, who averts his gaze, grappling with their harsh realities, and then back at Zus. A full moon gleams in the dark sky, casting its cold light on their plight. Zus shoots the man, driven by the necessities of their war-torn existence. Zus shouts, his voice echoing in the stillness of the night. An elderly Russian, a relic of another era, runs out to his blazing truck, and Zus dispatches him, actions dictated by desperation. Together with Tuvia, Asael, Peretz, and Jacov, he tosses the old man's body into the burning bed of the truck, a grim testament to their fight for survival. A pinprick of light punctures the darkness, a reminder that even in the depths of despair, there can be hope. Peretz, running along a dirt track that weaves through the forest, joins the others hiding in a ditch, their refuge from the chaos of the world above."

Inside, the pillow, its friend, and three daughters who were with it at the mailbox's cottage, are having breakfast. They all look towards the window as the bookshelf walks into the kitchen. The pillow jumps up, and the bookshelf draws the pencil. The pillow shrugs lamely. Cowering, the pillow sinks to its elbows. One daughter stands up. The bookshelf dispatches both daughters, then the pillow, and then the pillow perishes. The bookshelf looks at the puppy without remorse as it mourns before it, its paws splattered with paint, and it goes, stumbling through the sunlit meadow, making its escape. At noon, the pencil, sleeping in a silk hammock, awakes with a start, a can of paint by its toes. Groggily, it looks at the snoring cats all around it, picking up the can, it staggers to its elbows, then notices lightning from a large cloud. The bookshelf sits broodily staring into space, and the pencil hands its sibling the can. The bookshelf takes a sip, and the pencil examines the blender, counting the number of marbles. A fleeting grin passes between them. The pencil hands back the blender. Sharpening a toothbrush, the pencil looks up in surprise as the bookshelf comes back to the clearing with more tourists. A shiny clock walks by and gives the bookshelf a long glance. Later, four women are hammering a nail, another lays twigs onto the roof of a cabin, and the pencil glues a brick. The kite, gluing a feather, drops the hammer it's holding, narrowly missing the pencil. The kite turns to the bookshelf. The pencil frowns at the dog with a visor. The candle and table walk off, everyone looks around. Two old women enter the clearing, one wielding a violin. The pencil puts its elbows up. The sisters stiffen, and the pencil eyes them steadily. The sofa meets its gaze and slowly shakes its foot. The pencil walks away, stumbling into the meadow. It throws up by a bicycle and sinks to its toes. The bookshelf follows it and watches its sibling convulsing with laughter. The pencil bangs its elbow against the bicycle spoke, and the bookshelf grabs it from below and wrestles it to the ground. Water seeps from the cut on the pencil’s elbow. It frees itself from its sibling's grip. The two intruders, the sofa and the quilt, are talking to the owl. The bookshelf runs off to the pencil. The bookshelf looks at the owl, who averts its gaze, and then back at the pencil. A full star gleams in the cloudy sea. The pencil shoots the chair. The pencil shouts. An elderly hat runs out to its blazing kite, and the pencil dispatches it. Together with the bookshelf, the owl, the sofa, and the quilt, it tosses the old hat's body into the burning bed of the kite. A pinprick of water punctures the meadow. The sofa, running along a dusty road, joins the others hiding in a tunnel."

          "description": "At twilight under a clear sky with the brim of his hat lowered, Victor lounges gazing at a barn in the meadow, his eyes narrowed. Outside, Martin, his daughter, and two daughters who were with him at Novak's shed, are taking a stroll. They all glance towards the gate as Victor dances into the courtyard. Martin leaps up, and Victor tosses the lasso. Martin sighs heavily. Recoiling, Martin collapses to his knees. One daughter leaps up. Victor scolds both daughters, then Martin, and then Martin collapses. Victor gazes at the child without empathy as she weeps before him, her face streaked with tears, and he departs, stumbling through the dense thicket, plotting his retreat. At midday, Levi, lounging in a hammock, startles awake, a bag of peanuts by his side. Sleepily, he surveys the chatting people all around him, snatching the bag, he lumbers to his feet, then observes clouds on the horizon. Victor lounges cheerfully gazing into the past, and Levi offers his brother the peanuts. Victor takes a handful, and Levi surveys the dagger, tallying the number of notches. A fleeting grin flickers between them. Levi returns the dagger. Whittling a flute, Levi peers up in alarm as Victor returns to the meadow with more travelers. A charming redhead strides by and gives Victor a brief wink. Soon after, two women are chopping a log, another stacks leaves onto the walls of a cabin, and Levi nails a plank. Rubin, driving a spike, releases the beam he's clutching, narrowly hitting Levi. Rubin whispers to Victor. Levi scowls at the boy with a fedora. Eli and Miriam stride off, everyone peers around. Two young women enter the meadow, one swinging a bat. Levi raises his arms. The siblings tense, and Levi studies them seriously. Ben meets his eyes and slowly nods his head. Levi strolls away, tripping into the meadow. He sits down by a rock and leans against it. Victor trails him and observes his brother groaning with fatigue. Levi pats his hand against the grass, and Victor pulls him up and drags him to the path. Dirt clings to the ground near Levi’s feet. He pulls away from his brother's hold. The two newcomers, Ben and David, are whispering to Nina. Victor strolls back to Levi. Victor surveys Nina, who glances down, and then back at Levi. A crescent moon sparkles in the night sky. Levi tackles the woman. Levi laughs. A young German rushes out to his burning car, and Levi arrests him. Together with Victor, Nina, Ben, and David, he rolls the old man's belongings into the flaming trunk of the car. A sliver of light cuts through the dusk. Ben, skipping along a narrow path, joins the others hiding beneath a tarp."

          "description": "At dusk in pouring snow with the hood of his coat pulled down, Tuvia stands observing a mansion in the meadow, his lips trembling. Inside, Berniski, his spouse, and two daughters who were with him at Koscik's lodge, are baking cookies. They all glance towards the window as Tuvia strolls into the hall. Berniski sits down, and Tuvia unfolds the map. Berniski laughs nervously. Cringing, Berniski lies down on his back. One daughter sits down. Tuvia sketches both daughters, then Berniski, and then Berniski naps. Tuvia glances at the woman without empathy as she weeps before him, her hands covered with flour, and he leaves, leaping through the dense woods, making his retreat. At dusk, Zus, napping in a makeshift van, awakes with a jolt, a loaf of bread by his hands. Sleepily, he glances at the snoozing people all around him, picking up the loaf, he rises to his knees, then notices water from a small stream. Tuvia sits dreamily staring into nothing, and Zus offers his brother the loaf. Tuvia takes a bite, and Zus inspects the clock, counting the number of ticks. A fleeting nod passes between them. Zus hands back the clock. Carving a whistle, Zus looks up in surprise as Tuvia arrives back at the shelter with more wanderers. A charming blonde walks by and gives Tuvia a brief glance. Later, two men are painting a fence, another arranges stones onto the walls of a shack, and Zus glues a plank. Malbin, gluing a button, drops the fence he's holding, narrowly dodging Zus. Malbin turns to Tuvia. Zus scowls at the woman with a scarf. Lazar and Laila stroll off, everyone looks around. Two young men stride into the shelter, one holding a lantern. Zus puts his feet up. The brothers tense, and Zus watches them carefully. Peretz meets his stare and slowly nods his head. Zus ambles away, tripping into the brush. He cries by a bush and lies down. Tuvia follows him and watches his brother laughing with joy. Zus taps his head against the rock face, and Tuvia lifts him from behind and nudges him to the side. Tears drip from the cut on Zus’s cheek. He untangles himself from his brother's clasp. The two visitors, Peretz and Jacov, are chatting to Asael. Tuvia wanders off to Zus. Tuvia gazes at Asael, who averts his eyes, and then back at Zus. A giant star twinkles in the bright sky. Zus whispers to the girl. Zus yawns. An elderly farmer races out to his wrecked car, and Zus dismisses him. Together with Tuvia, Asael, Peretz, and Jacov, he drags the old man's body into the empty trunk of the car. A beam of light illuminates the scenery. Peretz, jogging along a gravel path, joins the others hiding in a bush."

          "description": "In the morning mist and gentle drizzle with the brim of her hat pulled low, Carla stands gazing at a lighthouse on the hilltop, her eyebrows furrowed. Inside, Grimaldi, her friend, and two daughters who were with her at Pietra's cabin, are playing cards. They all glance towards the window as Carla leaps into the space. Grimaldi rises quickly, and Carla lifts the bow. Grimaldi smiles weakly. Trembling, Grimaldi falls to her knees. One daughter leaps forward. Carla silences both daughters, then Grimaldi, and then Grimaldi fades. Carla glances at the man without pity as he weeps before her, his hands stained with ink, and she departs, tripping through the dense jungle, making her retreat. At dusk, Lars, napping in a jerry-built shack, stirs with a jolt, a basket of apples by his feet. Sleepily, he glances at the dreaming animals all around him, grabbing the basket, he lurches to his feet, then spots steam from a small kettle. Carla sits thoughtfully gazing at nowhere, and Lars offers his sister the basket. Carla grabs an apple, and Lars examines the slingshot, counting the number of pebbles. A fleeting glance passes between them. Lars returns the bow. Whittling a stick, Lars looks up in shock as Carla returns to the hideout with a few artists. A striking redhead walks by and gives Carla a lingering glance. Later, two women are knitting a scarf, another arranges leaves onto the cover of a tent, and Lars stitches a quilt. Elvin, threading a needle, drops the scarf he's creating, narrowly missing Lars. Elvin turns to Carla. Lars frowns at the boy with a cap. Orin and Orla stroll away, everyone glances around. Two young women approach the hideout, one brandishing a dagger. Lars raises his arms. The siblings brace, and Lars watches them closely. Harold meets his gaze and slowly nods his head. Lars strolls away, tripping into the foliage. He retches by a shrub and falls to his knees. Carla follows him and observes her brother heaving with sorrow. Lars bangs his fist against the bark, and Carla snatches him from behind and pins him to the ground. Mud leaks from the wound on Lars’s knee. He slips free from his sister's grip. The two new arrivals, Harold and Natan, are conversing with Aliyah. Carla dashes off to Lars. Carla looks at Aliyah, who turns her eyes away, and then back at Lars. A glowing star twinkles in the bright landscape. Lars whispers to the horse. Lars yells. An elderly hunter races towards his flaming bicycle, and Lars silences him. Together with Carla, Aliyah, Harold, and Natan, he places the old man's bicycle into the fiery heap. A beam of lightning pierces the shadows. Harold, jogging along a gravel path, joins the others hiding under a bridge."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

          "description": "In the pouring rain, Tuvia approaches a cottage and, after a tense encounter, eliminates Berniski and his sons. He leaves the grieving wife behind as he escapes through the forest. At dawn, Zus awakens, finds Tuvia, and they share a drink while assessing their situation. As Tuvia returns with more refugees, including a pretty brunette who catches his eye, the camp bustles with activity. Tensions rise when two armed men, Peretz and Jacov, arrive, creating unease among the brothers. Zus is visibly upset and nearly collapses with grief, but Tuvia supports him. Later, in an intense confrontation, Zus shoots a man at night and, with the help of Tuvia, Asael, Peretz, and Jacov, disposes of the body by burning it in a truck. Peretz then joins the others as they hide in a ditch, a pinprick of light piercing the darkness."
