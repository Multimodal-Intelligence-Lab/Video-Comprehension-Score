Merrill steps out of the closet for the first time. Meanwhile, Morgan pulls his eye away from the telescope set up on the window seat in his room, and Bo hugs Morgan tight, who then peels Bo's arms off of him. Graham unlocks the front door, looks down the hall shocked, and does not react but keeps staring. In another scene, Ray clutches the steering wheel tightly, turning his knuckles a yellow white, with two large bags overflowing with clothes in the truck. Graham glances at the backseat of the truck, his eyes gently move back to Ray, and drift down to the two blood-stained areas on his shirt. Tears start falling down Graham's face as Ray finally turns, his red face quivering as he talks. Ray looks at Graham, and the two men stare at each other for a beat before Ray looks away and puts the car in drive. Graham steps away as the truck moves forward and pulls down the driveway. Merrill's head is leaned against a bunch of winter coats with his eyes closed, which then open as he sits up in his chair. The chair in the closet creaks as Merrill leans forward a little towards the television screen as running is heard. Graham waits for a reply, but none comes, so he bends down where he stands and puts his head near the wood floor to try and look under the door. All he can see are the bottoms of a couple shelves in the corner of the pantry, as he's at too severe an angle. Graham sits up, only four feet away from the pantry door, looks around not knowing what to do, and his eyes fall on a bunch of kitchen knives that have spilled from a drawer onto the floor. He takes a butcher knife from the group, moves closer to the door, and uses the knife like a mirror to see under the door. Graham watches the soft reflection and then pulls the knife out. He sits there kneeling two feet from the door, takes a deep breath, and starts to lower his head under the slanted table but stops halfway down as he loses his nerve and sits up. Graham rises to his feet, places the butcher knife on the counter, starts walking across the kitchen, gets to the door, and stays like that for a long time. Then, Graham lets go of the doorknob, turns, and walks quickly across the kitchen, picks up the butcher knife, kneels down next to the pantry, ducks his head under the slanted kitchen table, places his cheek to the floor only inches from the bottom of the door, and looks into the pantry.",

Meanwhile, Morgan draws his eye away from the telescope set up on the window seat in his chamber, and Bo embraces Morgan firmly, who then removes Bo's arms from him. Graham unlocks the front entrance, gazes down the corridor astonished, and does not respond but continues staring. In another scene, Ray grips the steering wheel firmly, turning his knuckles a pale white, with two large sacks overflowing with garments in the truck. Graham glances at the rear of the truck, his eyes softly shift back to Ray, and drift down to the two blood-spattered areas on his shirt. Tears begin descending down Graham's face as Ray finally turns, his flushed face trembling as he speaks.

He sits there kneeling two feet from the door, takes a deep breath, and starts to lower his head under the slanted table but stops midway down as he loses his nerve and sits up. Graham rises to his feet, places the butcher blade on the counter, starts walking across the kitchen, gets to the door, and stays like that for an extended time.

          "description": "Graham, dressed in his reliable overcoat, descends the staircase with a deliberate and purposeful stride, as if he is on a mission. As he approaches the closet door, he pauses momentarily to give it a polite and respectful knock before gently opening it. With this small task completed, he continues on his journey down the hallway. In a significant and unexpected moment, Merrill, for the very first time, emerges from the confines of the closet. Meanwhile, elsewhere within the same house, Morgan, who has been absorbed in his astronomical observations, pulls his eye reluctantly away from the telescope that is meticulously set up on the window seat in his cozy room. Bo, overwhelmed with affection and warmth, embraces Morgan tightly in a heartfelt hug, but Morgan gently and kindly peels Bo's arms away from his body. At this point, Graham reaches the front door; he unlocks it and, with a sudden and shocked expression across his face, looks down the hallway. He does not react immediately, choosing instead to continue staring intently at the scene before him. In a separate and concurrent scene, Ray is depicted clutching the steering wheel of his vehicle with such intensity and force that his knuckles have turned a pale, ghostly yellow-white. Inside the confines of the truck, there are two large bags that are overflowing with clothes, creating a chaotic and cluttered environment. Graham's eyes briefly shift to the backseat of the truck, but his gaze gently returns to Ray, then drifts downward to notice two conspicuous blood-stained areas on Ray's shirt. This sight brings tears to Graham's eyes, and the tears begin to fall as Ray finally turns toward Graham. Ray's face is red and quivering as he speaks, looking directly at Graham, and their eyes lock momentarily in a silent exchange before Ray breaks eye contact, averting his gaze and putting the car in drive. Graham steps back just as the truck starts to move forward, pulling down the driveway. During this time, Merrill is resting his weary head against a pile of winter coats, his eyes closed in contemplation, but they open as he sits upright in his chair. The chair, nestled within the closet, emits a slight creak as Merrill leans forward a little toward the television screen, where the persistent sound of running footsteps can be heard. Graham, waiting expectantly for a response that does not come, bends down to where he stands and lowers his head toward the wooden floor, attempting to get a better view underneath the door. However, all he can see are the bottoms of a couple of shelves located in the corner of the pantry, as his viewing angle is too steep and limited. Graham sits up, still only four feet away from the pantry door, looking around with uncertainty, unsure of what action to take next. His eyes land on a collection of kitchen knives that have tumbled from a drawer onto the floor. He selects a butcher knife from the scattered group, moves cautiously closer to the door, and uses the reflective surface of the knife as a makeshift mirror to see under the door. Graham watches the soft reflection intently for a moment, then pulls the knife back. Remaining kneeling just two feet from the door, he takes a deep breath and begins to lower his head under the slanted table once more, but stops halfway, losing his nerve and sitting upright again. Gathering his resolve, Graham rises to his feet, places the butcher knife back on the counter, and starts walking across the kitchen. He reaches the pantry door, staying there a long time, lost in contemplation. Eventually, Graham releases the doorknob, turns around, and walks quickly back across the kitchen. Determined, he picks up the butcher knife again, kneels down beside the pantry, ducks his head under the slanted kitchen table, places his cheek to the floor mere inches from the bottom of the door, and looks intently into the shadowy depths of the pantry."

He pauses momentarily, raises his hand to knock gently on the door, and then opens it, revealing the hallway beyond. As he begins to walk down the hall, Merrill emerges from the closet for the first time, stepping out cautiously. Meanwhile, in another room, Morgan is intently peering through a telescope positioned on the window seat, his eye pressed against the lens. Bo approaches Morgan, wrapping her arms tightly around him in a hug, which prompts Morgan to gently peel Bo's arms away from him. Graham reaches the front door, unlocks it, and as he looks down the hall, a look of shock crosses his face, yet he remains motionless, his gaze fixed in place. In a different scene, Ray grips the steering wheel with such intensity that his knuckles turn a pale yellow-white, while two large bags, brimming with clothes, sit in the truck. Graham, seated in the truck, glances at the backseat before his eyes shift back to Ray, then drift down to notice two blood-stained areas on Ray's shirt. Tears begin to well up and fall down Graham's face as Ray finally turns towards him, his face flushed and trembling as he speaks. Ray meets Graham's eyes, and for a moment, the two men lock eyes in silence before Ray looks away, shifts the car into drive, and begins to pull away. Graham steps back, watching as the truck moves forward and down the driveway. Back inside, Merrill rests his head against a pile of winter coats, his eyes closed in thought, before they flutter open and he sits up in his chair. The chair creaks softly as Merrill leans forward slightly, his attention drawn to the television screen, while the sound of running fills the room. Graham, waiting for a response that never comes, bends down where he stands, lowering his head close to the wooden floor in an attempt to peer under the door. His view is limited to the bottoms of a couple of shelves in the pantry's corner, as the angle is too steep. Sitting up, just four feet from the pantry door, Graham looks around, uncertain of his next move, until his eyes land on a collection of kitchen knives that have spilled from a drawer onto the floor. He selects a butcher knife from the assortment, approaches the door, and uses the knife's reflective surface to peer under the door. Observing the soft reflection, he then withdraws the knife, kneeling two feet from the door, taking a deep breath. He begins to lower his head under the slanted table but hesitates, losing his nerve, and sits up again. Rising to his feet, Graham places the butcher knife on the counter, strides across the kitchen, and reaches the door, where he pauses for a long moment. Eventually, he releases the doorknob, turns swiftly, and walks back across the kitchen, retrieves the butcher knife, kneels beside the pantry, ducks his head under the slanted kitchen table, and presses his cheek to the floor, mere inches from the door's bottom, to peer into the pantry."

Graham waits for a reply but none comes so he bends down where he stands and puts his head near the wood floor to try and look under the door. All he can see are the bottoms of a couple shelves in the corner of the pantry as he is at too severe an angle. Graham sits up only four feet away from the pantry door looks around not knowing what to do and his eyes fall on a bunch of kitchen knives that have spilled from a drawer onto the floor. He takes a butcher knife from the group moves closer to the door and uses the knife like a mirror to see under the door. Graham watches the soft reflection and then pulls the knife out. He sits there kneeling two feet from the door takes a deep breath and starts to lower his head under the slanted table but stops halfway down as he loses his nerve and sits up. Graham rises to his feet places the butcher knife on the counter starts walking across the kitchen gets to the door and stays like that for a long time. Then Graham let us go of the doorknob turns and walks quickly across the kitchen picks up the butcher knife kneels down next to the pantry ducks his head under the slanted kitchen table places his cheek to the floor only inches from the bottom of the door and looks into the pantry."

          "description": "Wallace ascends up the ladder with his scarf on, shuffles to the attic window, taps on it before sliding it open, and begins up the hallway. Quentin leaps out of the attic for the first time. Simultaneously, Lance removes his foot away from the telescope stationed on the library bench in his den, and Mia hugs Lance loosely, who then shrugs Mia's grip off him. Wallace locks the balcony gate, glances up the hallway amazed, and does not respond but keeps glaring. In another scene, Neil grips the umbrella tightly, turning his knuckles a pale green, with two large crates spilling with books in the back. Wallace peeks at the rear of the van, his eyes softly shift back to Neil, and glide down to the two ink-splattered spots on his jacket. Raindrops start falling down Wallace's face as Neil finally spins, his blue face quaking as he mumbles. Neil squints at Wallace, and the two boys gape at each other for a moment before Neil looks away and sets the motorcycle in gear. Wallace leaps aside as the van rolls backward and pushes up the driveway. Quentin's head is nestled against a stack of summer hats with his eyes closed, which then open as he shifts in his hammock. The hammock in the attic creaks as Quentin leans backward a little towards the radio as dancing is heard. Wallace anticipates a response, but none arrives, so he crouches down where he stands and places his ear near the tile floor to try and hear under the wall. All he can sense are the bottoms of a couple pumpkins in the corner of the closet, as he's at too sharp an angle. Wallace stands up, only six feet away from the closet wall, surveys around uncertain of what to do, and his gaze lands on a heap of garden rakes that have tumbled from a shelf onto the ground. He takes a spade from the pile, scoots closer to the wall, and uses the spade like a periscope to peek over the wall. Wallace observes the faint reflection and then yanks the spade away. He crouches there standing three feet from the wall, inhales deeply, and starts to lift his hand over the slanted bookshelf but pauses halfway up as he loses his courage and stands back. Wallace climbs to his knees, places the spade on the table, starts tiptoeing through the living room, arrives at the wall, and stays that way for a long time. Then, Wallace releases the latch, rotates, and dashes swiftly across the living room, snatches up the spade, kneels next to the closet, curls his hand over the slanted kitchen table, rests his cheek to the tile only inches from the top of the wall, and listens into the closet."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Graham unlocks the front door, shocked by what he sees down the hall but does not react. In another scene, Ray clutches the steering wheel with blood-stained shirt visible, while Graham tears up as they exchange a glance. Merrill, sitting with his head against winter coats, leans forward to watch TV as running is heard. Graham checks under a door but can only see shelf bottoms. Noticing fallen kitchen knives, he uses a butcher knife to see under the door. Losing his nerve, Graham sits back but then quickly approaches the pantry, ducking under the table to peer inside."
