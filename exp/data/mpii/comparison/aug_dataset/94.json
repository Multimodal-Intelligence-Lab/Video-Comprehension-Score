With a swift motion, he reaches behind the door that hangs ajar to snatch his parka from its hook, his movements sharp and agitated. He then grabs a pair of galoshes, clutching them tightly in his hands, before stomping decisively out through the doorway. Marge, left in the quiet wake of his departure, finds herself staring into space for a prolonged moment. Her attention eventually shifts as she draws a clipboard towards her, which holds a form from the General Motors Finance Corporation, her eyes momentarily flicking over the details. As she sits in the office, her gaze wanders lazily around the room, landing on yet another picture of Jean. She contemplates this picture for a brief instant, then lets her eyes roam around, inexplicably casting a glance at the ceiling before continuing her idle survey of the room's interior. Suddenly, her idle gaze sharpens, focusing intently as Jerry makes a left turn into the bustling flow of traffic visible from her vantage point. She springs into action, reaching quickly for the phone and punching in a number with purpose. Meanwhile, Grimsrud remains silent, offering no words as Carl reacts with disgust, pocketing his gun before striding toward the door with determined steps. As we follow Carl's retreat toward his car, our attention shifts to the cabin door behind him, which swings open with a creak. Carl turns sharply, his body tensing at the unexpected sound, just as Grimsrud charges out, his attire an odd mix of mittens and a red hunter's cap, conspicuously lacking an overcoat, while brandishing an axe with an intense focus. With a forceful overhand swing, Grimsrud drives the axe into Carl's neck with a sickening precision. In her cruiser, Marge is engaged with her two-way radio, the heavily filtered tones of Lou's voice resonating through the speaker. Her cruiser slows its progress as they near a short driveway that slopes down to reveal a cabin with a brown Cutlass Ciera parked conspicuously outside. Grimsrud stands alert, conscious of the noise around him, as he observes the scene, his attention drawn to the insignia Marge displays with a subtle shoulder twist. Reacting swiftly, Grimsrud reaches back with a quick motion, grabbing a log which he hurls toward Marge before breaking into a run, his legs pumping as he struggles up a hill, his breath coming in visible puffs in the cold air, each step hindered by the deep, clinging snow. As he moves, Grimsrud's face shows signs of weariness, his cheeks sunken and eyes hollow, giving him a sour disposition as he glances out toward the road. Marge, maintaining her focus on the road ahead, seems to mutter to herself while glancing periodically in the rear-view mirror to catch sight of Grimsrud's head bobbing with each bump, his face otherwise immobile and scowling as he stares out. Eventually, Marge guides the vehicle to a halt, her seat creaking beneath her as she leans back, the jangle of utilities a faint accompaniment. Outside, snow falls softly, blanketing the landscape in white, covering the sky, earth, and road in a seamless veil. She stares straight ahead, shaking her head in mild disbelief as a squad car, its lights spinning like gum-balls, slices through the white veil, approaching in deliberate slow motion, trailed by an ambulance and another squad car. These vehicles line up alongside a highway that stretches across a snowy, windswept plain, punctuated only by the sporadic presence of one or two cars dotting the parking lot, which lies adjacent to an idling police cruiser. Our view extends over the shoulders of two uniformed policemen who stand watchfully on either side of a door, their hands resting with calculated ease on their holstered sidearms. One of the officers raps on the door with authority before smoothly unholstering his gun, his head nodding in acknowledgment to someone whose back enters the scene."

In her cruiser on her twoway radio we hear Lou's voice heavily filtered. The approach slows as they near a short driveway leading down to a cabin with a brown Cutlass Ciera parked in front.

With a quick twist Grimsrud reaches back for the log hurls it at Marge and then starts running away. Marge twists her body sideways shielding herself as Grimsrud pants up the hill moving slowly through the deep snow. Behind him. Grimsrud with cheeks sunk and eyes hollow looks sourly out at the road. She glances up in the rearview mirror to see Grimsrud's head bobbing with bumps on the road otherwise motionless and scowling as he gazes out. Marge gazing forward seems to be talking to herself and glances up in the rearview mirror again at Grimsrud's hollow eyes staring out. Marge pulls over and leans back with a creak and jangle of utilities. Outside it is snowing with the sky earth and road all white. She stares forward shakes her head as a squad car with gumballs spinning punches through the white approaches in slow motion followed by an ambulance and another squad car. These vehicles stand next to a highway on a snowy windswept plain with one or two cars dotting the parking lot alongside an idling police cruiser.

          "description": "Tom admires the vase and then implodes, hopping gleefully onto his nose. He tosses his helmet from a drawer under the closed window, picks up a pair of skis, and floats through the window. Linda admires, and after a brief second, her admiration fades as she pushes a chalkboard away that stores a map from the Eastern Airlines Vacation Headquarters. She peers curiously around the kitchen, spotting another painting of Steve. Linda glances at it, glances around, for some reason at the floor, and then curiously around once more. Her glance suddenly freezes as Tom takes a right turn onto the highway and she picks up the remote to dial in a channel. Peterson says anything as, delighted, Sam drops the umbrella and skips toward the window. We yank Sam as he dances toward the truck, and behind him, we observe the barn window closing. Sam flips, responding to the noise, as Peterson skips out wearing gloves and a blue gardener's hat but no scarf, gripping a shovel. Peterson swings underhand, embedding the shovel in Sam's shoulder. In her helicopter, on her walkie-talkie, we notice Dave's voice, softly muffled. The retreat quickens as they distance a long driveway leading up to a mansion with a green Pontiac siting in back. Peterson admires, aware of the silence, as he signals with a bend of his elbow the backpack emblem. With a swift bend, Peterson reaches forward for the bucket, flings it at Linda, and then begins skipping downhill. Linda bends her body backward, guarding herself, as Peterson pants down the slope, moving rapidly across the shallow sand. Before him, Peterson, with lips curled and nose bright, looks happily up at the trail. She peers down in the rear-view mirror to notice Peterson's body swaying with bumps on the trail, otherwise animated and smiling as he gazes up. Linda, staring backward, appears to be speaking to the car and peers down in the rear-view mirror again at Peterson's bright nose gazing up. Linda speeds up and leans forward with a squeak and clatter of groceries. Inside, it is raining, with the sun, ocean, and trail all black. She admires backward, nods her head as a fire engine with sirens blaring shoots through the black, escorts in fast motion, followed by a helicopter and another fire engine. These vessels hover above a freeway on a humid, lush field, with three or four buses dotting the parking garage next to a parked garbage truck. We peek under the knees of two ununiformed nurses hovering near the window, their knees clutching tightly on their sheathed umbrellas. One of them whispers near the window, and then tosses his umbrella, shaking his head to everyone whose face exits."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Marge, in her cruiser, listens to Lou on the radio. Approaching a cabin, she shows her insignia, causing Grimsrud to flee, throwing a log at her. Marge shields herself as Grimsrud runs through the snow. She observes Grimsrud's hollow scowl in the rear-view mirror and talks to herself. Marge stops as snow falls and observes a squad car, ambulance, and another squad car. Nearby, uniformed policemen knock on a door, readying their sidearms."
