Moving to the library setting, Ron cautiously places the golden egg onto the table, casting longing glances back as he and Hermione reluctantly depart, leaving Harry surrounded by his study materials. Harry takes a moment to gather the scattered books, organizing them into a neat pile, while he also tidies his notes, arranging them methodically. After Moody exits, leaving the room empty except for Harry and Neville, Harry looks toward Neville with a sympathetic expression, acknowledging the situation. Transitioning to the lake scene, Fred and George energetically engage in taking bets, creating an air of excitement, as Neville hands the gillyweed over to Harry, the pivotal exchange completed with a nervous but determined demeanor. Three towering spectator pavilions stand erected around the lake, casting grand reflections on the water's surface. As Harry receives the gillyweed, he inadvertently chokes on it, gasping for air, just as the three other competitors dive smoothly into the water, disappearing below the surface, while Moody unceremoniously gives Harry a nudge, sending him splashing in after them. Struggling for breath, Harry involuntarily sinks beneath the surface, finding himself surrounded by the metal supports of the pavilions, his hands instinctively clutching his neck where gills begin to form, transforming him to breathe underwater. He glances downward, observing his feet morphing into flippers, then raises his hands to discover they have turned webbed, completing his aquatic adaptation. As Seamus stands on the edge, peering intently into the water, Harry propels himself upwards, bursting out of the water with force, executing a graceful somersault in the air akin to a dolphin, before diving back beneath the surface. Swiftly kicking out with his newly formed flippers, Harry propels himself through the dense water weed, navigating over the rocky lake bed that suddenly drops off into a deep ravine. With his arms tucked close to his sides, he courageously plunges into the murky depths, seamlessly gliding through the water. Small fish swim alongside him, their bodies gleaming in the dim light, as he navigates with ease in his shorts and singlet, prominently marked with “Potter” on the back, while his wand remains securely sheathed and strapped to his leg. As he progresses through a narrow channel, he peers ahead through the murky water, weaving through ropes of dark green weed that hang before him like draping curtains. Harry glances over his shoulder, his senses alert, and notices a figure swimming strongly behind him: it's Fleur, wearing a delicate, transparent veil over her mouth and nose, her long fair hair streaming gracefully behind her as she moves. Suddenly, something darts past her face, causing Fleur to vanish unexpectedly, seemingly pulled down and out of sight, while Harry feels himself knocked aside by whatever swiftly passed by. Regaining his balance, Harry catches a glimpse of a silvery tail disappearing into a labyrinth of weeds, compelling him to follow the merperson guiding him deeper above the jagged rocks lining the lake's bottom. Peering into the distance, he discerns the remnants of a stone archway and, with determination, kicks out forcefully with his flipper adapted feet, navigating upward through towering columns that loom like the grand architecture of an underwater cathedral. He swims purposefully past the ancient, ruined archways, their edges softened and blurred by the encroaching algae and waving water weed, until he finally reaches the unsettling sight of four individuals in black cloaks—Ron, Hermione, Cho, and a small girl with long fair hair—standing suspended in the water, eyes closed and faces expressionless, while unfriendly merpeople linger menacingly nearby, ominously armed with sharp tridents and flicking their tails restlessly in the water. Focused on his mission, Harry carefully works to untie the rope binding Ron's ankle, freeing him from his aquatic captors, and then without pausing, he moves decisively toward Hermione, determined to rescue her as well."

In the library, which is lined with ancient tomes and known as a sanctuary for serious study, Ron puts the golden egg, a clue from the Triwizard Tournament, on the table, and he and Hermione, both deeply invested in Harry's success, leave reluctantly as Harry piles up his books and tidies his notes. Moody, a seasoned Auror with a magical eye that can see through walls, leaves them alone, and Harry looks at Neville apologetically, aware that Neville often feels out of place at such events. At the lake, the setting for the second task of the tournament, Fred and George, known for their mischievous business ventures, take bets as Neville, who discovered the plant in a Herbology class, hands over the gillyweed. Three tall spectator pavilions, built to accommodate the cheering crowds, have been erected in the lake, and Harry chokes on the gillyweed as three of the competitors dive in and Moody, showing his usual tough-love approach, pushes Harry in after them. Gasping for breath, he sinks down amongst the metal supports of the pavilions, clutching his neck as gills develop on either side like a fish, a rare transformation for wizards. He looks down and sees his feet turn into flippers, holding up his hands as they become webbed, a change that allows him to navigate more like a merperson. Seamus, watching with a blend of awe and concern, stares down into the water as Harry suddenly hurtles up out of the water, somersaults in the air like a dolphin, a move that displays his growing confidence, and vanishes again under the surface. Harry kicks out with his flippers and swims through the water weed over the rock-strewn bed of the lake, which falls away in front of him into a deep ravine, known to be home to various magical creatures, as he dives into the murky darkness, arms held close by his sides. Fish, some known only to the magical community, swim beside him as he moves easily through the water, wearing shorts and a singlet with Potter written on the back, a uniform suited for the task, and his wand, an essential wizard's tool, is in a sheath, strapped to his leg. He heads through a narrow channel, peering uncertainly through the cloudy water, and swims through ropes of dark green weed hanging like curtains in front of him. Harry looks over his shoulder and spots a figure behind: Fleur, one of his competitors and a part-Veela known for her enchanting presence, is swimming strongly, a delicate filmy veil over her mouth and nose, a magical adaptation for breathing underwater, with her long fair hair streaming behind her. Something whips past her face, and Fleur suddenly disappears, pulled down out of sight as Harry is knocked aside by something that flashes past, a known hazard of the underwater terrain. Recovering himself, he catches sight of a silvery tail vanishing into the Forest of Weed and follows the merperson, a creature known for its territorial nature, as it leads him above the jagged rocks on the bottom of the lake. Far ahead, he sees the ruins of a stone archway, rumored to be remnants of ancient magical civilizations, and kicks out strongly with his flipper feet, with tall columns rising around him like an underwater cathedral, a testament to the grandeur hidden beneath the lake's surface. He swims past ruined archways, their outlines softened by algae and water weed, before reaching four people in black cloaks floating upright in front of him—Ron, Hermione, Cho, and a small girl with long fair hair—their eyes closed and faces blank, enchanted into a deep sleep for the task, while unfriendly-looking merpeople lurk ominously close, adhering to their role as guardians, carrying sharp tridents and lashing their tails. Harry unties the rope around Ron's ankle, driven by the desire to protect his friend, and moves toward Hermione, determined to ensure her safety."

Selena leaves them alone, and Oliver glances at Edmund regretfully. At the pond, Max and Charlie make wagers as Edmund hands over the sapling. Three tall observation towers have been constructed in the pond, and Oliver sputters on the sapling as three of the entrants leap in and Selena shoves Oliver in after them. Gasping for air, he descends among the wooden beams of the towers, clutching his throat as gills emerge on either side like a seahorse.

Thomas peers down into the puddle as Oliver suddenly rockets up out of the puddle, flips in the air like a seal, and disappears again beneath the surface. Oliver kicks out with his paddle feet and glides through the algae over the pebble-strewn floor of the pond, which drops off in front of him into a deep cavern as he plunges into the cloudy abyss, arms held tightly by his sides.

Oliver glances over his elbow and notices a silhouette behind: Clara is swimming energetically, a delicate sheer scarf over her mouth and nose, with her long blond hair flowing behind her. Something zips past her face, and Clara suddenly vanishes, dragged down from view as Oliver is jostled aside by something that zips by. Regaining his balance, he glimpses a glimmering fin disappearing into the Jungle of Algae and pursues the naiad as it guides him above the rugged stones on the floor of the pond.

Three short tent gazebos have been assembled in the forest, and Luna coughs on the foxglove as three of the creatures leap over and Lupin nudges Luna in alongside them. Gasping for air, she floats down amongst the wooden beams of the gazebos, clutching her chest as lungs develop on either side like a bird. She glances downward and sees her boots morph into claws, raising her arms as they become feathered. Dean peers up into the sky as Luna abruptly shoots skyward from the ground, spins in the air like an eagle, and disappears again below the canopy. Luna thrusts out with her claws and glides through the air currents over the moss-covered floor of the forest, which slopes away in front of her into a deep gorge as she swoops into the dim twilight, wings held tightly against her body. Owls glide beside her as she maneuvers deftly through the air, wearing leggings and a jacket with Lovegood written on the back, and her quill is in a pouch, strapped to her hip. She navigates through a thin corridor, peering cautiously through the hazy atmosphere, and soars through strands of gray mist hanging like banners ahead of her. Luna glances over her wing and spots a figure behind: Cedric is gliding swiftly, a delicate shroud over his mouth and nose, with his short dark hair trailing behind. Something dashes past his face, and Cedric abruptly vanishes, dragged out of view as Luna is nudged aside by something that zooms by. Steadying herself, she catches a glimpse of a golden feather disappearing into the Forest of Mist and pursues the centaur as it guides her above the jagged stones at the forest floor. Far in the distance, she sees the remnants of a stone tower and propels forward with her clawed feet, with slender trunks rising around her like a woodland canopy. She hovers past crumbling towers, their silhouettes softened by moss and mist, before reaching four creatures in gray robes hovering upright in front of her - Draco, Ginny, Neville, and a young boy with short dark hair - their eyes shut and expressions vacant, while menacing centaurs linger ominously near, wielding sharp spears and flicking their hooves.

Seamus gazes up into the sky as Harry suddenly spirals down out of the sky, pirouettes in the air like a parrot, and reappears again above the ground. Harry flaps out with his wings and flies through the air currents over the flower-strewn field of the meadow, which rises up in front of him into a tall peak as he glides into the bright sky, arms held open wide. Birds soar beside him as he glides effortlessly through the air, wearing a vest and shorts with Potter written on the back, and his wand is in a holster, strapped to his side. He zooms through a wide passage, peering cautiously through the clear air, and flies through strands of light brown grass draping like streamers in front of him. Harry glances over his wing and spots a shape behind: Fleur is flying swiftly, a delicate gossamer scarf around her neck and ears, with her short dark hair fluttering behind her. Something darts past her arm, and Fleur suddenly reappears, propelled up into view as Harry is jostled aside by something that glimmers past. Righting himself, he glimpses a golden beak darting into the Canopy of Grass and follows the birdperson as it guides him beneath the towering branches on the top of the meadow. Far below, he spots the outline of a stone bridge and flaps out powerfully with his winged arms, with leafy trees towering around him like an aerial forest. He flutters past broken bridges, their edges softened by moss and sky grass, before reaching four figures in red robes floating horizontally beside him - Ron, Hermione, Cho, and a small boy with short dark hair - their eyes open and expressions serene, while friendly-looking birdpeople flit brightly nearby, wielding slender harpoons and fluttering their wings.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
