Now it's Edward who's immobilized, powerless in time, as he inspects in panes while vehicles draw out, seeking for his destined affection. Colossus is hitchhiking for a lift, and the last pickup lorry halts to let him climb in back. As the lorry pulls away, it passes a dispirited Edward who believes he'll never locate the girl, the love of his existence. Amos inclines over so Karl can endorse a agreement on his back and detects Edward strolling back into the shelter. Amos hands off the agreement to a jester, and as Amos begins to walk away, Edward hastens to catch up with him, pointing to the bleachers where no rucksack is to be found. Getting in front of Amos, Edward halts him, and Amos grins, entertained. Amos takes a prolonged look at Edward, and ultimately, there's no way he can say no, so he shrugs, and Edward shakes Amos's hand before he can withdraw the proposal. We shift into a montage, where Edward is shown grinning apprehensively, his head tilted to the side, with it held in a colossal lion's open mouth, whose sharp fangs are just piercing his skin. If the lion flinches, Edward's existence is in peril. The audience applauds, making the lion skittish, which makes Edward even more anxious. With his eyes droopy from deprivation of rest, Edward operates the whirling amusement park ride and nods off, tumbling backward into the path of the spinning limbs. One of the Hydra vehicles strikes him square in the abdomen, hurling him up and away, soaring 200 feet through the atmosphere. Amos is strolling past, pauses, observes the youthful man, and then finally walks away. We push in on Edward, captivated by the idea. Edward shovels dung in the nastiest stables, engrossed with his reflections. In serene contemplation, he considers his latest bit of information. A sudden detonation occurs as Edward is shot out of a giant cannon. Under a full moon, Edward walks up to a battered camper and is about to knock when he notices it's rocking considerably. Yet, Edward knocks nevertheless, and the rocking and moaning abruptly cease. A beat later, the door handle begins to rattle, seeming stuck. Edward turns the knob, and the door bursts open, knocking him down with a colossal black canine, the largest anyone has ever seen, with green glowing eyes and a flicker of fire for a tongue. Edward struggles with the beast as its mouth snaps at his throat. Blocking with an arm, Edward attempts to push himself free, but the creature’s hands—holding tight instead of paws—hinder him."

This causes a young woman to find herself lost and adrift in its confusing wake. Now, it is Edward who finds himself frozen, caught helpless in the relentless grasp of time. He diligently checks in shop windows while cars are pulling out, all the while desperately searching for his destined love. Meanwhile, Colossus is seen thumbing for a ride at the roadside, and the very last pickup truck on the street pulls over to let him climb into the back. As the truck drives away into the distance, it passes by an utterly dejected Edward, who is filled with the heartbreaking belief that he will never find the girl, the true love of his life. Nearby, Amos leans over so that Karl can use his back to sign a contract, and at the same time, he notices Edward walking back into the bustling tent. Amos promptly hands off the signed contract to a nearby clown and begins to walk away until Edward hurriedly catches up with him, pointing toward the bleachers where no backpack is to be found. Getting in front of Amos, Edward steps in to stop him, and Amos, entertained, smiles with amusement. Amos takes a long, lingering look at Edward, and ultimately realizes there is no reasonable way he can deny him, so he simply shrugs, and Edward seizes the moment to shake Amos's hand before any offer can be retracted. We transition into a vivid montage, where Edward is depicted standing nervously with a tentative smile, his head casually tilted to the side, but held precariously in the massive open mouth of a lion, whose sharp, pointed teeth gently poke at his skin. If the lion were to make any sudden movements, Edward's life would be in peril. The crowd erupts in applause, making the lion uneasy, which in turn makes Edward even more anxious. His eyes are droopy from a lack of sleep as he mans the whirling, dizzying amusement park ride and starts to nod off, eventually falling backward into the path of the fast-spinning arms. One of the Hydra cars hits him directly in the gut, sending him soaring up and away, flying 200 feet through the air. As Amos is walking past, he stops momentarily, glances at the young man, and then finally continues walking away. We focus in on Edward, who is utterly captivated by the concept. Edward finds himself shoveling manure in the nastiest of stables, deeply preoccupied with his own swirling thoughts. In a state of quiet reverie, he contemplates his latest piece of intriguing information. Suddenly, there is an explosion as Edward is propelled out of a giant cannon with great force.

However, Edward decides to knock anyway, prompting the rocking and moaning to abruptly cease. A beat later, the door handle begins to rattle as if it is stuck. Edward turns the knob with determination, and the door bursts open, causing him to tumble backward and down to the ground as a massive black dog, the largest anyone has ever seen, leaps out.

          "description": "In a sudden and unexpected surge of activity, everything around them begins to move at an incredibly fast and dizzying pace. The once-distinct and easily recognizable crowd transforms into a chaotic, swirling blur of motion. This overwhelming change leaves a young woman feeling utterly lost and adrift, tangled in the confusing wake of her surroundings. At this moment, it is Edward who finds himself standing utterly still, trapped and frozen in the merciless and relentless grip of time. As he moves down the street, he carefully checks in each shop window while cars continuously pull out and drive away. All the while, he is desperately searching for his destined love. Meanwhile, at the side of the road, Colossus can be seen standing there, thumbing for a ride, hoping to catch a lift from any passerby. Finally, the last pickup truck on the now-deserted street comes to a halt, allowing him to climb into the back. As the truck disappears into the distance, it passes by a dejected Edward, who is filled with the heartbreaking belief and sorrowful conviction that he may never find the girl who is the true love of his life. Nearby, Amos is leaning over so that Karl can use his back as a makeshift table to sign a contract. At the same time, Amos notices Edward making his way back into the lively and bustling tent. Amos quickly hands off the signed contract to a nearby clown and begins to walk away until Edward, in a hurry, catches up to him. He points toward the bleachers, indicating that there is no backpack to be found. With a determined step, Edward moves in front of Amos to stop him. Amused, Amos smiles, entertained by the situation. He takes a long, lingering look at Edward, and ultimately there is no reasonable way he can deny him; with a simple shrug, Edward seizes the moment and shakes Amos's hand before any offer can be taken back. We then transition into a vivid and colorful montage, where Edward is shown standing nervously, wearing a tentative yet hopeful smile, his head tilted casually to the side, but caught in the gigantic, open jaws of a lion. The lion's sharp, pointed teeth gently press against his skin, creating tension, as any sudden movement from the lion could put Edward's life in grave danger. The crowd erupts into applause, which makes the lion uneasy and, in turn, makes Edward even more anxious. His eyes, heavy and droopy from a lack of sleep, blink slowly as he operates the whirling, dizzying amusement park ride. He begins to nod off, eventually falling backward into the path of the swiftly spinning arms. One of the Hydra cars hits him squarely in the gut, launching him high into the sky, where he soars a staggering 200 feet through the air. As Amos is walking past, he stops momentarily, glances at the young man, and then finally continues on his way. We focus in closely on Edward, who is utterly captivated by the entire concept. He finds himself laboring away, shoveling manure in the filthiest and most unpleasant of stables, deeply preoccupied and lost in his own swirling thoughts. In a quiet state of reverie, he reflects and contemplates this latest piece of intriguing information. Then, in an unexpected moment, there is a sudden explosion as Edward is launched out of a giant cannon with tremendous force. Underneath the soft glow of a full moon, Edward approaches a weathered and battered camper, on the verge of knocking on its door when he notices that it is rocking back and forth significantly. Nevertheless, Edward decides to knock, which causes the rocking and the accompanying moaning sounds to cease abruptly. A moment later, the door handle begins to rattle as if it is stuck. Edward turns the knob with firm determination, and the door bursts open, causing him to tumble backward and fall to the ground. As he hits the earth, a massive, imposing black dog, larger than any other he has ever seen, leaps out. With eyes glowing a vivid green and a tongue like a flicker of fire, the fierce creature wrestles with Edward, its mouth snapping dangerously close to his throat. Struggling to keep it at bay with one arm, Edward fights to push himself free, but the creature’s hands, gripping tightly and eerily human-like instead of bearing paws, prevent his escape."

          "description": "Suddenly, the entire world seems to surge into motion around her, and the young woman finds herself swallowed by the swift-moving crowd, becoming lost in its relentless momentum. Meanwhile, Edward stands motionless, seemingly trapped in a moment of helplessness as he peers through the reflections in shop windows, his gaze darting anxiously beyond the shifting glass. As cars rhythmically move in and out of street lanes, each pulling away from the curb, Edward's eyes scan for the elusive figure of his destined love. In a different part of this whirlwind scene, Colossus extends a hitchhiker's thumb upwards, hoping for a ride, and success is met when the last pickup truck grinds to a halt, inviting him to clamber into its open back. The truck, with its new passenger, rumbles away, rolling past a despondent Edward, whose heart sinks with the belief that the love of his life has slipped irretrievably beyond his reach. Meanwhile, Amos bends over, creating a makeshift desk with his back so Karl can scrawl his signature on a contract. As his eyes survey the surroundings, Amos catches sight of Edward trudging back into the tent, fueling a flicker of curiosity. In a smooth, almost absent-minded motion, Amos passes the signed contract to a clown and pivots to leave, his feet just beginning to move. But Edward, driven by urgency, accelerates to intercept Amos, pointing emphatically toward the bleachers, pointing out the conspicuous absence of a backpack. Blocking Amos's path, Edward halts him, catching the older man's attention, which turns into a faint, amused smile. Amos scrutinizes Edward with an expression that reveals an internal debate, ultimately conceding as the corners of his mouth lift in a resigned shrug. Taking advantage of the moment, Edward seizes Amos's hand in a firm handshake, securing the promise before anything changes. We transition seamlessly into a montage, capturing Edward's expression marked by a blend of nervousness and resolve. His head is precariously cradled within the gaping jaws of a massive lion, its sharp teeth just grazing his skin, holding his life on a razor's edge should the creature twitch. The audience's applause reverberates, unsettling the lion and in turn, dialing up Edward's anxiety. Exhaustion drapes Edward's eyelids half-closed as he operates a chaotic amusement park ride. Fatigue overtakes him, and he drifts into a brief sleep, his body lurching backward only to be caught in the sweeping path of the ride's mechanized arms. With brutal accuracy, one of the Hydra cars slams into him, its force launching him violently, his body arcing dramatically through the air, traveling an astonishing 200 feet. As Amos stumbles upon the scene, he pauses, observing the young man's plight before deciding to move on. We delve deeper into Edward's consciousness, captivated by the never-ending swirl of concepts filling his thoughts. With each shovel thrust, Edward shifts manure in the foulest of stables, his mind lost in the analysis of recent revelations. An abrupt cacophony erupts as Edward is propelled from the barrel of a giant cannon, a spectacle of explosive power. Under the serene glow of a full moon, Edward approaches a dilapidated camper, intending to knock when he notices the unsettling sway of its structure. Despite this, he raps his knuckles on the surface, causing the movement and accompanying sounds to abruptly cease. After a moment of silence, the door handle quivers as if stuck before Edward turns it firmly, resulting in the door flying wide open. This action sends Edward tumbling to the ground, greeted by the unexpected and overwhelming presence of an enormous black dog, its eyes casting an eerie green glow and a fiery tongue flicking dangerously. Edward engages in a desperate struggle with the beast as its snapping jaws drive mercilessly towards his throat. He defends with an arm, attempting to pry himself loose, but the creature's strange, human-like hands grip him tightly, refusing to let him escape its grasp."

Now it's Edward who's frozen, helpless in time, as he checks in windows of the bustling bazaar while cars, typical of a busy festival night, pull out, searching for his fated love. Colossus, a nickname for the towering man known among travelers, is thumbing for a ride, and the last pickup truck, a dusty old Ford with faded paint, stops to let him climb in back. As the truck pulls away, it passes a dejected Edward who believes he'll never find the girl, the love of his life who vanished amidst the throng. Amos, a seasoned ringmaster with decades of experience, leans over so Karl can sign a contract on his back and spots Edward walking back into the tent where a circus performance recently concluded. Amos hands off the contract to a clown, part of a troupe known for their hilarious yet intricate acts, and as Amos starts to walk away, Edward hurries to catch up with him, pointing to the bleachers where no backpack is to be found, echoing an earlier mishap during a rehearsal. Getting in front of Amos, Edward stops him, and Amos smirks, amused by Edward's persistence. Amos takes a long look at Edward, assessing him with the keen eye of a judge, and ultimately, there's no way he can say no, so he shrugs, and Edward shakes Amos's hand before he can retract the offer. We move into a montage, where Edward is shown smiling nervously, his head tilted to the side, with it held in a massive lion's open mouth, a notorious trick in the show, whose sharp teeth are just poking his skin. If the lion, trained yet unpredictable, flinches, Edward's life is in danger. The crowd applauds, making the lion antsy, which makes Edward even antsier. With his eyes droopy from lack of sleep after a long night of carnival activities, Edward mans the whirling amusement park ride and nods off, falling backward into the path of the spinning arms. One of the Hydra cars, an attraction known for its dizzying speeds, hits him square in the gut, throwing him up and away, sailing 200 feet through the air. Amos is walking past, stops, looks at the young man enduring the chaos of circus life, and then finally walks away. We push in on Edward, enraptured by the concept of becoming part of this surreal world. Edward shovels manure in the nastiest stables, part of his grueling new duties, preoccupied with his thoughts. In quiet reverie, he ponders his latest bit of information learned from a retired performer. A sudden explosion occurs as Edward is shot out of a giant cannon, a thrilling stunt often used as a grand finale. Under a full moon, Edward walks up to a battered camper, a relic from the 1960s with patched-up windows, and is about to knock when he notices it's rocking significantly. Yet, Edward knocks anyway, and the rocking and moaning suddenly stop, indicating something peculiar inside. A beat later, the door handle begins to rattle, seeming stuck due to the old hinges. Edward turns the knob, and the door bursts open, knocking him down with a massive black dog, akin to legendary hellhounds of folklore, the biggest anyone has ever seen, with green glowing eyes and a lick of fire for a tongue. Edward wrestles with the beast as its mouth snaps at his throat. Blocking with an arm, Edward tries to push himself free, but the creature’s hands—eerily human-like and holding tight instead of paws—prevent him."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
