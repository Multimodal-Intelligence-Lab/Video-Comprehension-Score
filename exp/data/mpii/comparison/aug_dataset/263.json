At that precise moment, the front door handle audibly clicks open, revealing Smalls standing firmly in the doorway of the old, abandoned trailer, which is now cloaked in an eerie and unsettling silence. The room is left in utter disarray, remnants of a fierce battle, as delicate streams of sunlight filter in between the narrow slats of the venetian blinds. Smoke, curling up from Lenny Smalls' cheroot, elegantly drifts through the beam of light. After he pauses momentarily at the threshold to thoroughly absorb the chaotic scene before him, Smalls makes his way directly to a specific location amidst the debris. With a deliberate motion, he nudges some of the disorderly clutter aside with his toe, thereby revealing a piece of paper partially concealed beneath. He leans down to pick it up, but as he stands, he suddenly freezes with a soft grunt of surprise. The paper in his hand is Gale's picture of the Farmers and Mechanics Bank, glaring under the harsh noonday sun. Meanwhile, sitting in the front seat of their idling car, poised and alert, Gale and Evelle exchange a knowing glance at each other.

Gale, visibly shocked, tosses a sack to Evelle while casting a startled look at the tellers' counter. A muffled voice is heard from offscreen, momentarily catching Evelle off guard, but then he regains his senses as Gale processes the situation with newfound understanding.

This growing cacophony is suddenly and sharply silenced by the sound of a definitive click. At that exact moment, the front door handle makes an audible click, opening smoothly to reveal Smalls standing with determination in the doorway of the old, long-abandoned trailer. The interior of the trailer is now shrouded in an eerie and unsettling silence, adding to the atmosphere of desolation. Inside, the room is left in complete disarray, bearing the remnants of a fierce and chaotic struggle, while delicate streams of sunlight filter through the narrow slats of the venetian blinds, casting soft patterns on the floor. Smoke, spiraling upward from Lenny Smalls' cheroot, elegantly weaves through the beam of light, creating a mesmerizing effect. After pausing briefly at the threshold to fully absorb the chaotic and disordered scene before him, Smalls moves purposefully to a specific spot amidst the clutter. With a deliberate and precise motion, he uses his toe to nudge aside some of the disorderly clutter, thereby revealing a piece of paper that had been partially concealed beneath the debris. He bends down to pick it up, but as he stands up again, he suddenly freezes in place, emitting a soft grunt of surprise. The paper he now holds in his hand is none other than Gale's picture of the Farmers and Mechanics Bank, which is glaringly illuminated under the harsh noonday sun. Meanwhile, sitting in the front seat of their idling car, vigilant and alert, Gale and Evelle exchange a knowing and meaningful glance at each other. With a decisive action, Gale reaches for his door, and simultaneously, both Gale and Evelle burst energetically out through the car door. Evelle is holding a shotgun at the ready, while Gale clutches his own shotgun in one hand and Nathan Jr. securely in his car seat with the other. All of the individuals within freeze instantly, their eyes fixated on Gale and Evelle.

Meanwhile, smoke from Lenny Smalls' cheroot gently rises and ripples through the beams of light.

The moment is frozen, as everyone stares at Gale and Evelle. An old hayseed, raising his hands in the air, speaks up, prompting a murmur of acknowledgment from all the people sprawled on the ground. Gale hurriedly tosses a sack to Evelle and stares in shock at the tellers' counter, just as a muffled voice is heard from offscreen. Evelle, briefly abashed, quickly brightens as Gale registers understanding, eliciting another murmur of acknowledgment from the grounded crowd. The camera remains fixed on the roof of the speeding squad car, looking past its flashing gumballs as it races toward the townlet, its siren wailing a piercing cry. A teller is seen completing the task of stuffing the last of two burlap bags; we focus closely on her hands as she inconspicuously slips a cash packet into the bagâ€”a packet concealing a small plastic device wrapped with just a few bills and a sleeve. She discreetly taps a button on the device, setting it ticking before shoving it into the sack.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby cafÃ©, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Amid murmurs, a teller discreetly hides a ticking device within a cash packet. Gale and Evelle grab the sacks and baby, escaping as the sirens blare. Driving away, they realize something's wrong, but before they can react, a loud pop erupts, covering their car's interior in blue paint."
