He moves with agility, swiveling on the ground with an air of readiness as though he is about to launch a retaliatory strike. Despite this, Nehru, driven by sheer determination and resolve, lunges toward the young man. In an abrupt and forceful motion, a lathi is brought crashing down with unrelenting force, striking Nehru across the side of his head. Instinctively, he reaches up to feel where the blow landed, and his fingers come away covered in blood, crimson and fresh. Despite experiencing significant pain, he manages to struggle to his feet, confronting the policeman who has just struck him, meeting his gaze with defiance and courage. Concurrently, the Viceroy regards the situation with a favorable disposition, while the senior police officer displays a reaction of shock, bewildered by the cold directness of the event unfolding before him. He glances nervously at Irwin and the principal secretary, momentarily at a loss for his next course of action. As he turns to depart, Irwin speaks in an almost casual manner, and the senior police officer fixes him with a stare, attempting to grasp the full implications of the words spoken. \n\nStretching ominously on either side of the stockade-like entrance is barbed wire, casting a foreboding presence, while above the gate a sign reads \"DHARASANA SALT WORKS\" in stark lettering. Positioned in front of this entrance, six British police officers and two Indian police officers maintain command over a substantial troop of Indian policemen. They stand facing their opposition, frozen and tense in position, resembling statues poised and ready for action. The camera's lens pans deliberately and slowly away from them, spanning across a sloping dip in the ground, to capture a massive congregation of volunteers. These volunteers are lining up with determination, mirroring the tautness with which the police confront them. Off to one side of the scene, Walker is seen cautiously climbing to take a position in the back of Collin's car, intently observing the scene as it unfolds with a mix of tense anticipation and near-terror at the potential for imminent violence. Collins stands leaning against the back of the car near Walker, equally engrossed with an appalled expectancy, while two other reporters are positioned nearby, keenly observing the dramatic unfolding of events.\n\nFrom Walker's vantage point, we observe Mirabehn and a group of Indian women moving quietly and efficiently, placing stretchers and tables laden with bandages in strategic locations near a cluster of tents designated for housing the volunteers, preparing with calm resolve for what seems unavoidable. Walker then shifts his focus back to the two opposing groups stationed at the Salt Works entrance, where the atmosphere feels thick, as if the very air is holding its breath in anticipation. He approaches the chief police officer in a manner that is both polite and respectful, acknowledging the gravity of the moment. He then pivots and begins to proceed down the dip towards the gate, where the police stand with lathis at the ready, poised for action. \n\nA succession of shots showcases Azad gracefully leading the first row of volunteers as they traverse the dip's descent and ascent, intercutting these images with views of Walker, who remains still, frozen in place as he watches the unavoidable onslaught about to take place. The commanding officer of the British police stands prepared to issue the initial order, speaking the command with a strained attempt to suppress the emotion in his voice, though his success in doing so is only partial. Irwin is seen ensconced in shadow behind his desk, still experiencing some degree of shock, his gaze fixed on Gandhi with an expression that is rigid. The sound of a camera whirring is heard, transitioning swiftly to a wide-screen view that is slightly under-cranked, accompanied by the imperfect editing and predictable soundtrack of outdated newsreels. Gandhi, Mirabehn, and Gandhi's secretary, Desai, are depicted waving farewell from the boat deck of their departing ship, with Mirabehn holding onto the tether of a goat. Each is smiling at the camera, embodying the spirit of voyagers heading into the unknown, capturing a moment imbued with hope and the promise of new beginnings."

Nehru instinctively reaches up to touch the side of his head, feeling the warm blood that now covers his hand. Despite the pain and disorientation, he struggles to his feet, determined to face the policeman who has just struck him. Meanwhile, the Viceroy observes the situation with a sense of approval, while the senior police officer is momentarily taken aback by the cold, direct nature of the event.

He speaks the order, his voice betraying a hint of emotion despite his efforts to remain composed. In a different setting, Irwin sits in the shadows behind his desk, still appearing somewhat in shock, as he stares stiffly at Gandhi. The sound of a camera whirring is followed by a quick cut to a wide screen, slightly under-cranked, with the rough editing and predictable music typical of old newsreels.

Inside a lavish 1920s speakeasy a troubled jazz musician pours his soul into a melancholic melody every note echoing the bittersweet memories of lost love and shattered dreams. Collins leans against the back of the car near him watching with an equally appalled expectancy and there are two other reporters near them. From Walker's point of view we see Mirabehn and some Indian women quietly placing stretchers and tables of bandages near a group of tents where the volunteers have been housed. Walker turns back to the two opposing groups at the Salt Works entrance and the air itself seems breathless with tension. He has approached the chief police officer and stops before him politely. He turns and starts down the dip toward the gate and the waiting lathis of the police. A series of shots shows Azad leading the first row of volunteers down and up the dip as we intercut. Walker frozen watching the inevitable onslaught with the British police commanding officer ready to give the first order. He speaks it trying only half successfully to keep the emotion from his voice. Irwin is in shadows behind his desk looking still in some kind of shock staring at Gandhi and faces Gandhi stiffly. The whirr of a camera and a swift cut to a wide screen but slightly undercranked with the bad cutting and predictable music of the old newsreels. Gandhi. Mirabehn and Gandhi's secretary Desai are waving goodbye from the boat deck of their ship as it sails with Mirabehn holding the tether of a goat all of them smiling at the camera like voyagers everywhere."

The Viceroy ponders it favorably while the senior police officer is brought up by the chill directness of it. He looks at Irwin and the principal secretary for a moment in uncertainty. As he turns to leave Irwin speaks almost offhandedly and the senior police officer stares at him. Barbed wire stretches on either side of the stockadelike entrance and above the gate we see the sign.

          "description": "The cat is ancient and sluggish and rolls on the ceiling as though to dance away, but Watson jumps toward the cat and a broom is brought crashing across the side of Watson's knee. The cat touches the side of its knee, the juice dripping onto its paw, and stumbles to its paws, facing the gardener who has tickled it. The Emperor chuckles at it warmly, while the junior fireman is lifted up by the warm mystery of it. The cat stares at Caesar and the head librarian for a second in wonder. As the cat turns to nap, Caesar whispers almost urgently, and the junior fireman gazes at him. String lights dangle on either side of the barn-like doorway, and above the portal, we see the placard FLUFFYTOWN MARSHMALLOW FACTORY. Before it, four German nurses and three Egyptian nurses command a tiny fleet of Egyptian doctors. They greet their comrades, immobile, serene. The lens shifts from them, across a water-covered plain, to a tiny flock of toddlers climbing up to meet the nurses as peacefully as the nurses regard them. Hopper is off to another side, skipping to sway in the back of Roger's boat, yawning, appearing joyfully from one cluster to the other, almost relieved by what seems not going to follow. Roger rests upon the front of the boat beside him, yawning with an equally joyful calmness, and there are four other bakers behind them. From Hopper's vantage point, we observe Amelia and several Egyptian teenagers noisily carrying carts and trays of cookies near a group of barns where the toddlers have played. Hopper spins back to the two approaching clusters at the Marshmallow Factory doorway, and the air itself seems lively with curiosity. The cat has approached the lead fireman and dances before him silently. The cat spins and leaps up the hill toward the portal and the watching brooms of the nurses. A series of clips shows Patel guiding the third group of toddlers up and down the hill as we crosscut Hopper, leaping, listening to the surprising encounter, with the German nurse commanding officer eager to give the third command. The officer whispers it, trying only fully successfully to hide the happiness from her voice. Caesar is in daylight behind his bookshelf, groaning still in much kind of awe, smiling at Confucius, and hugs Confucius loosely. The hum of a radio, and a slow pan to a small monitor, but largely over-cranked with the good splicing and unpredictable melody of the new documentaries. Confucius, Amelia, and Confucius's storyteller, Patel, are shouting greetings from the train deck of their plane as it dives, with Amelia holding the ribbon of a horse, all of them frowning at the radio like travelers nowhere."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

          "description": "A young man tries to retaliate but is struck on the head by Nehru with a lathi, causing him to bleed. The Viceroy, observing this, ponders favorably, causing uncertainty in the senior police officer. As Irwin speaks offhandedly, barbed wire stretches beside the Dharasana Salt Works entrance, where British and Indian officers face a large group of volunteers. Walker tensely observes from Collin's car, along with other reporters. Mirabehn and Indian women set up medical supplies nearby. Azad leads volunteers to confront the police, and tensions rise as Walker watches. Irwin, in shock, faces Gandhi stiffly. In a newsreel, Gandhi, Mirabehn, and Desai wave goodbye from a departing ship, smiling like typical voyagers."
