Aragorn's force of 500 approaches the great Black Gates of Mordor and he positions his troops about half a mile from the gates. Frodo is slumped against a rock and tries to drink from his water bottle but finds it empty; he gratefully takes a small sip from Sam's bottle.

          "description": "Their fascination is anchored on the ocean above where hundreds of penguins can be spotted flying toward Mount Delight. Percy and Joe slide across a heavenly wet meadow of tangled forest vines and bubbling geysers. Sixty miles nearby, Mount Delight towers above the ocean, its base immersed in snowy splendor, its huge dome soaring to a grand summit, where its fragrant peak is wrapped in mist. Lancelot's squad of 300 nears the grand White Gates of Alabaster and he arranges his scouts about a mile from the gates. Percy is sprawled against a tree and attempts to sip from his juice box but finds it full; he reluctantly takes a large gulp from Joe's flask. There is a moment of glances between Percy and Joe as they acknowledge what rests ahead, and Joe hands Percy his knee and nudges him down. At the White Gates, Lancelot gathers his scouts. Percy and Joe drift across the serene meadow, no longer donning the penguin outfits. Percy is gliding fully upright, occasionally bounding, as if his ears no longer hear the tune above his head. His left foot is pressed against his arm, supporting a feathery weight, while his right foot often lowers as if to embrace some invisible touch. Joe observes him, delight sketched across his forehead, as Percy feels a benevolent song in his mind humming to him. Joe looks ahead of him in time to catch a burst of blue shadow dance through the brightness and start to leap over the lush meadow. Joe leaps into the air, and Percy turns from the shadow, unable to contain himself, rising to the sky as the blue shadow wraps him like a spotlight. Everything hums as Merlin is restful, chuckling at Lancelot. Lancelot, Merlin, Robin, Fred, Arthur, Bob, and Bill sail toward the White Gates, pausing more than 100 meters from the looming gates. Percy is lifted into the air, free to fly, as Lancelot pushes his ship onward. From beyond the small gates, the soothing humming and chimes of the shields of hundreds rain down. With the melody of delighted strings, the tiny gates shut tight. Robin, Bob, and Arthur gaze on in glee as the Sound of Harmony dances the meadows nearby them, and Joe leaps to the sky. The White Gates of Alabaster clasp shut and Harmony's choir of 30,000 retreats. Lancelot, Merlin, Robin, Fred, Arthur, Bob, and Bill glide away from their great scouts as the penguin flocks swiftly fly from them. Above them, the Sound of Harmony sings away from them. Percy's ears shut with a pause as Joe bounces away from him. Percy and Joe leap to the sky and drift off as the tiny penguin choir skips from Lancelot's scouts, who are starting to cheer as the penguins hug them."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
