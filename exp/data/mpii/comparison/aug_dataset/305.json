Vic rises from his seat and embraces Eddie, who nods his head up and down, while Mr. Blonde serenely lowers himself. Nice Guy Eddie is steering to the meeting, chatting on his portable car phone. Mr. White, Mr. Pink, and Mr. Blonde encircle a cop and continue to strike him. The three men are rumpled, hair disarrayed, and shirttails out, as they have the cop secured to a chair and persist in thumping him. Eddie steps inside the storage, and when Nice Guy Eddie strides in, everybody leaps. Nice Guy notices Mr. Orange, and Mr. White traverses to Mr. Blonde. Eddie, Mr. White, and Mr. Pink depart the storage, conversing amongst themselves. Mr. Blonde then gradually swivels his head toward the cop, ambles toward him, and smacks his visage. He places a strip of tape over the cop's mouth as the cop thrashes around frantically. Freddy completes feigning to be insensible, strides past the sheriffs to the basin, and gazes down to observe Freddy cleansing his hands. Mr. Blonde strides away from the cop, unfolds a razor, switches on the radio, and croons along with Stealer's Wheel. He peers into the cop’s visage, grasping the razor and crooning along, before striking out like a cobra with a gash across the visage, then severs the cop’s ear and hoists it for him to see. Mr. Blonde strides out of the storage, opens the trunk, and extracts a sizable can of gasoline. He returns within, drenches gasoline all over the cop, who pleads him not to, and ignites a match. Mr. Orange, who was wounded, gazes at the kid's gaping face and the cavity where his ear utilized to be, as Marvin commences to sob. We observe Mr. Orange, recognized as Freddy Newendyke, sporting a high school letterman jacket, enter a café, notice Holdaway, and head his path, sliding into the booth with him. Holdaway attends to Freddy, gazes at him for a moment, then grins. Freddy paces back and forth, practicing an anecdote, perusing from the page and occasionally stumbling over his words."

With a sense of purpose, Joe walks around the perimeter of his desk, returning to his chair with deliberate movements. Meanwhile, Vic rises from his own seat, approaching Eddie to warmly embrace him. Eddie, in turn, acknowledges this gesture by nodding his head rhythmically up and down, a silent exchange of camaraderie, as Mr. Blonde, appearing composed and relaxed, sits down again with an air of ease. \n\nNice Guy Eddie is in motion, on his way to the agreed meeting point, speaking animatedly on his portable car phone, handling multitasking with practiced ease. Inside the warehouse, Mr. White, Mr. Pink, and Mr. Blonde focus their attention on a police officer whom they have surrounded. They proceed to subject him to a brutal beating.

He maneuvers past the sheriffs to arrive at the sink, where he stands, looking downward, watching the water flow over his hands as he washes them, blotting out the scene with routine actions.\n\nMr. Blonde, maintaining his air of menace, steps away from the cop, brandishing a razor he has just opened. He switches on the radio, allowing the music of Stealer’s Wheel to fill the space, singing along nonchalantly.

Joe then makes his way around the desk, each step deliberate before settling into his chair, feeling the familiar contours against his back. Meanwhile, Vic stands from his seat, extending his arms to envelop Eddie in a warm hug, during which Eddie responds with an enthusiastic nodding of his head up and down. As this unfolds, Mr. Blonde remains seated, exhibiting a composed demeanor. Nice Guy Eddie maneuvers the car to the rendezvous point, maintaining a conversation via his portable car phone, his attention split between the road and the conversation. In the warehouse, Mr. White, Mr. Pink, and Mr. Blonde have a cop restrained to a chair and collectively decide to beat him; their disheveled appearances tell of previous chaos, with unkempt hair and shirttails hanging out as indicators of their disarray. Eddie makes his entrance into the warehouse, and the moment Nice Guy Eddie steps inside, the atmosphere shifts as everyone inside reacts with a jump. Upon spotting Mr. Orange, Nice Guy Eddie’s attention shifts while Mr. White makes his way over to Mr. Blonde. Following this, Eddie, Mr. White, and Mr. Pink exit the warehouse, engaged in a conversation amongst themselves. After their exit, Mr. Blonde turns his head gradually toward the cop, approaches with intentional strides, and delivers a sharp slap to his face. He then proceeds to place a piece of tape securely over the cop's mouth, subduing his frantic movements. In another scene, Freddy finishes his act of feigned unconsciousness and proceeds past uniformed sheriffs towards the sink, where he takes a moment to observe himself washing his hands, the sensation of water and soap against his skin grounding him. Mr. Blonde shifts his focus away from the cop, methodically opens a razor, and flicks on the radio. He begins to sing along with Stealer's Wheel, letting the music accompany his menacing gaze into the cop’s face before unleashing a sudden, precise slash across it with the razor; he subsequently severs the cop’s ear and holds it up to ensure the cop sees his mutilation. Exiting the warehouse once again, Mr. Blonde opens the trunk to retrieve a large gasoline can, feeling its weight in his grip as he re-enters the building. He douses the cop with gasoline, despite the cop's desperate pleas, and ultimately strikes a match to ignite it. Mr. Orange, wounded and bleeding, takes in the sight of the kid's ravaged face and the vacant spot where his ear once was, while Marvin begins to sob. The narrative shifts to show Mr. Orange, known outside this situation as Freddy Newendyke, wearing a high school letterman jacket and entering a coffee shop. He scans the room, finds Holdaway, and makes his way over to slide into a booth across from him. Holdaway attentively listens to Freddy, taking a moment to absorb what he hears before breaking into a smile. Freddy, in preparation, paces back and forth, internally reciting an anecdote, occasionally stumbling over his words as he reads from the page, rehearsing with an earnest determination."

Joe walks back around to his desk, part of a mismatched set of second-hand furniture in the office, and sits in his chair. Vic, feeling the warmth from the Remy, gets out of his seat and hugs Eddie, who bobs his head up and down to the rhythm of an unseen beat echoing in his mind, while Mr. Blonde calmly sits down, his demeanor as cold and calculating as ever. Nice Guy Eddie is driving to the rendezvous, navigating the busy Los Angeles streets with ease, while talking on his portable car phone, a clunky device symbolizing his status and constant need for communication. Mr. White, Mr. Pink, and Mr. Blonde surround a cop, whom they have kidnapped following a heist gone wrong, and proceed to beat him. The three men are disheveled, hair a mess from their earlier scuffle, and shirttails out, reflecting the chaos of their failed heist, as they have the cop tied to a chair and continue wailing on him. Eddie steps inside the warehouse, a space cluttered with evidence of their crimes, and when Nice Guy Eddie walks in, carrying an air of authority, everybody jumps. Nice Guy sees Mr. Orange, lying in a pool of his blood, and Mr. White, ever loyal to his partners, crosses to Mr. Blonde. Eddie, Mr. White, and Mr. Pink walk out of the warehouse, talking amongst themselves about their next move in the criminal underworld. Mr. Blonde then slowly turns his head towards the cop, walks toward him, and slaps his face, relishing in the control he has over the helpless man. He puts a piece of tape over the cop's mouth, stifling any cries for help as the cop moves around wildly. Freddy finishes pretending to be unconscious, a skill honed from years of undercover work, walks past the sheriffs stationed outside the door as reassurance, to the sink, and looks down to watch Freddy washing his hands of metaphorical and literal blood. Mr. Blonde walks away from the cop, opens a razor, a weapon he carries for intimidation and torture, turns on the radio, and sings along with Stealer's Wheel's hit song \"Stuck in the Middle with You,\" known for its upbeat tune despite his sinister actions. He stares into the cop’s face, holding the razor and singing along, before lashing out like a cobra, evoking a predatory precision and swiftness, with a slash across the face, then cuts off the cop’s ear and holds it up for him to see, a grotesque trophy of his dominance. Mr. Blonde walks out of the warehouse, opens the trunk of his car, an inconspicuous sedan parked strategically away from prying eyes, and pulls out a large can of gasoline, preparing for a fiery finale. He returns inside, pours gasoline all over the cop, who begs him not to in a voice cracked with terror, and lights a match, igniting both the room and the tension. Mr. Orange, who was shot during the botched robbery, looks at the kid's gashed face and the hole where his ear used to be, as Marvin starts to weep, overwhelmed by the brutality of his captors. We see Mr. Orange, known as Freddy Newendyke, wearing a high school letterman jacket reminiscent of simpler times, enter a coffee shop popular among law enforcement for off-duty meetings, spot Holdaway, his mentor in the force, and head his way, sliding into the booth with him. Holdaway listens to Freddy, who is visibly anxious about his undercover role, looks at him for a moment, then smiles, offering reassurance and camaraderie. Freddy paces back and forth in his modest apartment, rehearsing an anecdote about a fictional drug deal to solidify his cover story, reading from the page and sometimes stumbling over his words as he perfects the performance that could mean life or death."

During a clandestine meeting in a snowcovered mountain lodge two rival spies exchange cryptic messages hinting at an imminent global conspiracy. He puts a piece of tape over the cop's mouth as the cop moves around wildly. Freddy finishes pretending to be unconscious walks past the sheriffs to the sink and looks down to watch Freddy washing his hands. Mr Blonde walks away from the cop opens a razor turns on the radio and sings along with Stealer's Wheel. He stares into the cop’s face holding the razor and singing along before lashing out like a cobra with a slash across the face then cuts off the cop’s ear and holds it up for him to see. Mr Blonde walks out of the warehouse opens the trunk and pulls out a large can of gasoline. He returns inside pours gasoline all over the cop who begs him not to and lights a match. Mr Orange who was shot looks at the kid's gashed face and the hole where his ear used to be as Marvin starts to weep. We see Mr Orange known as Freddy Newendyke wearing a high school letterman jacket enter a coffee shop spot Holdaway and head his way sliding into the booth with him. Holdaway listens to. Freddy looks at him for a moment then smiles. Freddy paces back and forth rehearsing an anecdote reading from the page and sometimes stumbling over his words."

          "description": "Sam lounges behind the counter and gazes at Lee, who munches on some blueberries. Sam strolls back around to the counter and flops onto the couch. Lee climbs out of the hammock and high-fives Alex, who nods rhythmically, while Mr. Green leisurely reclines. Kind Fellow Alex is cycling to the carnival, chatting on his handheld radio. Mr. Brown, Mr. Gray, and Mr. Green encircle a sailor and proceed to quiz him. The trio are unkempt, hair tousled, and shoelaces undone, as they have the sailor strapped to a stool and keep grilling him. Alex strides into the barn, and when Kind Fellow Alex arrives, everyone freezes. Kind Fellow spies Mr. Lavender, and Mr. Brown ambles over to Mr. Green. Alex, Mr. Brown, and Mr. Gray wander out of the barn, chatting amongst themselves. Mr. Green then lethargically swivels his head towards the sailor, strolls up to him, and pats his shoulder. He sticks a bandage over the sailor's mouth as the sailor squirms frantically. Bobby concludes faking unconsciousness, saunters past the cowboys to the basin, and peers down to observe Bobby brushing his teeth. Mr. Green ambles away from the sailor, unfolds a fan, turns on the stereo, and hums along with The Beatles. He peers intently into the sailor's face, clutching the fan and humming along, before darting like a hummingbird with a slash across the cheek, then clips off the sailor’s nose and holds it up for him to observe. Mr. Green ambles out of the barn, unlatches the chest, and extracts a hefty crate of cookies. He reenters, scatters cookies all over the sailor, who pleads with him not to, and strikes a flint. Mr. Lavender, who was startled, glances at the dancer's painted face and the gap where his nose used to be, as Chris starts to chuckle. We witness Mr. Lavender, known as Bobby Oakridge, donning a varsity sweater, enter a bistro, notice Carter, and make his way over, sliding into the booth with him. Carter hears Bobby out, glances at him briefly, then grins. Bobby roams back and forth, practicing a riddle, consulting the map and occasionally tripping over his phrases."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Nice Guy Eddie drives to the rendezvous and converses on a car phone. In a warehouse, Mr. White, Mr. Pink, and Mr. Blonde brutally beat a cop tied to a chair. Disheveled, the trio reacts when Eddie enters the warehouse. Mr. Blonde slaps the cop and tapes his mouth shut. Freddy, pretending to be unconscious, washes his hands. Mr. Blonde menacingly sings along with the radio, slashing the cop's face with a razor and severing his ear. Mr. Blonde fetches gasoline from the car, douses the cop, and lights a match. Observing the injured cop, Mr. Orange, who is actually undercover officer Freddy Newendyke, recalls meeting with Holdaway in a coffee shop. Freddy rehearses an anecdote, occasionally stumbling over his lines."
