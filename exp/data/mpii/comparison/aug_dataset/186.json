Just behind Sheriff Brackett, Sam Loomis is seen walking up the street with a steady pace, and as Loomis draws nearer, Brackett greets him with a welcoming smile. While they engage in conversation, the camera gradually circles around them, unveiling a wider view of the street in front of them as Loomis' station wagon slowly moves by in the background. Through the branches of the swaying trees, the luminous full moon begins its ascent into the night sky, casting a gentle glow. Meanwhile, Annie's car quietly travels down a serene residential street and eventually pulls up in front of a modest two-story house set a short distance back from the road: the Doyle house. From the front seat of the station wagon, we are able to watch as Laurie emerges from Annie's car, bids her farewell with a wave, and walks confidently towards the entrance of the Doyle house. Subsequently, Annie's car executes a wide U-turn, beginning to head in the opposite direction, with the station wagon smoothly pulling forward to follow closely behind her. Annie soon comes to a stop three houses down the road and maneuvers her car into a garage, while the station wagon comes to a halt several feet away.

Brackett's trusty flashlight flickers on, casting a narrow beam of light on the two men as they cautiously navigate their way through the deserted rooms, with the camera closely following their every movement. Abruptly, Brackett comes to an abrupt halt and focuses his flashlight on a small, mysterious object lying ominously in the corner of the room.

Observing Loomis's approach, Brackett's face breaks into a welcoming smile. As their conversation unfolds, the camera gently encircles them, capturing the unfolding dialogue while simultaneously revealing the street in its expanse, where Loomis's station wagon is seen cruising by. The camera's gaze shifts upward beyond the rustling, wind-swept trees to capture the full moon as it ascends into the night sky, casting a gentle glow over the scene. Meanwhile, Annie's car proceeds further along a tranquil residential street, eventually coming to a halt in front of a two-story house that is set slightly back from the road: the Doyle house. From within the station wagon's front seat, the view shifts to Laurie as she steps out of Annie's car, waves a brief farewell, and makes her way up to the Doyle house. Annie's car executes a wide U-turn, beginning its journey in the opposite direction, with the station wagon pulling forward to tail her movements. Three houses later, Annie brings her car to a stop and maneuvers it into a garage, all while the station wagon halts a few feet away. Emerging quietly from the station wagon, the shape keeps close to the camera, keeping himself concealed from view as he surveys the street where gusts of wind are busily scattering the costumes of children darting from house to house. The shape begins to move again, and the camera rhythmically follows, keeping pace as he strides toward the Wallace house. He halts in front as Annie exits the garage and crosses to another two-story frame house: the Wallaces'. The front door swings open, and through the illuminated windows of the front room, Annie is seen engaging in a brief conversation with the Wallaces, who are in the process of putting on their coats. To avoid detection, the camera and the shape swiftly retreat behind a tree. As the Wallaces step outside and head toward the garage, the shape stealthily slips out from behind the tree, directing an unwavering gaze toward the house. Meanwhile, Annie and Lindsey Wallace, a charming nine-year-old girl, appear framed in the doorway by the warm glow of the hallway light. After a moment, Annie closes the door behind them. A police car soon arrives in front of the Myers house, accompanied by the background chorus of whistling wind and the rhythmic chirping of crickets. Brackett and Loomis disembark from the vehicle and position themselves by the front gate. Inside their destination, Annie switches on the television and heads over to a wall-mounted mirror, where she begins to brush her hair methodically. Outside, at the side of the house, Loomis and Brackett make their way onto the front porch. A broken, rusted rain gutter clangs persistently against the side of the house in the stirring wind as the front door eases open with a creak. Loomis and Brackett find themselves at the threshold of a pitch-black interior. Brackett's flashlight flickers on, casting a beam that outlines the two figures as they cautiously navigate the darkened house, with the camera seamlessly trailing their progress. Abruptly, Brackett halts, focusing his flashlight's beam on a small object resting in the corner of the room, pausing momentarily in silence."

Behind Brackett, the local sheriff known for his years of service in the community, Sam Loomis, who is a psychiatrist specializing in criminal behavior, walks up the street, and Brackett smiles as Loomis approaches with his usual air of determination. As they talk, the camera slowly moves around them, revealing a view of the street as Loomis' station wagon, which he has been using for his search, moves by. Through the blowing trees, a gusty autumn night feature, the full moon rises in the night sky, casting an eerie glow. Annie's car moves down a quiet residential street typical of suburbia and pulls up in front of a two-story house set back from the street: the Doyle house, known in the neighborhood for its distinctive red door. From the front seat of the station wagon, we see Laurie, a diligent student known for babysitting in the area, get out of Annie's car, say goodbye, and walk up to the Doyle house where she is expected for the evening. Annie's car then makes a wide U-turn, something she's become quite adept at, and starts down the other direction, with the station wagon pulling forward to follow her like a shadow. Annie stops three houses down and pulls into a garage that belongs to the Wallaces, while the station wagon stops several feet away, maintaining distance. The shape, a mysterious figure only known by this moniker, gets out of the station wagon, staying close to the camera, obscuring himself from view, and glances down the street as gusts of wind blow the costumes of children going house to house for Halloween. The shape moves, his intent purposefully unknown, and the camera tracks behind him as he walks toward the Wallace house, stopping in front as Annie comes out of the garage and walks to another two-story frame house: the Wallaces', known for their annual elaborate Halloween decorations. The front door opens, and through the front room windows, we see Annie talking to the Wallaces, a friendly couple often seen at community events, as they put on their coats. The camera and shape quickly move behind a tree to hide from sight. The Wallaces step out of their house and walk to the garage as the shape steps out from behind the tree and stares at the house, his motives hidden in the shadows. Annie and Lindsey Wallace, a pretty little nine-year-old who loves telling ghost stories, stand in the doorway framed by the hall light that spills warmly onto the porch. Annie closes the door. A police car pulls up in front of the Myers house, the infamous site of a past tragedy long whispered about among locals, amid the sounds of wind and chirping crickets. Brackett and Loomis get out, each with a sense of urgency, and stand by the front gate. Inside, Annie, unaware of the night's looming dangers, turns on the TV, which is tuned to a classic horror film marathon, goes to the mirror on the wall, and begins to brush her hair in preparation for a quiet evening. Looking down the side of the house, Loomis and Brackett walk up to the front porch, their task heavy upon their shoulders. A broken, rusted rain gutter, remnants of a storm long since passed, clangs back and forth against the house in the wind as the front door slowly opens. Brackett and Loomis stand in the doorway of a totally dark house, the memories of its past almost palpable. Brackett's flashlight comes on, illuminating the two men as they move through the house, with the camera tracking them through the shadows of forgotten rooms. Suddenly, Brackett stops and trains his flashlight on a small object in the corner of the room, its significance not immediately clear. For a moment, Brackett doesn't speak, as the weight of the silence thickens the air."

Bella's helicopter drifts down a bustling commercial avenue and parks in front of a three-story hotel set away from the avenue: the Parker hotel. From the rear compartment of the bicycle, we watch Tessa hop out of Bella's helicopter, wave farewell, and march toward the Parker hotel.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
