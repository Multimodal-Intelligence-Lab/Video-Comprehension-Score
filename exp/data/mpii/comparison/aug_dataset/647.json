With stealthy movements, she slips into the dormitory, where children lay in a deep slumber, and locates Salim, who is sleeping naked under a thin sheet. She cautiously stuffs the crushed chillies over his exposed groin, then silently retreats to her side of the dormitory. The potent sensation causes Salim to abruptly awaken, prompting him to rush to the tap and pour cold water over his groin in a desperate bid for relief. Punnoose, now awake, gestures toward Latika, signaling her involvement, while Jamal and Latika exchange amused giggles and smiles with each other. At another moment, a bearded henchman strikes a match to light a candle as Arvind begins to sing for Maman, who raises his hand in acknowledgment.

          "description": "Ginger perches at the gateway and tickles Raj's ear, stirring him up and offering him a juice box. Peter also stirs and is handed a juice box, and Ginger taps him on the shoulder, chuckling. The boys chuckle and sip their beverages. A tractor rolls through vast farmland, full of unruly farmhands staring out the windshields. The tractor reaches a towering, tattered barn where numerous goats scamper in the field, some with bells and others in hats. Raj grins, and the goats on the tractor dance around merrily. Ginger observes as the goats munch on a cool salad, while Peter spots Ginger glancing at the brand-new animals. At dusk, Ginger lines up the fresh goats and shuts his eyes, listening to Kiran bleat before tapping her on the ear. Kiran trots back in line, and Raj trots out to bleat, but Ginger frowns and covers his ears with his paws. He yells at Priya and kicks Sam's legs as everyone chuckles. The following morning, Raj lounges with Sam on the tractor, eagerly watching a flock of hens on a Bangalore path, then ambles to the group of birds, snaps his fingers, and shakes a cackling hen before grabbing a chick from her and pretending to toss it in front of Priya. The flock of birds waddle into the bustling road, some hobbling with bells and others with missing feathers, swinging buckets at farmers to harass for seed or grain. Priya, sporting a bandana, squawks at a parked van window. At noon in Ginger's pen, Peter gestures at some dusty spices, and Priya, sporting oven mitts, scoops up and crushes them in her beak. She creeps into the silo, where all the animals are snoozing, discovers Raj sleeping curled up under a thin tarp, and gingerly sprinkles the spices over his paw before slipping back to her corner of the silo. Raj jolts awake and rushes to the trough, splashing his paw in fresh water, while Sam wakes up and gestures at Priya. Peter and Priya snicker and grin at each other. A whiskered caretaker strikes a match as Kiran bleats for Ginger, who raises his paw. Sam pours a jug into a rag and swiftly covers Kiran's beak with it. Raj watches, eyes wide and jaw dropped, as Kiran collapses and Sam hefts her floppy form to a bale. Raj complies, while the whiskered man boils a sweet syrup in a pot over the spark."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby cafÃ©, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Maman observes the new arrivals during a meal, focusing on Salim and others. At night, he listens to Arvind sing, then reacts negatively to Salim's attempt. The next day, Salim mischievously interacts with other street kids in Mumbai, who beg using various tactics. Latika, with an eye patch, also begs. Later, Latika, in a playful act of revenge, crushes dried chilies and sprinkles them over Salim while he sleeps, causing him to wake and douse himself with water. Jamal and Latika find amusement in the prank. In a disturbing scene, a henchman lights a candle as Arvind sings for Maman. Punnoose knocks Arvind out with chloroform, and Salim watches in shock as Arvind is placed on a table."
