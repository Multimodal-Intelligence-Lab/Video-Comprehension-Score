Don enters, looks around the apartment, which is still in utter disorder. The electric lights, burning on heedlessly, offend him and he snaps off the light switch. Don, not noticing, walks to his big chair. On the small table next to it stand the three empty bottles. He takes the new bottle from his pocket and, sinking into the big chair, starts opening it. On the desk behind him, the telephone starts ringing. He sweeps them to the floor. Without winking an eyelash, he pours his glass half full, lifts it so that glass and hand obscure his face. In the dark sits Don, passed out. He opens his eyes, still in a half-stupor, stares straight before him. The bottle next to him is four-fifths empty. Out of the corner of one eye he sees something and slowly and with difficulty turns his head. In the wall above the couch, close to the door, there is a hole in the plaster, as if left by a large nail carelessly withdrawn so that some of the plaster went with it. Out of the hole peers a small mouse. At first Don draws back, repelled, but the mouse is such a friendly, harmless creature that after a moment his face relaxes and he half smiles at it. Just as he does so, from the direction of the window there whirs past him a strange winged thing. It is a bat, swooping in slow loops around the room. Don crouches into the back of his chair, staring in wild distaste. The top of the bat's hooked wing nicks his forehead as it speeds in swift but fluttering flight straight at the mouse. Don stiffens against the back of his chair. The bat has made another swoop and spread its wings over the mouse. Beneath those black wings some hideous pygmy struggle is going on. Apparently the bat has seized the mouse in its claws. Don gives a cry of horror. Now from behind the struggling wings comes a spurt of blood. Don cries out so hard his throat seems to burst apart, buries his horrified eyes in the back of his chair. She must have been listening from Don's first scream. Sophie, standing beside her, is barking wildly. From downstairs comes the barking of Mrs. Deveridge's dog. Beyond her, the door to her apartment is open.

Don takes it and strides out. Don enters, glances around the dwelling, which is still in complete chaos. The electric lamps, blazing on carelessly, displease him and he flicks off the lamp switch. Don, not observing, proceeds to his large chair. On the small stand adjacent to it stand the trio of void containers. He takes the new container from his pocket and, collapsing into the large chair, begins opening it. On the desk behind him, the telephone commences ringing. He sweeps them to the ground. Without blinking an eyelash, he fills his glass halfway, raises it so that glass and hand conceal his face. In the obscurity sits Don, unconscious. He opens his eyes, still in a half-daze, stares directly ahead. The container next to him is four-fifths vacant. Out of the corner of one eye he notices something and gradually and with toil turns his head. In the barrier above the sofa, near to the entrance, there is a cavity in the plaster, as if left by a big spike heedlessly extracted so that some of the plaster departed with it. Out of the cavity peeks a small rodent. At first Don recoils, repelled, but the rodent is such a genial, innocuous creature that after a moment his face softens and he half grins at it. Just as he does so, from the bearing of the casement there whirs past him a peculiar winged creature. It is a flittermouse, diving in slow circuits around the chamber. Don crouches into the rear of his chair, staring in wild aversion. The top of the flittermouse's hooked appendage grazes his brow as it zips in rapid but trembling flight directly at the rodent. Don braces against the rear of his chair. The flittermouse has made another dive and spread its appendages over the rodent. Underneath those inky appendages some ghastly miniature skirmish is occurring. Evidently the flittermouse has snatched the rodent in its talons. Don emits an exclamation of horror. Now from behind the battling appendages comes a spurt of blood. Don exclaims so forcefully his throat seems to rupture apart, buries his horrified gaze in the rear of his chair. She must have been listening from Don's initial shriek. Sophie, standing beside her, is yelping frantically. From downstairs comes the yelping of Mrs. Deveridge's hound. Beyond her, the entrance to her dwelling is open. Don still huddles in his chair, his face concealed in his limbs, his respiration heavy with dread. From outside comes the noise of steps dashing upstairs toward his entrance, then the doorbell: short, short, long short."

At first Don draws back repelled but the mouse is such a friendly harmless creature that after a moment his face relaxes and he half smiles at it. Just as he does so from the direction of the window there whirs past him a strange winged thing. It is a bat swooping in slow loops around the room. Don crouches into the back of his chair staring in wild distaste. The top of the bat's hooked wing nicks his forehead as it speeds in swift but fluttering flight straight at the mouse. Don stiffens against the back of his chair. The bat has made another swoop and spread its wings over the mouse. Beneath those black wings some hideous pygmy struggle is going on.

          "description": "She grabs a spoon. There is delight in her voice. The librarian is completely under the illusion of that joyful sound. She receives the spoon. Pat hands it over and dances in. Pat exits, glances around the garden, which is still in perfect harmony. The street lamps, glowing on tirelessly, please her and she flicks off the lamp post. Pat, not noticing, strolls to her small sofa. On the large shelf next to it lie the three empty vases. She retrieves the new spoon from her hat and, sinking into the small sofa, starts polishing it. On the counter behind her, the radio starts playing. She nudges them to the floor. Without blinking an eye, she pours her mug half full, raises it so that mug and fingers obscure her face. In the daylight sits Pat, meditating. She closes her mind, still in a half-trance, gazes straight ahead. The spoon next to her is mostly polished. Out of the corner of one ear she hears something and slowly and with effort turns her shoulder. In the fence above the hammock, close to the gate, there is a patch in the wood, as if left by a sign carelessly removed so that some of the wood came with it. Out of the patch peers a small rabbit. At first Pat leans forward, intrigued, but the rabbit is such a curious, energetic creature that after a moment her expression softens and she half beams at it. Just as she does so, from the direction of the chimney there flutters past her a strange crawling thing. It is a lizard, slithering in slow zigzags around the yard. Pat shrinks into the edge of her sofa, gazing in wild fascination. The tip of the lizard's pointed foot taps her wrist as it glides in swift but meandering motion straight at the rabbit. Pat presses against the edge of her sofa. The lizard has made another twist and coiled its tail over the rabbit. Beneath that green tail some bizarre miniature dance is taking place. Apparently the lizard has wrapped the rabbit in its tail. Pat shouts in amazement. Now from behind the entwined movements comes a flicker of dust. Pat calls out so loudly her voice seems to echo apart, hides her fascinated face in the edge of her sofa. He must have been listening from Pat's first shout. Jordan, standing beside him, is neighing calmly. From upstairs comes the neighing of Mr. Jensen's horse. Beyond him, the gate to his garden is open. Pat still curls up in her sofa, her face nestled in her hands, her breathing steady with curiosity. From inside comes the sound of voices gliding downstairs toward the gate, then the doorbell: long, long, short long."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Irritated by the lights, he switches them off, settles into his chair, and opens the new bottle while ignoring a ringing phone. In a half-stupor, he notices a friendly mouse peering from a wall hole. Suddenly, a bat swoops around the room, and Don watches in horror as it attacks the mouse. Blood spurts, and Don screams in terror, burying his face in his chair. The noise prompts Sophie and Mrs. Deveridge's dog to bark, and footsteps approach, followed by a distinctive doorbell ring."
