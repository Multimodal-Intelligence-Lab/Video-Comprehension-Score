A few paces away, the two children stand, drenched by the rain, watching him. On the ground between them, the pole lies. David stands and looks at them. Onto the woman's bruised and bloody wrists, liquid is splashed, and they are bound tightly by twists of wire. Looming over her, beer bottle in hand, the huge maintenance man spits a stream of liquid at her bruised face. The maintenance man is closed on by David from behind, his left arm is thrown around the man's neck by him, and his wrists are clamped with David's other hand. At the choking arm, the man tears, and David is slammed back into the bedroom wall by him. The dent in the plaster wall is left by David's back. Attempting to throw him off, the man fails, and his throat is squeezed relentlessly by David. David is jabbed viciously in the ribs with the man's elbow, lifted again by him, but the arm across his throat cannot be escaped by him. Across the room the man staggers, lifting and twisting David, still attempting to throw him off. They are reeled across the room, and David is smashed into the wall again by him. The man thrashes about, desperately pulling at the arm locked around his neck, and makes another backward rush into the wall before he falls forward onto his knees. Off balance, he rises, and David drags him back down. To the floor he sinks, and the grip is tightened by David, yanking against the man's neck. Off the inert form, David throws and falls face down, motionless, goes the maintenance man. To the woman, David crosses and quickly untwists the wire from her wrists. Her arms flop down when they are freed by him. David steps back and the woman is slumped sideways onto the floor, limp and unreacting. Over her, he stands, still in his cape, gazing down. The closet door is gently opened by David. From the shadowy light of her room, Audrey's sleeping body in a white night dress is carried by him to the foot of the stairs. Her eyes are opened in the brighter light of the hall by her, and as up the staircase she is carried by David, her head is lifted. Watching him, with a smile very faint, her long, fair hair falls back from her white forehead, and the light makes a silver line of her profile, emphasizing her aquiline features, as steadily up at him she stares. Along the landing and into the bedroom, she is carried by him, where softly on the bed she is laid by him."

On his third attempt, he reaches out determinedly and finally manages to grasp it securely in his hand. Above him, bright lights illuminate the surface of the pool, shining down intensely. With effort, David struggles to the surface of the water, desperately clinging to the pole for support. As he reaches the pool's edge, he releases his grip on the pole and uses his free hand to claw his fingers over the edge, trying to find a hold. The pole, now unsupported, slides away from him as David clings grimly to the pool's edge for a brief, tense moment. Summoning his strength, he hauls himself out of the water and begins the laborious task of crawling painfully and slowly away from the edge, each movement a struggle. Nearby, two children stand a few paces away from him, their clothes soaked from the rain as they silently watch his progress. The pole now lies on the ground, positioned between the children. Rising to his feet, David stands and takes a moment to look at the children, acknowledging their presence. Meanwhile, liquid splashes onto the woman's wrists, which are bruised and bloody, tightly bound by twists of wire. The large maintenance man looms over her menacingly, a beer bottle in hand. He spits a stream of liquid at her bruised face, adding further to her discomfort. David approaches the man stealthily from behind and swiftly throws his left arm around the man's neck, using his other hand to clamp down on his own wrist, securing the chokehold. The man reacts with panic, clawing at the constricting arm around his neck and violently slamming David backward into the bedroom wall. The impact is forceful enough to leave a noticeable dent in the plaster. Despite this, David maintains his relentless grip on the man's throat. The man retaliates by jabbing David viciously in the ribs with his elbow and attempts to lift him again in a bid to escape the hold, but David's arm remains firmly in place around his throat. The man staggers across the room, lifting and twisting David as he tries desperately to dislodge him. Their struggle continues as they reel across the room, and the man smashes David into the wall again with force. He thrashes about wildly, pulling with all his might at the arm locked around his neck, and makes another backward rush into the wall in a final attempt to break free. Exhausted and overpowered, he falls forward onto his knees, trying to recover his balance. David seizes the opportunity to drag him back down to the floor, tightening his grip and yanking against the man's neck with increased pressure. Overwhelmed, the man sinks to the floor, and David finally releases the now inert form, allowing the maintenance man to fall face down, motionless and defeated. With urgency, David crosses to the woman and quickly works to untwist the wire binding her wrists, freeing her from her restraints. Once free, her arms fall limply downward, her body showing signs of exhaustion. David steps back and watches as the woman slumps sideways onto the floor, her body limp and unreacting. Taking a moment, he stands over her, still donning his cape, and gazes down at her with contemplation. Gently, David opens a nearby closet door. Within the shadowy light of the room, Audrey's sleeping body, dressed in a white nightdress, is visible. Carefully, David carries her from the dim confines of the room out into the brighter light of the hall. As they emerge into the light, Audrey opens her eyes and raises her head while David carries her up the staircase. She regards him with a faint smile, her long, fair hair cascading back from her white forehead as the light outlines her profile with a silver gleam, emphasizing her aquiline features. Her gaze remains fixed steadily on him as he carries her along the landing and into the bedroom. With care, he lays her softly onto the bed, ensuring her comfort and safety."

He lets go of it to claw his fingers over the textured pool edge, providing a better grip for safety. The pole slides away into the water, and David hangs on grimly for a moment before hauling himself out of the water with the effort of someone exhausted from a long struggle and crawling painfully slowly away from it. The two children, who had been playing nearby before the rainstorm started, are standing a few paces away, drenched by the rain, watching him. The pole is lying on the ground between them, having been tossed aside in the struggle. David stands and looks at them, their curious eyes on him. Liquid splashes onto the woman's bruised and bloody wrists, which are tightly bound by twists of industrial wire, often used in construction for binding steel rods. Looming over her, beer bottle in hand, the huge maintenance man, known to locals for his intimidating presence, spits a stream of liquid at her bruised face, further degrading her. David closes on him from behind, throws his left arm around the man's thick neck, and clamps his wrists with his other hand. The man tears at the choking arm, and slams David back into the bedroom wall, creating a dent in the plaster wall, a clear sign of the ongoing struggle.

He rises off balance and David drags him back down, using techniques learned from self-defense classes. He sinks to the floor and David tightens his grip, yanking against the man's neck. David throws off the inert form and the maintenance man falls face down, motionless, an eerie silence following the commotion. David crosses to the woman and quickly untwists the wire from her wrists with careful hands. When they are free, her arms flop down, completely drained of strength. David steps back and the woman slumps sideways onto the floor, limp and unreacting, likely in shock from her ordeal. He stands over her, still in his rain-soaked cape, gazing down at her with concern. David gently opens a closet door, revealing a small hidden space.

          "description": "Jeremy reaches for it, misses it, spots it once more, and at the fourth try, snatches it. Beneath the tree, dim lanterns illuminate the river. Jeremy struggles to the shore, gripping the tree, releases it to drag his fingers over the riverbank. The tree rolls away, and Jeremy clings desperately for a while before pulling himself out of the stream and stumbling painfully away from it. The three dogs are sitting a few steps away, soaked by the fountain, observing him. The tree rests on the sand near them. Jeremy rises and gazes at them. Oil drips onto the child's scratched and scarred ankles, tied loosely by loops of rope. Hovering over her, soda can in hand, the tiny gardener sprays a mist of oil at her scratched knees. Jeremy approaches him from the front, wraps his right leg around the gardener's waist, and grips his elbows with his other leg. The gardener tugs at the strangling leg, and bangs Jeremy forward into the study door. Jeremy’s chest leaves a crack in the wooden door. The gardener attempts to shake him off, but Jeremy tightens his grip fiercely. The gardener nudges him gently in the shin with his knee, raises him up once more, but can't break free of the leg around his waist. He stumbles across the garden, hauling and turning Jeremy, still attempting to shake him off. They lurch across the garden and he crashes Jeremy into the door again. He flails around, tugging frantically at the leg locked around his waist, and makes another forward charge into the door before dropping sideways onto his elbows. He rises unsteadily and Jeremy pulls him back down. He collapses to the grass and Jeremy strengthens his hold yanking against the gardener's waist. Jeremy pushes away the lifeless form and the gardener falls sideways, unmoving. Jeremy strides to the child and swiftly unloops the rope from her ankles. When they are untied, her legs droop down. Jeremy retreats and the child topples backward onto the ground, limp and unresponding. He stands over her, still in his robe, staring down at her. Jeremy quietly closes a window shutter. Marissa's resting figure in a blue night shirt is carried from the dim glow of her chamber to the base of the ladder. She opens her eyes in the brighter glow of the hallway, and raises her gaze as Jeremy carries her down the staircase. She observes him, grinning slightly, her long, dark hair cascading back from her pink forehead, and the glow outlining her profile, highlighting her rounded features, as she gazes intently down at him. He transports her along the corridor and into the patio, where he places her softly on the swing."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

          "description": "David manages to grab a pole and surfaces from a pool, dragging himself out. Two children watch him, drenched by rain. Nearby, a woman’s wrists are bound with wire, and a maintenance man menaces her with a bottle. David stealthily approaches and subdues the man by gripping his neck, despite being slammed into a wall repeatedly. David eventually overpowers the man, who collapses motionless. He frees the woman, who falls limp to the floor, and stands over her, observing in silence. David finds Audrey asleep, carries her gently upstairs, and lays her on a bed. Audrey wakes, offering a faint smile as she observes David, her features softly illuminated."
