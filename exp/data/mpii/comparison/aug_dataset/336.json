SMEAGOL moves towards DEAGOL, and then jumps on him, strangling him and ripping the glittering ring from DEAGOL's limp hand. SMEAGOL slips the ring onto his finger, descending into madness as his body twists and distorts, becoming a creepy, shriveled wretch, and finally crawling into a dark cave beneath the Misty Mountains. A grim landscape, covered in thorn bushes and the scars of recent fires, surrounds the dark Morgul Valley as it disappears up towards the mountains. FRODO and SAM are in a filthy culvert; SAM twitches in a restless sleep, but FRODO is awake, his hand trailing down to the chain around his neck. A sudden hiss startles FRODO, who quickly hides the ring as GOLLUM peers at them with gleaming eyes. SAM stirs, looks at FRODO, who shakes his head. SAM then looks at the dead, brown twilight. The days are growing darker when the ground suddenly quivers, and a rolling, rumbling noise echoes down the valley. SAM shoots GOLLUM a hostile look and turns back to rummage in his knapsack, holding up a piece of dried lembas bread to FRODO. FRODO looks at SAM questioningly. FRODO and SAM follow GOLLUM, clambering through bracken and over jagged rocks, as he leads them on a winding, torturous path. Meanwhile, GANDALF leads ARAGORN, LEGOLAS, THEODEN, and GIMLI through dark woodland as the moving forest of Fangorn opens before them, creating an avenue of trees that allows access along the old Isengard road. A thick, humid mist fills the forest, and as the forest separates ahead, the ruins of the great stone wall, cracked and splintered into countless jagged shards, are revealed. Far off, half veiled in swirling steam, stands the tower of Orthanc, unbroken by the storm, with pale waters lapping about its feet. Two small hobbits, MERRY and PIPPIN, sit on the smashed wall with a feast of breads, meats, and wine spread before them. They puff on long pipes as they lie back in the sun. MERRY cuts PIPPIN off before he can respond, as GANDALF, ARAGORN, LEGOLAS, and GIMLI stare at the sight before them. GANDALF leads the company through the flotsam and jetsam floating upon the muddied waters surrounding the tower. TREEBEARD, the giant ENT, strides towards them, alarming all but GANDALF, who stares up the long length of the dark tower as the old ENT nods his head wisely.

However, to his complete surprise, he is unexpectedly yanked overboard and vanishes beneath the surface of the water with a sudden and dramatic splash. Meanwhile, at the same time, SMEAGOL is leaning over the side of the small boat, peering intently into the depths below. DEAGOL manages to glance back at him, a smirk teasingly appearing on his lips.

          "description": "As DEAGOL stands at the edge of the boat, he grips his fishing rod tightly, feeling a sudden, powerful tug that pulls him overboard with a splash into the deep water, causing him to disappear beneath the surface as bubbles rise rapidly. Meanwhile, SMEAGOL leans precariously over the edge of the boat, eyes searching the water for any sign of DEAGOL. Below, DEAGOL turns underwater, locking eyes with SMEAGOL, a smirk playing on his lips despite the circumstances. With sudden determination, SMEAGOL inches towards where DEAGOL has surfaced. He pounces with a ferocity born of desperation, landing on DEAGOL and wrapping his hands around DEAGOL's throat, his grip tightening as he strangles him. SMEAGOL's fingers claw at DEAGOL's hand, and he pries the glittering ring from DEAGOL’s now limp fingers. Securing his prize, SMEAGOL slips the ring onto his finger, a sinister transformation overtaking him as the madness seeps into his mind, contorting his body grotesquely. His former self disintegrates into the eerie, shriveled figure now known as GOLLUM, who crawls away from his old life, seeking refuge in the dark, ominous cave beneath the looming Misty Mountains. In the grim landscape overhead, thorn bushes stretch hostilely across the terrain, the ground still scarred by recent fires, while the Morgul Valley meanders off towards the menacing peaks of the mountains. In a filthy culvert nearby, FRODO, wide-eyed and alert, lies quietly as his fingers brush against the chain around his neck, holding the precious ring hidden beneath his clothing. Next to him, SAM twitches sporadically, lost in a restless sleep, unaware of the brewing tension. A sudden, sharp hiss pierces the air, causing FRODO to instinctively tuck the ring away just as GOLLUM's gleaming eyes emerge from the shadows, scrutinizing them with eerie intensity. SAM stirs from his uneasy slumber, glancing first at FRODO, who offers a subtle shake of his head to communicate silence. Confusion shifts SAM's gaze to the desolate, deadened twilight around them, as the realization sets in that the days are becoming darker and more perilous. The ground unexpectedly starts to tremble beneath them, accompanied by a deep, rolling rumble that reverberates through the valley. SAM shoots GOLLUM a hostile, mistrustful look before turning his attention back to his knapsack, rummaging through its contents until he retrieves a piece of dried lembas bread, extending it towards FRODO in a gesture of sustenance and solidarity. With a look of mutual understanding, FRODO and SAM begin to follow in GOLLUM's lead, clambering over the treacherous terrain of bracken and jagged rocks as GOLLUM guides them on a convoluted, arduous path through the wilderness. Elsewhere, GANDALF, with an air of determined leadership, leads ARAGORN, LEGOLAS, THEODEN, and GIMLI through the dense, foreboding woodland of Fangorn. As they march, the forest seems to part before them, forming an avenue of towering trees that provide a guided route along the old, worn path of the Isengard road. A thick, oppressive mist clings to the forest air, swirling around them as the trees give way to reveal the shattered remnants of a once-mighty stone wall, now reduced to countless jagged shards from the storm's wrath. In the distance, the dark silhouette of the tower of Orthanc stands defiant, unyielding to the storm, its base lapped by pale, murky waters. Two small hobbits, MERRY and PIPPIN, find a moment of brief reprieve and indulgence atop the shattered wall, a spread of breads, meats, and wine laid out before them as they recline under the warm rays of the sun, puffing contentedly on long pipes. MERRY is quick to interject, cutting off PIPPIN's words before he can respond, diverting their attention back to the view as GANDALF, ARAGORN, LEGOLAS, and GIMLI take in the extraordinary sight before them. GANDALF leads their small assembly through the debris and remains floating in the muddied waters at the tower's base, making their way through the aftermath. TREEBEARD, the mighty ENT, strides purposefully towards the group, his imposing presence causing alarm among them all except for GANDALF, who holds his ground, looking up respectfully at the ENT, recognizing his ancient wisdom. As TREEBEARD nods his head with solemn understanding, PIPPIN's attention is captured by a mesmerizing, golden light emanating from within the muddy waters. With instinctive swiftness, PIPPIN dismounts his horse, moving quickly to the source of the light and before ARAGORN's warning voice can reach him, he has already laid claim to the Palantír, clasping it tightly in his hands."

A sudden hiss startles FRODO, who quickly hides the ring as GOLLUM, the twisted creature once known as Smeagol, peers at them with gleaming eyes. SAM stirs, looks at FRODO, who shakes his head. SAM then looks at the dead, brown twilight that marks the decay spreading from Mordor. The days are growing darker when the ground suddenly quivers, and a rolling, rumbling noise echoes down the valley, heralding the approach of Sauron's forces.

FRODO and SAM follow GOLLUM, clambering through bracken and over jagged rocks, as he leads them on a winding, torturous path through the perilous lands of Middle-earth. Meanwhile, GANDALF leads ARAGORN, heir to the throne of Gondor, LEGOLAS, THEODEN, king of Rohan, and GIMLI through dark woodland as the moving forest of Fangorn, ancient and sentient, opens before them, creating an avenue of trees that allows access along the old Isengard road. A thick, humid mist fills the forest, and as the forest separates ahead, the ruins of the great stone wall of Isengard, cracked and splintered into countless jagged shards, are revealed.

          "description": "BERT tugs on his kite, but is pulled off the pier and vanishes into the sky with a swoosh, while ERNIE leans over the bench. BERT turns to glance at him with a grin on his face. ERNIE moves towards BERT, and then leaps on him, tickling him and snatching the shining badge from BERT's limp paw. ERNIE slips the badge onto his collar, spiraling into delirium as his shape bends and twists, becoming a bizarre, wilted creature, and finally crawling into a hidden burrow beneath the Rolling Hills. A desolate terrain, covered in tumbleweeds and the marks of recent floods, surrounds the barren Sugar Valley as it vanishes up towards the hills. JAMES and LUCAS are in a grimy trench; LUCAS twitches in a fitful nap, but JAMES is alert, his arm reaching down to the rope around his waist. An abrupt whistle startles JAMES, who quickly conceals the badge as GRUMPY peers at them with flickering eyes. LUCAS stirs, glances at JAMES, who nods his head. LUCAS then looks at the faded, grey dusk. The weeks are becoming gloomier when the earth suddenly shakes, and a rolling, booming roar echoes down the valley. LUCAS throws GRUMPY a wary glance and turns back to dig in his satchel, holding up a strip of stale flatbread to JAMES. JAMES glances at LUCAS questioningly. JAMES and LUCAS follow GRUMPY, scrambling through thickets and across jagged cliffs, as he guides them on a meandering, punishing route. Meanwhile, MERLIN guides LANCELOT, ROBIN, CHARLES, and ODIN through dim undergrowth as the shifting brush of Sherwood parts before them, creating a corridor of shrubs that permits passage along the ancient Nottingham path. A dense, steamy fog fills the glen, and as the thicket divides ahead, the remnants of the massive timber fence, fractured and shattered into myriad splintered fragments, are exposed. Far away, half obscured in swirling vapor, stands the spire of Rivendell, untouched by the winds, with clear streams lapping about its base. Two tiny elves, WILLOW and MAPLE, perch on the broken fence with a spread of pastries, cheeses, and cider laid before them. They smoke long reeds as they recline in the sunlight. WILLOW interrupts MAPLE before he can reply, as MERLIN, LANCELOT, ROBIN, and ODIN gaze at the scene ahead. MERLIN leads the group through the debris and rubble floating upon the murky streams surrounding the spire. OAKEN, the towering TROLL, strides towards them, startling all but MERLIN, who gazes up the great height of the shadowy spire as the ancient TROLL nods his head sagely. MAPLE's eye is caught by something radiating with a silver glow in the muddy brook. LANCELOT pivots as, quick as a wink, MAPLE has leapt off his chariot and scooped up the Mirror Orb."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
