While remaining fully clothed, Angela finds herself once more encircled by her fellow girls, just as the high school band reaches the crescendo of its performance with a resonant final note. The Dancing Spartanettes simultaneously execute their last elegant pose, which prompts a wave of reactions from the audience. Amidst this, Carolyn energetically joins the rest of the audience in clapping, her hands meeting enthusiastically in applause, while Lester remains motionless in his seat, utterly captivated by Angela and incapable of diverting his gaze from her. As time passes and the game concludes, Jane and Angela emerge from the gymnasium, with Lester and Carolyn positioned at the outskirts of the parking lot, waiting expectantly. Jane hesitantly steps toward her parents, with Angela trailing slightly behind, causing a palpable moment of awkwardness. As Jane strides toward the parking area, Lester lingers, his eyes fixed on Angela, who, with a knowing smile, acknowledges the influence she holds over him and the gratitude he feels in that mesmerized state. A solitary red rose petal drifts languidly through the air, capturing attention as it gently lands. We then observe Lester and Carolyn lying in their bed from above; even in her sleep, Carolyn’s features reflect determination, while Lester remains awake, eyes cast upward. As the tender red rose petal descends into his view, resting softly on his pillow, a cascade of additional rose petals showers onto the bed, prompting Lester to gaze up at them with a smile. In this ethereal scene, Angela appears unclothed and suspended, enveloped by a torrent of rose petals that fall gracefully, while her hair radiates outward like a halo, shimmering with a warm, subtle light. She gazes downward with a smile that embodies myriad emotions, a smile that Lester returns with laughter as the rose petals envelop his face. Driving away later, Jane casts her eyes downward and, still chuckling, exits the car before giving a parting wave as Angela departs. The camera zooms in on Jane, capturing her as she walks up the driveway. Abruptly, she halts, sensing an unseen observer’s presence, and her gaze shifts to the colonial house next door, where a moving van was previously stationed. The front porch remains cloaked in shadows until a sudden illumination from the porch light reveals Ricky, clothed conservatively as expected. Jane, with irritation, fixes Ricky with a hard stare, to which he responds with a curious expression and then raises his digicam, commencing to record her. Through his lens, Jane appears visibly angered and self-conscious as she turns away, hastily moving toward her home and flipping him off before disappearing inside. Once inside, Jane promptly closes and locks the door, her hand flicking off the light left on for her before she peers through the window, her lips curling into a smile. Turning back into the room, she feels the rapid beating of her heart. Meanwhile, Lester, attired for work, rifles through Jane's address book, retrieves Jane's phone, and with the receiver pressed to his ear, stands immobilized by nerves, unable to articulate any words. He reluctantly replaces the receiver and swiftly exits the room just as Jane emerges from the bathroom, a towel wrapped snugly around her torso as she attends to drying her damp hair. As she notices the unattended phone, Angela reclines across her bed, engaged in a phone conversation. Jane, her attention drawn, notices her address book open to the H page, sparking curiosity and surprise."

Jane turns back into the room, her heart racing with a mix of emotions. Lester, dressed for work at the local office where he has recently been promoted, goes through Jane's address book and grabs Jane's phone to dial, standing with the receiver to his ear, nervous but frozen and unable to speak, caught in indecision. He hangs up and exits quickly as Jane emerges from the bathroom, a towel wrapped around her torso, drying her wet hair, freshly showered. She picks up the phone, noticing the number Lester had tried to dial. Meanwhile, Angela is sprawled across her bed, on the phone, chatting animatedly.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
