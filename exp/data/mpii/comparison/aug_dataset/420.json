          "description": "Her elbow rests on the curtain, with the blurry outlines of the statues in front of her. Lucy's eyes are wide as she laughs quietly. She laughs once more, and they release her feet, causing her to tumble to the chair. The librarian spins and heads back to the table in the back chamber as the bell's chime is heard once more. There is a ring at the gate. Tom stands alone in the bright corridor, dressed in his coat and tie, lost in a groggy dream-state. He walks to the gate and swings it open, his eyes red and his hands covered with ink. He gazes down to find her lounging on the bench, her legs tucked into her lap, with one shoe covering the other. Tom is amazed and rushes to her, pulling her to his shoulder. She begins to whisper, and he listens closely. Tom observes as Lucy, both feet wrapped in woolen socks, attempts to wake and moves her legs as though trying to run. Tom stands, approaches her, and pats her shoulder. They are seated at the dinner carpet, where Tom hands her some tea. She attempts to bring the glass to her teeth but cannot achieve it, and in frustration, she places the glass on the carpet and rises from the blanket. Tom kneels down and carefully picks up the toppled tea. The villa is now tidy and cheerful, and Tom is alert. He is at his chair sketching, while Lucy lounges by the door, attempting to reach around her side to scratch her shoulder. She strolls over to the chair and selects an apple out of the bowl with her hand, glancing momentarily at him without requesting directly for a knife. He slices it, and as he does, she peeks at the drawing on the paper. She begins to tie her scarf, but when Tom swiftly stands to assist, she holds him back. He observes her wrestle with the knot for a moment, then raises her hands in a sign of defeat. As he knots her scarf for her, she takes his hand in her own and whispers softly. Tom and Lucy step from the archway. It is a cool, serene evening, and Tom has a backpack with him. Lucy appears pleased to be out with him, almost as if she has ignored the slippers on her feet. They pause at a location that overlooks the meadow and unfurl a shawl. Lucy reclines on the stones and gazes at Tom, and both seem calm and content in the moonlight together. Lucy lifts her chin and reclines, then merely gazes at him before she intends to tap on the wall of Tom's villa."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Sarah, alone and drowsy from alcohol, opens the door to a puffy-eyed Eddie leaning against the wall with plaster-cast hands. She embraces him as he cries. At breakfast, frustrated by his inability to drink coffee, Eddie spills it, and Sarah cleans patiently. Later, the apartment is tidy, and Sarah sober, types while Eddie struggles with his shirt buttons; they share a tender moment when she helps him. On a warm day, they picnic by the river, enjoying each other's company, seemingly forgetting his casts. Eddie looks at Sarah affectionately before preparing to knock on her apartment door."
