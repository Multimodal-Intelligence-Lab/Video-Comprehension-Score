A tiny circle of light hits Norman's face from the hole in the wall behind the picture. This end of the room is very dim, allowing us to see clearly the light striking Norman's face. We move close to Norman, extremely close, until his profile fills the screen, and the tiny spot of light hits his eye. We see the small hole through which the light comes, and Norman peeps through. Through the hole, we look into Mary's cabin and see Mary undressing; she is in her bra and half-slip. She stoops over a bit, places her hands behind her upper back, and begins to unhook her bra. Norman watches as Mary removes her bra, and we see his eye run up and down the unseen figure of Mary. Mary is just slipping into a robe, covering her complete nudity. Norman turns from the hole, faces us for a moment, continues turning until he can look out the small parlor window. Quickly and precisely, he rehangs the picture over the hole in the wall, turns, and starts out of the parlor. We see him go through the office and out onto the porch, not even bothering to close the door behind him. Norman walks along the porch, in the direction of the big house. Once on the path, he pauses, looks up at the light in the bedroom window, then pulls himself up, squares his shoulders, and strides manfully up the path. He opens the door of the house and enters. We see him pause at the foot of the stairway and look up at the bedroom door just at the head of the stair. He bypasses the stairs and slowly makes his way to the kitchen at the far end of the hall. He enters the kitchen and drops wearily into a chair. Meanwhile, Mary is seated at a small desk, engrossed in figuring in a small notebook. After a moment, she tears the page out of the notebook and, rising, begins to rip it into small pieces. She goes into the bathroom, drops the pieces into the toilet bowl, and flushes the toilet. Then she drops her robe, steps into the tub, and turns the shower on. For a moment, we watch Mary as she washes and soaps herself. We then see the bathroom door being pushed slowly open and the shadow of a woman fall across the shower curtain. Mary's back is turned to the curtain.

We move close to Norman, extremely close, until his profile fills the screen, and the tiny spot of light hits his eye. We see the small hole through which the light comes, and Norman peeps through. Through the hole, we look into Mary's cabin and see Mary disrobing; she is in her bra and half-slip. She bends over a bit, places her hands behind her upper back, and begins to unfasten her bra.

          "description": "Norman is looked at by a picture hanging on the far end of the wall he is leaning against. It is reached by him, touched, and the small frame is reluctantly lifted off the wall by him. A tiny circle of light is hit on Norman's face from the hole in the wall behind the picture. This end of the room is dimmed to such a degree that the light striking Norman's face is seen clearly by us. Norman is approached by us, extremely close, until the screen is filled by his profile, and his eye is hit by the tiny spot of light. The small hole through which the light comes is seen by us, and through it, Norman peeps. Into Mary's cabin, we look through the hole and Mary is seen undressing; her bra and half-slip are worn by her. A bit is stooped over by her, her hands are placed behind her upper back, and her bra is begun to be unhooked by her. As Mary removes her bra, she is watched by Norman, and the unseen figure of Mary is run up and down by his eye. A robe is just slipped into by Mary, and her complete nudity is covered. From the hole, Norman turns, and for a moment, we are faced by him before turning continues until the small parlor window can be looked through by him. The picture is quickly and precisely rehung over the hole in the wall, by him, he turns and the parlor is started out of by him. Through the office and out onto the porch, he goes, the door not even being bothered to be closed behind him by him. Along the porch, Norman walks, and the big house is walked towards. On the path, a pause is made by him, the light in the bedroom window is looked up at by him, then he pulls himself up, his shoulders are squared, and up the path, he strides manfully. The door of the house is opened by him and he enters. At the foot of the stairway, he pauses and the bedroom door just at the head of the stair is looked up at by him. The stairs are bypassed by him, and he slowly makes his way to the kitchen at the far end of the hall. Into a chair, he drops wearily as he enters the kitchen. Meanwhile, at a small desk, Mary is seated, engrossed in figuring in a small notebook. After a moment, the page is torn out of the notebook by her and rising, it is begun to be ripped into small pieces by her. Into the bathroom, she goes, the pieces are dropped into the toilet bowl by her, and the toilet is flushed by her. Then her robe is dropped, into the tub, she steps, and the shower is turned on by her. For a moment, Mary is watched by us as she washes and soaps herself. The bathroom door is then seen being pushed slowly open and across the shower curtain, the shadow of a woman falls. To the curtain, Mary's back is turned. Suddenly, a hand reaches up, the shower curtain is grasped, and it is ripped aside by the hand, causing a look of pure horror to erupt on her face."

He is leaning against this wall, lost in his thoughts. After a moment of hesitation that seems to weigh heavily on him, he reaches out with a certain cautiousness, touching the picture gently with his hand. With a sense of reluctance that is almost palpable, he carefully lifts the small frame off the wall. As he performs this action, a tiny circle of light suddenly emerges, casting a distinct glow on Norman's face. This light comes from a hole in the wall that was previously concealed behind the picture. This particular section of the room is enveloped in dimness, which allows us to clearly observe the way the light illuminates Norman's face. Slowly, we move in closer to Norman, getting extremely close, until his profile completely fills the screen, and the small spot of light is seen reflecting in his eye. We notice the small hole through which this light is coming, and we see Norman peering through it. Through this hole, our view shifts into Mary's cabin, where we see Mary as she is undressing; she is wearing her bra and a half-slip. She bends over slightly and places her hands behind her upper back, beginning the process of unhooking her bra.

She proceeds into the bathroom, drops the pieces into the toilet bowl, and flushes them away. Then, she lets her robe fall, steps gracefully into the tub, and turns the shower on. For a moment, we watch Mary as she washes and soaps herself, lost in the simple act of cleansing. We then see the bathroom door being pushed slowly open, and the ominous shadow of a woman falls across the shower curtain. Mary's back is turned to the curtain, completely unaware of what is happening. Suddenly, a hand reaches up, grasps the shower curtain, and violently rips it aside, causing a look of pure, unadulterated horror to erupt on her face."

He pushes himself off the wall, takes a few steps forward, and reaches the picture. His fingers extend to touch the frame, feeling its texture, and with a hint of reluctance, he carefully lifts the small frame off the wall. As he does so, a tiny circle of light emerges from the hole behind the picture, casting a beam onto Norman's face. The dimness of this end of the room accentuates the light, making it clearly visible as it strikes his features. We draw closer to Norman, inching nearer until his profile dominates the screen, and the pinpoint of light aligns perfectly with his eye. Through this small hole, Norman peers, and we follow his gaze into Mary's cabin. Inside, Mary is undressing, clad in her bra and half-slip. She bends slightly, her hands reaching behind her upper back as she begins to unhook her bra. Norman observes intently as Mary removes her bra, his eye tracing the contours of her unseen figure. Mary then slips into a robe, concealing her nudity. Norman, having seen enough, turns away from the hole, momentarily facing us before continuing his turn to look out the small parlor window. With swift precision, he rehangs the picture over the hole, concealing it once more, and turns to leave the parlor. He moves through the office and steps out onto the porch, leaving the door ajar behind him. Norman walks along the porch, heading towards the big house. Upon reaching the path, he pauses, glancing up at the light shining from the bedroom window. He gathers himself, straightening his posture, and strides purposefully up the path. He reaches the house, opens the door, and steps inside. At the foot of the stairway, he pauses, his gaze lifting to the bedroom door at the top. Choosing not to ascend, he bypasses the stairs and proceeds slowly down the hall to the kitchen at the far end. Entering the kitchen, he drops into a chair, weariness evident in his demeanor. Meanwhile, Mary sits at a small desk, absorbed in calculations in a small notebook. After a moment, she tears a page from the notebook, rises, and begins tearing it into small pieces. She moves to the bathroom, drops the pieces into the toilet bowl, and flushes them away. She then lets her robe fall, steps into the tub, and turns on the shower. For a brief moment, we watch as Mary washes and soaps herself. Suddenly, the bathroom door creaks open slowly, and the shadow of a woman is cast across the shower curtain. With her back turned to the curtain, Mary remains unaware until a hand suddenly reaches up, grasps the shower curtain, and yanks it aside, causing a look of pure horror to erupt on her face."

A tiny circle of light hits Norman's face from the hole in the wall behind the picture, a peep hole cleverly concealed by his late mother to spy on guests in the adjacent room. This end of the room is very dim, allowing us to see clearly the light striking Norman's face. We move close to Norman, extremely close, until his profile fills the screen, and the tiny spot of light hits his eye. We see the small hole through which the light comes, and Norman peeps through. Through the hole, we look into Mary’s cabin, at Norman's family-owned motel where each cabin offers a sense of rustic seclusion, and see Mary undressing; she is in her bra and half-slip. She stoops over a bit, places her hands behind her upper back, and begins to unhook her bra. Norman watches as Mary removes her bra, and we see his eye run up and down the unseen figure of Mary. Mary is just slipping into a robe, covering her complete nudity. Norman turns from the hole, faces us for a moment, continues turning until he can look out the small parlor window. Quickly and precisely, he rehangs the picture over the hole in the wall, turns, and starts out of the parlor. We see him go through the office, part of the modestly run-down facade of the once-busy motel, and out onto the porch, not even bothering to close the door behind him. Norman walks along the porch, in the direction of the big house, a Victorian structure that looms ominously behind the motel and is widely rumored to be haunted. Once on the path, he pauses, looks up at the light in the bedroom window, then pulls himself up, squares his shoulders, and strides manfully up the path. He opens the door of the house and enters. We see him pause at the foot of the stairway, known for its creaky steps lined with worn carpet, and look up at the bedroom door just at the head of the stair. He bypasses the stairs and slowly makes his way to the kitchen at the far end of the hall. He enters the kitchen and drops wearily into a chair. Meanwhile, Mary is seated at a small desk, engrossed in figuring in a small notebook, which contains calculations regarding the sum of money she plans to keep hidden. After a moment, she tears the page out of the notebook and, rising, begins to rip it into small pieces. She goes into the bathroom, drops the pieces into the toilet bowl, and flushes the toilet. Then she drops her robe, steps into the tub, and turns the shower on. For a moment, we watch Mary as she washes and soaps herself in an old claw-foot tub that features prominently in the lore of the motel.

Norman walks along the porch in the direction of the big house. Once on the path he pauses looks up at the light in the bedroom window then pulls himself up squares his shoulders and strides manfully up the path. He opens the door of the house and enters. We see him pause at the foot of the stairway and look up at the bedroom door just at the head of the stair. He bypasses the stairs and slowly makes his way to the kitchen at the far end of the hall. He enters the kitchen and drops wearily into a chair. Meanwhile Mary is seated at a small desk engrossed in figuring in a small notebook. After a moment she tears the page out of the notebook and rising begins to rip it into small pieces. She goes into the bathroom drops the pieces into the toilet bowl and flushes the toilet. Then she drops her robe steps into the tub and turns the shower on. For a moment we watch Mary as she washes and soaps herself. We then see the bathroom door being pushed slowly open and the shadow of a woman fall across the shower curtain. Mary's back is turned to the curtain. Suddenly a hand reaches up grasps the shower curtain and rips it aside causing a look of pure horror to erupt on her face."

A tiny circle of light hits Norman's face from the hole in the wall behind the picture. This end of the room is very dim allowing us to see clearly the light striking Norman's face. We move close to Norman extremely close until his profile fills the screen and the tiny spot of light hits his eye. We see the small hole through which the light comes and Norman peeps through. Through the hole we look into Mary's cabin and see Mary undressing. After a moment she tears the page out of the notebook and rising begins to rip it into small pieces.

          "description": "Daisy gazes at a poster floating on the opposite edge of the desk she is sprawling over, stretches towards it, nudges it, and unwillingly pulls the tiny vase off the shelf. A small beam of darkness grazes Daisy's hand from the crack in the door behind the poster. This side of the attic is quite bright, obscuring the shadow hitting Daisy's hand. We drift away from Daisy, incredibly distant, until her silhouette vanishes from view, and the faint trace of darkness grazes her foot. We observe the large crack through which the shadow emerges, and Daisy glances around. Through the crack, we peer into Tim's attic and find Tim dressing up; he is in his coat and coat-tails. He stands up straight, places his feet on the lower floor, and stops fastening his coat. Daisy listens as Tim puts on his coat, and we notice her foot dance side to side with the unseen silhouette of Tim. Tim is just stepping out of the suit, uncovering his entire brightness. Daisy turns away from the crack, turns towards us for a second, keeps turning until she can gaze into the large hallway mirror. Slowly and casually, she unhooks the poster at the crack in the door, turns, and wanders into the closet. We watch her stroll through the hallway and into the yard, not even attempting to shut the window behind her. Daisy skips across the yard, towards the tiny cave. Once on the trail, she halts, glances down at the shadow in the living room ceiling, then hoists herself down, narrows her knees, and hops gracefully down the trail. She shuts the window of the cave and exits. We observe her halt at the head of the ladder and gaze down at the living room window just at the foot of the ladder. She crosses over the ladder and swiftly makes her way to the pantry at the near side of the room. She exits the pantry and stands energetically on a table. Meanwhile, Tim is lying on a large couch, absorbed in painting on a large canvas. After a moment, he sticks the page onto the canvas and, falling, ceases to tear it into large chunks. He enters the cellar, sticks the chunks onto the ceiling tiles, and opens the window. Then he lifts his suit, jumps out of the pool, and shuts the lights off. For a second, we observe Tim as he dries and dresses himself. We then glimpse the cellar window being yanked swiftly closed and the shape of a child rise beneath the pool tiles. Tim's front is facing the tiles. Instantly, a foot reaches down, releases the pool tiles, and bolts them away, causing a look of utter joy to erupt on his face."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

          "description": "Norman examines a picture on the wall, revealing a small hole that projects light onto his face in the dim room. Looking through the hole, he spies on Mary undressing in her cabin. As Mary begins to put on a robe, Norman turns away, rehangs the picture, and exits the room without closing the door. He walks toward the big house, glancing at the lighted bedroom window before entering the house and heading to the kitchen, where he sits wearily. Meanwhile, Mary tears up a page from a notebook and flushes it away before showering. As she washes, the bathroom door slowly opens, and a shadow falls across the curtain. Suddenly, a hand pulls the curtain aside, and Mary displays a look of pure horror."
