          "description": "Colored fasteners tumble into a sizable mound, creating the Warner Brothers' emblem, and additional fasteners persist to descend. A thin, pale-faced, elderly woman's hollow eyes flutter open tiredly, then shut. The woman, Daisy, reclines in a hospital cot wearing a snug turban as 30-something Caroline approaches her bedside and grasps her hand. Daisy was scratching her torso, and a nurse traverses the cot to Daisy's IV drip, adjusting it as Daisy shuts her eyes once more. Dark-haired Caroline gazes away thoughtfully, then softly takes Daisy's hand in her own, embraces her, sits up, and caresses her mother's limb. Daisy's eyes open slightly and her brow wrinkles. A reminiscence discloses a vast depot with a grand arcade and a clock maker's where Caroline listens attentively. The clock maker wears dark spectacles, is bald, and has a mustache. They see their offspring off at the depot as Mrs. Gateau opens a letter at the dining table, looks across at her spouse, who wipes his mouth and vacates the table. They stand on a platform as uniformed men unload a line of coffins from a steam locomotive and then depart the burial ground. He installs a large brass gear as a throng of onlookers congregates on the spacious concourse of the train depot, staring expectantly at Mr. Gateau, who stands atop a raised, wooden scaffold platform and unveils a vast, embossed, brass, wall-mounted timepiece with its long second hand commencing to rotate backwards. In reverse motion, a fallen combatant rises and runs backward from a detonation as bespectacled President Roosevelt doffs his trilby, observing soldiers move backward over mire. Their offspring descends from the locomotive on which he departed as it reverses into the depot while, on the concourse, the President lowers his head and then gazes upward again. Grainy footage depicts Mr. Gateau rowing out to ocean in a wooden vessel. The nurse rises from her seat in the corner of the chamber and walks out past a vacant adjacent cot, as pale Caroline gazes off in contemplation, shuts her eyes, moves to the sofa, and reveals Daisy's suitcase, exposing a leather-bound volume. Caroline sits with a volume that contains a black-and-white nuptial photo. Fireworks brighten the avenues filled with merrymakers waving American flags as 40-something Thomas Button dashes through the throng and makes a beeline for a dwelling on the corner, his trilby blowing off as he races to the front steps and lets himself in. A maid in the passageway closes the door as Thomas rushes to an upper bedroom to find his wife lying in a large cot under blood-stained sheets. Thomas removes his coat as a physician approaches him, then turns to see a clergyman. Thomas strides to his wife's bedside and nods as the clergyman administers the last rites, and Thomas walks cautiously towards the infant's cradle."

The sunken eyes of a gaunt, ashen-faced, old woman are flickered open wearily and then closed. Daisy, the woman, is lying in a hospital bed wearing a tight turban while 30-something Caroline goes to her bedside and clasps her hand. Daisy scratched her chest, and a nurse rounded the bed to Daisy's IV drip and adjusted it as Daisy's eyes were closed again. Dark-haired Caroline looks away pensively, then Daisy’s hand is gently taken by her in her own, hugged, sat up, and her mother's arm is stroked by her. Daisy's eyes are opened slightly and her brow furrows. An enormous station is revealed by a flashback, with a grand colonnade and a watch smith's where Caroline intently listens. Dark glasses are worn by the watch smith, who is bald and has a mustache. Their son is seen off at the station by them as Mrs. Gateau opens a letter at the dining table and looks across at her husband, who wipes his mouth and leaves the table. They stand on a platform unloading a line of coffins from a steam train as uniformed men, then the grave is left by them. A large brass cog is fitted by him as a crowd of spectators gathers on the spacious concourse of the train station, staring expectantly at Mr. Gateau, who stands atop a raised, wooden scaffold platform and unveils a huge, embossed, brass, wall-mounted clock with its long second hand starting to be turned backwards. In reverse action, a fallen soldier is stood by and run backward from an explosion as bespectacled President Roosevelt watches soldiers run backward over mud, having removed his trilby. The train on which he departed is climbed down by their son as it is reversed into the station while, on the concourse, the President's head is hung and then looked up again. Mr. Gateau is shown by grainy footage rowing out to sea in a wooden boat. The nurse, having risen from her seat in the corner of the room, walks out past an empty neighboring bed, as pale Caroline stares off in thought, closes her eyes, goes to the sofa, and a leather-bound book is uncovered in Daisy's suitcase by her. Caroline sits with a book that contains a black-and-white wedding photo. The streets filled with revelers waving American flags are illuminated by fireworks as 40-something Thomas Button sprints through the crowd, making a beeline for a house on the corner, his trilby blowing off as the front steps are raced to by him and himself is let in. The door is closed in the hallway by a maid as Thomas hurries to an upstairs bedroom and finds his wife lying in a large bed under blood-stained sheets. The coat is removed by Thomas as a doctor approaches him, then a priest is turned to be seen by him. Thomas strides to his wife's bedside and nods as the last rites are given by the priest, and the baby's cot is cautiously walked towards by Thomas."

As more and more buttons continue to descend with unyielding persistence, a gaunt, elderly woman with an ashen face and sunken eyes flickers them open, eyes heavy with weariness, only to close them again shortly after they had opened. This woman, whose name is Daisy, is lying in a hospital bed, her head adorned with a turban that is tightly wrapped and secure. At her bedside, a woman in her thirties, known as Caroline, approaches with care and gently clasps Daisy's hand in a comforting gesture of reassurance. Daisy, who had been absentmindedly scratching at her chest, is attended to by a nurse. The nurse walks around the bed to make necessary adjustments to Daisy's IV drip, ensuring that it is properly set and functioning, as Daisy closes her eyes once more, seeking rest. Caroline, with her dark hair framing her face in soft waves, looks away thoughtfully and pensively, then tenderly takes Daisy's hand in her own.

Mr. Gateau fits a large brass cog into place as a crowd of spectators gathers on the spacious concourse of the train station, their anticipation mounting as they fix their eyes intently on him. He ascends a raised, wooden scaffold platform, and with a flourish, unveils a huge, intricately embossed, brass, wall-mounted clock, its long second hand intriguingly beginning to turn in reverse. In a surreal and dream-like reverse action, a fallen soldier stands and runs backward from an explosion, creating a striking image, while bespectacled President Roosevelt removes his trilby hat, observing with curiosity as soldiers run backward over the muddy terrain. Their son, in an unexpected twist of time, descends from the train on which he had previously departed, as it reverses into the station in a surreal fashion.

Grainy footage captures Mr. Gateau rowing out to sea in a solitary wooden boat, a lone figure against the vast and unending expanse of water.\n\nReturning to the present-day hospital room, the nurse rises from her seat in the corner and walks with purpose out past an empty neighboring bed, leaving pale Caroline behind, lost in her thoughts. Caroline closes her eyes momentarily, seeking solace, then moves to the sofa where she uncovers Daisy's suitcase, revealing an old, leather-bound book. Caroline sits with the book cradled in her hands, turning its pages to find a black-and-white wedding photo, a poignant and touching reminder of days gone by.

In reverse action, a fallen soldier stands and runs backward from an explosion, symbolizing the possibility of undoing tragic events, as bespectacled President Roosevelt, the 32nd President of the United States noted for his leadership during the Great Depression and World War II, removes his trilby, a type of hat popular in the early 20th century, watching soldiers run backward over mud. Their son climbs down from the train on which he departed as it reverses into the station while, on the concourse, the President hangs his head and then looks up again.

Fireworks illuminate the streets filled with revelers waving American flags during a celebration likely marking Independence Day or another national holiday, as 40-something Thomas Button sprints through the crowd and makes a beeline for a house on the corner, his trilby blowing off as he races to the front steps and lets himself in. A maid in the hallway, reflecting the era's social structure where domestic help was common in affluent households, closes the door as Thomas hurries to an upstairs bedroom to find his wife lying in a large bed under blood-stained sheets. Thomas removes his coat as a doctor, an authority figure in medical emergencies, approaches him, then turns to see a priest, who offers spiritual support during critical moments. Thomas strides to his wife's bedside and nods as the priest gives the last rites, a ritual of the Catholic faith, and Thomas walks cautiously towards the baby's cot."

A robust, rosy-cheeked, young man's beaming face flickers open energetically, then closes. The man, Harold, sits in a rocking chair wearing a loose beret as teenage Leonard marches to his side and pats his elbow. Harold was scratching his knee, and a gardener circles the chair to Harold's bookshelf, straightening it as Harold closes his gaze again. Blond-haired Leonard looks away thoughtfully, then gently takes Harold's elbow in his own, embraces him, stands up, and rubs his father's leg. Harold's gaze opens slightly and his brow crinkles. A flashback reveals a tiny farm with a modest fence and a glassblower's hut where Leonard listens curiously. The glassblower dons bright goggles, is ponytailed, and has a beard. They send their daughter off at the farm as Mr. Orange peels an apple at the picnic table, glances across at her wife, who cleans her glasses and exits the table. They stand in a field as decorated workers unload a row of barrels from a sailboat and then leave the meadow. She molds a small silver spoon as a group of performers assembles on the narrow stage of the farm, watching eagerly at Mrs. Orange, who stands atop a lowered, metal scaffold stage and unveils a minuscule, embossed, silver, ground-mounted sundial with its short hand beginning to tick forward. In reverse action, a wandering fisherman stands and walks backward from a splash as blue-eyed Prime Minister Churchill removes his cap, observing fishermen walk backward over waves. Their daughter descends up from the boat on which she anchored as it advances into the farm while, on the stage, the Prime Minister lifts his chin and then glances down. Clear footage shows Mrs. Orange cycling into the forest in a metal wagon. The gardener rises from her seat in the middle of the hallway and strolls in past a full adjacent chair, as dark-haired Leonard stares off in anticipation, opens his gaze, strolls to the bookshelf, and closes Harold's backpack, revealing a paper-bound map. Leonard stands with a map that holds a colored family reunion picture. Lanterns dimly light the alleys filled with dancers waving British banners as 20-something Richard Coin jogs through the crowd and rushes towards a barn at the edge, his cap fluttering off as he strides to the rear porch and marches himself in. A chef in the kitchen opens the drawer as Richard lurches to a downstairs parlor to find his brother lying in a small hammock under clean-cut covers. Richard puts on his hat as a merchant approaches him, then shifts to notice a fisherman.

Henry was tapping his knee, and a gardener wheels the cart to Henry's flower pot, watering it as Henry shuts his eyes again. Blonde-haired Margaret gazes away curiously, then softly pats Henry's shoulder with her own, embraces him, stands up, and massages his friend's hand. Henry's eyes flicker slightly and his lips tighten. A flashback shows a bustling plaza with small stalls and a jeweler's where Margaret observes casually. The jeweler dons light shades, is completely bald, and sports a beard. They send their daughter off at the plaza as Mr. Foster reads a postcard at the kitchen counter, glances over at his spouse, who dusts his chin and exits the room. They wait at a dock as uniformed sailors load a row of crates onto a cargo ship and then step off the pier. He installs a tiny silver gear as a crowd of onlookers assembles on the spacious deck of the ferry terminal, observing eagerly at Mrs. Foster, who stands atop a raised, stone pedestal and reveals a massive, engraved, silver, column-mounted clock with its short minute hand starting to spin forward. In a reverse sequence, a jubilant athlete rises and jogs forward toward a celebration as monocled Emperor Wilhelm dons his bowler hat, watching civilians walk forward over cobbles. Their daughter climbs up onto the ship from which she arrived as it sails away from the harbor while, on the deck, the Emperor bows his head and then tilts it up again. Grainy footage shows Mrs. Foster paddling into the river in a metal canoe. The gardener stands from his seat in the middle of the park and strolls away past an unoccupied adjacent bench, as radiant Margaret gazes in contemplation, opens her eyes, rises from the bench, and uncovers Henry's duffle bag, finding a velvet-covered journal. Margaret flips through a journal that includes a colorful landscape painting.

They watch their daughter arrive at the shop as Mr. Apple slices a cake at the picnic table, stares at his wife, who chews her food and vacates the table. They wander in a corridor as armored knights retrieve a stack of baskets from a horse cart and then enter the barn. She attaches a small iron bell as a group of travelers roams on the narrow footpath of the bus depot, gazing hopefully at Mr. Apple, who balances on a low, metal ladder and reveals a tiny, engraved, iron, floor-mounted sculpture with its short minute hand beginning to spin forward. In a forward sequence, a standing dancer falls and leaps forward into a flash as monocled Emperor Caesar dons his fedora, observing dancers leap forward over sand. Their daughter climbs up onto the truck from which she arrived as it drives away from the shop while, in the corridor, the Emperor raises his gaze and then looks down again. Clear footage shows Mr. Apple biking through the forest on a rusty rickshaw. The janitor springs from his couch in the alcove of the house and strolls in past a filled kitchen cabinet, as tan Edward stares ahead in confusion, opens his eyes, heads to the recliner, and opens Peter's briefcase, concealing a plastic-covered magazine. Edward stands with a magazine that includes a color portrait of a garden party. Balloons darken the beaches filled with dancers waving German flags as 60-something Violet Hairpin ambles past the ocean and takes a detour to a shed in the pasture, his fedora slipping off as he strolls to the back gate and locks it shut. A butler in the attic opens the window as Violet meanders to a downstairs study to find his daughter resting on a small mat under water-stained towels. Violet puts on his cape as a gardener approaches him, then turns to greet a sailor. Violet shuffles to his daughter’s chairside and shakes his head as the sailor receives a letter, and Violet strolls quickly towards the animal's kennel."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Her daughter, Caroline, clasps Daisy's hand while a nurse adjusts Daisy's IV drip. Caroline looks pensive, holding Daisy's hand and comforting her. A flashback reveals a train station where Mr. Gateau, watched by a crowd, unveils a clock running backwards. Soldiers and a train move in reverse, symbolizing a desire to reverse time. Meanwhile, in the present, Caroline uncovers Daisy's suitcase and finds a leather-bound book with a wedding photo. Fireworks and revelers fill the streets as Thomas Button sprints to his house, finding his wife in bed under blood-stained sheets. A doctor and priest are present as Thomas nods solemnly and approaches the baby's cot."
