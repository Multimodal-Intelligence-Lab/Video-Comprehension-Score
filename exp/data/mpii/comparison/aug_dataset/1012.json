Friday, a female servant named after the literary character in \"Robinson Crusoe\" famous for the novelâ€™s theme of servitude, zips up the back of the Queen's black dress and hands her a pearl necklace, an elegant piece often associated with royalty and timeless fashion. The Queen, whose full title is Elizabeth II, takes it, looks into a full-length mirror crafted by a renowned British artisan, and fastens the necklace around her neck before studying her reflection with a fixed stare, a practice she has maintained as part of her disciplined routine. As the Queen descends the grand staircase of her historic Scottish residence, Prince Philip, her husband known for his naval service during World War II and his support of numerous charities, emerges from a nearby room. Looking troubled, the Queen descends the stairs, rushes into the courtyard, puts on a head scarf typical of her casual countryside attire, and gets into the driver's side of a nearby Land Rover, a vehicle favored by the Royal Family for its durability and British heritage, which then pulls away. Three bodyguards, part of the Queen's well-trained security detail, quickly jump into a nearby car and follow her. \n\nAlastair, a senior advisor known for his strategic communications expertise, bursts into Tony's office, goes to the door, and Tony, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, looks up at Alastair as he leaves the room. The Queen's Land Rover enters the expansive grounds of Balmoral Castle, a country estate that serves as the Royal Familyâ€™s private retreat in Scotland, followed by the bodyguards' car. The Queen emerges from the Land Rover, gazes around the estate, and a middle-aged man in a cloth cap, reminiscent of traditional British country attire, emerges from a nearby door. On seeing the Queen, he removes his cap as a sign of respect, unlocks the door to a small, stone building used for hunting activities, and opens it for her to enter. The Queen removes her sunglasses, often worn to protect her eyes during outdoor activities, and glances at something inside: the stag, a majestic creature native to the Scottish Highlands, which hangs from the ceiling by its feet at the center of the room, skinned and with its head removed, with a patch of blood under the body, reflecting the traditional practices of game management. The Queen sees the stag's head and antlers, a trophy symbolizing the grandeur of the animal, arranged side-by-side on a nearby table, gently touches the side of the stag's head, and, with her face turned away from the man to maintain composure, catches her breath. The Queen closes her eyes, composes her features with a stoic resolve, turns to face the man, looks at the stag's body again, and moves towards the door, which the man opens.\n\nVideo footage shows a carpet of flowers around the gates and walls of Buckingham Palace, a royal residence in London that serves as the administrative headquarters of the monarch, with crowds swarming outside in tribute.

The Queen turns back to the window while Robin stares at her before the Queen turns back to him.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby cafÃ©, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
