Jane dashes after him, shoves him aside, and seals the cupboard doors before striding off to dress in a glossy dark emerald gown. Kevin, incredulous, captures a snapshot of the cupboard, and Jane rolls her eyes self-consciously. She then extracts a golden gown with folds and orange blossoms, while a bridesmaid stumbles.

Meanwhile, in a nearby kitchen, Jane is engaged in cleaning; she pauses, placing the cup she's washing down on the countertop, then moves toward the door, her curiosity piqued. She peers through the peephole and finds Kevin standing outside, visibly exasperated, his eyes closed in anticipation, silently hoping he hasn't crossed a line as he begins to speak into a dictaphone. Suddenly, Kevin opens his eyes and, in a state of astonishment, his jaw drops upon realizing the contents of a closet—dresses as far as the eye can see. Jane reacts quickly, rushing toward him and forcibly maneuvering him out of the way before firmly closing the closet doors. With determination, she strides away and changes into a shiny dark green dress. Meanwhile, Kevin, unable to contain his disbelief, takes a photo of the closet scene, prompting Jane to roll her eyes with a mix of self-consciousness and resignation. She then pulls out a yellow dress adorned with pleats and orange flowers, during which a bridesmaid loses her balance and falls over. Moving on, Jane chooses a twirly orange dress and a Japanese-style kimono, prompting her and Kevin to exchange playful bows as he snaps another photo. At a wedding setting, Jane crouches down to match the height of the Japanese bridesmaids, one of whom is distinctly attired in long black gloves and even a man's evening suit. With a flourish, Jane performs an energetic high-stepping routine while wearing a top hat, then gracefully sashays in a pink floral print ensemble before modeling a bright dress reminiscent of yellow and pink candy floss. Kevin becomes entangled in a white skirt resembling a giant, dazzling snowflake, accented with yellow. The wedding unfolds on a picturesque lawn overlooking the ocean, with bridesmaids clad in tiny pink strapless mini-dresses. Jane poses for photos with a heavily made-up bride and a much older groom, who sports an open shirt in a color palette of gauzy red, shiny candy pink, and flowery baby blue, all while Kevin lounges casually on a couch, capturing the scene with his camera. In his explorations, Kevin discovers a cowboy hat decorated with a red flower on its brim, envisioning an amusing scene at another wedding where Jane sits humorously backward on a horse for a photo opportunity. He also uncovers a pair of flippers, picturing an underwater wedding scenario where Jane dons a floral bathing cap, smiling as the bride and groom share a submerged kiss. At this moment, Kevin reaches for the dictaphone, catching Jane in a rare moment of vulnerability and sadness, her expression unguarded. They find themselves seated opposite each other, ensnared in a tense and uncomfortable silence, and later, Jane, still appearing unhappy, methodically hangs the dresses back in the closet. On a sunny day, Jane arrives at Tess's apartment, where her suspicions are aroused as Tess conspicuously blocks the doorway, trying to prevent Jane from entering, while Pedro, obliviously dancing and vacuuming, causes Jane to look on in appalled disbelief. Meanwhile, in a separate narrative thread, Kevin is at work, observing Maureen as she walks away, triggering him to shake his head in mild frustration. Later, he joins Jane as they scan barcodes on wedding list items, including peculiar choices like china penguins, a task that leaves Jane feeling mortified as Kevin, amused, waves the scanner in triumph. High above the bustling streets at the New York Journal, Kevin makes his way toward Maureen's office, his expression one of horror as he processes some troubling information. Simultaneously, Jane makes her way with urgency to meet George on the terrace of the boathouse. Back at the newspaper, Kevin reaches for the phone, poised to make an important call."

She puts down a cup she's washing, goes to the door, and sees Kevin through the peephole, looking exasperated after a day of relentless deadlines and meetings. Kevin, with his eyes closed, hopes he hasn't gone too far in his investigation and talks into a dictaphone, a tool commonly used by reporters like him to capture their observations and thoughts. In astonishment, his jaw drops as he spots a closet full of dresses, akin to a private collection worthy of a fashion exhibit. Jane rushes after him, barges him out of the way, and closes the closet doors before striding off determinedly to put on a shiny dark green dress, perhaps for a glamorous evening event. Kevin, still disbelieving, takes a photo of the closet, and Jane rolls her eyes self-consciously, aware of the unusual nature of her wardrobe. She then pulls out a yellow dress with pleats and orange flowers, while a bridesmaid, caught off guard by the unexpected fashion show, falls over. Next is a twirly orange number and a Japanese-style kimono, reflecting her eclectic taste, and they bow to each other as Kevin eagerly takes a photo. At a picturesque wedding by the seaside, Jane crouches to be the same height as the traditionally dressed Japanese bridesmaids, one wearing long black gloves and even a man's evening suit, adding a modern twist to the ceremony.

The wedding takes place on a lush lawn overlooking the ocean, with bridesmaids in tiny pink strapless mini-dresses, designed to complement the cheerful summer atmosphere. Jane poses with a heavily made-up bride and much older, open-shirted groom, whose outfits in gauzy red, shiny candy pink, and flowery baby blue create a striking contrast, while Kevin lounges on the couch taking pictures, satisfied with the day's work. Kevin finds a cowboy hat with a red flower on the brim, reminiscent of Southern weddings, and at a rustic wedding, Jane sits on a horse that faces the wrong way for the photo, adding humor to the occasion. He also finds a pair of flippers, and at an underwater wedding, Jane smiles in a floral bathing cap as the bride and groom share a unique watery kiss, a nod to adventurous couples. Kevin reaches for the dictaphone and catches Jane off guard, looking sad and vulnerable, revealing a side of her not often seen. They sit opposite each other in uncomfortable silence, the weight of their thoughts hanging heavily between them, and later, still looking unhappy, Jane hangs the dresses back in the closet, a symbolic act of retreat. On a sunny day filled with hidden tensions, Jane arrives at Tess' apartment and becomes suspicious as Tess blocks the doorway, while Pedro is vacuuming and dancing, making Jane look appalled at the unexpected chaos.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
