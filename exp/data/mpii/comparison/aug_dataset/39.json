JEAN-LOUIS dashes away, delighted with the circumstance. SYLVIE perceives REGGIE's repast of chilled poultry, spud salad, buns and margarine, vino, and espresso, as REGGIE commences consuming a poultry limb. SYLVIE remarks the disordered table before trailing. They traverse through a splendid indoor swim area with ceiling-tall panes displaying snow-blanketed peaks, continuing their dialogue. An open veranda encircles the pool with sunbathers in deck recliners, and REGGIE and SYLVIE sustain their discourse. SYLVIE halts, distinguishing a peculiar figure in a bizarre crocheted hood masking the visage except for the optics, proboscis, and maw. The camera tilts downward to include JEAN-LOUIS, gripped by the hooded person, and also displays REGGIE and SYLVIE. SYLVIE evaluates the predicament, rises up, and she and JEAN-LOUIS commence to depart, with JEAN-LOUIS spraying PETER with his water gun. The camera displays the Arc de Triomphe at the Thoroughfare's terminus and sweeps to a cab pulling up to a stately structure with REGGIE, SYLVIE, and JEAN-LOUIS inside. REGGIE vacates, and the chauffeur starts offloading her luggage as JEAN-LOUIS pokes his cranium out the casement, and REGGIE gazes at SYLVIE, astounded. REGGIE strides toward the edifice with the chauffeur hauling her cases and presses the button to unseal the anterior portal. As the lift ascends, REGGIE departs, trailed by the chauffeur who places the parcels in front of the flat portal and leaves. Sighing, REGGIE extracts her keychain to unfasten the entrance and enters the vacant Lounge, with camera pursuing. The chamber is stripped empty, with traces of primal facade hue where artworks once dangled, fasteners still in situ. She dashes to the dormitory, camera staggering behind her, discovering it likewise vacant. She rapidly unlatches wardrobe armoires revealing solely racks, and finds drawers void as well. REGGIE is in near-daze. We observe a sizable metallic drawer being opened, unveiling a familiar silhouette beneath a moist muslin shroud, as REGGIE, GRANDPIERRE, and an ASSISTANT peer into the drawer. GRANDPIERRE raises the shroud's edge, unveiling a naked foot with a label attached to its large toe."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
