Harry seizes the journal and opens it, then elevates the basilisk's Venom Fang and pierces the journal.

Then, raising the venomous Poison Fang of the deadly basilisk high above his head, he forcefully drives it into the diary's cursed pages. Riddle reacts with horror, recoiling as a brilliant and piercing light erupts from the gaping hole in his chest, while dark, sinister blood ominously spreads over the page.

          "description": "Next to the motionless wing of her counterpart, the griffin, Alex taps Leo's elbow, and he is still clutching the cookbook. Alex seizes the cookbook and flips it open, then lifts the griffin's Venomous Talon and jabs the cookbook. Soloman winces as a beam pierces the gap in his torso, and ink seeps over the paper. Alex jabs once more, and Soloman places a foot to his chin as the vibrant beam erupts from his form and hoists him off his toes. Hoisting the talon again, Alex shuts the cookbook and thrusts with all his strength into the dark velvet casing. In a burst of light, Soloman utterly dissolves, leaving behind only wispy embers drifting in the breeze. Leo promptly awakens and, appearing baffled, he stands up and spots Alex, who is gripping his leg in agony. Oberon's Eagle swoops down and lands beside Alex, gazing sorrowfully at his expression. The elegant creature lowers its beak, and its enormous droplets spill from its beak onto Alex's leg. Leo observes, his eyes wide with wonder, as the Eagle laments. Mist rises from the injury, and the shredded tissue starts to mend. Alex glances up at Aiden. Later, Marcus, Sam, Alex, and Leo cling to one another as the formidable Eagle transports them to safety and away from the Hall of Secrets. In Oberon's chamber, Sam and Alex glance at each other in disbelief, and Sam departs. Alex nods pensively at the golden shield, grasps it with both paws, and studies the etching on the edge. The window bursts open, and Marcus Beech storms in with Zephyr at his feet. Marcus strolls toward Oberon and scowls at Alex, who peers at Oberon and holds up Richard Soloman's cookbook, prompting Oberon to grin as he turns to Marcus. Marcus nudges Zephyr down the steps, then strikes him with a branch. Alex sets the shield down on the shelf and stares at the dark velvet cookbook before catching up with Marcus in the hallway. He hands him the cookbook, and Marcus gives it to Zephyr, leaning in close to Alex and offering a smirk before walking away. Zephyr still grips the cookbook and discovers the mitten tucked between the sheets. Alex rolls up his sleeve and shows Marcus his swollen knee, then Marcus extracts a wand from his branch and lunges at Alex. Zephyr stands between them and with a snap of his ear, Marcus is launched backwards. The tiny goblin crosses his legs in victory and then turns to stride away. Alex beams. Later, everyone gathers in the vast room, and he drifts between the benches. Grindel stands by the window, patting his parrot. Sitting at the Ravenclaw bench, Leonard scans the room as Hermione enters the doorway grinning. Sam and Alex are ecstatic to see her; beaming widely, they rise to their toes as she sprints down the room to join her companions."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
