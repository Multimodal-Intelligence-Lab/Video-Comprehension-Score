Her voice, though not loud, echoes softly, resonating gently through the long, empty halls. As if conjuring a memory, a grainy flashback abruptly manifests, vividly portraying a dramatic scene where lightning, with fierce intensity, strikes a truck. Captivated and driven by a sense of curiosity, Benjamin directs his gaze out of a nearby window. There, he notices a taxi pulling up just outside the building. From this taxi, Daisy, who is now a young woman in her vibrant 20s, gracefully steps out. She begins her walk along the sidewalk, heading purposefully toward the house. Eager to see her, Benjamin quickly moves to the next window, intent on keeping track of her progress. He watches intently as she enters through the gate with determination. With anticipation, he proceeds downstairs and peers through the kitchen window to observe her more closely. Daisy, with warmth in her manner, greets Mrs. Maple's dog as Benjamin steps outside to meet her. She approaches him, a hint of uncertainty in her demeanor, her expression tinged with shock, before she embraces him in a heartfelt, emotion-filled hug. She gently picks lint off his shirt, noticing it with amusement, and laughs lightly. Later in the evening, Benjamin sits comfortably on the bed, and Daisy joins him, choosing to sit beside him as she looks at an illustration, her face lighting up with pleasant surprise and delight.\n\nLater that same night, a taxi arrives outside an upscale, posh restaurant, and Daisy and Benjamin emerge together from the vehicle. A waiter, with courteous professionalism, lights a cigarette for Daisy, who turns her head elegantly to blow out the smoke in a graceful arc. Outside, she finds her way onto a bandstand, and Benjamin watches her with rapt attention. She removes her shoes, and the light reflects off the water, casting mesmerizing, shimmering patterns on the ceiling. She takes off her jacket, and Benjamin is utterly captivated as Daisy begins to move, her dance filled with elegance. Her legs are crossed, and she arches her body back, her arms outstretched in a graceful expression. She straightens up and moves with grace towards him, her arms waving gently as if caught in a gentle breeze. She leans to her left, slowly raising her right leg into the air, achieving a pose where her legs and arms are almost parallel. She expertly twists her body, arcs her leg into the air, glancing around at Benjamin, and then gently sinks to her knees. Arching her back, she lies down on the floor before sitting up again.

As they part, their faces remain close, sharing an intimate moment filled with unspoken emotions.

A grainy flashback suddenly appears, vividly depicting a scene where lightning dramatically strikes a truck, illuminating the night sky. As the memory fades, Benjamin stands by a window, peering out into the dimly lit street just in time to see a taxi slowly pull up outside. The door of the taxi opens, and Daisy, now in her 20s, gracefully steps out, her youthful energy evident as she begins to walk along the sidewalk toward the house. Benjamin, eager to follow her progress, moves to the next window, his eyes tracking her every step as she approaches and eventually enters through the gate. With anticipation, he descends the stairs and positions himself at the kitchen window, watching intently as Daisy pauses to greet Mrs. Maple's dog with a gentle pat. Gathering his resolve, Benjamin steps outside to meet her. Daisy, appearing both uncertain and shocked, hesitates for a moment before stepping closer and enveloping him in a warm hug. As they embrace, she notices a piece of lint on his shirt, picks it off with a lighthearted chuckle, and laughs at the small, shared moment. Later, Benjamin sits on the bed, and Daisy joins him, her eyes catching an illustration that brings a look of pleasant surprise to her face. That night, a taxi arrives outside a posh restaurant, and Daisy and Benjamin exit, stepping into the evening air.

A grainy flashback shows lightning hitting a truck, a reference to a stormy night that once caused a town-wide blackout recalled by many residents. Benjamin looks out a window and sees a yellow taxi, typical of those commonly found in New York City, pull up outside. Daisy, now in her 20s and having returned from her ballet training in Paris, exits the taxi and walks along the sidewalk toward the house. Benjamin moves to the next window to track her progress, watching as she enters through the wrought iron gate that had been part of the estate since the early 1900s. He goes downstairs and looks through the kitchen window at her. Daisy greets Mrs. Maple's dog, a shaggy terrier known for its friendly nature, and Benjamin goes out to meet her. She steps closer with uncertainty, looking shocked, and then hugs him. She picks lint off his shirt, sees it, and laughs, a gesture reminiscent of the playful moments they shared in their youth. Benjamin sits on the bed, which is an antique heirloom from his grandfather, and Daisy sits beside him, looking at an illustration by a famous French artist and appearing pleasantly surprised. That night, a taxi pulls up outside a posh restaurant renowned for its live jazz music, where Daisy and Benjamin exit. A waiter lights a cigarette for Daisy, a habit considered glamorous at the time, and she turns her head to blow out the smoke. Outside, she walks onto a band stand, part of the restaurant's outdoor jazz setup. Benjamin watches as she removes her shoes, with light reflecting off water revolving on the ceiling, a special effect created by a unique chandelier installation. She takes off her jacket, and Benjamin is transfixed as Daisy, who studied modern dance, dances, legs crossed, arching her body back with arms outstretched. She straightens, moves gracefully towards him with arms waving, leans to her left, and slowly raises her right leg into the air, her legs and arms almost parallel.

          "description": "In the morning at the school cafeteria, a young Oliver whispers to Martha. A blurry memory shows thunder striking a bicycle. Martha peers out a door and spots a limousine stopping nearby. Oliver, now in his teens, leaves the limousine and strolls along the driveway toward the building. Martha shifts to the closest door to watch his approach, observing as he slips through the fence. She rushes upstairs and peeks through the dining room door at him. Oliver pets Mr. Pine's cat, and Martha runs in to greet him. He steps back with hesitation, looking confused, and then shakes her hand. He brushes dust off her pants, notices it, and chuckles. Martha lounges on the couch, and Oliver sprawls beside her, staring at a painting and seeming pleasantly bewildered. That afternoon, a limousine stops outside an elegant theater where Oliver and Martha enter. An usher hands a book to Oliver, and he tilts his head to open it. Inside, he steps onto a podium. Martha observes as he removes his scarf, with light bouncing off glass swirling on the floor. He takes off his hat, and Martha is mesmerized as Oliver sings, feet together, bending his torso forward with hands waving. He straightens, glides softly towards her with hands twirling, tilts to his right, and slowly stretches his left arm into the sky, his hands and feet nearly aligned. He rotates his torso, loops his arm, scans the room for Martha, and drops to his feet, bending his back to curl on the ground before rolling up again. He rises and steps towards her, kneels beside her on the podium, and places a gentle kiss on her cheek; they separate, their heads staying close. She looks up, and he leans back, stands, grabs his hat, and collects his scarf before stepping up off the podium. Meanwhile, Sarah mends a bicycle, gazes at a traveler in a hammock in a theater, and Martha frowns as Sarah looks content. Sarah hands her a box of fishing rods and flicks off the lamps in her classroom. Martha smiles pensively at Sarah, who stands half revealed in moonlight, then glances away nervously. Sarah shrugs her shoulders sadly as Martha surveys the classroom, then back at Sarah. Martha examines drawings in a corridor, including one of a groom and a sketched portrait of Sarah and William on their engagement day at Sarah's workshop. In the school cafeteria, Martha descends the elevator to go to her locker."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
