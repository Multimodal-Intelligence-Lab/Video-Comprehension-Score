Thenardier opens his arms, but Cosette shakes her head at him. Thenardier beckons Cosette to him, but she doesn't go as Madame Thenardier gasps. Valjean grabs back his hat that Thenardier had taken and then takes Cosette, giving her a doll and carrying her away to the inn. Javert rides up and then rides away as Madame Thenardier shoves her husband, who leans in for a kiss, but she pushes him away. Valjean and Cosette ride through the night in a carriage, where she sleeps with her head resting on his lap, and Valjean strokes her hair while the moon shines through trees in the forest. He looks down fondly at the sleeping child, then sees Javert and stuffs the doll inside his coat.

Valjean lowers Cosette on the rope on the other side of the wall, climbs down himself, and carries Cosette as they peer into a chapel lit by the golden glow of candlelight, where a group of nuns is singing. Holding Cosette, Valjean turns and sees a man with a spade, who throws down his spade and takes off his hat. They go with Fauchelevant. High up on a tower, Javert stands facing an ornate cross, closes a Bible, and walks out to a ledge overlooking Paris, beside a huge stone eagle, as the tower rises up behind him to a spire with a cross on top.

She drops the pail and dashes to conceal behind a tree, observing him fearfully as moonbeam glows faintly on her youthful visage. Cosette brightens, takes his arm, and he carries the pail brimming with water through town, where Madame Thenardier walks up and takes the pail. Thenardier opens his arms, but Cosette shakes her head at him. Thenardier gestures Cosette to him, but she doesn't go as Madame Thenardier gasps. Valjean seizes back his hat that Thenardier had taken and then takes Cosette, giving her a figurine and carrying her away to the inn. Javert rides up and then rides away as Madame Thenardier shoves her spouse, who leans in for a peck, but she pushes him away. Valjean and Cosette ride through the night in a carriage, where she slumbers with her head resting on his lap, and Valjean caresses her hair while the moon gleams through trees in the forest. He gazes down fondly at the slumbering child, then notices Javert and stuffs the figurine inside his coat. They get out of the carriage and run off hand in hand by the city wall as Javert, on horseback, sees them and gives chase. They run along a colonnade, and Valjean climbs over a stone balustrade, lifting Cosette over as Javert is forced to halt and turn back. Valjean pulls down a cord dangling from the side of a structure, and now on foot, Javert marches along a passageway. As Javert searches along dim passageways, Valjean climbs to the top of a wall, struggling as Cosette observes fearfully. Using the cord, he hoists her up beside him, and they lie still along the top of the wall with Javert below them, who then walks off. Valjean lowers Cosette on the cord on the other side of the wall, climbs down himself, and carries Cosette as they peer into a chapel illuminated by the golden glow of candlelight, where a group of nuns is singing. Holding Cosette, Valjean turns and sees a man with a spade, who throws down his spade and removes his hat. They go with Fauchelevant.

The bucket is dropped by her, and she runs to hide behind a tree, fearfully watching him as her young face is faintly glowed upon by moonlight. Valjean is brightened by Cosette, who takes his arm, and the bucket full of water is carried by him through town, where up walks Madame Thenardier, taking the bucket. His arms are opened by Thenardier, but her head is shaken at him by Cosette. Cosette is beckoned by Thenardier, but she doesn't go as a gasp is given by Madame Thenardier. Thenardier is shoved by Madame Thenardier, who had taken Valjean’s hat, grabbed back by Valjean, and then Cosette is taken by him, with a doll being given to her and carried away to the inn. Javert rides up and then rides away, while Madame Thenardier shoves her husband, who leans in for a kiss, but being pushed away by her. Through the night, Valjean and Cosette are ridden in a carriage by them, where her head is resting on Valjean’s lap as she sleeps, and her hair is stroked by him while the moon shines through trees in the forest. Fondly, he looks down at the sleeping child, then Javert is seen by him, and the doll is stuffed inside his coat. Out of the carriage, they are gotten by them, and hand in hand, they run off by the city wall as on horseback Javert sees them and gives chase. Along a colonnade, they run, and a stone balustrade is climbed over by Valjean, Cosette is lifted over as Javert is forced to stop and turn back. A rope dangling from the side of a building is pulled down by Valjean, and now on foot, an alleyway is marched along by Javert. As dark alleyways are searched by Javert, the top of a wall is climbed by Valjean, struggling as he is watched fearfully by Cosette. Using the rope, she is hauled up beside him by him, and still along the top of the wall, they lie with Javert below them, then walking off. Cosette is lowered on the rope by Valjean on the other side of the wall, climbing down himself, and she is carried by him as they peer into a chapel lit by the golden glow of candlelight, where a group of nuns is singing. Turning, while holding Cosette, a man with a spade is seen by Valjean, who throws down his spade and takes off his hat. Fauchelevant goes with them. High up on a tower, Javert faces an ornate cross, a Bible is closed by him, and out to a ledge overlooking Paris, he walks, beside a huge stone eagle, as behind him a spire with a cross on top rises up the tower. In the corner of the wasteland where the Bastille stood, a giant elephant stands, constructed by Napoleon for a monument, now dowdy and decaying, and out of a hole in the elephant's head, a scruffy, ratty-haired urchin climbs."

Her young face is illuminated by the faint glow of the moonlight, which casts a gentle light upon her features. Upon recognizing Valjean, Cosette's demeanor changes; she brightens up and takes his arm with newfound trust. Valjean, with a reassuring presence, lifts the bucket now full of water and carries it through the town. As they proceed, Madame Thenardier approaches them and takes the bucket from Valjean. Thenardier, with open arms, gestures for Cosette to come to him, but she resolutely shakes her head, refusing his beckoning. Madame Thenardier gasps in surprise at Cosette's defiance.

As she wearily trudges along the path, she suddenly notices Valjean approaching her. Startled by his unexpected presence, she drops the bucket with a loud clatter and quickly scurries away to hide behind a nearby tree, cautiously peering out from her hiding spot. Her youthful face is illuminated by the faint glow of the moonlight, which casts a gentle, ethereal light upon her delicate features. Upon recognizing Valjean, Cosette's demeanor shifts dramatically; she brightens up and takes his arm with newfound trust and relief. Valjean, embodying a reassuring presence, lifts the now full bucket of water and carries it as they make their way through the town. As they proceed, Madame Thenardier approaches them and takes the bucket from Valjean with a possessive gesture. Thenardier, with open arms, gestures eagerly for Cosette to come to him, but she resolutely shakes her head, firmly refusing his beckoning. Madame Thenardier gasps in surprise at Cosette's act of defiance. Valjean, undeterred by the situation, retrieves his hat that Thenardier had taken without permission and then gently takes Cosette by the hand, presenting her with a special doll. He carries her away to the inn, where they find much-needed refuge. Meanwhile, Javert rides up on horseback, only to ride away again as Madame Thenardier, in frustration, shoves her own husband, who leans in for a kiss, only to be dismissively pushed away by her. As night envelops them in its dark embrace, Valjean and Cosette travel in a carriage, with Cosette peacefully sleeping, her head resting on Valjean's comforting lap.

Startled, she instinctively lets go of the bucket, allowing it to fall to the ground with a thud, and quickly darts away, seeking refuge behind a nearby tree. From her hiding spot, she peers out, her eyes wide with fear, as the faint glow of moonlight softly illuminates her young face. As Valjean draws nearer, Cosette's demeanor shifts; her expression brightens with a newfound sense of hope, and she steps forward to take his arm with a sense of trust. Valjean, now with Cosette by his side, picks up the bucket, which is full of water, and they proceed to walk through the town together. As they make their way, Madame Thenardier approaches them, her presence commanding as she reaches out to take the bucket from Valjean. Thenardier, standing nearby, opens his arms in a welcoming gesture towards Cosette, but she responds by shaking her head, indicating her reluctance. Undeterred, Thenardier beckons her to come closer, but Cosette remains steadfast, refusing to move, which prompts a gasp from Madame Thenardier. In a swift motion, Valjean retrieves his hat from Thenardier, who had taken it, and then turns his attention back to Cosette, presenting her with a doll as a gesture of kindness before carrying her away towards the inn. As they depart, Javert arrives on horseback, his presence imposing, but he soon rides away, leaving Madame Thenardier to express her frustration by shoving her husband, who leans in for a kiss, only to be pushed away. Valjean and Cosette continue their journey through the night in a carriage, where Cosette, feeling safe and secure, falls asleep with her head resting gently on Valjean's lap. Valjean tenderly strokes her hair, his gaze softening as he looks down fondly at the sleeping child, while the moonlight filters through the trees in the forest, casting a serene glow. Suddenly, Valjean's attention is drawn to the sight of Javert, prompting him to quickly stuff the doll inside his coat for safekeeping. They soon disembark from the carriage, urgency in their movements, and run hand in hand along the city wall as Javert, relentless in his pursuit, spots them and gives chase on horseback. The pair races along a colonnade, and Valjean, with determination, climbs over a stone balustrade, lifting Cosette over to safety as Javert is forced to halt and reconsider his path. Valjean then pulls down a rope that dangles from the side of a building, while Javert, now on foot, marches with purpose along an alleyway. As Javert continues his search through the dark, narrow passages, Valjean struggles to climb to the top of a wall, with Cosette watching anxiously. Using the rope, he manages to haul her up beside him, and they lie still along the top of the wall, holding their breath as Javert passes below them, unaware of their presence, and eventually walks off. Valjean carefully lowers Cosette on the rope to the other side of the wall, then climbs down himself, and with Cosette in his arms, they cautiously peer into a chapel, where the warm, golden glow of candlelight reveals a group of nuns singing in harmony. Holding Cosette close, Valjean turns to see a man with a spade, who, upon noticing them, throws down his spade and respectfully removes his hat. They proceed to go with Fauchelevant, who offers them refuge. Meanwhile, high up on a tower, Javert stands solemnly facing an ornate cross, closing a Bible with a sense of finality before stepping out onto a ledge that overlooks the vast expanse of Paris. Beside him, a huge stone eagle stands as a silent sentinel, while the tower rises majestically behind him, culminating in a spire topped with a cross. In a different part of the city, standing in the corner of the wasteland where the Bastille once stood, is a giant elephant, a model that Napoleon had constructed for a monument, now appearing dowdy and decaying.

She drops the bucket, spilling the water she had painstakingly fetched from the village well, and runs to hide behind a tree, watching him fearfully as moonlight glows faintly on her young face. Cosette brightens, recognizing the kindness in his eyes, takes his arm, and he carries the bucket full of water through the village of Montfermeil, where Madame Thenardier, the innkeeper's wife known for her shrewdness and cruelty, walks up and takes the bucket. Thenardier, the innkeeper whose avarice and greed know no bounds, opens his arms, but Cosette shakes her head at him. Thenardier beckons Cosette to him, but she doesn't go as Madame Thenardier gasps.

They go with Fauchelevant, a man whose life Valjean once saved and who now offers his help. High up on a tower, Javert stands facing an ornate cross, closes a Bible, and walks out to a ledge overlooking Paris, beside a huge stone eagle, as the tower rises up behind him to a spire with a cross on top, symbolizing his rigid sense of justice. Standing in the corner of the wasteland where the Bastille stood, a symbol of tyranny and its fall, is a giant elephant, a model Napoleon had constructed for a monument, now dowdy and decaying, from which a scruffy, ratty-haired urchin, reminiscent of the forgotten poor of Paris, climbs out of a hole in the elephant's head."

Xavier opens her arms, but Oliver shakes his head at her. Xavier beckons Oliver to her, but he doesn't go as Captain Xavier gasps.

Marjorie and Oliver ride through the dusk in a wagon, where he naps with his head resting on her lap, and Marjorie strokes his hair while the starlight shines through clouds over the meadow.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
