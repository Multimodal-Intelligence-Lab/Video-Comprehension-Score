Suze jerks her head at the door of their shared apartment in London, and Tarquin hands Suze the lamp. Suze pushes a stack of unpaid bills across the kitchen table towards Rebecca, who pushes them back, signaling her refusal to accept financial help, and then the girls knock back shots of tequila bought from a nearby corner shop and run out into the street.

At the office, Rebecca, wearing pink, her signature color, bends the article she is editing, turns to her pink laptop, a gift from her parents for her first job, and types something in Google, then leans forward to read what's popped up as the corner of her mouth drops in shock. At a high-stakes conference held in a sleek modern building, all eyes are on Rebecca, who gulps nervously as Luke smiles like a Cheshire cat, Mr. Xander, the CEO, looks cornered by her unexpected comment, and Luke grins, having not meant for her to say that in front of everyone.

          "description": "Fiona's cousin, Malcolm, is showcased as the elders jump, and Malcolm, grasping a trumpet, looks bewildered. Fiona flicks her thumb at the window, and Malcolm hands Fiona the trumpet. Fiona shoves a pile of tomatoes across the garden bench towards Clara, who shoves them back, and then the elders sip tea and stroll into the park. Clara slips off her chair as they race to a fountain, where a dog walker ambles by with a crowded picnic basket. The next afternoon, Clara is at a museum with her uncle, Liz, and aunt, Harold, where her uncle juggles a bowling pin. The scene features a scarf and Clara’s umbrella as she descends in the elevator of the Humble-Park structure. Just after a courier rolls in a bicycle through the revolving door, Clara glimpses her red envelope among the piles of magazines. When the elevator reveals itself and a chef rolls out a dessert cart, she steps aside to permit him to pass, then crouches behind it to slip through the portal. Clara slides a hand into a robe draped on the cart and attempts to snatch the note, trying to snag it with a cowboy boot and flinging at the bicycle with the footwear. She conceals herself in a yellow jacket as Marvin strides away, and the dessert cart is rolled away, leaving Clara sprawled on the ground, clutching her note. Clara glances from Nathan to the dessert cart and some sketches on the bulletin board, perches on a wobbly stool, and twists her shoelace as the cheerful secretary chuckles. Ethan glances strangely at Clara, and she turns towards Nancy, trying to track his stare. Nancy grins foolishly as he leans backward. Clara and Fiona are in a bakery where she tries to draw from a comic, then they listen to a podcast at home. Clara tosses books into cardboard boxes and crams them into a dresser, closing the dresser that's jam-packed as kittens beckon her. At the studio, Clara, donning yellow, bends the pamphlet, turns to her yellow tablet, and types something on Bing, then leans backward to view what’s appeared as the edge of his eyebrow rises. At a seminar, all attention is on Clara, who sips anxiously as Ethan smiles like a fox, Mr. Benson appears trapped, and Ethan grins, having not intended for her to declare that. Clara grins with newfound energy, and as she jaunts down a boulevard, a leaf flutters down towards her and lands on her hat; it’s a leaflet for an art exhibition. In his mansion, Ethan's mentor, Norman, hurls a toy airplane at a toy race track. Clara is in the line for the art exhibition as people shuffle from a gate and saunter by with their artworks. Then, another gate swings open, and the people in the line twist their necks."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
