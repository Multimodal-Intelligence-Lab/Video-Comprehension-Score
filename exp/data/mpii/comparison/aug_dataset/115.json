He stops by a majolica jar filled with sand, takes a pencil from his vest, and stands over the jar, extinguishing his cigar carefully so as not to damage it, then puts the half-smoked cigar into his vest pocket with the pencil. They move on and stop at a door lettered in embossed chromium: EDWARD S. NORTON, JR., PRESIDENT. Keyes opens the door and they go in. As Keyes and Neff enter, the door to Norton's private office opens, and Mr. Norton is letting out three legal-looking gentlemen. Norton, who is about forty-five, very well-groomed, and rather pompous in manner, sees Keyes and Neff. Neff puts down his hat and briefcase, and he and Keyes pass the legal-looking men and follow Norton into his office, which is naturally the best in the building; modern but not modernistic, spacious, and very well furnished, including flowers, smoking stands, and easy chairs.

As he strides toward his workspace, he encounters Keyes, who is donned in his vest and hat but no jacket. Keyes is holding a dossier of documents and puffing a cigar. He pauses by a majolica container filled with sand, takes a pencil from his vest, and stands over the container, snuffing his cigar meticulously so as not to mar it, then places the half-smoked cigar into his vest pocket with the pencil. They proceed and halt at a portal inscribed in embossed chromium: EDWARD S. NORTON, JR., PRESIDENT. Keyes opens the portal and they enter. As Keyes and Neff step in, the portal to Norton's private workspace opens, and Mr. Norton is ushering out three legal-appearing gentlemen. Norton, who is about forty-five, very well-groomed, and rather bombastic in demeanor, notices Keyes and Neff. Neff sets down his hat and briefcase, and he and Keyes pass by the legal-appearing gentlemen and trail Norton into his workspace, which is naturally the best in the edifice; contemporary but not ultramodern, roomy, and very well adorned, including flowers, smoking stands, and easy chairs. Norton has proceeded behind his desk, and after Keyes enters, Neff shuts the portal quietly. Norton disapprovingly glances at Keyes in shirt sleeves and smiles icily. Keyes and Neff perch while Norton remains standing and paces back and forth behind his desk contemplating deeply. There is a charged pause as he gazes back and forth between Keyes and Neff. The dictophone on his desk buzzes, and he reaches over to depress a key and places the earpiece to his ear, then restores it and turns back to Keyes and Neff. Keyes and Neff begin to rise just as the assistant opens the portal. Neff stands gazing at the portal and then relaxes with an evident exertion of will as Phyllis enters wearing a gray custom-fitted suit, a petite black hat with a veil, black gloves, and carrying a black satchel. The assistant shuts the portal behind her. Mr. Norton proceeds to greet her and pivots slightly towards Keyes, arranging a chair for Phyllis, who sits and nods silently. Neff stands behind a false mantelpiece, utterly expressionless, staring directly at Phyllis, and their gazes meet for a fraction of a second. She gestures as if to rise angrily, turns, and departs, the portal shutting after her. There is a significant pause, and Keyes rises, seizes the tumbler of water out of Norton's grip, and drains it in one large swallow while Norton observes him nearly bewildered."

Soon after, Neff emerges into the reception room, moving through the doors with noticeable purpose, his hat perched neatly on his head and a briefcase snugly tucked under his arm. As Neff strides purposefully towards his office within the bustling building, he encounters Keyes. Keyes, dressed only in his vest and hat, noticeably lacks a coat. He is holding a sizable file of papers and nonchalantly smoking a cigar. Stopping momentarily by a sturdy majolica jar filled with sand, Keyes methodically retrieves a pencil from his vest pocket. He stands over the jar with deliberate care, gently extinguishing his cigar, ensuring not to cause any damage, then meticulously places the half-smoked cigar back into his vest pocket alongside the pencil. \n\nTogether, Keyes and Neff proceed onward, pausing at a door prominently marked with embossed chromium letters that read: EDWARD S.

As they make their entrance, the door leading to Norton's private office swings open, and they observe Mr. Norton ushering out three distinguished legal-looking gentlemen. Mr. Norton, who appears to be around forty-five years old, is impeccably groomed and exudes a rather self-important air. He notices Keyes and Neff entering.

Norton casts a disapproving glance at Keyes, who is dressed in nothing more than shirt sleeves, and offers a frosty smile. Both Keyes and Neff settle into their seats while Norton remains standing, pacing thoughtfully behind his desk, deep in contemplation. An electrified pause ensues as he scans back and forth between Keyes and Neff. The dictograph on his desk suddenly buzzes, prompting him to reach over, press a key, and place the earpiece against his ear, before settling it back onto the desk and turning his attention once more to Keyes and Neff. \n\nAs Keyes and Neff begin to rise, the secretary opens the door. Neff stands momentarily, staring intently at the door, then visibly relaxes with a determined effort as Phyllis enters, dressed in a sophisticated gray tailored suit, donning a small black hat with a delicate veil, black gloves, and carrying an elegant black bag.

As Keyes and Neff make their entrance, the door to Norton's private office swings open, unveiling Mr. Norton as he ushers out three men who have the distinct appearance of legal professionals. Norton, who appears about forty-five, impeccably groomed and exuding a certain pompous demeanor, takes note of Keyes and Neff. Without delay, Neff sets down his hat and briefcase, deftly navigating past the legal-looking gentlemen to join Norton, who leads them into his office, which stands as the finest in the building. This space is modern yet not excessively so, generously proportioned, and tastefully adorned with flowers, smoking stands, and plush easy chairs. Norton, now situated behind his desk, observes as Keyes follows suit, prompting Neff to quietly shut the door behind them.

Keyes and Neff start to get up just as the secretary opens the door. Neff stands staring at the door and then relaxes with an obvious effort of will as Phyllis comes in wearing a gray tailored suit a small black hat with a veil black gloves and carrying a black bag. The secretary closes the door behind her. Mr Norton goes to meet her and turns a little towards Keyes arranging a chair for Phyllis who sits and nods silently. Neff stands behind a false mantel completely deadpan staring straight at Phyllis and their eyes meet for a fraction of a second. She makes as if to rise indignantly turns and walks out the door closing after her. There is a pregnant pause and Keyes stands up grabs the glass of water out of Norton's hand and drains it in one big gulp while Norton watches him almost stupefied."

          "description": "Griffin lounges beside the gramophone. Griffin glides past the courtyard archway with his scarf fluttering and his backpack dangling from his fingers. As he saunters toward his cubicle, he bumps into Harper, who is sporting his overalls and scarf but no boots. Harper is clutching a stack of magazines and chewing on a breadstick. He pauses by a porcelain pitcher brimming with pebbles, extracts a crayon from his overalls, and hovers over the pitcher, snapping his breadstick carefully so as not to spill, then slips the half-snapped breadstick into his overalls pocket with the crayon. They shuffle onward and halt at a portal etched in embossed platinum: MARGARET Q. HARPERSON, SR., TREASURER. Harper swings open the portal and they stride in. As Harper and Griffin enter, the entrance to Harperson's private chamber swings wide, and Ms. Harperson is ushering out three doctor-like people. Harperson, who is about thirty-five, exceptionally polished, and somewhat overbearing in demeanor, acknowledges Harper and Griffin. Griffin drops his scarf and backpack, and he and Harper breeze past the doctor-like figures and trail Harperson into her chamber, which is predictably the finest in the complex; contemporary yet not avant-garde, grand, and exquisitely adorned, featuring statuettes, magazine racks, and recliner sofas. Harperson has drifted behind her console, and after Harper steps through, Griffin gently shuts the entrance. Harperson disdainfully peers at Harper in casual attire and grins icily. Harper and Griffin settle into chairs while Harperson stays upright and meanders behind her console pondering intensely. There is a tense silence as she gazes back and forth between Harper and Griffin. The intercom on her console rings, and she leans over to press a switch and puts the receiver to her ear, then returns it and redirects her attention to Harper and Griffin. Harper and Griffin begin to rise just as the assistant swings open the entrance. Griffin stands scrutinizing the entrance and then unwinds with a visible effort of resolve as Clarissa enters clad in a cerulean embroidered gown, a petite ruby beret with a netted veil, crimson mittens, and clutching a crimson tote. The assistant swings the entrance closed behind her. Ms. Harperson advances to greet her and pivots slightly towards Harper, setting up a couch for Clarissa, who perches and nods mutely. Griffin stands opposite a faux column, utterly impassive, gazing directly at Clarissa, and their eyes lock momentarily. She acts as if to leap indignantly, pivots, and strides out, the entrance swinging shut behind her. There is an expectant lull, and Harper rises, snatches the tumbler of lemonade out of Harperson's grasp, and quaffs it in one substantial swig while Harperson observes him almost flabbergasted."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Norton, Jr.'s office, who is releasing three legal-looking men. Neff and Keyes follow Norton, who remains standing and thinking hard as he disapprovingly looks at Keyes in shirt sleeves. After a pause, the secretary introduces Phyllis, who enters in a gray suit and black accessories. Neff maintains a deadpan stare as their eyes meet briefly. Phyllis makes as if to leave indignantly, exiting the room. Keyes stands up and swiftly drinks Norton's water, leaving Norton astonished."
