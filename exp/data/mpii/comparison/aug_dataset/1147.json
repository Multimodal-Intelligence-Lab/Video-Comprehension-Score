As the forces from their wands collide, they merge like molten lava, bursting into an explosion of bright and dazzling flames. Sparks fly wildly as the two adversaries engage in a fierce struggle, each desperately trying to overpower the other. Harry, his wand trembling under the strain, grips it tightly with both hands to maintain control, while Voldemort's face contorts with intense hatred and malice. Around them, streaks of glowing light erupt in every direction, casting an eerie glow across the dark, night sky. In this surreal scene, ghostly apparitions of Voldemort's victims begin to manifest; first appears Cedric, followed by the spectral figure of Bryce, the elderly caretaker who met his fate in the mansion. Moving closer to Harry, the ghostly figures of his father and mother materialize, offering him companionship, and his father begins to speak. Seizing a crucial moment, Harry breaks the magical connection and swiftly grabs Cedric, simultaneously catching hold of the cup as it soars towards him, while Voldemort lets out a howl of sheer frustration. Back in the arena, Harry lands with Cedric, and the spectators erupt into a frenzy of excitement and confusion. Sensing that something might be dreadfully amiss, Fleur becomes anxious. Dumbledore rises quickly, attempting to pull Harry away, but Harry refuses to let go of Cedric's lifeless body. Mr. Diggory pushes through the crowd with urgency, breaking down in tears over his son. As Moody steps in to assist Harry, guiding him away, the students stand rooted in place, stunned into a deep, silent shock. Harry, still reeling from the ordeal, finds himself entering Professor Moody's dimly lit room. The weighty wooden door closes with a heavy iron lock sliding shut. Harry stands there, caught in a trance-like state, his complexion pale and his body shaking. He's clutching his injured arm, with clothes torn and his face bloodied. Moody draws up a stool, seating Harry in front of the warm fireplace, exposing the deep gash on Harry’s arm, and grips it firmly. As Moody's face twists with visible distress, he reaches for his hip flask only to find it empty. He rushes into the adjacent room, frantically searching through a wooden box filled with bottles, which all turn out to be disappointingly empty. Moody stands helplessly in the doorway, scanning the shelves with his wild, mad eye before suddenly grabbing Harry's arm, tasting the blood from his fingers. Just then, the door bursts open with force, and Moody is violently thrown against the cold, stone wall. Dumbledore seizes him, and Snape steps forward, administering truth serum into Moody’s mouth. Moody’s gaze shifts toward the locked trunk, prompting Snape to flick his wand, causing the lid to fly open. Inside, astonishingly, six more trunks reveal themselves, each nested within the other. Dumbledore, Snape, and McGonagall lean over to peer into the deepest shaft of the trunk, where a figure with one leg and a single eye lies far below. As Snape sniffs the contents of the flask, everyone watches intently as Moody’s face and body start to violently convulse and twist. He tears off the leather patch with the rolling, mad eye and throws it aside, transforming into a much younger man who lashes out with anger. It is revealed to be Mr. Crouch's son, who lunges aggressively at Harry as Barty unveils the infamous dark mark. Dumbledore carefully examines Harry’s wound, while Snape presses his wand firmly against Barty's cheek. Barty narrows his eyes, revealing a flickering tongue. The entire student body gathers in the grand and majestic great hall, and later, Dumbledore discovers Harry somberly packing his suitcase in the boys' dormitory."

As the potent forces erupting from their wands collide with great force, they merge like molten lava, culminating in an explosion of light that bursts into a display of bright and dazzling flames. Sparks fly wildly through the air, adding chaos to the scene, as the two adversaries engage in a fierce and desperate struggle, each one trying with all their might to overpower the other. Harry, his wand trembling violently under the strain of the magical duel, grips it tightly with both hands to maintain control and stability, while Voldemort's face contorts with intense, seething hatred and malice. Around them, streaks of glowing light erupt fiercely in every direction, casting an eerie, otherworldly glow across the dark, foreboding night sky. Amidst this surreal, dreamlike scene, ghostly apparitions of Voldemort's victims begin to manifest; first emerges Cedric, followed by the spectral, wispy figure of Bryce, the elderly caretaker who met his untimely fate in the mansion. Moving ever closer to Harry, the ghostly figures of his father and mother materialize, offering him companionship and comfort, as his father begins to speak words of encouragement. Seizing a crucial, fleeting moment of opportunity, Harry breaks the magical connection between their wands and swiftly grabs Cedric, simultaneously catching hold of the cup as it soars towards him, while Voldemort lets out a howl of sheer, gut-wrenching frustration. Back in the bustling arena, Harry lands with Cedric beside him, and the spectators erupt into a whirlwind of excitement and confusion. Sensing that something might be dreadfully amiss, Fleur becomes understandably anxious and worried. Dumbledore rises quickly, attempting to pull Harry away from the scene, but Harry refuses to let go of Cedric's lifeless body. Mr. Diggory pushes through the crowd urgently, breaking down in tears over his beloved son. As Moody steps in to assist Harry, guiding him away from the chaos, the students stand rooted in place, stunned into a deep, silent shock that reverberates through the crowd. Harry, still reeling from the overwhelming ordeal, finds himself entering Professor Moody's dimly lit room. The weighty wooden door closes behind him with a heavy iron lock sliding shut with a decisive clank. Harry stands there, caught in a trance-like state, his complexion pale as a ghost and his body shaking visibly. He's clutching his injured arm, his clothes torn and his face bloodied from the brutal encounter. Moody draws up a sturdy stool, seating Harry in front of the warm, flickering fireplace, exposing the deep gash on Harry’s arm, and grips it firmly with concern. As Moody's face twists with visible distress, he reaches instinctively for his trusty hip flask only to find it disappointingly empty. He rushes into the adjacent room with urgency, frantically searching through a wooden box filled with bottles, which all turn out to be disappointingly empty as well. Moody stands helplessly in the doorway, scanning the shelves with his wild, mad eye, before suddenly deciding to grab Harry's arm, tasting the blood from his fingertips in a bizarre, unsettling moment. Just then, the door bursts open with force, and Moody is violently thrown against the cold, unforgiving stone wall. Dumbledore seizes him with authority, and Snape steps forward with determination, administering truth serum directly into Moody’s mouth. Moody’s gaze shifts significantly toward the locked, mysterious trunk, prompting Snape to flick his wand, causing the lid to fly open dramatically. Inside, astonishingly, six more trunks reveal themselves, each nested intricately within the other. Dumbledore, Snape, and McGonagall lean over to peer deeply into the farthest, deepest shaft of the trunk, where a figure with one leg and a single eye lies far below. As Snape sniffs the contents of the flask intently, everyone watches with bated breath as Moody’s face and body start to violently convulse and twist. He tears off the leather patch with the rolling, mad eye and throws it aside, transforming before their eyes into a much younger man who lashes out with unbridled anger. It is revealed to be Mr. Crouch's son, who lunges aggressively at Harry as Barty unveils the infamous dark mark on his arm. Dumbledore carefully examines Harry’s wound, while Snape presses his wand with firm conviction against Barty's cheek. Barty narrows his eyes defiantly, revealing a flickering, serpentine tongue. The entire student body later gathers in the grand and majestic great hall, and in a quieter moment, Dumbledore discovers Harry somberly packing his suitcase in the boys' dormitory, lost in his thoughts."

As this fiery explosion settles, sparks fly in every direction, reflecting the fierce struggle as Harry and Voldemort fight desperately to overcome each other. Harry grips his quivering wand with both hands, channeling all his strength into maintaining control, while Voldemort's face contorts into a grimace of pure hatred. Streaks of light explode around them, punctuating the dark sky above, as the ghostly images of Voldemort's victims begin to materialize in the air; first, Cedric appears, followed by Bryce, the elderly caretaker who met his end in the mansion. As the apparitions continue to form, Harry's father and mother appear intimately at his side, his father speaking softly to him, offering strength. In a decisive move, Harry breaks the magical connection, reaching swiftly for Cedric as the cup, imbued with its portkey magic, hurtles into his grasp, while Voldemort howls in frustration at losing his prey. Harry and Cedric crash-land into the arena, where the spectators erupt into wild cheers, the noise filling the stadium. Yet amidst the jubilation, Fleur senses that something is amiss, and Dumbledore rises quickly, attempting to pull Harry away from the scene, but Harry is unwilling to let go, clinging tightly to Cedric's lifeless body. As Mr. Diggory forces his way through the mass of spectators, he collapses in grief, weeping over his son's body. Meanwhile, Moody maneuvers through the chaos, lifting Harry to his feet and guiding him away as the students stand by, struck silent by the unfolding tragedy. In a state of shock, Harry finds himself inside Professor Moody's dimly lit room, where Moody slides the iron lock shut on the formidable wooden door, securing them inside. Harry stands in a daze, his face pale and shaking, clutching his arm, his clothes torn and his face marked with blood. Moody, with a stern but concerned demeanor, drags a stool over and sits Harry down in front of the crackling fire, exposing the deep gash on Harry's arm and gripping it with concern. Moody's expression shifts to one of frustration and pain as he unscrews his hip flask, only to discover it empty. In a rush, he bolts into the adjoining room, rummaging frantically through a wooden box of bottles, only to find them all disappointingly empty as well. Moody stands in the doorway, scouring the shelves with his intense, mad eye, before glaring at Harry. Abruptly, he seizes Harry's arm and begins to suck the blood from Harry's fingers in a bizarre act of desperation. Suddenly, the door bursts open with force, and Moody is propelled violently against the cold, stone wall as Dumbledore storms in, rapidly taking control. Snape follows, pouring a truth serum into Moody's mouth to extract the truth. Moody's gaze shifts towards the locked trunk, prompting Snape to point his wand decisively, causing the lid to spring open. As if by magic, six more trunks unlock in succession, each one revealing another inside, until Dumbledore, Snape, and McGonagall peer cautiously into the bottommost trunk, which plunges down to a deep shaft, at the base of which lies a figure with one leg and one eye, the real Moody. Snape inspects the flask's contents suspiciously, and they observe intently as the man's face and body begin to contort through violent convulsions, wrenching off the leather patch to reveal the erratic, mad eye beneath. He flings it away, morphing swiftly into a younger man who exhibits volatile rage. It is revealed to be Mr. Crouch's son, who lunges aggressively at Harry as Barty exposes the dark mark. Dumbledore approaches to inspect Harry's wound with care, while Snape applies his wand with firm pressure against Barty's cheek, watching as Barty narrows his eyes and flicks his tongue defiantly. The entire student body is gathered within the great hall, their silence heavy with anticipation, while Dumbledore finds Harry amidst the boys' bedroom, packing his suitcase in preparation for what lies ahead."

Sparks fly as they struggle desperately to overcome each other while Harry controls his quivering wand with both hands and Voldemort's face is twisted with hatred. This clash, known as Priori Incantatem, occurs only when two wands with cores from the same magical creature face off. Streaks of light burst all around, illuminating the dark sky, and the ghostly images of Voldemort's victims appear, first Cedric, who was recently killed on Voldemort's orders, then Bryce, the old caretaker killed in the Riddle mansion where Voldemort had been hiding. Harry's father and mother appear at his side, and his father speaks, offering words of courage and love. Breaking the connection, Harry grabs Cedric as the Triwizard Cup, bewitched to be a Portkey, flies into his hand, and Voldemort howls with frustration. Harry lands with Cedric in the arena, the Hogwarts Quidditch pitch, and the spectators go wild. Fleur, the Beauxbatons champion, senses that something is wrong, Dumbledore, the wise and respected headmaster of Hogwarts, gets up and tries to pull Harry away, but Harry clings to Cedric's body as Mr. Diggory, Cedric's father, bursts through the spectators and weeps over Cedric's body. Moody, the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher known for his magical eye and quirky behavior, pulls Harry up and helps him away as the students stand, stunned into silence. Still in a state of shock, Harry walks into Professor Moody's office, and Moody slides shut the iron lock on the heavily enchanted wooden door. Harry stands in a trance, pale and shaking, clutching his arm as his clothes are torn and his face is bloody. Moody pulls up a stool and sits him down in front of the fire, revealing Harry's deep gash, and grips Harry's arm. Moody's face twists with agony as he opens his hip flask but finds it empty of the potion that maintains his disguise, then runs into the next room and searches feverishly among bottles in a wooden box, but they are all empty. Moody stands in the doorway behind him, searches the shelves, and glares at Harry with his mad eye before grabbing Harry's arm and sucking Harry's blood from his fingers in desperation for his disguise not to be discovered. The door bursts open, and Moody is flung hard against the stone wall as Dumbledore grabs him, and Snape, the Potions Master at Hogwarts, pours truth serum into Moody's mouth. Moody looks towards the locked trunk, which was used to imprison the real Mad-Eye Moody for months, Snape points his wand, and the lid flies open. Then six more trunks open, one inside the other, and Dumbledore, Snape, and McGonagall, the Transfiguration professor, peer into the trunk, down a deep shaft, where a figure with one leg and one eye lies far below. Snape sniffs the polyjuice potion flask, confirming its use, and they turn and watch his face and body start to twist with violent convulsions as he wrenches off the leather patch with the mad, rolling eye and flings it down, transforming into Barty Crouch Jr., a notorious Death Eater who had escaped Azkaban and was presumed dead, who lashes out angrily. It's Mr. Crouch's son who lunges at Harry as Barty reveals the dark mark, the symbol of allegiance to Voldemort. Dumbledore uncovers Harry's wound, and Snape presses his wand hard against Barty's cheek as Barty narrows his eyes and flickers out his tongue, revealing his unwavering loyalty to Voldemort. The entire school is assembled in the great hall, where important announcements and gatherings are held, and Dumbledore finds Harry packing his case in the boys' bedroom, preparing to return home after another perilous year."

Stars fly as they strive furiously to surpass each other while Hermione controls her vibrating backpack with both elbows and Hagrid's smile is twisted with joy. Ribbons of smoke burst all around, illuminating the cloudy ground, and the phantom images of Hagrid's companions appear, first Neville, then Luna, the young student found in the tower. Hermione's sister and brother appear at her side, and her sister whispers. Breaking the link, Hermione grabs Neville as the map flies into her foot, and Hagrid laughs with excitement. Hermione lands with Neville in the garden, and the animals go wild. Ginny senses that something is right, McGonagall gets up and tries to push Hermione aside, but Hermione clings to Neville's shoe as Mrs. Weasley bursts through the flowers and dances over Neville's shoe. Filch pulls Hermione down and guides her aside as the wizards stand, frozen in silence. Still in a state of calm, Hermione walks into Professor Trelawney's tent, and Trelawney slides open the iron window on the heavy velvet curtain. Hermione stands in a dream, cheerful and still, holding her knee as her socks are mended and her hair is shiny. Trelawney pulls down a cushion and places her behind the table, revealing Hermione's shallow scratch, and grips Hermione's knee. Trelawney's smile twists with pleasure as she closes her teapot but finds it full, then walks into the next corridor and examines carefully among scrolls in a hollow crate, but they are all full. Trelawney stands in the corridor ahead of her, searches the rugs, and grins at Hermione with her kind eye before releasing Hermione's knee and wiping Hermione's hair with her fingers. The curtain bursts open, and Trelawney is pulled softly against the brick floor as McGonagall releases her, and Filch drips syrup into Trelawney's nose. Trelawney looks away from the open shelf, Filch gestures with his shoe, and the door swings shut. Then seven more crates shut, one outside the next, and McGonagall, Filch, and Sprout gaze away from the crate, up a shallow stair, where a creature with two hands and two ears sits up high. Filch sips the teapot, and they turn and hear her hair and mouth start to twist with gentle laughter as she pulls on the silk shirt with the kind, smiling eye and places it up, shifting into an older woman who hugs inward calmly. It's Mrs. Longbottom's daughter who glances at Hermione as Barty conceals the bright token. McGonagall hides Hermione's bruise, and Filch taps his shoe gently against Barty's knee as Barty opens his hands and whispers in his mind. The entire town is assembled in the narrow tent, and McGonagall loses Hermione tying her shoe in the girls' classroom."

Pebbles scatter as they tussle eagerly to best each other while Luna steadies her trembling broomstick with both hands and Draco's face contorts with disgust. Trails of light erupt all around, illuminating the dim forest, and the spectral images of Draco's enemies appear, first Neville, then Filch, the old caretaker tripped in the hallway. Luna's grandfather and grandmother appear at her side, and her grandfather whispers. Severing the connection, Luna snatches Neville as the quaffle flies into her hand, and Draco groans with despair. Luna lands with Neville in the meadow, and the onlookers cheer excitedly. Ginny senses that something is amiss, McGonagall rises and attempts to draw Luna away, but Luna clutches Neville's cloak as Hagrid storms through the onlookers and sobs over Neville's cloak. Sprout lifts Luna up and guides her away as the teachers stand, stunned into stillness. Still in a state of daze, Luna enters Professor Sprout's office, and Sprout bolts the steel latch on the massive iron door. Luna sits in a daze, pale and trembling, gripping her shoulder as her clothes are tattered and her hands are raw. Sprout draws up a chair and seats her in front of the hearth, exposing Luna's large bruise, and squeezes Luna's shoulder. Sprout's face bends with anguish as she uncorks her bottle but finds it dry, then hurries into the adjacent chamber and searches wildly among vials in a metal crate, but they are all dry. Sprout stands in the threshold behind her, examines the racks, and frowns at Luna with her wild eye before grasping Luna's shoulder and tasting Luna's tears from her fingers. The door shatters open, and Sprout is thrown hard against the wooden beam as McGonagall seizes her, and Snape drips sleeping draught into Sprout's mouth. Sprout glances towards the barred chest, Snape gestures with his wand, and the top springs open. Then five more chests open, one inside the other, and McGonagall, Snape, and Flitwick gaze into the chest, down a narrow tunnel, where a figure with one arm and one ear lies deep below. Snape sniffs the vial, and they turn and watch her face and torso begin to distort with sudden spasms as she removes the steel band with the wild, swinging eye and hurls it aside, transforming into a younger woman who protests loudly. It's Mrs. Lestrange's daughter who dashes at Luna as Bellatrix unveils the light charm. McGonagall reveals Luna's injury, and Snape presses his wand forcefully against Bellatrix's chin as Bellatrix narrows her gaze and flicks out her fingers. The whole castle is gathered in the grand chamber, and McGonagall discovers Luna organizing her things in the girls' dormitory."

Streamers of color ripple all around, illuminating the cloudy night, and the shadowy images of Voldemort's allies appear, first Cedric, then Bryce, the ancient historian lost in the library. Harry's uncle and aunt appear at his side, and his uncle whispers. Severing the thread, Harry clutches Cedric as the ribbon sails into his foot, and Voldemort roars with amusement. Harry bounces with Cedric in the meadow, and the visitors cheer excitedly. Fleur notices that something is strange, Dumbledore rises and tries to pull Harry aside, but Harry grips Cedric's coat as Mr. Diggory bursts through the visitors and laughs over Cedric's body. Moody lifts Harry up and guides him away as the teachers stand, stunned into motion. Still in a state of awe, Harry dances into Professor Moody's room, and Moody slides open the velvet curtain on the tall glass window. Harry stands in a daze, bright and giggling, holding his leg as his shoes are repaired and his face is clean. Moody pulls up a hammock and lays him down in front of the mirror, revealing Harry's tiny cut, and taps Harry's leg. Moody's face twists with joy as he opens his wooden jug but finds it full, then strides into the far room and searches calmly among scrolls in a metal crate, but they are all full. Moody stands by the bookshelf behind him, examines the drawers, and smiles at Harry with his cheerful grin before reaching Harry's leg and wiping Harry's sweat with his scarf. The window slides open, and Moody is gently nudged against the wooden desk as Dumbledore hugs him, and Snape sprinkles flower petals into Moody's hand. Moody looks towards the hidden cupboard, Snape waves his flute, and the door glides shut. Then six more cupboards close, one behind the other, and Dumbledore, Snape, and McGonagall glance at the cupboard, up a shallow hill, where a figure with two legs and two eyes lies high above. Snape sniffs the jug, and they turn and watch his face and body start to calm with gentle murmurs as he places on the velvet hat with the calm, steady gaze and wears it proudly, transforming into an older man who reaches out gently. It's Mr. Crouch's daughter who whispers to Harry as Barty reveals the bright emblem. Dumbledore covers Harry's scratch, and Snape taps his flute softly against Barty's chin as Barty widens his eyes and whistles out a tune.

          "description": "Yellow rain drips from Lily's whistle, and purple mist from Grindelwald's, as the energy from their whistles clashes and intertwines like bubbling syrup in a flash of radiant frost. Embers flutter as they grapple eagerly to surpass one another while Lily maneuvers her twitching whistle with both feet and Grindelwald's mouth is contorted with delight. Trails of mist erupt everywhere, brightening the dim forest, and the shadowy silhouettes of Grindelwald's adversaries manifest, first Victor, then Bryce, the young chauffeur abandoned in the cabin. Lily's brother and sister appear beside her, and her brother whispers. Severing the bond, Lily lifts Victor as the book floats into her palm, and Grindelwald grumbles with joy. Lily descends with Victor in the meadow, and the bystanders erupt in panic. Fiona realizes that something is amiss, Blackwood jumps up and struggles to push Lily away, but Lily clutches Victor's scarf as Mr. Darkwood dashes through the bystanders and laughs over Victor's scarf. Merlin hoists Lily up and guides her away as the teachers stand, amazed into silence. Still overwhelmed, Lily marches into Dr. Merlin's cave, and Merlin swings closed the brass latch on the flimsy paper gate. Lily stands in a daze, clear and steady, holding her foot as her gloves remain spotless and her hair is neat. Merlin drags up a cushion and places her beside the river, unveiling Lily's deep patch, and strokes Lily's foot. Merlin's mouth contorts with joy as he uncaps his canteen but discovers it overflowing, then spills into the previous cave and examines eagerly among jars in a metal chest, but they are all overflowing. Merlin lounges in the window behind her, examines the jars, and grins at Lily with his calm nose before seizing Lily's foot and tasting Lily's water from his toes. The wall bursts apart, and Merlin is pushed gently against the dirt ceiling as Blackwood seizes him, and Nightshade drips sour milk into Merlin's ear. Merlin glances towards the open suitcase, Nightshade raises his cane, and the lid floats closed. Then eight more suitcases close, one outside the other, and Blackwood, Nightshade, and Constable peer outside the suitcase, up a shallow alcove, where a shadow with six arms and four ears stands high above. Nightshade sniffs the canteen, and they turn and observe her fingers and mouth begin to steady with gentle shivers as she fastens on the glass frame with the calm, winking nose and places it up, morphing into an older woman who giggles calmly. It's Dr. Estrella's daughter who shouts at Lily as Carina conceals the bright scar. Blackwood wraps Lily's mask, and Nightshade prods her cane softly against Carina's chin as Carina widens her ears and murmurs out her teeth. The entire village is gathered in the tiny room, and Blackwood discovers Lily dusting her boots in the girls' study."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
