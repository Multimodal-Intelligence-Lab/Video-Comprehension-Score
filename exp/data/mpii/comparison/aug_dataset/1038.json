This single action results in a massive explosion that violently shakes the very foundation of the hotel lobby. During this chaotic scene, in the hotel's dimly lit stairwell, Javier momentarily pauses to check the time on his watch. Simultaneously, outside on the bustling roads, an ambulance with Sam behind the wheel speeds purposefully, cutting through crowded streets while he talks via radio to coordinate efforts. A Secret Service agent descends the stairs with caution, only to be abruptly shot and incapacitated by Javier's ruthless precision. As Javier observes more agents maneuvering below with calculated precision in the stairwell, he carefully makes his way down, prudently opening a door on the seventh floor. Donning a ski mask, he confidently lurches forward through the doorway and stealthily stabs an unsuspecting agent in the back with lethal accuracy. As another agent comes around the corner, Javier reacts with swift decisiveness, killing the agent and taking possession of his firearm. Meanwhile, Sam navigates the ambulance through city streets at dangerously high speeds, recklessly careening through an intersection, which results in a dramatic collision between two unsuspecting cars. Using a cleverly positioned mirror, Javier identifies two agents stationed diligently outside the President's room. He then opens fire, shooting a third agent and strategically sets explosive charges to blow open the door to the President's room. He quickly ducks inside and fires his weapon with deadly intent, taking down Cavic, McCullough, and Heinkin before directing his gun towards Ashton. The ambulance arrives efficiently at the now-bombed hotel, and both Veronica and Sam promptly exit the vehicle. Sam deliberately taps the screen of his cell phone as an agent leads him away to assist, and they kneel beside a casualty in need.

In the stairwell, Javier, a former military operative known for his tactical skills, checks his high-tech digital watch that syncs with his team's communications, and outside, an ambulance hits the streets with Sam on its radio, coordinating the chaos from his mobile dispatch unit. A Secret Service agent, tasked with protecting the visiting dignitaries, heads downstairs, only to be shot by Javier. Javier watches more agents pass beneath him in the stairwell, then heads downstairs, easing a door open on level seven, a critical floor due to its direct access to emergency exits. He dons a ski mask, lurches through the doorway, and stabs an agent in the back, utilizing a combat knife known for stealth. Another agent rounds the corner, and Javier attacks, killing the agent and drawing his gun, a standard-issue Glock. Meanwhile, Sam, a trained emergency response driver, drives the ambulance through the streets at breakneck speed, careening through a junction infamous for traffic incidents and causing two cars to crash. Javier uses a compact tactical mirror to spot two agents outside the President's room, then opens fire, shooting a third agent, and sets charges designed for breaching doors which blow the door to the President's room. He ducks inside and guns down Cavic, McCullough, and Heinkin, three high-level security consultants, before pointing his gun at Ashton, the President of the United States. The ambulance arrives at the bombed hotel, and Veronica, a skilled field medic, and Sam climb out. Sam taps his cell phone screen, activating a secure communications app, as the agent leads him away, and they kneel by a casualty. Barnes, an experienced GNN field reporter, enters the network's OB truck and flashes his ID as Veronica enters the elevator with a gurney and presses the button for level seven. Barnes makes a second call on his cell phone, utilizing the network's encrypted line, and spots Taylor on the monitor dressed as a cop, indicating a deep cover operation. A flashback shows Taylor, a double agent, leaving Barnes and Howard, running off with a smirk, and entering the annex behind two agents as the bomb goes off outside. Taylor guns down both agents, sheds his jacket, dismantles the remote-controlled rifle used for long-range hits, changes into a Spanish policeman's outfit to blend in, and heads down an outside staircase with the packed-up rifle. As Taylor leaves, Barnes spots him on the monitor, glares, and leaps into action, rushing out of the GNN truck. Taylor puts his cell phone into the front seat of the ambulance driven by Sam and Veronica and gets into a Spanish police car, a common sight for patrolling the city's events. As Barnes rounds a corner, he heads down a quiet street, sees Taylor speed off, and gives chase on foot through a narrow pedestrian street often used by locals to avoid traffic, then onto the main road, rushing into oncoming traffic, a dangerous maneuver. Barnes speeds off in a blue hatchback, a rental typically used by journalists for quick escapes, gets on his cell phone, and slides around a corner. In the hotel, Javier forces Ashton towards the elevator on the seventh floor at gunpoint. Veronica arrives in the elevator and chloroforms Ashton, a tactic to ensure compliance without harm; they put the unconscious President on the gurney, enter the elevator, and Veronica fits an oxygen mask onto Ashton's face while Javier points a gun at the President's head."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
