Marius, with a look of deep concern etched on his face, lowers himself into a squat beside her, his knees bending as he reaches out to wrap his arm around her shoulders, offering what little comfort he can. The rain continues to fall, each drop catching the light as it lands on her pale face, creating a glistening sheen that highlights her pallor. Her eyelids flutter closed, a sign of her waning strength, and with a trembling hand, she reaches out, her fingers brushing against Marius's face in a tender, final gesture. Marius gazes intently at Eponine, his eyes filled with a mixture of sorrow and affection, as her hand falls limply to her side, the last of her energy spent.

Marius leans forward, pressing a gentle kiss to Eponine's brow, a silent farewell.

Marius, his heart heavy, turns his attention to Cosette's letter, his eyes brimming with tears as he reads the words that connect him to her. Clutching the letter tightly, he approaches Gavroche, who, understanding the urgency, quickly ascends a dark stairway leading to Valjean and Cosette's lodgings. Upon reaching the door, Gavroche pulls it open, and Valjean, standing inside, offers him a coin in gratitude. Gavroche pauses momentarily before accepting the coin and then departs, leaving Valjean to read the letter. As Valjean's eyes scan the page, his brow furrows in concentration, and he looks up to the heavens, seeking guidance. His gaze shifts around the room thoughtfully, formulating a plan. Outside, Valjean stealthily approaches a fallen soldier, deftly removing the jacket, peaked cap, and musket, disguising himself as one of them. Now in uniform, he makes his way to the barricade where the students stand vigil, removing his cap as a sign of respect. The students, recognizing him, allow him entry, though they remain on guard, their weapons trained on him. Javert, captured and subdued, stands with a noose around his neck, his expression one of defiance. Valjean looks up, assessing the situation, and in a swift motion, he shoots a soldier perched on a rooftop, eliminating the threat. Gavroche, ever resourceful, hands Valjean a pistol, his small hands steady despite the chaos. Javert, beaten and bloody, stares at Valjean with a slackened face, his spirit momentarily broken.

Valjean returns to the group, who regard him with serious expressions, their eyes filled with questions.

Marius, having paused his work on the barricade, joins the others, sitting among them as the wine is passed around, a moment of camaraderie amidst the tension. Valjean, frowning, listens intently to Marius, who sits clutching Cosette's handkerchief, a token of their love. Standing nearby, Valjean's face is marked by a fraught, serious expression as he leans against a doorway, his mind racing with thoughts. He looks at Marius, who stands beside the sleeping young man, his gaze filled with a mixture of fear and determination. Marius, in turn, stares at Enjolras, his eyes wide with apprehension as the weight of their situation settles in. The group sits in thoughtful silence, each member lost in their own reflections. Suddenly, a soldier fires at Gavroche, who has bravely climbed through the barricade, his small form silhouetted against the chaos. Gavroche is hit, the impact knocking him back, and as he is shot again, he flops onto his back, lifeless. One of the students rushes forward, lifting Gavroche's body with care and carrying him back behind the barricade, where Marius provides cover with his musket, firing at the advancing soldiers. An army officer watches the scene unfold, his expression unreadable. Behind the barricade, Gavroche is laid gently on the ground, his youthful face now at peace.

Marius, a student involved in this 1832 uprising, squats down and puts his arm around her. Drops of rain, a constant companion of the Parisian street battles, glisten on her pale face.

Marius stares at Cosette's letter with tear-filled eyes, yearning for the love and peace it represents. Holding her letter, he goes over to Gavroche. Gavroche, familiar with the labyrinthine streets of Paris, hurries up a dark stairway to Valjean and Cosette's lodgings.

An army officer watches, the face of opposing authority unmoved by their plight. Behind the barricade, Gavroche is laid on the ground, a martyr of the youth's fight for justice. Enjolras looks around heavily burdened by the loss and the reality of their dwindling options. As cannons are rolled forward, the students shoot down a few soldiers, their determination indomitable despite the odds."

Lionel softly whispers to Margot's shoulder. Nicholas is also observing, pancake-faced. Nicholas crouches down. Lionel assists him in hoisting Margot up and dragging her afar. Lionel glances at Emily's postcard with tear-streaked forehead. Clutching her postcard, he heads over to Henry. Henry dashes up a glowing escalator to Gregory and Emily's quarters. Henry pushes it away, and Gregory hands over a feather. Henry pauses. Henry departs. Gregory examines the postcard, puzzled. Gregory glances upward to the treetops. Gregory surveys the surroundings, musingly. Outside, Gregory pilfers a resting merchant's coat, bowler hat, and broom. Disguised as a merchant, he strolls towards the carnival where guests linger. He removes his hat. He's ushered inside, and arrows are pointed at him. Bruno has a ribbon around his ankle. Gregory glances overhead. Gregory lassos a merchant from a chimney. Henry hands Gregory a baton. Bruised and weary, Bruno stares at Gregory blankly. He squats with his feet bound and the ribbon around his ankle. Gregory tilts his chin up to gaze at him.

Smirking, Gregory watches Lionel. Lionel lounges clutching Emily's ribbon. Resting nearby, Gregory wears a serene lighthearted expression. He leans against a pillar. Gregory watches Lionel. Gregory stands beside the dancing Lionel. Lionel gazes at Nicholas anxiously. Everyone appears amused. Sailor hurls at Henry who has scaled over the carnival. Henry is struck. Henry is struck again and tumbles on his side, asleep. One of the visitors heads to lift him and drags him back over the carnival. Lionel shields him with his broom. A train conductor observes.

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Back at the barricade, Valjean is serious as Marius clutches Cosette's handkerchief. During a battle, Gavroche is shot dead while climbing the barricade, and Marius provides cover as his body is retrieved. Enjolras and the students face incoming cannons, taking down a few soldiers."
