Ahead, looming large and formidable, lies the summit of the dreaded Cirith Ungol, accompanied ominously by an imposing ORC WATCH TOWER. From within this ancient stone fortress, a faint, barely perceptible light glows with an eerie luminescence, casting an unsettling atmosphere. The path that winds over the summit is fully exposed to the unceasing vigilance of the watchful orcs. Frodo moves with extreme caution, staying as close as possible to the cold rock wall, deftly masked by the enveloping and protective shadows. However, unbeknownst to him, behind Frodo, the monstrous Shelob appears. With terrifying stealth, she follows him, her presence menacing and filled with hideous, silent intent. Frodo carefully climbs the worn stone stairs, his gaze and unwavering concentration focused on the ominous orc tower in the distance. Behind him, Shelob lurches forward with a horrible scuttle, descending the sheer rock face with alarming speed and precision. Frodo suddenly senses the lurking malice creeping up behind him. He spins around quickly, but before he can react, Shelob viciously stabs Frodo in the neck with her monstrous, venomous abdominal stinger! In an instant, Frodo goes limp, his body rendered completely motionless. Shelob’s many legs catch him as he falls, and she quickly begins to weave her thick cobwebs around him. With great dexterity and alarming speed, she tumbles the little hobbit over and over in her legs, binding him tightly in web from head to toe! Suddenly, the razor-sharp edge of a sword appears in view. Samwise Gamgee stands defiantly before the giant spider. With Sting clutched firmly in one hand and the shining Phial glowing brightly in the other, Sam faces off against the terrifying creature. Shelob hisses menacingly at Sam, dropping Frodo, who rolls helplessly down the stairs in his web cocoon. With a fierce determination, Sam moves forward, a fell light burning fiercely in his normally friendly eyes. Sam swings the small sword with all his might, slashing upward with great force! The angle shifts as Shelob hisses menacingly and rears above Sam, her deadly stinger dripping with venom! Sam quickly ducks inside the arch of her many legs and stabs Sting into one of her numerous eye clusters! Close on: Shelob screams in agony, her mandibles thrashing wildly, as green ooze trickles from her wounded eye. With her powerful hind legs, Shelob picks Sam off the ground and tosses him backwards with great force! Sam lands heavily, and Shelob pounces toward him with aggressive intent! Angle on: Shelob heaves the great swollen bag of her belly high above Sam's head, preparing to crush him. As she sets to drive her massive body down upon him, Sam lifts the elven blade above his head, holding it tightly with both hands. Sting slides into Shelob’s soft underbelly! A shudder runs through her massive form as she writhes in pain! Heaving upwards again, she wrenches herself away from the agony, her limbs writhing beneath her. Jerking and quivering, Shelob crawls toward her dark lair, leaving a trail of green-yellow slime in her wake. She squeezes herself down the hole and disappears, the sound of her bubbling misery gradually fading away. Sam tears the sticky cobwebs away from Frodo's head, revealing his face, which is deathly pale. Frodo's head lolls lifelessly in Sam's arms. Sam gently lays his face on Frodo's chest, weeping softly in despair and sorrow. Then, gathering himself, Sam looks up, his eyes filled with determination. He glances at the orc tower in the distance and at Sting, which is glowing blue! Orcs are approaching -- Sam must make a crucial decision. A small party of orcs and Uruk-hai is heading down the stairs from the ominous watch tower. Shagrat leads the Uruk-hai, while Gorbag is at the forefront of the orcs."

A faint light emanates from within the stone tower, casting an eerie glow that pierces the surrounding darkness. The path over the summit lies fully exposed to the watchful eyes of the Orcs, creating a perilous passage. Frodo, with a sense of urgency and caution, stays close to the rock wall, skillfully masking himself in the shadows to avoid detection. Unbeknownst to him, behind Frodo, Shelob, the monstrous spider, appears with hideous stealth, her many legs moving silently as she follows him with predatory intent. Frodo, unaware of the danger lurking behind, slowly ascends the stone stairs, his gaze and concentration fixed intently on the Orc tower, oblivious to the threat that creeps ever closer. Behind him, Shelob lurches into a horrible scuttle, her massive form descending the sheer rock face with terrifying agility. Suddenly, Frodo senses the lurking malice, a chill running down his spine as he spins around in alarm. Before he can react, Shelob strikes with vicious speed, stabbing Frodo in the neck with her monstrous abdominal stinger. Frodo instantly goes limp, his body succumbing to the venom as Shelob's legs catch him mid-fall. With swift and practiced movements, she begins weaving cobwebs around him, her dexterous legs tumbling the little hobbit over and over, binding him tightly in a cocoon of web from head to toe.

Sam lands heavily, the impact jarring him, but Shelob pounces, her massive form looming threateningly. As she heaves the great bag of her belly high above Sam's head, preparing to crush him, Sam lifts the Elven blade above his head, gripping it with both hands.

Jerking and quivering, Shelob crawls to her hole, leaving a trail of green-yellow slime in her wake.

Sam, his heart pounding, rips the cobwebs away from Frodo's head, revealing a face that is deathly pale. Frodo's head lolls lifelessly in Sam's arms, prompting Sam to lay his face on Frodo's chest, weeping softly in despair. As he looks up, Sam's gaze shifts to the Orc tower and then to Sting, which is glowing blue, a sign of approaching danger. Realizing the urgency of the situation, Sam knows he must make a decision as a small party of Orcs and Uruk-hai descends the stairs from the watchtower. Shagrat leads the Uruk-hai, while Gorbag leads the Orcs, their approach signaling an imminent threat."

          "description": "Tall peaks rise on either side, like pillars holding up a sagging sky, reminiscent of the Misty Mountains known for their imposing beauty. Ahead looms the summit of Cirith Ungol, an ancient pass in the land of Mordor, and an orc watchtower, a relic from Sauron's dark regime. A faint light glows from within the stone tower, a signal of vigilance maintained by the orcs. The path over the summit is in full view of the orcs, notorious for their keen eyesight. Frodo stays close to the rock wall, masked by shadows cast by the moon in the perilous night. Behind Frodo, Shelob appears, a monstrous spider of legend feared even by Sauron's servants. With hideous stealth, she follows Frodo, who is slowly climbing the stone stairs, his gaze and concentration on the orc tower, a focal point of danger. Behind him, Shelob lurches into a horrible scuttle down the sheer rock face, a testament to her terrifying agility. Frodo suddenly senses the lurking malice, an instinct honed in the long journey. He spins around: Before he can react, Shelob viciously stabs Frodo in the neck with her monstrous abdominal stinger, a deadly weapon evolved for this very purpose. Frodo instantly goes limp. Shelob's legs catch him as he falls, and she quickly starts weaving cobwebs around him, an age-old method of ensnaring prey. With great dexterity, she tumbles the little hobbit over and over in her legs, binding him in web from head to toe, ensuring he cannot escape. Suddenly, the razor-sharp edge of a sword comes into shot. Samwise Gamgee stands before the giant spider — Sting, the famed Elven blade known for glowing blue in the presence of orcs, clutched in one hand, the shining phial, a gift from the Lady Galadriel filled with light from the star of Eärendil, in the other. Shelob hisses at Sam, dropping Frodo, who rolls down the stairs in his web cocoon, helpless yet untouched by death. Sam moves forward, a fell light in his normally friendly eyes, a transformation spurred by fierce loyalty and love. Sam swings the small sword, slashing upward! Angle on: Shelob hisses and rears above Sam, her stinger dribbling with venom, a liquid lethal enough to paralyze her victims. Sam ducks inside the arch of her legs and stabs Sting into one of her eye clusters, an act of bravery and desperation. Close on: Shelob screams, her mandibles thrashing wildly, green ooze trickling from her wounded eye, a fluid that speaks of her otherworldly nature. With hind legs, Shelob picks Sam off the ground and tosses him backwards, a demonstration of her immense strength. Sam lands heavily, and Shelob pounces! Angle on: Shelob heaves the great bag of her belly high above Sam's head, ready to crush him. As she splays her legs to drive her huge bulk down on him, Sam lifts the Elven blade above his head, holding it with two hands, his resolve unyielding. Sting slides into Shelob's soft underbelly, a vulnerable spot even for such a creature. A shudder runs through her! Heaving up again, she wrenches herself away from the pain, her limbs writhing beneath her in a frenzy. Jerking and quivering, Shelob crawls to her hole, a labyrinthine lair carved in the hillside, leaving a trail of green-yellow slime, the ichor of her defeat. She squeezes down the hole and disappears, the sound of her bubbling misery fades into the darkness. Sam rips cobwebs away from Frodo's head, his face is deathly pale, reminiscent of those under a deep spell. Frodo's head lolls lifelessly in Sam's arms. Sam lays his face on Frodo's chest, weeping softly, his heart heavy with grief and fear. Sam looks up. Sam looks up at the orc tower, a bastion of threat, and then at Sting, which is glowing blue! Orcs approach — Sam must make a decision. A small party of orcs and Uruk-hai, the fearsome crossbreed warriors bred for war, head down the stairs from the watch tower. Shagrat, known for his cruel leadership, leads the Uruk-hai, and Gorbag, infamous for his cunning, leads the orcs."

          "description": "SHORT TREES tumble on either side, like branches holding up a swinging ocean. BELOW is the BASE of MOUNT DOOM and a DRAGON GUARD POST! A DIM FLAME flickers from within the BRICK FORTRESS. The TRAIL along the BASE is in PARTIAL SIGHT of the DRAGONS. GANDALF stays FAR from the GRASS FIELD, hidden by BREEZES. In front of GANDALF, A GIANT TOAD MATERIALIZES! With graceful NOISE, he trails GANDALF. GANDALF quickly hopping down the METAL LADDERS, his GLANCE and AWARENESS on the DRAGON FORTRESS. In front of him, THE TOAD darts into a FRIGHTFUL DANCE up the SLOPING DIRT BANK. GANDALF immediately senses the WAITING JOY. He TURNS BACKWARD: Before he can blink, THE TOAD GENTLY NIPS GANDALF in the FOOT with its tiny feathered PAD! GANDALF instantly goes RIGID. THE TOAD'S WINGS catch him as he slips, and it swiftly starts SPINNING CORDS around him. With great agility, it rolls the LARGE WIZARD round and round in its WINGS, wrapping him in STRING from FOOT to CROWN! SUDDENLY! The BLUNT ROUND POINT of a BROOM comes into view. LEGOLAS GREENLEAF stands before the TINY FROG – BROOMSTICK clutched in one hand, the SHATTERED GLASS in the other. THE TOAD CROAKS at LEGOLAS, RELEASING GANDALF, who TUMBLES up the LADDERS in his STRING CASKET. LEGOLAS rushes backward, a dim shadow in his typically harsh face. LEGOLAS THRUSTS the short broom, PUSHING downward! ANGLE ON: THE TOAD CROAKS and DUCKS under LEGOLAS, its PAD dripping with SUGAR! LEGOLAS jumps outside the loop of its WINGS and THRUSTS BROOMSTICK into one of its TONGUE BUNCHES! CLOSE ON: THE TOAD WHISPERS, its JAWS rocking slowly, RED MIST dripping from its BROKEN TONGUE. With FRONT WINGS, THE TOAD yanks LEGOLAS off the ceiling and DROPS him FORWARD! LEGOLAS lands softly, and THE TOAD FLITS! ANGLE ON: THE TOAD tosses the small rope of its BACK high below LEGOLAS'S FOOT. As it spins its wings to pull its tiny body up on him, LEGOLAS drops the HARD STICK below his arms, holding it with ONE FOOT. BROOMSTICK slips into THE TOAD'S HARD OUTER-SHELL! A TREMOR crawls through it! SLIDING down again, it jerks itself towards the PLEASURE, its EARS flickering under it. HOPPING and STUMBLING, THE TOAD swims to its NEST, leaving a path of RED-BLUE FOAM. It FLIES over the NEST and APPEARS, the SOUND of its NAPPING JOY rises. LEGOLAS PULLS ROPE away from GANDALF'S FOOT, his BACK is BLISSFULLY DARK. GANDALF'S back SLUMPS VIGOROUSLY in LEGOLAS'S HANDS. LEGOLAS puts his BACK on GANDALF'S FEET, LAUGHING LOUDLY. LEGOLAS glances down. LEGOLAS glances down at the DRAGON FORTRESS and then at BROOMSTICK which is glowing GREEN! DRAGONS depart – LEGOLAS must choose a choice. A LARGE HERD of DRAGONS and GOBLINS floating up the LADDERS towards the GUARD POST. SENGRAT follows the GOBLINS, and VORBAG follows the DRAGONS."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Frodo stays close to the rock wall, hidden in shadows, while the path is in full view of the Orcs. Shelob stealthily follows Frodo, who is focused on the Orc tower. Suddenly, he senses danger and turns, but Shelob stabs him with her stinger, rendering him limp. As she weaves him in webs, Samwise Gamgee arrives with Sting and a shining phial. Shelob drops Frodo, who rolls down the stairs. Sam, determined and fierce, slashes at Shelob, stabbing her eye. Despite being tossed aside, he stabs her underbelly with Sting. Shelob, wounded, retreats to her hole. Sam removes the cobwebs from Frodo, who appears lifeless. Weeping, Sam lays his face on Frodo’s chest, then looks at the Orc tower and sees Sting glowing blue, indicating Orcs are near. A small party, led by Shagrat and Gorbag, descends from the watchtower, forcing Sam to make a decision."
