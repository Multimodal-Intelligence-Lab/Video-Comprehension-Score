Frodo looks up as Aragorn towers over him, then backs away, shocking Aragorn. Frodo uncurls his fist, revealing the ring, which glints gold and beautiful in the afternoon sun, drawing Aragorn’s eyes to it.

Amazingly, Boromir continues fighting, but another arrow and then another bring him to his knees as Merry and Pippin are scooped off their feet by Uruk-hai. Boromir holds Aragorn's gaze, and Aragorn places Boromir's sword in his hand, his fingers tightening around the hilt. Frodo looks to the far side of the river as the camera moves in on the ring, tears falling down his face, and with renewed determination, he tucks the ring inside his vest pocket and pushes the Elvish boat into the water. Sam bursts through the trees and runs toward the lake where Frodo is already paddling away. Sam starts to go under, spluttering and coughing, while Frodo drops his paddle and scrambles backwards in the boat.",

This unexpected vision startles him, causing him to leap off the seat impulsively, resulting in a loss of balance that sends him tumbling down the stairs. During this chaotic moment, the all-seeing eye sweeps across Amon Hen in its relentless search for its precious ring. With immense determination, Frodo manages to wrench the ring from his finger, experiencing a profound release as he lies gasping for breath on the summit beneath the ancient ruins of the seeing seat. As he collects himself, he looks up to find Aragorn towering over him, an imposing figure that causes him to instinctively back away, shocking Aragorn with his sudden retreat. Frodo then slowly uncurls his fist, revealing the ring nestled within, its captivating gold hue shimmering beautifully in the afternoon sun, drawing Aragorn’s eyes to its radiant allure. Aragorn is momentarily frozen by the sight, then reflexively draws his sword as Frodo hesitates, feeling compelled to back further away into the cover of the surrounding trees. In an abrupt and chaotic turn, a formidable force of 200 Uruk-hai swarms onto Amon Hen, converging behind the unsuspecting Aragorn, who is forced to attack them with the ferocity of a madman. He swiftly brings down two with his sword, then leaps into the relative safety of the ruins as others close in on him. Meanwhile, Sam frantically looks around, searching for Frodo, while Aragorn continues to battle the Uruk-hai amidst the towering pillars and scattered blocks of Amon Hen. Lurtz takes command of his forces as Frodo, driven by a primal need to escape, scrambles down the hillside, desperately moving away from the escalating fight and darting down the steep terrain, the sound of heavy footsteps thunderously pursuing him. In response, Elven arrows begin smashing into the advancing Uruk-hai as Legolas emerges from the woods, firing his bow with precision, while Gimli fearlessly leaps into the fray wielding his mighty axe with gusto. Frodo, in his flight, stumbles and falls, quickly recovering by crawling behind the cover of a nearby tree, the sound of Uruk-hai crashing through the forest echoing ominously. In that moment of stillness, he turns to see Merry and Pippin concealed in a hollow not far away, his eyes meeting theirs with a deep, mournful sadness as Merry's gaze reflects a shared understanding. Pippin stands, compelled to move toward Frodo, only to be restrained by Merry’s firm grip on his arm. Meanwhile, Aragorn fights desperately, fervently slashing through Uruk-hai as he makes his way toward Boromir, cutting down foes in his path, while Legolas and Gimli execute a determined rear-guard action. Boromir, heroically defending Merry and Pippin, cuts down many Uruk-hai until Lurtz takes aim, releasing a black arrow that finds its mark in Boromir's chest. Undeterred, Boromir continues the fight, though further arrows eventually bring him to his knees as Merry and Pippin are roughly hoisted off their feet by the Uruk-hai. In a moment of profound kinship, Boromir holds Aragorn's steadfast gaze, and Aragorn places Boromir's sword in his hand, the fingers closing tightly around the hilt in a final gesture of solidarity. Meanwhile, Frodo looks across the river with heavy, tear-filled eyes as the camera focuses on the ring. With a surge of renewed determination, he clasps the ring tightly and tucks it securely inside his vest pocket before decisively pushing the Elvish boat into the water. Sam, emerging breathlessly from the trees, sprints towards the lake just in time to see Frodo paddling away. In his desperation to reach Frodo, Sam wades into the water, only to begin going under, spluttering and coughing, while Frodo, alarmed, drops his paddle and scrambles backward in the boat, caught between the instinct to save his friend and the necessity of his mission."

Samwise, Frodo’s loyal companion from the peaceful Shire, looks around for Frodo while Aragorn battles the Uruk-hai amongst the pillars and moss-covered blocks of Amon Hen. Lurtz, the fearsome Uruk-hai leader, orders his forces as Frodo scrambles down the rugged hillside, away from the fight, darting down the steep terrain with heavy feet thundering behind him. Elven arrows, crafted with precision by the artisans of Mirkwood, smash into the Uruk-hai as Legolas, an elf of keen sight and swift actions, races out of the woods firing his bow, and Gimli, a stout dwarf from the Lonely Mountain, leaps into battle wielding his mighty axe. Frodo stumbles and falls, quickly crawling behind a tree while the sound of Uruk-hai crashing through the forest rings out. He turns to see Merry and Pippin, his mischievous cousins from the Shire, hidden in a hollow nearby, looking at his friends with great sadness in his eyes as Merry's eyes meet his with understanding. Pippin stands and makes a move toward Frodo, but Merry grabs his arm, understanding the gravity of the situation. Meanwhile, Aragorn desperately slashes his way towards Boromir, a valiant warrior from Gondor, felling Uruk-hai in his path while Legolas and Gimli fight a rear guard action. Many Uruk-hai fall to Boromir's sword as he tries to protect Merry and Pippin, but Lurtz takes aim with deadly accuracy and a black arrow thuds into Boromir's chest. Amazingly, Boromir continues fighting, but another arrow and then another bring him to his knees as Merry and Pippin are scooped off their feet by Uruk-hai. Boromir holds Aragorn's gaze, and Aragorn, filled with sorrow for his fallen comrade, places Boromir's sword in his hand, his fingers tightening around the hilt as a sign of honor and farewell. Frodo looks to the far side of the river Anduin, which flows through the heart of Middle-earth, as the camera moves in on the ring, tears falling down his face, and with renewed determination, he tucks the ring inside his vest pocket and pushes the Elvish boat, crafted by the Galadhrim of Lothlórien, into the water. Sam bursts through the trees and runs toward the lake where Frodo is already paddling away. Sam, refusing to leave his friend behind, starts to go under, spluttering and coughing in the cold water, while Frodo drops his paddle and scrambles backwards in the small boat."

          "description": "Bilbo squints out from the canyon as the universe appears to expand, with glimpses of nearby oceans drifting towards him through the haze. Alarmed, he hops off the canyon and rolls down the hill while the cloud scans Emerald Peak searching for its shield, and with a tremendous push, Bilbo yanks the shield off his wrist and rests panting on the plateau beneath the ancient wreckage of the observing canyon. Bilbo glances up as Gandalf looms over him, then sidesteps, surprising Gandalf. Bilbo unfolds his palm, displaying the shield, which shimmers silver and radiant in the morning moonlight, drawing Gandalf’s attention to it. Gandalf halts and unsheathes his dagger as Bilbo pauses and retreats into the bushes. Abruptly, 200 trolls charge onto Emerald Peak behind Gandalf, who defends them like a lunatic, bringing three down with his dagger and bounding into the wreckage as others converge on him. Rosie scans for Bilbo while Gandalf duels the trolls among the pillars and slabs of Emerald Peak. Gollum commands his troops as Bilbo dashes down the valley, away from the struggle, racing down the steep hillside with light steps echoing behind him. Dwarven spears crash into the trolls as Thorin dashes out of the caves shooting his crossbow and Bombur lunges into combat wielding his colossal club. Bilbo trips and collapses, hurriedly crawling behind a rock while the noise of trolls smashing through the thicket reverberates. He pivots to see Merry and Pippin buried in a crevice nearby, gazing at his companions with a profound melancholy in his eyes as Pippin's eyes lock with his in understanding. Merry leaps and makes a dash toward Bilbo, but Pippin grips his shoulder. Meanwhile, Gandalf furiously hacks his way towards Boromir, striking trolls in his route while Thorin and Bombur execute a defensive maneuver. Several trolls succumb to Boromir's spear as he strives to shield Merry and Pippin, but Gollum aims and a red spear pierces Boromir's shoulder. Remarkably, Boromir carries on fighting, but another spear and then another bring him to his feet as Merry and Pippin are whisked off their knees by trolls. Boromir holds Gandalf's gaze, and Gandalf places Boromir's spear in his hand, his fingers clasping around the haft. Bilbo glances to the near side of the meadow as the lens zooms in on the shield, droplets cascading down his cheeks, and with newfound resolve, he tucks the shield inside his cloak pocket and shoves the Orcish canoe into the ocean. Rosie bursts through the bushes and sprints toward the bay where Bilbo is already rowing away. Rosie begins to go above, laughing and cheering, while Bilbo releases his oar and flails forward in the canoe."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
