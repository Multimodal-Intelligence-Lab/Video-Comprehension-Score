The proprietor advances toward his dwelling as George is utterly perplexed. George places his arm around Clarence, and they commence up the path to Martini's establishment, which is now nearly unrecognizable. The merry Italian ambiance is absent, and it is now more of a hard-drinking dive, a honky-tonk. The identical bar remains, but the tables lack coverings, and the patrons are lower class and tougher. George and Clarence enter and approach the bar as two patrons exit the bar. Nick the barkeep is behind the bar, and as he speaks, he leans over the counter, positioning his left fist almost in Clarence's eye, confounding Clarence. Nick turns away to retrieve the libations while listening distrustfully to their dialogue but ceases pouring the libations with the bottle poised in his hand. George glances up at Nick, who slams the bottle down on the counter. A small ruin of a man with frail, watery eyes, evidently a broken-down beggar with his hat in hand, is Gower the pharmacist, who can hardly credit his eyes. Nick grabs a seltzer bottle and sprays Gower in the visage with it as the crowd laughs harshly. Gower grins weakly as the soda runs off his visage, and George, appalled, leaps up and moves over to Gower. The bouncers eject Gower out the front entrance. George dashes back to the bar, and George and Clarence come flying through the entrance and land in the snow. Nick is at the cash register busily ringing the bell while George and Clarence lie in the snow with George having a strange, perplexed look on his visage. They linger for a moment as they land, looking at each other, and George catches a glimpse of the front of the edifice with the neon sign above the entrance. George and Clarence get to their feet, and George points to the sign while looking at Clarence, who sort of lowers his head. George fixes him with a very interested look and, still watching him, goes up to him and pokes his arm, and it's flesh. George swiftly searches his pockets for identification, but without success, and is utterly befuddled as he feverishly continues to turn his pockets inside out and starts off. Clarence rises, and George strides off hurriedly as Clarence slowly follows him, glancing up toward Heaven as he goes. George looks at the altered character of the establishment in astonishment, then starts up the street toward the main part of town, and as he goes, the camera moves with him, showing a town that has thoroughly transformed from a quiet, orderly small town to having the aspect of a frontier village."

The house is approached by the owner as George is left completely bewildered. Clarence has George's arm put around him, and up the road to Martini's place, which is now almost unrecognizable, they are started off by them. The cheerful Italian feeling has been removed, and a hard-drinking joint, a honky-tonk, it has now become. There is the same bar, but no covers are on the tables, and the people are tougher and lower down. The bar is entered by George and Clarence, and to the bar, they go up as the bar is left by two people. The bar is occupied by Nick the bartender, who leans over the counter as he speaks, putting his left fist nearly in Clarence's eye, puzzling Clarence. Drinks are turned away for by Nick while their conversation is listened to suspiciously by him, but with the bottle poised in his hand, the drinks are stopped being poured.

Gower is squirted with a seltzer bottle in the face by Nick as the crowd brutally laughs. A weak smile is given by Gower as the soda runs off his face, and over to Gower, George, horrified, leaps.

To his feet, George and Clarence get up, and the sign is pointed to by George while Clarence is looked at by him, who sort of hangs his head. A very interested look is fixed on him by George, and up to him, he goes, poking his arm, and it's flesh. His pockets are rapidly searched by George for identification, but success eludes him, and completely befuddled he is as his pockets are feverishly continued to be turned inside out by him and off he starts. Clarence rises, and hurriedly off George strides as slowly follows Clarence him, glancing up toward Heaven as he goes.

The owner proceeds toward his house as George is completely bewildered. George puts his arm around Clarence, who had recently arrived claiming to be an angel sent to help him, and they start off up the road to Martini's place, which is now almost unrecognizable.

The bouncers, who were known around town for their heavy-handed tactics, throw Gower out the front door.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
