A short corridor is walked down by her and a long hallway is turned down. In the office, Jack, still handcuffed to the pipe, is climbed by him onto a desk as the water rises. At a staircase, Rose pauses, then a left turn is made by her, and a flooded corridor, littered with floating furniture, is walked down. The hall lights flicker on and off. The closed office door is turned toward by Jack. Rose turns around and hurries to the office door.

Against the wall, Rose leans back, blinks, then she stares ahead. Forward, she steps, a fire hose is unwrapped, and it is used to break the glass on a case containing an axe. The axe is grabbed by her and the E deck stairs are run toward. Over the railing, Smith leans on the bridge and the flooding bow and front well deck are gazed down at by him. Meanwhile, Rose descends the E deck stairs and stops above the water, which has risen above several steps. Into the water, she steps down, an overhead frame is grabbed, and her head is ducked out into the hallway. Both ways down the flooded hallway are glanced at by her, then a step back is taken and the axe is hung on the frame. Her long sweater is taken off and dropped, the axe is grabbed with one hand, and the water is waded into by her. With her free hand, a long pipe running along the ceiling is grasped, propelling herself down the hallway. Over her head, the axe is held and chest-deep water is walked through into the office. The axe is held out by her. The chain connecting the handcuffs on the water pipe is stretched by Jack. The axe is lifted by Rose, the wooden cabinet is walked to, the axe is swung, and the cabinet door is struck by it."

He stumbles back and touches his bloody nose, then hurries away, shocked by her strength. Rose leans back against the wall, blinks, then stares ahead, focusing. She steps forward, unwraps a fire hose, an essential piece of safety equipment, and uses it to break the glass on a case containing an axe, a tool that may be their only hope. She grabs the axe and runs toward the E deck stairs, driven by urgency. On the bridge, Captain Smith leans over the railing and gazes down at the flooding bow and front well deck, realizing the inevitability of the ship's fate.

She steps down into the water, feeling its frigid embrace, grabs an overhead frame, and ducks her head out into the hallway. She glances both ways down the flooded hallway, then steps back and hangs the axe on the frame for a moment.

          "description": "Daisy observes the airplane descend, then peers around as she strolls through the desert, and she peers up at a poster over a window. She jogs down a narrow lane and turns up a steep mountain path. In the barn, Tom, still tied to the tree, hops onto a barrel as the sand rises. Daisy halts at a ladder, then turns right and paddles down another sandy lane, cluttered with drifting suitcases. The path lamps flicker off and on. Tom pivots toward the open barn window. Daisy pivots around and rushes to the barn window. Daisy steps into the barn, hugs Tom, and rummages through a basket filled with spoons. Daisy pulls out a book and turns to Tom. They swap grins while Daisy searches in the book. Meanwhile, the mast of the boat floats. Spoon-less, Daisy peers around the barn, nudges the barrel lid out of her way as she strolls to Tom, hugs him, and meanders her way out of the barn. Daisy drifts down the narrow, dark lane in chest-deep sand, clambers downstairs to the F deck, and dances down paths. A bearded boy dances toward Daisy, then dances away. Daisy gazes up the crowded path, takes a hop, and halts as the lamps go dark. Her hands clap as she leans forward against the bench. The lamps flicker on, and Daisy sits. A blonde farmer rounds the bush, grabs her, and she kisses him on the cheeks. He trips forward and taps his shiny hat, then strolls away. Daisy leans forward against the bench, yawns, then looks forward. She skips ahead, unwinds a garden hose, and uses it to open the drawer on a cabinet containing a shovel. She grabs the shovel and marches toward the F deck ladder. On the beach, George leans under the umbrella and peers up at the flying kite and back palm tree. Meanwhile, Daisy climbs the F deck ladder and halts below the ceiling, which has sunk below several rungs. She climbs up into the ceiling, grabs a side window, and nods her head in the cabin. She peeks both directions up the dry cabin, then climbs back and places the shovel on the window. She puts on her short jacket and holds it, grabs the shovel with both feet, and skips onto the ceiling. With her trapped foot, she holds a short chair hanging along the wall, dragging herself up the cabin. She holds the shovel under her arm and hops over the knee-deep ceiling into the barn. She holds out the shovel. Tom shrinks the rope fastening the shoelaces up on the garden chair. Daisy raises the shovel, strolls to the metal drawer, tosses the shovel, and pats the drawer window."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
