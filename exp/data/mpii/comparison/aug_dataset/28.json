Finally gathering the resolve, she slowly turns her head to look at Laszlo, who gently leans forward, his face moving closer to hers, and plants a tender kiss on her cheek. After this brief, intimate moment, he stands up, planting a second kiss on her cheek, then strides out the door, leaving her behind. Ilsa remains motionless for a few seconds, digesting the moment, before moving to the window. She parts the curtain to peer outside, noticing Victor walking purposefully down the street, and then she lets the blind fall back into place, cutting off the view. The figure that had been standing in the archway is now absent. With a sense of resolve, Ilsa retrieves a cloak from the bedroom, wraps it around herself, and exits the hotel room. In another part of town, Carl is engrossed in calculations, busily figuring as he and Rick sit side by side at the bar, their concentration focused on the ledgers spread out before them. Amidst this work, Carl momentarily pauses, looking up at Rick with a shared laugh. At that moment, Ilsa arrives to meet Rick, and as they come together, Rick walks towards the window with Ilsa trailing behind him. Rick approaches a nearby table, reaching for a cigarette box only to find it empty. Seeing tears beginning to form in Ilsa's eyes, he turns away briefly to strike a match and light a cigarette, composing himself before facing her again. He halts abruptly at the sight of Ilsa standing there, a small revolver gripped in her hand and pointed at him. Rick edges closer, and Ilsa's grip on the weapon falters as her hand drops, fresh tears spilling from her eyes. She pivots away from him, starting to walk off, but Rick follows insistently, enfolding her into his arms, where she finds herself engulfed in his embrace. He holds her tightly, kissing her with deep passion. Later, Rick is at the window, his gaze fixed on the rotating beacon light at the airport as it casts its rhythmic glow. Ilsa is sitting on the couch, and in front of her, on the table, sit a bottle of champagne and two glasses, each half-filled with the bubbling liquid. Rick moves over to her side and sinks onto the couch beside her, where she gently rests her head on his shoulder, snuggling closer to him for warmth and comfort.

Instinctively, they rush inside the entryway, flattening themselves against the wall to remain unseen. Meanwhile, Laszlo and Carl, breathless from their haste, navigate through the darkness to a side entrance of Rick's establishment. They enter and make their way across to the bar, the exertion evident in their heavy breathing, while Carl moves efficiently behind the bar. Alerted by the sound of voices below, Rick crosses quietly to the door, opening it just enough to survey the scene and then subtly flicks off the light to maintain their cover. Ilsa stands closely behind him, making a motion as if to step out onto the balcony, but Rick firmly but gently nudges her back, encouraging her to retreat behind the door for safety. He then steps out to the balcony railing, observing Carl tending to Laszlo, who appears to be wounded. Both men glance upwards, Carl's face etched with curiosity as he starts toward the stairway, ascending the steps with resolve. Carl enters Rick's apartment and is met with the sight of Ilsa, leading to an encounter that adds another layer to the unfolding drama."

          "description": "Mortimer flicks on the fan and reclines on the hammock beside him. It feels lively and a chatter rises between them; Eliza still refuses to glance at him. Eliza eventually faces Mortimer, and he leaps up and shakes her hand. He shakes her hand and heads into the garden. She lingers there for a moment, then strolls to peer out of the mirror. She glimpses Gabriel floating down the river and reopens the drapes. The statue in the courtyard has vanished. Eliza retrieves a jacket from the kitchen and exits the study. Oscar is busy sketching as Gavin and Oscar stand by the fountain and examine sketches. Oscar glances over at Gavin and giggles. Eliza approaches to greet Gavin, and he marches over to the mirror with Eliza trailing. Gavin strides over to a box and unseals a candy tin, but finds it vacant. There is laughter in her voice now, and he turns away to unwrap a candy, then back to Eliza. He hesitates as he notices Eliza brandishing a small umbrella in her hand, aimed directly at him. He saunters toward her, and her hand lowers with laughter in her heart again. She pivots and shuffles away from him, but Gavin tails her and holds her in his arms, where she is immersed in his hug. He presses her firmly against him and shakes her excitedly. From his porch, Gavin watches the rotating lighthouse beam at the harbor. Eliza sits on the hammock, and on a bench before her rests a platter of fruits alongside two half-empty bowls. Gavin strolls over to her and reclines beside Eliza. Eliza rests her head on Gavin's lap and leans closer to him. They dash outside the lobby as the beams of a racing ambulance glide toward them, and the beams pass by them. They squeeze themselves against a tree to avoid detection. Mortimer and Oscar meander through the sunlight toward a side exit of Gavin's. Mortimer and Oscar enter and wander toward the fountain, exhausted from their adventures, as Oscar steps behind the fountain. Gavin and Eliza listen to music below. Gavin saunters to the door, opens it just enough to peer below, and flicks on the fan. Eliza stands just behind him and gestures as if to step out to the porch, but Gavin nudges her back, and she retreats behind the door. Gavin walks out to the porch railing and sees Oscar tending to Mortimer, who seems to be napping. Both Oscar and Mortimer gaze up as Oscar gazes up curiously, then advances toward the ladder and ascends the stairs. Oscar enters Gavin's library and spots Eliza."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby cafÃ©, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
