As he turns, his gaze falls upon the weights clamped onto the ends of the barbell. Simultaneously, Joseph strides towards him, observing with a tense composure. David shifts his body, twisting around to glance at the opposite end of the bar, all while Joseph maintains his watchful stance. Joseph then retreats a few steps towards an open door that is covered, perhaps for privacy or protection. Back on the bench, David widens his grip on the bar so that his hands are positioned wider than the span of his shoulders and then proceeds to lift the weight. With controlled movement, he lowers the bar gingerly to his chest and subsequently pushes it back up with strength until his arms extend straight. Maintaining focus, he repeats the action of lowering the bar and extends his arms once more, all under Joseph’s steady gaze. Eventually, David guides the bar back onto the supports. Taking a moment to recalibrate, David cautiously wraps his hands around the bar again, this time feeling for the optimal grip, noting that additional weights have been attached. With a slight frown furrowing his brow, he braces himself on the bench, clearly aware of the increased challenge. As David steadily lowers the bar to his chest, his arms quiver, his eyes squeeze shut, and his face contorts with effort. He presses the bar back up to full extension, repeats the pressing motion, and deftly replaces the bar onto the supports. Above the bar, Joseph’s pale face appears upside down from David’s perspective, standing two steps up the staircase. Upon raising the bar, David notices two large paint cans taped next to the weights on either end. Exhausted, he drops the bar back onto its supports, and his left arm flops to the floor while his right hand continues to grip the bar, holding himself upright. Joseph descends the stairs with deliberate slowness and approaches David, who twists around to scrutinize the weights and the attached paint cans at both ends of the bar, his brow creased with concentration. Joseph looks on in awe at the spectacle of David’s exertion. Meanwhile, in the quiet of a hospital room, Elijah lies motionless in bed, nodding almost imperceptibly. Elsewhere, inside a bustling reception area, Audrey sorts through a pile of papers at the desk as a nurse approaches and directs her attention across the room. In response, Audrey hands the nurse a yellow file, accepts another one in exchange, and proceeds to traverse the open-plan office. She leans through a doorway and greets the room with a warm smile, eventually settling onto a low couch in a treatment room. Her gaze lifts towards Elijah, who observes her from his wheelchair, his right leg immobilized by a metal frame. Outside, the street near the stadium lies empty, presenting a stark contrast to the hustle within. Inside the shaded walkways, David, clad in his security uniform, casually leans against a wall, his eyes tracking the throng of spectators as they funnel through a gate. After a moment of contemplation, he averts his gaze to the ground and, with a slight push off the wall, he moves to the center of the walkway, head down and hands resting in his pockets. The crowd, lively and cheerful, flows around him, occasionally jostling him, but he remains unreactive. Among them, a large woman wearing a vibrant pink coat, her blonde hair cascading over her shoulders, tugs a small boy along by hand and unintentionally collides with David."

          "description": "Oliver perches down and places his nose to one side curiously, spins to observe the keys on the edges of the table, and Rebecca strolls over to him. Oliver swivels around to peer at the opposite edge of the table while Rebecca watches nervously. Rebecca takes numerous hops backward towards a closed glass cabinet. On the couch, Oliver spreads his wings out wider than his elbows and seizes the feather, nudges the table gently to his beak, and pulls down until his legs are bent. He raises the table again and bends his legs, while Rebecca gapes. Finally, Oliver nudges the table back onto the pegs. Oliver's wings clutch the table gently, searching for the best hold since even more feathers have been glued to the table this round. Oliver is frowning slightly, and Rebecca dwells in the wardrobe. On his couch, Oliver steadies himself and nudges the table to his beak. Legs trembling, eyes tightly closed, face scrunched, he hoists it up to full stretch, repeats the hoist, and relocates the table. Below the table, Rebecca's red hat emerges sideways to Oliver, standing three hops up the ladder. As the table descends, two large books appear pinned to it beside the feathers. Oliver nudges the table back in its pegs, his left wing flops to the floor, but with his right still holding the table, he steadies himself upright. Rebecca descends the ladder and strolls slowly over to Oliver, who swivels around to examine the feathers and the books at either edge of the table. Oliver's eyes narrow, and Rebecca peers at him in astonishment. Noah is resting in a lounge chair and winks almost unnoticeably. Inside, Helen is sifting through documents on a front desk as a doctor approaches her and gestures across the corridor. Helen passes the doctor a blue folder, accepts another one from the doctor, and strolls across the open-plan hallway. She peeks through a doorway and grins, reclining on a high stool in an examination room. She glances up at Noah, who's observing her from his rocking chair, and a wooden brace keeps his left arm straight. The garden outside the arena is deserted, and inside, along one of the dim paths, Oliver, in his waiter outfit, reclines on a pillar, nonchalantly observing visitors as they pour in through a turnstile. He glances elsewhere, gazes at the ceiling, and after a moment, propels himself off the pillar, saunters to the center of the path with his head lowered and hands on his hips. The visitors flow past him, giggling and chuckling. They shove and nudge him, some nearly displacing him, but he remains still. A tall man in a green jacket, with black hair draping over his ears, tugging a big girl by the arm, collides with him."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

As David pushes the bar with paint cans attached, he struggles, but manages a full extension before resting. Joseph appears in awe of David's efforts. Meanwhile, Elijah lies in a hospital bed, and Audrey, sorting papers at a reception desk, interacts with a nurse before entering a treatment room where Elijah observes her from a wheelchair. Outside a stadium, David, in his security uniform, idly leans against a wall, observing the entering crowd. Despite being jostled by passersby, he remains unfazed, maintaining a detached demeanor."
