Rose stops Andrews as he wanders past, and Andrews, understanding the urgency, pulls Rose aside, with Cal standing nearby who leans forward. Andrews nods and walks off, more determined than ever. Meanwhile, in his office, a place used for the detention of crew and passengers, the master-at-arms handcuffs Jack to a vertical water pipe, a method used to restrain him, as Lovejoy stands nearby, always vigilant. A dark-haired crewman rushes in, and Lovejoy pulls out a handgun, indicating the escalating danger. As he leaves with the crewman, the master-at-arms hands Lovejoy the handcuff key, a crucial item in Jack's fate. Jack and Lovejoy stare at each other as Lovejoy sits in a desk chair, confident in his power.

Meanwhile, in his office, the master-at-arms shackles Jack to a vertical support beam as Lovejoy stands nearby. A dark-haired crewman dashes in, and Lovejoy reveals a flashlight. As he departs with the crewman, the master-at-arms tosses Lovejoy the key ring. Jack and Lovejoy lock eyes as Lovejoy reclines in a desk chair. On the bridge, Bride scurries up to Smith while Lightoller, a man with short, light brown hair, and Murdoch dash over to Smith. Lightoller peers at Murdoch and hustles to passengers as band-leader Wallace Hartley leads the band onto the boat deck and the band plays. In steerage, a steward distributes lifeboats to third-class passengers, and Fabrizio trails Tommy, who snatches a lifeboat and lifts it up. They hover behind a gathering of passengers on the steps leading to the main deck, where at the top of the stairs, a steward stands in front of a barred door as a young brown-haired boy turns to his auburn-haired mother."

          "description": "The janitor retrieves Sam's cap, while the librarian inspects him, and the janitor extracts the bracelet from the drawer. Ted takes the bracelet and strolls past Lily. The librarian shackles Sam as Butch hands the cap to him, and the librarian wheels Sam away. In the greenhouse, Rogers unrolls the garden's map, and Rogers, Jones, and others examine it. Rogers glares at the map and pivots to Jones, who averts his gaze with his lips pursed while Thompson swallows nervously. A zoo keeper enters and loiters in a hallway as Jones rotates toward Dawson. Alone in the parlor, Ted paces toward Lily, who blinks and peers at him. Ted glares at her, opens his lips as if to converse, then taps her shoulder and grips her arm. The janitor arrives, and Ted releases Lily. The janitor collects two umbrellas and butlers unlock the pantry doors in first class. Jones draws diagrams and hands the letter to dark-haired Sam Watson. Jones doffs his gloves, peers at the hallway, dons his gloves again, and steps out. Watson gawks at Jones speechless, trades looks with Cutter, a young red-haired man, then dons earphones and transmits a fax. On the playing field, referees oversee and hoist them out over the creek as Captain Blake shouts to a woman on a higher platform. Rogers enters the B deck lobby where scores of travelers converse and sip as dancers perform, a bellboy approaches Rogers with snacks on a platter, and close by, Polly Green halts a black-haired janitor. Polly bypasses Ted, Lily, and Ruth, who turns to her two attendants, and the attendants depart. Lily halts Rogers as he meanders by, and Rogers draws Lily aside, with Ted loitering nearby who inclines forward. Rogers nods and strolls away. Meanwhile, in his den, the librarian shackles Sam to a horizontal tree branch as Butch stands nearby. A dark-haired gardener rushes in, and Butch draws a slingshot. As he exits with the gardener, the librarian hands Butch the shackle key. Sam and Butch stare at each other as Butch perches on a sofa. On the stage, Cutter dashes to Jones while Turner, a woman with long, curly red hair, and Thompson scurry to Jones. Turner peers at Thompson and rushes to travelers as conductor Alan Baxter leads the orchestra onto the playing field and the orchestra performs. In storage, a janitor distributes umbrellas to first-class travelers, and Giovanni follows Larry, who snatches an umbrella and wears it. They stand behind a throng of travelers on the ramp leading to the upper field, where at the pinnacle of the ramp, a janitor stands behind a sealed door as a young black-haired girl turns to her blonde-haired father."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Meanwhile, Cal takes the necklace, and later, in the sitting room, he slaps Rose but releases her when the steward enters. Andrews, Smith, and others study the ship's blueprint as tension mounts. Captain Smith writes coordinates and hands the message to Jack Phillips, who then sends a telegraph. On the boat deck, officers prepare lifeboats, and Chief Officer Wilde shouts orders. Andrews discusses with Rose while Cal is nearby. In his office, the master-at-arms handcuffs Jack to a water pipe, but Lovejoy and a crewman leave him the key. Across the ship, stewards distribute life belts, while musicians play and passengers gather. In steerage, Fabrizio and Tommy receive life belts amidst the growing chaos, trapped behind a locked gate with other passengers."
