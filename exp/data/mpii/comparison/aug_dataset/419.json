Amused, Bert gets up and joins Eddie at the bar, laughs, and signals the bartender for another round. He starts to go, and Eddie exits. The sound of a ship's horn is heard as Eddie walks past the piers and warehouses toward a small waterfront bar called Arthur's Pool Hall. The atmosphere at Arthur's is stifling and oppressive, with a few lonely drinkers, dock workers, sitting stooped over their beer bottles at the bar. In the back is a pool table where, as Eddie enters, two burly men with cue sticks in hand are watching a pale, skinny young man line up his shot. They exchange glances, sizing each other up, and then the young man shoots. Eddie goes to the rack and takes a cue, while one of the other players puts away his cue. The young man makes his break shot, slamming the nine into the pocket, and grins snidely at Eddie. The other two men, the losers, stand around, mutely following the play. Eddie tosses a coin on the table and collects it while the young man racks up the balls. Preparing to break, Eddie chalks his cue, rams the cue ball into the pack, and the nine drops in.

He wipes his mouth with his sleeve, nervously backs away, tries to back off but finds nowhere to go, and makes a casual movement toward the table. Turk takes the bills from the table and stuffs them into Eddie's breast pocket. They drag Eddie into the men's room and shove him up against the ground-glass partition.",

He is seated at a table, with a drink in hand, and attentively observes Eddie as he strides past him on his way to the bar. Eddie, in passing, glances toward Bert, who, with a smile filled with amusement, gets up from his seat and accompanies Eddie over to the bar. Laughing heartily, Bert gestures animatedly to the bartender to bring them another round of drinks. As Bert begins to part ways, Eddie too makes his exit. The distant sound of a ship's horn reverberates in the air, as Eddie proceeds past the piers and warehouses, making his way to a small, somewhat shabby waterfront bar that goes by the name of Arthur's Pool Hall. Inside Arthur's, the atmosphere is stifling and oppressive, inhabited by a few solitary drinkers and dock workers who are hunched over their beer bottles at the bar. Toward the back of the room stands a solitary pool table where, upon Eddie's entrance, two robust, burly men, each holding a cue stick, watch with keen focus as a pale, skinny young man lines up his shot. As they exchange glances, sizing each other up, the young man takes his deliberate shot. Eddie approaches the collection of cues and carefully selects one, just as one of the other players puts his cue to rest. The young man confidently makes his break shot, sending the nine ball forcefully into the pocket, a snide grin spreading across his face directed at Eddie. The other two men, having lost, stand silently, their eyes following the play intently. Eddie tosses a coin onto the table and retrieves it, while the young man busies himself, racking up the balls once more. As he prepares to break, Eddie methodically chalks his cue, then strikes the cue ball with precision into the pack, watching as the nine ball drops in. A stunned silence envelops the room, leaving everyone, particularly the young man, momentarily speechless. Eddie, overtaken by the moment, shoots with the same exceptional skill he had once displayed at Ames, sinking shots with effortless precision, entirely oblivious to the menacing expressions on the faces of the gathering group of men encircling the table. Eddie executes a difficult shot, prompting the men to exchange uneasy glances, as he proceeds to make increasingly challenging shots and intricate combinations. He concludes with yet another combination shot, leaving the young man visibly uneasy as he reaches into his jacket for the money. All eyes fixate on Eddie as the young man, resigned to the inevitable outcome, pays up and places his cue down, quickly dropping the cash on the table before making a hasty departure. At this point, one of the remaining men, a thick-skinned, obscenely imposing individual known as Turk, steps forward with a contrived smile adorning his face. As Eddie looks around at the circle of silent, glaring men, any initial fury he harbored gives way to an insidious sense of fear. Nervously, he wipes his mouth with his sleeve, backing away, attempting to make a casual retreat toward the table but finding no avenue for escape. Turk retrieves the bills from the table and stuffs them into Eddie's breast pocket. Thereafter, they forcefully drag Eddie into the men's room and shove him against the ground-glass partition with determined intent."

The sound of a train's whistle is heard as the lamp walks past the trees and benches toward a small downtown café called Willow's Art Studio. The atmosphere at Willow's is tense and gloomy, with a few lonely diners, street performers, sitting slumped over their coffee cups at the counter. In the corner is a chessboard where, as the lamp enters, two hefty women with pawn pieces in hand are watching a pale, skinny young child line up its move. They exchange glances, sizing each other up, and then the child plays. The lamp goes to the board and takes a bishop, while one of the other players puts away its bishop.

The echo of a train's whistle is heard as Carla saunters past the plazas and offices toward a quaint riverside café called Oliver's Dart Corner. The ambiance at Oliver's is tense and suffocating, with a few solitary readers, clerks, hunched over their coffee mugs at the counter. In the corner is a dartboard where, as Carla steps in, two hefty women with darts in hand are observing a pale, lanky youth aim his throw. They exchange nods, evaluating each other, and then the youth tosses. Carla heads to the board and grabs a dart, while one of the other players stores her dart.

The echo of a car engine is heard as Tony strolls past the shops and kiosks toward a tiny harbor cafe called Harold's Bakery. The ambiance at Harold's is cramped and suffocating, with a few solitary artists, carpenters, slouching over their tea cups in the corner. In the alley is a chessboard where, as Tony enters, two burly chefs with aprons in hand are observing a gaunt, lanky teenager arrange his pieces.

Tony makes a daring move, and the observers swap nervous glances as Tony proceeds to execute more daring maneuvers and complex formulas.

All gazes fixate on Tony as the teenager, anticipating the inevitable, pays the debt, sets down his book, drops the coins on the board, and scurries out hastily. Then one of the remaining fellows, a burly, unsightly individual named Marvin, steps forth with a patronizing grin. As Tony scans the circle of silent, brooding figures, his bravado dissipates into apprehension.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
