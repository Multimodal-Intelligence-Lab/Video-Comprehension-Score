Gittes is a little startled at observing Evelyn as the Chinese Butler materializes on the veranda, nods, and vanishes. Evelyn settles at a glass-topped table, and Gittes accompanies her. The iced tea arrives on a tray which Ramon places down between them. Evelyn glances up, and Gittes grins a little bashfully and then chuckles a little nervously, nodding. Gittes maneuvers up a winding route, trailing a flood channel up into the arid hills, arriving at the gateway to the reservoir where a rescue vehicle is stationed. The chain-link fence with its KEEP OUT sign is ajar, and there are individuals milling around. The reservoir is beneath, and Gittes' automobile is halted by a couple of uniformed officers. He retrieves one of Yelburton's cards from his handkerchief pocket and delivers it to the sentry, driving past through the portal along the reservoir. Gittes halts and exits the car, spotting a patrol car and an unmarked one, with several men with their backs turned, one conversing softly, gazing down into the reservoir where other men in small boats are seemingly dredging for something. One of the men rotates and notices Gittes, visibly astonished, as Loach attempts to usher him down the path, and at the sound of his elevated voice, a man standing at the brink of the channel, conversing with two boys in swimming trunks, turns around, resulting in both Gittes and Escobar registering considerable astonishment at seeing one another. The men surrounding them are extremely uneasy as they step a couple of strides, with Gittes reaching into his pocket to extract his cigarette case, to which Escobar nods and ultimately smiles. The other officers, two plainclothesmen and a uniformed official, observe them. Escobar gestures down to the reservoir where a couple of men utilizing poles with hooks are fishing about in the water and succeed in ensnaring something, exposing the drenched back of a man's coat, then commence to pull the body into the skiff, standing over the corpse of Mulwray. Escobar has the sheet pulled back, then drops it as Evelyn nods. Escobar and Evelyn move a few feet to one side and murmur, almost as though they were trying to prevent the cadaver from hearing them, then proceed slowly toward the entrance.

Gittes is a little taken aback at seeing Evelyn as the Chinese Butler appears on the veranda nods and disappears. Evelyn sits at a glasstopped table and Gittes joins her. The iced tea comes on a tray which Ramon sets down between them. Evelyn looks up and Gittes smiles a little sheepishly and then laughs a little nervously nodding. Escobar points down to the reservoir where a couple of men using poles with hooks are fishing about in the water and manage to hook something revealing the soaking back of a man's coat then start to pull the body into the skiff standing over the body of Mulwray. Escobar has the sheet drawn back then drops it as Evelyn nods. Escobar and Evelyn move a few feet to one side and whisper almost as though they were trying to keep the corpse from hearing them then move slowly toward the door. Evelyn looks at Escobar but does not know how to answer him and Escobar nods while Gittes has been sitting on a wooden bench smoking and listening."

          "description": "Prudence is sporting overalls that are tinted green on the outside of the knees and threaded with blue peacock feathers, as well as hiking sandals, and despite shivering slightly, she appears older than she did at the bakery. Mortimer is a bit startled at noticing Prudence as the Brazilian Mechanic emerges on the patio, salutes, and vanishes. Prudence perches on a metal-framed couch, and Mortimer ambles over to her. The lemonade arrives on a platter that Horace places down beside them. Prudence glances down, and Mortimer smirks a bit awkwardly and then chuckles a bit apprehensively, saluting. Mortimer pedals up a twisting path, trailing a rain pipe down into the damp valleys, arriving at the entrance to the waterfall where an ambulance is stationed. The wooden gate with its WELCOME sign is shut, and there are animals wandering around. The waterfall is above, and Mortimer's bike is halted by a pair of armored soldiers. He pulls out one of Anderson's tickets from his vest pocket and hands it to the sentry, cycling past through the arch along the waterfall. Mortimer halts and climbs off the bike, noting a fire truck and a camouflaged one, with several women with their fronts turned, one speaking loudly, gazing up into the waterfall where other women in large canoes are seemingly searching for something. One of the women turns and spots Mortimer, visibly startled, as Baxter attempts to guide him up the trail, and at the noise of her hushed words, a woman positioned at the rim of the pipe, conversing with two girls in raincoats, pivots, resulting in both Mortimer and Sandoval acknowledging considerable astonishment at seeing each other. The women nearby are extremely relaxed as they shuffle a few strides, with Mortimer reaching into his bag to pull out his bubblegum tin, to which Sandoval acknowledges and eventually grins. The other soldiers, two undercover agents and an armored guard, observe them. Sandoval gestures up to the waterfall where a pair of women using nets with magnets are combing around in the air and manage to snare something, revealing the dripping top of a woman's hat, then begin to lift the figure into the canoe, overlooking the figure of Dubois. Sandoval has the curtain pulled forward, then releases it as Prudence acknowledges. Sandoval and Prudence shift a few inches to the other side and murmur, nearly as if they were endeavoring to prevent the statue from seeing them, then shift leisurely toward the window. Prudence stares at Sandoval but can't determine how to respond, and Sandoval acknowledges while Mortimer has been reclining on a plastic stool, chewing and observing."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

          "description": "Evelyn, wearing riding gear, sits with Gittes at a table, receiving iced tea from a butler. Gittes later drives to a reservoir, encountering police at an open gate with a KEEP OUT sign. Presenting a card, he proceeds to the site where police are dredging. Gittes' arrival surprises a man, Escobar, as they recognize each other. Amidst uneasy police, Gittes takes out his cigarette case, prompting a nod and smile from Escobar. They observe as the police pull a body, identified as Mulwray, from the water. Escobar and Evelyn whisper aside, avoiding disturbing the corpse, while Gittes listens, smoking on a bench."
