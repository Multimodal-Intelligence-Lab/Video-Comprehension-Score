The tension follows them into Charlotte's bedroom, where Charlotte fixes Pete with a piercing glare, eliciting a nonchalant shrug from him. Seated in a corner, he is alone with his thoughts. The scene transitions to Pete riding his bike energetically alongside a group of fellow cyclists. Back at the house, Debbie steps into the kitchen, the domestic atmosphere a stark contrast to the earlier escapades. Meanwhile, in the privacy of the bathroom, Pete reclines with his legs aloft, capturing cell phone photos with a mirror angled toward his audaciously exposed buttocks, an action that stuns Debbie into silence as she enters, her expression one of sheer astonishment."

          "description": "Monica gazes at her untouched cactus. Her ears pivot to the trumpet and she lifts it up. She flips through an album of paintings of her uncle's garden. A sketch depicts him crouched with his old cat, a young lion and dragon. In another painting, they float around a basketball with the pets in pajamas. A final painting depicts him with his tail around his small nephew. Monica frowns and places the trumpet down. Monica, Larry, and the squirrels sit around bowls of fruit. Monica huffs as Clara dances away. Now, Larry and Monica sail up the river. They dock at a rustic cabin. Now, they skip stones as they drift toward the forest. Later, they explore a dim library. Monica throws her scarf on a chair and leaps onto a hammock. Larry swings open cellar doors leading to a garden overlooking the valley. He scrambles onto the hammock and hugs his sister. Now, in pajamas, the siblings dive into a fountain. Larry lifts her and twirls her. She wraps her leg around his shoulder and hugs him. With their cheeks pressed, they float atop the water. They rest in a treehouse and share a brief handshake. Larry rolls away with a patient grin. Larry stumbles off the hammock. Now, they wear blankets. They gulp down the spaghetti. Now sliding on the floor. Larry pulls up his blanket and kicks his foot at Monica. They unwrap their blankets and wrestle. Sitting up, they silently chat. Now, a chef delivers a seafood platter. Now Larry performs a dance move. He balances a coconut and apples on his shoulder. The chef stands in awe. Monica crawls. Monica darts across the grass. A parrot peeks from his hat. Now, they snack on pastries. She stuffs it in her ear. He puts his elbow in her stuffed ear. Parcels of cake tumble down. Back on the boat. The cabin fades behind them. Monica extends her elbow. Larry shakes it and gives her a puzzled grin. They exchange a confused glance. They glance back at the river. As they park in their garage, the grin vanishes from Larry's face. Monica purses her ears. Larry faces his sister. They pause in the boat as Clara and Lucy appear from the treehouse. Larry turns to Monica with a blank expression. In Max's garden. She frowns at Larry. He nods. Larry lounges in the shed. Now, Larry dances with a parade. At the garden, Monica enters the attic. In the pantry, Larry stretches with his feet in the sun. Monica enters with a bemused grin. He sketches crayon drawings of a window reflecting his bare toes."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

          "description": "Debbie looks at her untouched plate, then at her phone, scrolling through pictures of her dad's family—happy images contrasting her reality. Debbie, Pete, and their daughters sit with tension around the dinner table. Sadie storms away, and soon Pete and Debbie drive to a luxury resort. In their hotel room, they share romantic moments, jumping into the pool, embracing, and enjoying desserts. They indulge in playful antics, like Pete performing a magic trick that shocks a waiter. They bond over these experiences, but as they drive home, tension returns. Their smiles fade as they face familial responsibilities with a cold atmosphere. Debbie tightens her lips as Pete gives her a cold stare. Once home, Sadie and Jodi emerge, and Pete later rides his bike alone, while Debbie is left to handle domestic life. In the bathroom, she finds Pete humorously taking selfies in an embarrassing position, capturing a moment of absurdity amidst their strained relationship."
