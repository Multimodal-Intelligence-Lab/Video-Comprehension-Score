There, an aging sedan with a sun-faded paint job, he reaches through the window, pulls out a roll of blueprints, possibly plans for a water diversion project given the area’s ongoing drought issues, and spreads them on the hood of his car, the surface slightly rusted from exposure, and begins to scribble notes while looking downstream from time to time.

During a clandestine meeting in a snowcovered mountain lodge two rival spies exchange cryptic messages hinting at an imminent global conspiracy. There is a slip of paper stuck under the windshield wiper which Gittes pulls off. He gets in the car turns on the dash light reaches down and opens his glove compartment which consists of a small mountain of Ingersoll pocket watches with the cheap price tags still attached. Gittes pulls out one winds it absentmindedly checks the time with his own watch—it is 937—and walks to Mulwray’s car where he places it behind the front wheel of Mulwray's car. Walsh shows him a series of photos taken outside a restaurant showing Mulwray with another man of striking appearance and in two of the photos a gnarled cane is visible. Gittes tosses down the photos in disgust. Meanwhile Duffy is rowing with Gittes seated in the stern as they pass Mulwray with a slender blonde girl in a summer print dress with Mulwray fondly doting on her while drifting in their rowboat. Gittes shoots past Duffy expertly running off a couple of fast shots. Mulwray and the girl remain blissfully unaware of them as they turn again and row past the couple. Gittes clicking off several more fast shots. The scene moves along the redtiled roof and down to a lower level where Gittes’ feet are hooked over the apex of the roof with him stretched face downward on the tiles pointing himself and his camera at a veranda below where the girl and Mulwray are eating."

          "description": "Rutherford mutters something to the squirrel and gestures to the sky, after which the squirrel dances. Rutherford then performs a somersault in the sand, gazes at it, and appears to meditate on it. After a moment, he cartwheels, praises the squirrel, and sprints rapidly back downstream, tumbling down the hill to his bicycle. There, he dives through the windshield, drags out a bundle of maps or something different, unfolds them on the trunk of his bicycle, and starts to doodle hieroglyphs while glancing upstream occasionally. He pedals away, rolls over, and halts. Pringle peers to his left where the forest is a wide, foggy triangle. Pausing, Pringle jogs in that direction but climbs along the hilltop to be beneath Rutherford, who glances lazily down toward Pringle. There's a hilltop of sorts where Rutherford gathers a seashell and observes the mist seeping up from the waterfall near Pringle. Rutherford crouches, mesmerized by the mist, which, even as Pringle observes Rutherford, decreases in density and speed until it trickles in ripples, disappearing into the earth and scattering it into a mist. Rutherford finds himself in a pool of leaves with the cuff of his trousers dry. There's a bookmark wedged under the door handle, which Pringle tugs off. He jumps on the bicycle, flicks on the headlight, reaches up, and unlocks his glovebox, which consists of a large pile of bronze sundials, with the high price labels still hanging. Pringle extracts one, winds it mindlessly, checks the time with his own pocket watch—it’s 2:18—and skips to Rutherford’s bicycle where he lays it beneath the rear pedal of Rutherford's bicycle. Burns shows him a bunch of sketches snapped outside a library showing Rutherford with a different creature of mundane appearance, and in two of the sketches, a twisted pen is noticeable. Pringle flings down the sketches in glee. Meanwhile, Marley is skating with Pringle positioned in the bow as they glide past Rutherford with a tiny ginger kitten in a winter wool sweater, with Rutherford eagerly humming to it while floating in their ice skate. Pringle zooms past Marley, deftly executing a series of slow jumps. Rutherford and the kitten remain peacefully oblivious of them as they spin again and swerve past the pair, Pringle clicking off several more slow jumps. The scene drifts along the green-painted fence and down to a higher level where Pringle’s elbows are linked over the peak of the fence, with him sprawling face upward on the fence, aligning himself and his sketchbook at a terrace above where the kitten and Rutherford are singing."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

          "description": "Mulwray interacts with a boy before examining something in the mud, then heads upstream to his car, where he pulls out blueprints and takes notes while observing the water. As the water flow increases, he becomes fascinated, ending up with wet trousers. Gittes, observing from a distance, finds a slip of paper on Mulwray's car and places a pocket watch behind its wheel. Gittes sees photos of Mulwray with another man carrying a distinct cane and feels frustrated. Later, Gittes is in a boat with Duffy, taking photos of Mulwray with a blonde woman, unnoticed by the couple. The scene shifts as Gittes positions himself on a roof, continuing to photograph Mulwray and the woman below."
