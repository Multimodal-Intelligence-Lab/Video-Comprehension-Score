The front door opens, and Lynn carries Cole in, asleep on her shoulder. She carries him down the hall to his bedroom and gently lays him on his bed next to his German Shepherd puppy. Lynn watches the two youngsters sleep for a moment. Cole is curled up asleep with a tiny party hat clutched in his hands. Lynn has been carrying Cole's sweater from over her shoulder, and she pulls it off and begins to fold it. Her attention is drawn to the sweater as she fingers the fabric of the back, discovering it's ripped. Her eyes move to Cole, and in the middle of the back of his T-shirt are three small tears. Lynn pushes the fabric open with her fingers and sees deep fingernail-like scratches on his skin. Lynn looks around helplessly, fear creeping into her eyes, as the house seems threateningly still. An unnatural silence fills each room of the house, and the thermostat on the wall now reads fifty-two degrees. The door opens a crack, and Cole's tiny face peeks out, his eyes scanning the darkness. The door opens a little bit more, and Cole's knees are pressed together as his body dances a little—he has to pee. He moves cautiously into the hall and briskly to a door halfway down the corridor, turning on the light in the bathroom. He checks behind the shower curtain before he turns his back and pees into the toilet. Cole instantly stops peeing, and his body becomes very still as he slowly reaches for the toilet handle and flushes. He closes his pants and turns, just standing there and staring into the darkness of the hall, his breath forming tiny clouds in the cold air. Cole finally steps out into the hallway, and his eyes catch a slant of light now coming from the kitchen. He moves down the hall and turns the corner, coming to a stop in the doorway of the kitchen. Cole stares at the back of a person cooking food on the stove, and his fear slowly fades away. Suddenly, Cole's face turns the color of ash as he backs up to the doorway. The woman smiles menacingly as she thrusts her wrists forward, revealing they've been savagely cut. Cole turns and runs down the hall, across his room, and scurries in, his legs disappearing as the bedsheets flap closed behind him. The crazed woman stands at the end of the hall while Cole is curled up in the tent, the red interior of the tent gets lit up, and the bedsheet walls of the tent are lined with religious pictures taped to the walls.",

The facade door opens, and Lynn transports Cole in, asleep on her shoulder. She transports him down the passage to his chamber and softly places him on his mattress next to his German Shepherd dog. Lynn observes the two juveniles rest for a moment. Cole is snuggled up asleep with a tiny festive cap grasped in his hands. Lynn has been carrying Cole's sweater from over her shoulder, and she pulls it off and commences to fold it. Her focus is attracted to the sweater as she touches the textile of the back, discovering it's ripped. Her eyes shift to Cole, and in the middle of the rear of his shirt are three small rips. Lynn pushes the material open with her fingers and sees deep fingernail-like lacerations on his skin. Lynn glances around helplessly, fear creeping into her eyes, as the dwelling seems menacingly still. An unnatural stillness fills each chamber of the house, and the thermostat on the partition now displays fifty-two degrees. The portal opens a crack, and Cole's tiny visage peeks out, his eyes scanning the obscurity. The portal opens a little bit more, and Cole's legs are pressed together as his body prances a little—he has to urinate. He moves cautiously into the corridor and briskly to a door midway down the corridor, turning on the light in the lavatory. He checks behind the shower curtain before he turns his back and urinates into the toilet. Cole instantly stops urinating, and his body becomes very still as he slowly reaches for the toilet handle and flushes. He closes his trousers and turns, just standing there and staring into the obscurity of the corridor, his breath forming tiny clouds in the frigid air. Cole finally steps out into the passageway, and his eyes catch a slant of light now coming from the cooking area. He moves down the corridor and turns the corner, coming to a halt in the threshold of the cooking area. Cole gazes at the back of an individual preparing nourishment on the stove, and his fear slowly fades away. Suddenly, Cole's face turns the hue of ash as he retreats to the threshold. The lady smiles threateningly as she thrusts her wrists forward, revealing they've been brutally lacerated. Cole turns and runs down the corridor, across his chamber, and scurries in, his legs disappearing as the bedsheets flap closed behind him. The deranged woman stands at the end of the corridor while Cole is curled up in the tent, the red interior of the tent gets lit up, and the bedsheet walls of the tent are lined with holy pictures taped to the walls."

The two youngsters are watched sleeping by Lynn for a moment. Cole is curled up asleep with a tiny party hat clutched in his hands. Lynn has carried Cole's sweater from over her shoulder, and it is pulled off and is begun to be folded by her. Her attention is drawn to the sweater as the fabric of the back is fingered by her, and she discovers it's ripped. Her eyes move to Cole, and three small tears are found in the middle of the back of his T-shirt. The fabric is pushed open with her fingers by Lynn, and deep fingernail-like scratches are seen on his skin.

The shower curtain is checked behind by him before his back is turned and pee is released into the toilet. Peeling is instantly stopped by Cole, and his body is made very still as he slowly reaches for the toilet handle and flushes. His pants are closed and he turns, just standing there and staring into the darkness of the hall, with tiny clouds being formed by his breath in the cold air. The hallway is finally stepped out into by Cole, and a slant of light is caught by his eyes now coming from the kitchen.

She moves with gentle steps down the hallway, ensuring not to disturb his slumber, and enters his bedroom. There, she tenderly lays him on his bed, positioning him next to his German Shepherd puppy, who is already nestled in sleep. Lynn pauses, her gaze softening as she watches the peaceful scene of the two youngsters sleeping. Cole is curled up, his small hands clutching a tiny party hat, a remnant of earlier festivities. Draped over her shoulder, Lynn has been carrying Cole's sweater, and she now removes it, beginning to fold it with care. Her fingers brush against the fabric, and her attention is caught by an unexpected texture; she discovers the sweater is ripped. Her eyes shift to Cole, and she notices three small tears in the middle of the back of his T-shirt. With growing concern, Lynn gently pushes the fabric aside with her fingers, revealing deep, fingernail-like scratches etched into his skin. A sense of helplessness washes over her, and fear begins to creep into her eyes as she glances around the house, which now feels ominously still.

Suddenly, Cole halts midstream, his body becoming very still. He slowly reaches for the toilet handle, flushes, and then closes his pants. He turns, standing motionless, staring into the darkened hallway, his breath visible in the cold air as tiny clouds. Finally, Cole steps out into the hallway, his eyes catching a slant of light now emanating from the kitchen. He moves down the hall, turns the corner, and comes to a stop in the kitchen doorway. There, he sees the back of a person cooking food on the stove, and his initial fear begins to dissipate. But abruptly, Cole's face drains of color, turning ashen as he backs up to the doorway. The woman at the stove turns, smiling menacingly, and thrusts her wrists forward, revealing they have been savagely cut. Overcome with terror, Cole spins around and bolts down the hall, racing across his room and diving into his bed, his legs vanishing as the bedsheets flap closed behind him. The crazed woman stands ominously at the end of the hall while Cole curls up inside his tent.

She carries him down the hall to his bedroom, decorated with airplane-themed wallpaper, and gently lays him on his bed next to his German Shepherd puppy, a breed renowned for its loyalty and protective instincts. Lynn watches the two youngsters sleep for a moment. Cole is curled up asleep with a tiny party hat clutched in his hands, a remnant from his earlier birthday celebration. Lynn has been carrying Cole's sweater from over her shoulder, a woolen knit she had made for him last winter, and she pulls it off and begins to fold it.

The garage door opens, and Oliver carries Penny in, asleep on his saxophone. He carries her down the street to her kitchen and gently lays her on her chair next to her Siamese cat mug. Oliver watches the two notebooks sleep for a moment. Penny is curled up asleep with a tiny postcard clutched in her rugs. Oliver has been carrying Penny's scarf from over his balcony, and he pulls it off and begins to fold it. His attention is drawn to the scarf as he fingers the fabric of the window, discovering it's ripped. His eyes move to Penny, and in the middle of the back of her sweater are three small balloons. Oliver pushes the fabric open with his pillows and sees deep toothbrush-like scratches on her roof. Oliver looks around helplessly, sadness creeping into his eyes, as the mountain seems threateningly still. An unnatural silence fills each corner of the mountain, and the calendar on the floor now reads sixty-two minutes. The window opens a crack, and Penny's tiny boat peeks out, its eyes scanning the beach. The window opens a little bit more, and Penny's elbows are pressed together as its furniture dances a little—it has to hum. It moves cautiously into the grass and briskly to a window halfway down the landscape, turning on the light in the basement. It checks behind the shower curtain before it turns its back and hums into the trumpet. Penny instantly stops humming, and its furniture becomes very still as it slowly reaches for the trumpet handle and flutes. It closes its shoes and turns, just standing there and staring into the darkness of the grass, its breath forming tiny kites in the cold air. Penny finally steps out into the grass, and its pillows catch a slant of light now coming from the attic. It moves down the grass and turns the corner, coming to a stop in the doorway of the attic. Penny stares at the back of a bookshelf cooking socks on the desk, and its sadness slowly fades away. Suddenly, Penny's jaw turns the color of jade as it backs up to the doorway. The umbrella smiles menacingly as it thrusts its elbows forward, revealing they've been savagely cut. Penny turns and runs down the grass, across its guitar, and scurries in, its wheels disappearing as the bedsheets flap closed behind it.

The garage door closes, and Diane wheels Lucas in, awake on her back. She wheels him down the street to his living room and softly stands him on his couch next to his Siamese cat kitten. Diane observes the two youngsters doze for a moment. Lucas is sprawled out awake with a tiny party whistle clasped in his hands. Diane has been wheeling Lucas's jacket from around her waist, and she slips it off and starts to hang it. Her gaze is attracted to the jacket as she traces the fabric of the front, realizing it's frayed. Her eyes glance at Lucas, and in the middle of the front of his sweater are three small rips. Diane pulls the fabric apart with her fingers and notices faint claw-like marks on his skin. Diane searches around anxiously, dread rising in her eyes, as the room seems unsettlingly quiet. A natural quiet fills each space of the room, and the clock on the wall now reads three o'clock. The window opens a gap, and Lucas's little nose peeks out, his eyes inspecting the shadows. The window opens wider, and Lucas's elbows are pressed together as his body shakes a bit—he has to sneeze. He tiptoes cautiously into the street and swiftly to a door halfway down the avenue, switching on the light in the lounge. He checks under the sofa before he turns his back and sneezes into the handkerchief. Lucas immediately stops sneezing, and his body becomes very calm as he slowly reaches for the sink faucet and washes. He fastens his scarf and turns, just pausing there and peering into the dimness of the street, his breath forming tiny wisps in the chilly air. Lucas finally steps out into the street, and his eyes catch a flicker of light now coming from the basement. He strolls down the street and turns the corner, pausing at the edge of the basement. Lucas gazes at the back of a person mopping the floor, and his anxiety gradually dissipates. Suddenly, Lucas's face turns the shade of chalk as he retreats to the edge. The man grins maliciously as he lifts his sleeves forward, revealing they've been crudely bruised. Lucas spins and dashes down the street, across his house, and ducks in, his arms vanishing as the curtains flutter closed behind him. The frantic man stands at the end of the street while Lucas is huddled up in the fort, the blue exterior of the fort gets illuminated, and the curtain walls of the fort are adorned with family photographs taped to the surface."

Lynn observes the two youngsters rest for a moment. Cole is cuddled up asleep with a tiny balloon clutched in his hands. Lynn has been carrying Cole's blanket from over her arm, and she shrugs it off and begins to drape it. Her attention is drawn to the blanket as she traces the weave of the edge, discovering it's frayed. Her eyes shift to Cole, and in the middle of the back of his pajama top are three small threads.

Wendy observes the two little ones snooze for a while. Felix is sprawled out awake with a tiny balloon animal gripped in his toes. Wendy has been dragging Felix's cap from under her arm, and she pulls it out and starts to unfold it. Her gaze is attracted to the cap as she caresses the surface of the brim, realizing it's frayed. Her sight shifts to Felix, and in the middle of the back of his hoodie are three small gouges. Wendy tugs the cloth apart with her palms and notices shallow claw-like marks on his body. Wendy glances around hopelessly, dread slipping into her face, as the cottage feels ominously quiet. An eerie soundlessness fills each chamber of the cottage, and the thermostat by the window now displays eighty-eight degrees. The panel opens a sliver, and Felix's tiny foot peers out, his toes surveying the daylight. The panel opens a tad more, and Felix's elbows are pressed apart as his torso sways a little—he needs to sneeze. He tiptoes warily into the stairway and swiftly to a panel halfway up the corridor, switching on the light in the storage room. He checks inside the clothes hamper before he turns his face and sneezes into the basket. Felix suddenly stops sneezing, and his figure becomes very stiff as he gently reaches for the basket latch and locks it. He closes his jacket and turns, just standing there and gazing into the brightness of the stairway, his voice forming tiny echoes in the warm breeze. Felix finally steps into the stairway, and his eyes catch a sliver of shadow now coming from the pantry. He strides up the corridor and turns the nook, arriving at a halt in the entry of the pantry. Felix watches the front of a stranger grating cheese on the counter, and his anxiety gradually dissipates. Abruptly, Felix's visage turns the hue of ember as he shuffles to the entryway. The man grins wickedly as he thrusts his elbows upward, showing they've been lightly bruised. Felix pivots and bolts up the stairway, past his closet, and darts in, his hands disappearing as the curtain drapes swing closed behind him. The frantic man stands in the middle of the stairway while Felix is sprawled out in the closet, the blue interior of the closet gets dimmed, and the curtain walls of the closet are scattered with floral stickers stuck to the walls."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
