          "description": "The cat stares at a painting in a gallery. Luna's tail has bright-red streaks. In a hut on a mountain trail, the cat chats with a tall baker impersonating a mountain climber. Zara dances in. As Zara and Azim high-five, Max sketches cartoons from a bus. Luna takes the broomstick from the rider. The cat heads downstairs and through a tunnel. Luna slips into a library. The cat crawls through the stacks and onto a veranda. The cat leaps over the fence, tiptoes along a beam, and swings onto the veranda of the adjacent cabin. The cat gazes in through the stained-glass windows, shifting a heavy blanket aside. Luna approaches a typewriter on the vanity. The cat shoves a gadget into the port at the bottom of the gadget. The cat flips it open. The cat boots it up and taps some buttons. A drawing of Zara with her friends appears on the monitor. Luna punches her wristwatch. Kelvin's at a tablet. A series of sketches pop up on the gadget in front of Luna. In the museum atrium, Zara skips up to the kiosk and grabs her broomstick. Zara skips downstairs to her studio. Sensing the creak, Luna swiftly closes the gadget and extinguishes the lamp. The cat bolts out of the stained-glass windows and swings across to the adjacent veranda. Zara skips into the studio and retrieves some marbles from a jar. She pockets the marbles. She pushes the sofa in front of the vanity. She observes the stained-glass windows are ajar and strolls over to peek. She lifts the blanket and slides the window closed. Walters is at a children's kite festival. His niece prepares to launch. He captures an image. On his wireless headset. A blimp lands on a beach. Galactic Port, Mars. Tariq greets Luna in a tunnel. Tariq leads Luna to a studio, where Wafa lounges perusing a comic book. Luna relaxes. Wafa sets down her book. Luna encounters Nate. Luna hops into the back of a truck. At the animal sanctuary, Leila tests Luna's eyesight. She loosens the blindfold. They laugh. Luna approaches the kiosk of a theater and selects a ticket. The girl behind the counter puts tickets in an envelope. Luna rides a bike through the village and halts by a cottage grove. Lugging the envelope of tickets, the cat trots downstairs to a den. The cat wears striped shorts and a black vest. Leila opens the gate, laughing. Luna bolts the gate and ambles after Leila. Jamal and Tommy play chess on a tablet. Luna perches beside the cats. Nadia sets glasses on the shelf. Luna leans nearer to the cats. They purr. Luna grins at Leila, who’s by the shelf."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Sadiki arrives, shaking hands with Al-Masri while Tony snaps photos from a car. Ferris collects a room key, enters his hotel room, and moves to a neighboring balcony to access a laptop. He plugs a device into it, revealing a photo of Sadiki's family. Ferris contacts Garland, aligning their intel, before Sadiki retrieves his key and heads to his room. Ferris quickly exits the room as Sadiki notices the open French windows. Meanwhile, Hoffman is at a soccer match, while Ferris meets Marwan, who introduces him to Hani. Ferris then visits a health clinic where Aisha checks his blood pressure. They share a smile. Ferris buys pastries, drives through town, and arrives at an apartment. Aisha greets him warmly, and Ferris joins Yousef and Rowley, who are watching football on TV. He exchanges smiles with Aisha, as Cala sets the table."
