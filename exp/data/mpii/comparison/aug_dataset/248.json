Vincent walks toward the house located in Los Angeles, a city with a vibrant yet gritty underground culture, and pulls a note off the door before he enters, with video screens in the background and Mia's mouth coming toward a microphone. Vincent turns, walks, and finds the intercom on the wall, an essential communication device in many urban residences. Vincent's Malibu, a classic American car from the 1960s that exudes a certain coolness, then pulls up to a restaurant with a big sign featuring a neon figure of a cartoon surly cool cat jackrabbit in a red windbreaker towering over the establishment. Inside, Mia draws a square with her hands, causing dotted lines to appear on the screen, forming a square, an artistic gesture reminiscent of experimental films, which then disperse. Buddy, likely the eager waiter, exits as Vincent takes a look around the place, observing YUPPIES, a term for young urban professionals, dancing, DINERS biting into big, juicy hamburgers, and icons, possibly impersonators of famous celebrities, playing their parts. He hands Mia a rolled smoke, a term for a hand-rolled cigarette, which she takes and puts to her lips, and a Zippo lighter, a brand known for its durability and windproof flame, appears in Vincent's hand, which he uses to light it. He begins rolling one for himself as the sound of a subway car, an unusual presence in a diner setting given Los Angeles' limited subway system, fills the diner, making everything shake and rattle, and Marilyn Monroe, or rather a performer dressed as the iconic Hollywood star, runs to a square vent in the floor, prompting the entire restaurant to applaud. Buddy returns with the drinks, and Mia wraps her lips around the straw of her shake, a classic American diner treat often made with ice cream and milk, while Vincent smiles, takes a sip, and slides the shake back. Mia powders her nose by doing a big line of coke off the bathroom sink, her head jerking up from the rush, as Vincent digs into his Douglas Sirk steak, named after the famous filmmaker known for his melodramatic films, scanning the Hellsapopinish, a term suggesting an absurd or chaotic atmosphere, restaurant with his eyes. Mia returns to the table, pointing at Marilyn in the white dress serving a table, and then at a blonde waitress in a tight sweater and capri pants taking an order from a bunch of film geeks, people deeply passionate about cinema, and Mia and Vincent smile. Vincent is slow to answer, and patrons cheer as Ed Sullivan, the legendary television host known for introducing numerous entertainment acts, stands with Marilyn Monroe holding a trophy. Marilyn holds the trophy as Mia holds her hand, and Vincent reacts. Vincent and Mia walk onto the dance floor toward Ed Sullivan, as patrons cheer again. They walk up to the microphone and make hand movements, likely reminiscent of famous dance routines, as they dance, before the front door flings open, and Mia and Vincent dance tango-style, an intricate and passionate ballroom dance originating from Argentina, into the house. They finish their dance, laughing, and stand face to face looking at each other before Mia moves away to attend to both. Vincent hangs up his overcoat on a big bronze coat rack in the alcove, an area often used as an entryway, while Mia moves to her CD player, a popular music-playing device in the late 20th century, thumbs through a stack of CDs, and selects one: k.d., referring to k.d. lang, a renowned Canadian singer known for her unique blend of country and pop music, which blasts out of the speakers with a high-energy country number as Mia plays air-guitar, dances her way around the room, and finds herself wearing Vincent's overcoat."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
