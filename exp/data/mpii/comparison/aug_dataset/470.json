The table is completely covered in scattered papers, and the fireplace is cluttered with stacks of dirty dishes, adding to the chaotic atmosphere. Mozart's Masonic apron is casually draped over the forte-piano, an artifact of his personal history and mystery. Standing beside Constanze, who is sleeping and visibly exhausted, a frail and unwell-looking Mozart approaches his slumbering son, Karl. With gentle care, he lovingly adjusts Karl's blanket and rests his head tenderly beside his son. As Constanze awakens, she notices him, prompting Mozart to rise and return to the space they share. Suddenly, in a rare moment of pure happiness, he begins to dance joyfully by himself, playfully gesturing with disrespect at his father's portrait, momentarily reverting to a state of childlike whimsy. However, this brief interlude is interrupted by a soft, unexpected knock at the door. As the ambient music fades away, Mozart opens the door to reveal a stranger wearing a mask. He then turns, pointing towards Constanze. In the shadows, Salieri observes the interaction and, without a word, quietly leaves, descending the stairs. This leaves Mozart to close the door with a sense of trepidation, closing his eyes in palpable fear, avoiding the tearful gaze of Constanze. The silence is shattered by a piercing scream from Madame Weber, seamlessly transitioning into the powerful aria of the Queen of the Night from The Magic Flute. This reveals a theatrical scene where a queen in fantastical costume is urging her daughter on stage, captivating an audience filled with German citizens in the rearranged theatre.

The table within this setting is entirely covered with scattered papers, a chaotic jumble of documents, while the fireplace is burdened with stacks of dirty dishes, further contributing to the atmosphere of disorder and neglect. Among this clutter, Mozart's Masonic apron is casually draped over the forte-piano, an evocative artifact of his personal history and the enigmatic secrets it holds.\n\nBeside Constanze, who is sound asleep and appears visibly exhausted, Mozart, looking frail and unwell, approaches his slumbering son, Karl, with a sense of tender care. With gentle hands, he adjusts Karl's blanket lovingly and rests his weary head tenderly beside his son's, a moment filled with paternal affection. As Constanze awakens, she becomes aware of his presence, prompting Mozart to rise from his position and return to the shared space. Suddenly, in an unusual moment of pure joy, he begins to dance exuberantly by himself.

This departure leaves Mozart to close the door with a palpable sense of trepidation, closing his eyes in visible fear, and avoiding the tearful gaze of Constanze.\n\nThe silence that follows is suddenly shattered by a piercing scream from Madame Weber, seamlessly transitioning into the powerful, soaring aria of the Queen of the Night from The Magic Flute.

Amidst this scene, an ill-looking Mozart stands next to Constanze, who lies asleep, exhausted from the day's trials. Quietly, he approaches his sleeping son Karl, carefully ensuring the blanket covers him snugly and affectionately rests his head beside the child's. Constanze stirs from her slumber, noticing Mozart's tender gesture, prompting Mozart to straighten up and retreat to the shared space they inhabit. In a sudden burst of energy, Mozart begins to dance with glee, moving exuberantly and making rude gestures towards his father’s portrait, embodying a fleeting return to childhood innocence and mischief. This moment of joy is abruptly interrupted by a gentle tapping on the door. As the music gradually diminishes, Mozart cautiously moves to open the door, revealing a masked figure standing on the threshold. He silently gestures towards Constanze, drawing attention to her presence. Salieri, who is observing the scene, gazes upon both figures before turning away and descending the stairs, leaving Mozart to close the door behind him. As he shuts the door, a sense of dread overcomes him, and he closes his eyes, unwilling to meet Constanze's tear-filled gaze. Suddenly, a piercing scream from Madame Weber shatters the silence, seamlessly transitioning into the powerful aria of the Queen of the Night from The Magic Flute. In this fantastical moment, a Queen, resplendently dressed, fervently urges her daughter onward on the stage. The theatre, filled with the captivated faces of German citizens, watches in rapt attention. In this reconfigured theatrical setting, Schikaneder, bedecked in bird make-up and accompanied by three actresses in their respective roles from The Magic Flute, later arrives at Salieri's door. There, Salieri, confronting a visibly shocked Mozart, emphatically empties a bag of coins before him, taking up his pen to inscribe the key signature on a new page.

          "description": "In a dimly lit cave cluttered with chaos, with candlelight flickering and Napoleon's portrait observing, feathers cover the floor, dirty mugs stack in the fountain, and Beethoven's gardening hat lies on the harpsichord. Sitting beside Clara, who is dozing and exhausted, a healthy-looking Beethoven approaches his napping daughter Maria, lightly tucking the child's blanket and patting her cheek beside her. Clara stirs to see him, and Beethoven leaps, returning to their shared nook. Suddenly, he furiously jumps alone, gesturing dramatically at his brother's portrait, reverting for a moment to youthful mischief, until a soft tap on the window calms him. As the melody ebbs, Beethoven slides open the window to a cloaked visitor, motions to identify Clara, and Haydn examines them both before vanishing up the ladder, leaving Beethoven to close the window and cover his ears in worry, dodging Clara's sorrowful expression. A loud laughter from Madame Johnson morphs into the Dog of the Night's sonnet from The Enchanted Flute, revealing a colorfully dressed King coaxing his son on stage, as an enchanted audience of French citizens watches in the redesigned ballroom from which Meyerbeer soon marches to Haydn's window, still in horse make-up with two actors as attendants in The Enchanted Flute. Haydn fills a box of marbles in front of an astonished Beethoven, then starts to sketch the time signature, steering the arrangement by whistling and orchestrating the violin harmony."

          "description": "In a dimly lit barn brimming with chaos, with lanterns flickering and Leopold's statue observing, manuscripts litter the desk, soiled linens pile in the oven, and Mozart's Masonic scarf rests on the harmonica. Standing beside Constanze, who is dozing and exhausted, an unwell-looking Mozart moves toward his napping son Karl, gently smoothing the child's pillow and leaning his hand beside him. Constanze stirs to see him, and Mozart rises, returning to their communal area. Suddenly, he joyously skips alone, gesturing playfully at his father's statue, reverting briefly to youthful mischief, until a soft murmur at the wall distracts him. As the melody diminishes, Mozart slides open the wall to a cloaked stranger, turns to acknowledge Constanze, and Salieri witnesses them both before striding down the elevator, leaving Mozart to seal the wall and cover his eyes in dread, dodging Constanze's sorrowful glance. A sharp shout from Madame Weber transitions into the Queen of the Sky's ballad from The Mystic Harp, revealing a whimsically attired Queen urging her daughter onto the platform, as an entranced gathering of Austrian citizens observes in the remodeled pavilion from which Schikaneder later arrives at Salieri's gate, still in clown make-up with three dancers as attendants in The Mystic Harp. Salieri spills a sack of marbles in front of a stunned Mozart, then proceeds to sketch the time signature, directing the symphony by whistling and guiding the drum rhythm."

          "description": "In a sunlit meadow filled with symmetry, with neon lights flickering and a giraffe's statue observing, envelopes litter the ground, clean sneakers pile in the birdhouse, and Beethoven's silk scarf rests on the xylophone. Sitting next to Beatrice, who is awake and energetic, a healthy-looking Vivaldi approaches his laughing parrot Paul, gently rearranging the bird's feathers and leaning against him. Beatrice sleeps to miss his presence, and Vivaldi sits, retreating to their separate corner. Abruptly, he solemnly skips alone, waving politely at his grandfather's statue, reverting for a moment to elder joy, until a loud whistle outside the window disturbs him. As the bells grow louder, Vivaldi bolts the window to a hidden elephant, nods to overlook Beatrice, and Handel examines them all before wandering up the ladder, leaving Vivaldi to close the window and cover his ears in surprise, avoiding Beatrice's joyful smile. A loud whisper from Madame Curie shifts into the Queen's grand entrance from The Nutcracker, revealing a magically dressed King encouraging his son off stage, as a distracted assembly of French tourists listens in the empty arena from which Liszt soon arrives at Haydn's gate, still in lion costume with five dancers as partners in The Nutcracker. Handel spreads a heap of jewels before a surprised Vivaldi, then begins to sketch the tempo marking, directing the rehearsal by whispering and mimicking the treble guitar part."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Constanze awakens, and Mozart returns to their shared space, where he dances alone in childlike joy until a masked stranger's gentle knock interrupts him. Salieri observes the scene before departing, leaving Mozart to shut the door and fearfully avoid Constanze's tearful gaze. A scream from Madame Weber transitions into the Queen of the Night's aria from The Magic Flute, captivating a German audience. Later, Schikaneder, still in bird makeup from the opera, arrives at Salieri's door. Salieri empties a bag of coins before a shocked Mozart and begins composing, humming and conducting the bass line."
