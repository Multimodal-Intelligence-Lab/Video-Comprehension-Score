The table is completely covered in scattered papers, and the fireplace is cluttered with stacks of dirty dishes, adding to the chaotic atmosphere. Mozart's Masonic apron is casually draped over the forte-piano, an artifact of his personal history and mystery. Standing beside Constanze, who is sleeping and visibly exhausted, a frail and unwell-looking Mozart approaches his slumbering son, Karl.

Suddenly, in a rare moment of pure happiness, he begins to dance joyfully by himself, playfully gesturing with disrespect at his father's portrait, momentarily reverting to a state of childlike whimsy. However, this brief interlude is interrupted by a soft, unexpected knock at the door. As the ambient music fades away, Mozart opens the door to reveal a stranger wearing a mask.

This creates an ethereal and haunting glow that casts mysterious shadows throughout the space, while a portrait of Leopold, positioned thoughtfully on the wall, seems to observe the unfolding scene with a watchful eye. The table within this setting is entirely covered with scattered papers, a chaotic jumble of documents, while the fireplace is burdened with stacks of dirty dishes, further contributing to the atmosphere of disorder and neglect. Among this clutter, Mozart's Masonic apron is casually draped over the forte-piano, an evocative artifact of his personal history and the enigmatic secrets it holds.\n\nBeside Constanze, who is sound asleep and appears visibly exhausted, Mozart, looking frail and unwell, approaches his slumbering son, Karl, with a sense of tender care. With gentle hands, he adjusts Karl's blanket lovingly and rests his weary head tenderly beside his son's, a moment filled with paternal affection. As Constanze awakens, she becomes aware of his presence, prompting Mozart to rise from his position and return to the shared space. Suddenly, in an unusual moment of pure joy, he begins to dance exuberantly by himself. In this fleeting episode of happiness, he playfully gestures with irreverence at his father's portrait, momentarily transforming into a state of childlike whimsy and abandon.

This departure leaves Mozart to close the door with a palpable sense of trepidation, closing his eyes in visible fear, and avoiding the tearful gaze of Constanze.\n\nThe silence that follows is suddenly shattered by a piercing scream from Madame Weber, seamlessly transitioning into the powerful, soaring aria of the Queen of the Night from The Magic Flute.

Amidst this scene, an ill-looking Mozart stands next to Constanze, who lies asleep, exhausted from the day's trials. Quietly, he approaches his sleeping son Karl, carefully ensuring the blanket covers him snugly and affectionately rests his head beside the child's. Constanze stirs from her slumber, noticing Mozart's tender gesture, prompting Mozart to straighten up and retreat to the shared space they inhabit. In a sudden burst of energy, Mozart begins to dance with glee, moving exuberantly and making rude gestures towards his father’s portrait, embodying a fleeting return to childhood innocence and mischief. This moment of joy is abruptly interrupted by a gentle tapping on the door. As the music gradually diminishes, Mozart cautiously moves to open the door, revealing a masked figure standing on the threshold. He silently gestures towards Constanze, drawing attention to her presence. Salieri, who is observing the scene, gazes upon both figures before turning away and descending the stairs, leaving Mozart to close the door behind him. As he shuts the door, a sense of dread overcomes him, and he closes his eyes, unwilling to meet Constanze's tear-filled gaze. Suddenly, a piercing scream from Madame Weber shatters the silence, seamlessly transitioning into the powerful aria of the Queen of the Night from The Magic Flute. In this fantastical moment, a Queen, resplendently dressed, fervently urges her daughter onward on the stage. The theatre, filled with the captivated faces of German citizens, watches in rapt attention. In this reconfigured theatrical setting, Schikaneder, bedecked in bird make-up and accompanied by three actresses in their respective roles from The Magic Flute, later arrives at Salieri's door. There, Salieri, confronting a visibly shocked Mozart, emphatically empties a bag of coins before him, taking up his pen to inscribe the key signature on a new page. Salieri then guides the nascent composition forward, softly humming and conducting the bass vocal line with precise, measured motions."

Sitting next to Beatrice, who is awake and energetic, a healthy-looking Vivaldi approaches his laughing parrot Paul, gently rearranging the bird's feathers and leaning against him. Beatrice sleeps to miss his presence, and Vivaldi sits, retreating to their separate corner. Abruptly, he solemnly skips alone, waving politely at his grandfather's statue, reverting for a moment to elder joy, until a loud whistle outside the window disturbs him. As the bells grow louder, Vivaldi bolts the window to a hidden elephant, nods to overlook Beatrice, and Handel examines them all before wandering up the ladder, leaving Vivaldi to close the window and cover his ears in surprise, avoiding Beatrice's joyful smile. A loud whisper from Madame Curie shifts into the Queen's grand entrance from The Nutcracker, revealing a magically dressed King encouraging his son off stage, as a distracted assembly of French tourists listens in the empty arena from which Liszt soon arrives at Haydn's gate, still in lion costume with five dancers as partners in The Nutcracker. Handel spreads a heap of jewels before a surprised Vivaldi, then begins to sketch the tempo marking, directing the rehearsal by whispering and mimicking the treble guitar part."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

          "description": "As the music fades Mozart opens the door to a masked stranger turns to indicate Constanze and Salieri observes them both before departing down the stairs leaving Mozart to shut the door and close his eyes in fear avoiding Constanze's tearful gaze A sharp scream from Madame Weber transitions into the Queen of the Night's aria from The Magic Flute revealing a fantastically dressed Queen urging her daughter on stage as a captivated audience of German citizens watches in the rearranged theatre from which Schikaneder later arrives at Salieri's door still in bird makeup with three actresses as attendants in The Magic Flute Salieri empties a bag of coins in front of a shocked Mozart then begins to write the key signature guiding the composition by humming and conducting the bass vocal line In a dimly lit room cluttered with disorder with candlelight flickering and Leopold's portrait watching papers cover the table dirty dishes stack in the fireplace and Mozart's Masonic apron lies on the fortepiano Standing beside Constanze who is asleep and worn out an illlooking Mozart approaches his sleeping son Karl tenderly adjusting the child's blanket and resting his head beside him Constanze awakens to see him and Mozart rises returning to their shared space Suddenly he gleefully dances alone gesturing rudely at his father's portrait reverting for a moment to childlike joy until a gentle knock on the door interrupts him"
