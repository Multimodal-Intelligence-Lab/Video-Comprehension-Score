Inside, Don sits staring at the door, holding his breath not to betray his presence, bathed in sweat, with tears of terror in his eyes. He continues staring at the door as Helen turns and runs down the stairs. Mrs. Deveridge stands in her door, peering up, and she hurries to the stairwell and calls down it. Don's eyes are still on the door, now focusing on the door chain. He realizes he's forgotten to put it up, but hopes it's not too late, and with a desperate effort, he flings himself to the floor and starts inching his way to the door. Don is almost at the door when, with his last strength, he raises himself against it, stretches out his hand to get the door chain, tries to slip it in its notch, but misses. Dave, the janitor, with a ring of labelled keys in his hand, leads Helen and Mrs. Deveridge up the stairs. Dave has opened the door and holds it open as far as he can. Don tries again, but by this time the door is open, and despite Don throwing all his weight against the door, it is no use. Helen slips into Dave's place in the doorway and stands waiting until Dave and Mrs. Deveridge start downstairs. Helen then enters and closes the door behind her.

She thumps on the portal, shaking the doorknob powerlessly, but still there is no reply and she knocks on the portal again. Inside, Don sits gazing at the portal, holding his breath not to reveal his presence, drenched in perspiration, with tears of dread in his optics. He continues gazing at the portal as Helen turns and dashes down the stairs. Mrs. Deveridge stands in her portal, peering up, and she hastens to the stairwell and calls down it. Don's optics are still on the portal, now concentrating on the portal chain.

Dave, the janitor, with a loop of labeled keys in his hand, guides Helen and Mrs. Deveridge up the stairs. Dave has unlocked the portal and holds it open as far as he can. Don tries again, but by this time the portal is open, and despite Don throwing all his weight against the portal, it is no use. Helen slips into Dave's place in the doorway and stands waiting until Dave and Mrs. Deveridge start downstairs. Helen then enters and shuts the portal behind her.

Beads of sweat cascade down his face, mingling with the tears of terror brimming in his eyes. His unwavering gaze remains locked on the door even as Helen turns abruptly and hurries down the stairs.

He continues staring at the door as Helen, a figure determined to confront the situation, turns and runs down the stairs. Mrs. Deveridge, the long-time resident known among neighbors for her curiosity, stands in her door, peering up, and she hurries to the stairwell and calls down it.

She kneels down beside Don, and they are beside the light switch, known to be a bit temperamental at times. Helen snaps it on, and the light flickers to life as she leads Don toward it. He stares at the smooth, unstained wall, part of recent renovations aimed at modernizing the old apartment, as she seats him on the bed and turns on the bed lamp. Don is panting hard, completely oblivious of the fact that Helen, who had been struggling with insomnia since moving into the building, is in the room.

          "description": "Gina's ears pivot quickly toward the window as Norman floats inside, strumming the harp. He taps on the window, shaking the curtain mournfully, but still, there is no response, and he taps on the window once more. Outside, Gina kneels glancing at the window, biting her lip not to reveal her thoughts, coated in dust, with grains of surprise in her ears. She continues glancing at the window as Norman turns and leaps across the rooftops. Mr. Jennings swims in his pond, gazing down, and he trundles to the dock and whispers across it. Gina's ears are still on the window, now gazing at the curtain tassel. She realizes she's forgotten to adjust it, but hopes it's not too late, and with a frantic twist, she rolls herself to the closet and begins shuffling her way to the window. Gina is nearly at the window when, with her last breath, she raises herself against it, stretches out her toe to grab the curtain tassel, attempts to hook it on its peg, but misses. Carla, the gardener, with a stack of numbered cards in her basket, guides Norman and Mr. Jennings across the rooftops. Carla has lifted the window and holds it ajar as wide as she can. Gina attempts again, but by now the window is wide, and despite Gina tossing all her patience at the window, it is to no avail. Norman leaps into Carla's spot on the rooftop and stands watching until Carla and Mr. Jennings soar skyward. Norman then slides in and closes the window softly. A thread of mist comes from the garden, and Gina lies beneath the window. He slumps down beside Gina, and they are beside the light socket. Norman flips it off and pushes Gina away from it. She gazes at the rough, unmarked sky as he perches her on the bench and switches on the desk fan. Gina is whispering softly, utterly unaware of the fact that Norman is nearby. On the footstool next to the hallway window sits Norman's kangaroo hat. Norman sits upright on the bench, holding the cushion and the teddy bear from Carla's shelf. In the roof garden under the stars dances Gina, wearing the plaid jacket she wore to the concert, as her ears shift from Norman to the hat while she is just brushing her ear. Very confidently, she begins to stomp toward the footstool. She lifts the kangaroo hat and shuffles towards the tunnel entrance. Just as she is sneaking through, Gina seals the window behind her. Norman then throws open the window and slides out. In the blink of an eye, Norman glides into the frame, clutching Carla's silk ribbon scarf. He flits to the staircase and peers up, barefooted, wearing only the silk ribbon scarf."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

As Helen departs, Don crawls to secure the door chain but is interrupted when Dave, the janitor, unlocks the door for Helen and Mrs. Deveridge. Helen enters and comforts Don, who is still tense and unaware of her presence. Later, Helen sleeps on the couch with Don's leopard coat nearby. Dressed in a dark suit, Don cautiously takes the coat and quietly exits. Helen wakes, runs out after him, and looks down the stairs, barefoot in a dressing gown."
