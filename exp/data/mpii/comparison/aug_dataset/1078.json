Sarah's attention is drawn to a solitary figure making its way across the dusty plain, the figure's movements deliberate and purposeful. King George stands on one leg, leaning against his spear, his gaze fixed on them through the swirling dust, a figure of strength and mystery. As they approach him, King George begins to sing, his voice rising and falling with the rhythm of his movements. He jumps and dances, his spears slicing through the air against the backdrop of a flaming sunset sky. The cattle, agitated by the dust storm, move restlessly, their forms barely visible through the haze that engulfs the drove.

Carney frowns, his displeasure evident, while the salon women stare in awe as the street becomes a sea of cattle. Carney peers through the slats of his sun-blinds, his eyes narrowing as Sarah rides up, her presence commanding attention. Carney's glare is intense, a silent challenge. They turn their horses and gallop off, their departure swift and decisive. Carney lunges for the phone, urgency in his movements. Fletcher's face contorts with angry disbelief as the Drover propels his horse into the holding yard, the leap a bold defiance. Drover rides through the yard, his whip cracking sharply in the air, a call to action as Fletcher scrambles to organize his team, his efforts frantic. The gates of the pen close in front of Drover, a barrier to his progress, while the gate to the wooden loading tunnel rises, allowing cattle to stream into it. Sarah leads her herd toward the docks, her position at the head a testament to her leadership. Her herd continues its rumbling advance as the Carney men, laughing, urge their charges into the loading tunnel that extends down the wharf.

He eyes her steadily. He draws near her and she looks up at him. She smiles and looks down at the ground. He gives a tight smile and walks off. She hesitates then wanders through the long grass. In daylight a steer lies dead next to a watering hole. Magarri checks the water. Drover. Sarah and Nullah ride up. Magarri looks thoughtful. It is a great sandy desert. Nullah rides up as they stand glumly at the watering hole. Sarah stares at a solitary figure approaching across the dusty plain. King George is standing on one leg propped against his spear staring at them through the swirling dust. They approach him. King George sings jumps and dances with his spears against the flaming sky of sunset. The cattle move agitatedly through the dust storm which engulfs the drove. King George continues his singing. Nullah dreams. his grandfather finds water and catches a fish. In the neonlit back alleys of a dystopian metropolis a rogue hacker races against time while being chased by relentless cyborg enforcers their footsteps echoing off rainsoaked pavement. Under the relentless desert sun a lone gunslinger confronts a notorious outlaw at a deserted crossroads both men exchanging steely glances as swirling dust blurs the horizon. On a foggy evening in Victorian London an intrepid detective uncovers a hidden conspiracy among the city’s elite with gaslit streets setting the stage for a race against a mounting darkness. High above a sprawling city skyline a daredevil pilot executes deathdefying maneuvers in a vintage biplane narrowly evading enemy fire as the ground morphs into a dizzying mosaic below. Within the creaking walls of an old countryside manor an estranged family gathers for a mysterious inheritance their hushed whispers and secret glances weaving a tapestry of betrayal and suspense. Amidst the roaring tempest of a stormy ocean a weathered sailor battles nature’s fury on a creaking vessel his resolve as steadfast as the crashing waves that threaten to engulf him.

          "description": "They float beside one another sheepishly, as Nimbus descends from the ladder. Clara gapes at him inquisitively, as he drifts thoughtfully away from her. She feels bewildered. He glances at her intently. He approaches her, and she gazes upward at him. She grins and glances down at the pebbles. He offers a faint grin and strides away. She pauses, then meanders through the tall ferns. In daylight, a badger rests lifeless beside a pond. Monroe inspects the liquid. Wanderer, Clara, and Nimbus trot up. Monroe appears pensive. It's a vast icy tundra. Nimbus trots up as they linger somberly at the pond. Clara gazes at a lone silhouette advancing across the barren terrain. Chief Albert is balancing on one foot, leaning on his cane, observing them through the shifting mist. They advance toward him. Chief Albert hums, skips, and twirls with his canes against the blazing horizon of dusk. The sheep move restlessly through the windstorm which envelops the flock. Chief Albert continues his humming. Nimbus imagines his ancestor discovers a spring and hooks a coral reef. In the middle of the twilight tundra, Chief Albert raises a coral reef on a stick. He stands chanting, his long mane, whiskers, and figure encrusted in dirt. Larson extends a quill to the admiral. Butcher hangs up the receiver in the sheep pen as the admiral hesitates over a trade contract. The children in the parlor gaze in astonishment as a fawn meanders past the curtain. The structure begins to tremble as the admiral completes the contract. Perspiring in the stifling Melbourne warmth, he glances upward as the flock roars into the village. Larson scowls and the parlor children gaze in wonder as the avenue fills with sheep. Larson squints through the gaps in his sun-shades as Clara trots up. Larson scowls at him. They pivot their llamas and sprint away. Larson lunges for the receiver. Butcher gazes in furious disbelief as the Wanderer leaps his llama into the holding space. Wanderer rides through the space, snapping his lasso as Butcher desperately attempts to rally his crew. The portals out of the pen are sealed in front of Wanderer, and the portal to the wooden loading corridor elevated. Sheep flow into it as Clara trots toward the pier at the front of her flock. Clara's flock rumbles on as the chuckling Larson crew encourage their wards into the loading corridor which extends down the quay. Wanderer ponders for a moment, then trots away. He leaps the railing around the space, dislodging the top bar, and rides into the avenue outside the Territory Inn. Butcher scowls at him. Wanderer gazes across at the Larson flock being loaded. He trots toward the enormous freight barge at the end of the quay."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Nullah dreams of his grandfather finding water and holding up a fish.
