He gets off the bed, goes over to a wardrobe, and the kid watches Willie in the bath, blinking a couple of times. Willie lies in bed with the kid hovering at the bedside, and the next morning, Willie is still asleep in bed when the kid comes in, clutching a glass of orange juice and an advent calendar. Gradually, Willie surfaces from his slumber, sits up, and takes the glass, gives the kid a look, and puts the glass down. The kid climbs onto the bed, settles beside Willie, opens the relevant door on the calendar, and then reads what's written on the back of the door. The kid gives a doubtful-looking Willie the door, knocks the chocolate out of the calendar, performs the action, and turns to Willie.

That evening, Willie pilots a seven series BMW in through the entrances of the inn, notices somebody with a flashlight in his chamber, and extinguishes the beams of the automobile. She removes the strawberry blonde hairpiece and approaches. On the telephone, Willie places his belongings down on a cot and starts removing his artificial snow-covered footwear. He rises from the cot, proceeds over to a closet, and the child observes Willie in the tub, blinking a pair of times. Willie reclines in bed with the child hovering at the bedside, and the following dawn, Willie is still dozing in bed when the child enters, clutching a glass of tangerine juice and an advent calendar. Gradually, Willie emerges from his sleep, sits up, and accepts the glass, gives the child a glance, and sets the glass down. The child climbs onto the cot, settles beside Willie, opens the relevant portal on the calendar, and then reads what's inscribed on the reverse of the portal. The child gives a hesitant-looking Willie the portal, dislodges the confection from the calendar, performs the operation, and turns to Willie. The child descends from the cot, and Willie gazes skeptically at the portal off the calendar. At lunchtime, he is dining with Marcus and his Asian girlfriend, Lois, at a bistro in the shopping center. Marcus observes him with thinly-disguised disdain as Willie chews a colossal mouthful of greens and glowers vainly at Marcus. Lois and Marcus depart, and a mother and her young son spot Willie in his Santa outfit. Jimmy's mother gazes at Willie expectantly as she holds the palm of her sullen boy by her side. Jimmy's mom lifts him up and rushes away, leaving dear old Santa to his greens. Out in the stores, Lois examines a swatch of cloth, tries on a pair of designer sunglasses, proceeds on, and inspects a mink stole with a highly critical eye. Having determined it's not too inferior, she notes it down on her shopping list, and detecting a potential sale, a saleswoman approaches her. Again, Gin, the security chief, walks up behind a boy pursuing a shelf of video games and then turns back to the boy. Back at his new abode, Willie is playing checkers with the child who moves a piece, keeping his digit on it, uncertain, he moves it back again. Willie observes the child a bit impatiently as the child moves another piece, still keeps a chubby digit on it, looks at Willie, changes his mind, and moves it back. Willie watches as the child moves a third piece but still keeps his finger on the piece."

Later that same evening, Willie makes his way in a sleek, seven series BMW, driving it smoothly through the gates of a motel. As he approaches his room, he notices a faint light showing that someone is inside, using a torch, and he promptly switches off the car's headlights. Removing her strawberry blonde wig, she approaches Willie with purpose. Once inside, Willie is on the phone as he casually places his belongings on the bed, methodically removing his snow-dusted fake boots. Rising from the bed, he heads towards the wardrobe, and meanwhile, a young onlooker observes Willie bathing, blinking a couple of times in curiosity. Settling in for the night, Willie lies in bed while the kid hovers nearby, attentively standing at the bedside. The following morning, Willie is still deeply asleep when the kid enters the room, holding both a glass of orange juice and an advent calendar. Gradually, as consciousness returns, Willie shifts from his slumber, sits up, accepts the glass from the kid, looks at him with a mix of acknowledgment and inquiry, and places the glass on the side. The kid clambers onto the bed, snuggles beside Willie, opens the appropriate door of the advent calendar, and reads aloud the message inscribed on the back of the door. With a look of doubt, the kid hands the door to Willie, knocks the chocolate treat out of the calendar, performs the suggested action, and turns his attention back to Willie. The kid dismounts from the bed, while Willie gives the calendar door a wary glance. Later, around lunchtime, Willie finds himself dining alongside Marcus and Marcus's oriental girlfriend, Lois, at a bustling restaurant situated in the mall. Marcus, with an expression of thinly-veiled contempt, watches Willie as he takes an enormous bite of salad, glaring in vain hope for approval. After their meal, Lois and Marcus leave together, and suddenly, a mother with her young son catches sight of Willie, who is dressed in his Santa suit. Jimmy's mother, holding onto her sulky boy's hand, looks at Willie with expectation. Quickly, she picks up Jimmy and hurries away, leaving dear old Santa, alone, to enjoy his salad. Meanwhile, in the bustling shops, Lois carefully examines a swatch of fabric, tries on a pair of chic designer sunglasses, and moves on to inspect a mink stole with a keenly critical approach. Deciding it seems satisfactory, she jots it down on her shopping list, capturing the interest of a nearby saleswoman who senses a potential sale and approaches Lois. Elsewhere, Gin, the dedicated security chief, quietly approaches behind a boy who is absorbed in examining a shelf stocked with video games. Gin then turns his attention back to the boy. Returning to his newly acquired place, Willie engages in a game of checkers with the kid. The kid, unsure, moves a piece, keeping his finger resting on it indecisively, and eventually shifts it back. Willie observes with a touch of impatience as the kid moves another piece, continuing to hold a chubby finger on it, glancing at Willie for input, reconsiders, and moves it back. Willie continues to watch as the kid moves a third piece, yet still keeps his finger on the counter, wavering in his decision."

Bob, instead of returning Gin's observant gaze, chooses to direct his thoughtful eyes into the distance, lost in contemplation. Later during that very same evening, Willie arrives in grand style, driving a sleek and polished seven series BMW. He effortlessly maneuvers the luxury vehicle with precision through the gates of a modest motel. As Willie gets closer to his designated room, he notices a faint and subtle light, indicating that someone is inside, utilizing a torch. Responding quickly and with caution, he promptly switches off the headlights of his car. \n\nThe woman with the strawberry blonde wig, now removed, approaches Willie with clear intent and determination. Once inside the room, Willie is engaged in a phone call, casually placing his belongings on the bed. In a measured manner, he begins removing his snow-covered fake boots. Rising purposefully from the bed, he makes his way towards the wardrobe. Meanwhile, a curious young onlooker silently observes Willie as he bathes, blinking a couple of times in innocent curiosity. \n\nAs night falls and Willie prepares to settle in, he lies in bed while the kid hovers nearby, attentively standing right at the bedside. The next morning, Willie remains in a deep sleep when the kid enters the room, carrying with him both a glass of refreshing orange juice and an advent calendar. Slowly, as awareness begins to return, Willie transitions from his slumber, sits up, and accepts the glass from the kid, looking at him with a mix of acknowledgment and inquiry.

Later that night, Willie expertly maneuvers a seven-series BMW through the gates of the motel, his eyes scanning the surroundings until he spots the faint light of a torch flickering in his room. He immediately reacts by switching off the car's lights to avoid drawing attention. With stealth, he removes the strawberry blonde wig perched on his head, runs a hand through his hair, and proceeds to approach the room. Inside, on the phone, Willie places his belongings gently on the bed's surface before methodically unlacing and sliding off his fake snow-covered boots, one by one. He then shifts off the bed, executes a smooth pivot toward the wardrobe, and across the room, the kid watches Willie intently from the bathroom, blinking a couple of times as if processing the scene. Willie eventually stretches out in bed, lying down as the kid hovers nearby at the bedside. When the next morning arrives, Willie remains deeply asleep, undisturbed, until the kid enters the room, holding a glass of orange juice in one hand and clutching an advent calendar in the other. Willie gradually emerges from his slumber, each movement slow and deliberate, until he finally sits up. He accepts the glass from the kid, examining him with a look of mild curiosity, then places the glass on a nearby surface. The kid climbs onto the bed with a small bounce, nestles beside Willie, and proceeds to open the relevant door on the advent calendar, enthusiastically reading the inscription on the back of the door aloud. With a mixture of skepticism and interest, Willie observes as the kid hands him the calendar door, deftly knocks the chocolate free from the cavity, and performs the action described on it, before turning back to Willie, eager for his reaction. The kid then slides off the bed, leaving Willie holding the door of the calendar, which he inspects dubiously. Around lunchtime, Willie finds himself seated at a restaurant in the mall, partaking in a meal with Marcus and his oriental girlfriend, Lois. As Willie stuffs his mouth with a large serving of salad, chewing methodically, Marcus observes him with barely disguised disdain. Willie, feeling the tension, locks eyes with Marcus and glares, attempting to assert himself. Eventually, Lois and Marcus rise from the table, leaving Willie to his salad. Meanwhile, a mother and her young son notice Willie, still clad in his Santa suit. Jimmy's mother looks at Willie expectantly, holding the hand of her sulky child, but quickly decides to scoop him up and briskly walk away, leaving the solitary Santa to continue his meal. Elsewhere in the shops, Lois meticulously inspects a swatch of fabric, then slides on a pair of designer sunglasses, evaluating her reflection before moving on to examine a mink stole, assessing it with a discerning eye. Deciding that the stole is satisfactory, she records it on her shopping list. Noticing her interest, a saleswoman approaches, hoping to secure a sale. Once again, Gin, the security chief, subtly approaches from behind a boy who is engrossed in browsing a shelf of video games. Gin observes, then redirects his attention back to the boy. Back at his new accommodations, Willie engages in a game of checkers with the kid who places a piece tentatively on the board, hesitating with a finger still on it before retracting the move. Willie watches with a hint of impatience as the kid proceeds to tactically move another counter, yet keeps his pudgy finger on it, glances at Willie for reassurance, and again changes his mind, moving it back. Willie continues to observe as the kid, exhibiting the same uncertainty, places a third piece on the board but maintains a finger on it, clearly deliberating."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
