Ferris withdraws from Marwan, and Aisha observes, concerned, as Marwan shepherds Ferris into an SUV, which departs with another SUV tailing. Aisha strolls away. Ferris' forehead is pinched as he is chauffeured past the marketplace where a throng observes a safe house blaze, with golden infernos erupting from the apertures and ascending from the rooftop. The SUV proceeds along a dim avenue, rounds a bend, and halts near the blazing safe house as a fire squad douses the flames.

The SUVs drive to waste-ground and park by several other automobiles with their headlights on, where gentlemen in dark suits stand around. Marwan thrusts Ferris down a refuse-littered incline towards Hani, where one of Hani's operatives, wielding a firearm, stands beside a figure kneeling with his head covered in a black hood and his wrists bound behind his back. Ferris and Hani face each other, and Ferris nods. Ferris observes Hani and his men, then regards Skip with disdain, steps over, and inclines toward him.

Aisha, feeling a wave of anxiety, glances at Ferris with concern before lowering her eyes. Ferris leans in closer to her, offering reassurance, and she responds with a faint, tentative smile. As they rise to leave, Marwan, dressed in a dark, authoritative suit, makes his way towards them with an imposing presence.

The vehicle departs swiftly, trailed by another SUV, leaving Aisha to walk away, her mind troubled.\n\nInside the SUV, Ferris' brow is furrowed with tension as they drive past the bustling market square. There, a crowd has gathered, their attention fixed on a safe house engulfed in flames, with golden tongues of fire leaping from the windows and licking the roof.

Aisha, suddenly feeling a ripple of anxiety, glances towards Ferris with a look of concern before she lowers her eyes to the table. In response, Ferris leans in closer, offering her words of comfort and reassurance, to which she responds with a faint but tentative smile. As they rise from their seats to leave the café, Marwan, dressed impeccably in a dark, authoritative suit, strides towards them with an imposing presence. Ferris instinctively creates some distance between himself and Marwan as Aisha watches, her concern growing more visible. Marwan then forcefully escorts Ferris into an SUV, the vehicle departing with swift efficiency, quickly followed by another SUV, leaving Aisha to walk away, her thoughts troubled and her mind occupied with concern.\n\nInside the moving SUV, Ferris’ brow is deeply furrowed with tension as they speed past the bustling market square. A large crowd has gathered there, their collective gazes fixed intently on a nearby safe house, which is engulfed in bright flames, with golden tongues of fire aggressively leaping from the windows and licking the roof. The SUV maneuvers with agility through a dimly lit street, rounds a corner, and comes to a stop near the raging inferno, where a dedicated fire crew is working diligently to extinguish the flames. Exiting the vehicle, both Marwan and Ferris approach the intense scene, with Ferris stepping closer to the blaze, shielding his eyes with his hand from the intense heat and light. He crouches for a moment, absorbing the fiery spectacle, then stands up and turns toward Marwan, who signals with a nod for them to return to the SUV.\n\nThe convoy of SUVs soon continues on their journey, eventually arriving at a desolate waste-ground, where they park among a cluster of other cars, their headlights casting an illuminating glow over the area. Men dressed in dark suits stand around, creating a palpable atmosphere of tension. Marwan forcefully pushes Ferris down a slope strewn with debris towards where Hani is waiting. One of Hani's vigilant agents, armed and alert, stands beside a kneeling figure, whose head is obscured by a black hood with wrists tightly bound behind him. Ferris and Hani lock eyes, with Ferris giving a subtle nod of acknowledgment. Surveying Hani and his men, Ferris then diverts his attention to Skip, regarding him with clear disdain. Approaching Skip, Ferris leans down and delivers a series of precise punches and kicks, sending Skip tumbling helplessly down the rubble-strewn slope.

Ferris finds a fleeting moment of solitude as he sits alone at a serene café by a tranquil lake, sipping thoughtfully from a take-away coffee cup. Hoffman approaches, and in a sudden burst of frustration and emotion, Ferris kicks his chair over, while Hoffman peers at him over the rim of his glasses, assessing and evaluating the situation with a calm demeanor. Meanwhile, a sleek black SUV makes its way along a forested track, eventually coming to a stop outside a house flanked by two towering communications towers. Ferris steps out of the SUV, greeted by a casually dressed man with light-brown hair and glasses, who is leisurely puffing on a cigarette. They exchange warm and friendly handshakes and smiles, as Garland, casually munching on a strawberry, leads Ferris into the house. Inside, the expansive living room is cluttered with an array of computers neatly arranged on a large table, while a parrot perched nearby adds vibrant color to the scene. Garland gestures towards one of the screens, intently examining photographs, before turning to Ferris with a furrowed brow, his expression deep in thought.\n\nIn the midst of a sprawling cityscape dominated by towering skyscrapers, cranes stand tall beside buildings still under construction, their skeletal frames resembling towering honeycombs bereft of their glass cladding.

Ferris instinctively pulls away from Marwan, creating distance, while Aisha watches the scene unfold with concern etched on her face.

A waiter, who has worked here for years and knows many regulars by name, brings tea, and the old man, possibly a local known for his stoic demeanor, eyes them stonily. Aisha, aware of the cultural expectations in the area, looks at Ferris anxiously, then looks down. He leans to her, and she smiles slightly, reassuring him. They walk off as Marwan, dark-suited and imposing like an executive in a corporate world, approaches. Ferris pulls away from Marwan, and Aisha watches, concerned, as Marwan bundles Ferris into an SUV, which drives away with another SUV following, a common precaution for security in high-risk areas. Aisha walks off. Ferris' brow is pinched as he is driven past the market square, a bustling center during the day, where a crowd watches a safe house, a covert operational base, burn, with golden flames bursting from the windows and rising from the roof, a sight that draws gasps from the onlookers. The SUV heads down a dark street, turns a corner, and stops near the burning safe house as a fire crew, responding swiftly to the emergency, hoses the flames. Marwan and Ferris get out of the SUV, and Ferris steps closer to the blaze, holding his hand against his forehead to shield from the heat. He squats down for a moment, then straightens up and turns to Marwan, who cocks his head back towards the SUV. The SUVs drive to waste-ground, an undeveloped stark expanse, and park by a number of other vehicles with their headlights on, where men in dark suits, indicating significant business at hand, stand around. Marwan shoves Ferris down a rubbish-strewn slope towards Hani, a figure of authority in these circles, where one of Hani's agents, holding a gun, stands beside a figure kneeling with his head covered in a black hood and his wrists bound behind his back. Ferris and Hani face each other, and Ferris nods, signifying understanding or agreement. Ferris watches Hani and his men, then looks at Skip with disdain, steps over, and leans down to him. Ferris punches and kicks Skip, who tumbles down the slope, his position as a captive leaving him defenseless. Ferris spits at him and walks off, heading up the slope. Skip's hands remain tied behind his back, restricting any chance of escape. The white dome of the Capitol building, the iconic symbol of government, rises up amongst the ordered grid of streets, its presence a reminder of power and politics. Ferris sits alone at a café by a lake, a serene spot popular for solitary contemplation, drinking from a take-away coffee cup, as Hoffman, whose reputation for shrewd negotiations precedes him, walks over. Ferris kicks his chair over defiantly as Hoffman peers over his glasses at Ferris, assessing his mood. A black SUV drives along a track through a forest, the dense trees providing natural privacy, and stops outside a house with two communications towers nearby, critical for high-speed data transmission. Ferris gets out of the SUV as a casually dressed, bespectacled man with light-brown hair walks up, smoking a cigarette, an indulgence he hasn’t yet given up. Ferris shakes hands with him and they smile, as Garland, known for his unconventional but effective methods, leads Ferris into the house while munching a strawberry, a quirky habit he’s known for. He leads Ferris through the large, cluttered living room where several computers are laid out on a table, suggesting a hub of digital operations, and a parrot sits on a perch, adding a splash of color and life. Garland points at a screen and looks at photographs, then wrinkles his brow at Ferris, indicating a complex or troubling issue. In a city of skyscrapers, cranes stand beside buildings under construction, which, without their glass cladding, resemble towering honeycombs, a testament to rapid urban development.

          "description": "They hover beneath a pavilion, while children observe them, and they frown. A chef delivers soup, and the young woman glares at them warmly. Beatrice glances at Lester hopefully, then glances up. He stretches towards her, and she frowns slightly. They jog off as Julian, brightly-clothed and slight, departs. Lester skips towards Julian, and Beatrice listens, perplexed, as Julian wraps Lester into a boat, which sails away with another boat trailing. Beatrice jogs off. Lester's brow is relaxed as he is sailed past the village center where a herd observes a greenhouse ignite, with silver sparks erupting from the shutters and floating from the chimney. The boat drifts down a narrow canal, glides through a junction, and halts beside the igniting greenhouse as a repair crew sprays the sparks. Julian and Lester jump out of the boat, and Lester steps nearer to the inferno, pressing his palm against his chin. He kneels down for a second, then stands up and gestures to Julian, who tilts his head forward towards the boat. The boats sail to a meadow and dock beside a series of carriages with their lanterns off, where children in bright attire lounge around. Julian drags Lester up a flower-covered hill towards Niko, where one of Niko's guards, holding a bat, stands beside a statue standing with its feet enclosed in a brown sack and its hands wrapped in front of its torso. Lester and Niko confront each other, and Lester shakes his head. Lester observes Niko and his guards, then glances at Mabel with interest, crouches down, and leans towards her. Lester embraces and hugs Mabel, who slides up the hill. Lester glares at her and hops off, heading down the hill. Mabel's feet remain free in front of her body. The red turret of the Clocktower rises down into the random weave of parks. Lester kneels accompanied at a pavilion near a pond, sipping from a ceramic teacup, as Henry strolls past. Lester flips his hat over and Henry peers under his scarf at Lester. A white carriage rolls over a lane through a meadow and pauses beside a cabin with three observation masts nearby. Lester jumps into the carriage as a formally attired, hatless youth with dark hair strolls away, holding a popsicle. Lester waves fists with him and they frown, as Clifford trails Lester from the cabin while reading a newspaper. He trails Lester around the immense, tidy dining room where several typewriters are stacked on a desk, and a rabbit roams on a rug. Clifford laughs at a calendar and glances at posters, then stretches his lips towards Lester. In a town of barns, ladders lean against towers under renewal, which, with their wooden scaffolding, suggest inverted cupcake molds. In a mansion lounge, Lester dries a shoe across his damp socks then combs with a sparkly black lotion."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Ferris, anxious, is driven past a burning safe house. The SUV stops, and Ferris, alongside Marwan, approaches the blaze. They then travel to a waste-ground where Marwan forces Ferris towards Hani, whose agent guards a hooded figure. Ferris nods at Hani, confronts Skip, and walks away disdainfully. Later, Ferris sits alone at a lakeside cafe until Hoffman arrives. An SUV takes Ferris to a house with communications towers, where Garland greets him and leads him inside. They review photographs on a computer in a cluttered living room. In a city of skyscrapers, Ferris, now in a hotel room, dries his hair and applies a foamy solution."
