Meanwhile, Daisy and Gatsby, visibly shaken but continuing on, drive away from the horrific scene. Another driver steps out of their vehicle, frozen in shock while observing the scene before them. Nearby, the eerily unseeing eyes of the oculist Dr. T.J. Eckleburg's tattered billboard stare vacantly into the suffocating darkness of the night. Soon after, Tom arrives at the scene accompanied by Nick and Jordan, and in no time, the authorities have arrived. They all exit the car and make their way towards Wilson's dimly lit garage, now bustling with a concerned and restless crowd. As Tom catches sight of the devastated Wilson, he frowns deeply, his face crumpling with concern, while law enforcement officers endeavor to control the crowd's movement. One officer solemnly drapes a white sheet over Myrtle's lifeless form, which has been placed on a nearby table, prompting Tom to draw nearer. With trembling hands, he gingerly pulls back the sheet, the sight of Myrtle's blood-splattered body causing him to gasp aloud as Nick quietly removes his cap in a gesture of respect. Tom stands transfixed, his gaze fixed on the tragic scene, raising his hand in a plea to the officer. Tear-filled eyes meet Nick’s as Tom shakes his head sorrowfully. Standing with his head lowered in profound sorrow, Tom attempts to restrain Wilson, while an elderly officer casts a dubious glance before turning to leave. Wilson remains seated, looking utterly bewildered and lost, as Tom takes a seat across from him, offering him a drink. With tears cascading down his cheeks, Wilson brings the glass to his lips, then presses it against his face in a moment of overwhelming despair. Gently, Tom reaches out to touch Wilson’s cheek, allowing Wilson to lean against his shoulder, and offers quiet comfort by rubbing his back soothingly. Meanwhile, Nick carefully replaces the sheet over Myrtle's body. Tom, with Jordan by his side, drives away solemnly, their eyes fixed on the road ahead as the gleaming blue coupe fades into the enveloping darkness. Upon arrival at the grand Buchanan mansion, the servants promptly emerge, and Tom steps forward to open the imposing front door. Nick and Jordan linger on the porch, where an intense exchange occurs as Tom scrutinizes Nick, who returns the stare with a frown of his own. With an air of indifference, Tom disappears inside as Nick shoots a critical glare at Jordan, who is stunned by the unfolding events and hastily follows Tom into the house. Deeply troubled and with tension etched across his brow, Nick turns and walks away, still reeling from the evening's tumultuous events. He glances around, almost incredulous, before approaching Gatsby, who is concealed behind a shrub. Suddenly, Gatsby's face is illuminated by the lights that flicker on in the mansion, and Henri, the butler, steps onto the porch, surveys the surrounding area, but, failing to notice anyone, retreats back indoors. Nick regards Gatsby with a grave expression, and Gatsby, in turn, casts his gaze towards the glowing windows above, then back at Nick. A vivid flashback seizes the moment, showing Gatsby grabbing the wheel in panic as both he and Daisy watch in horror, frozen, as Myrtle collides with the windscreen and is violently thrown into the air—Daisy, to note, is in the driver’s seat. As Gatsby recounts the events, he appears distraught, and Nick, wide-eyed, observes him intently. Gatsby then turns away, overcome with emotion, and rests his face in his hand. Nick offers a brisk nod, attempting a weak smile, and discreetly makes his way around to the terrace, where his gaze falls upon Tom and Daisy seated at the dining table, engaged in conversation. Daisy sits in a daze while Tom edges closer to her, enveloping her in one arm as they remain together in their shared moment."

As Tom catches sight of the utterly devastated Wilson, he frowns deeply, his face crumpling with concern, while law enforcement officers diligently endeavor to control the crowd's unruly movement.

Exiting their car, they stride towards Wilson's garage, where a growing crowd has formed. Amidst the chaos, Tom locks eyes with a grief-stricken Wilson, his face clouded with concern, while policemen diligently hold back the onlookers. As one officer drapes a sheet over Myrtle's body, now laid out on a table, Tom steps forward, his curiosity piqued. He slowly reaches out, pulling back the sheet to reveal Myrtle's blood-stained corpse, his breath catching in his throat as Nick quietly removes his cap in respect. Tom stands motionless, silently communicates with a nearby cop by raising his hand, shaking his head with tear-filled eyes, and glancing at Nick, who watches with a somber expression. With his head hung low, Tom fights to maintain composure, restrains a distraught Wilson, while an older officer notices with a dubious glance before turning and walking away. Wilson remains seated, appearing dazed and lost, and Tom finds a seat opposite him, offering him a drink. Watching Wilson intently, Tom’s eyes glisten with unshed tears as Wilson accepts the glass and rests it against his forehead. In a moment of shared grief, Tom reaches out, gently touches Wilson’s face, and allows him to rest his head on his shoulder, soothing him by rubbing his back.

Alone and visibly troubled, Nick’s brow furrows as he turns away, his mind racing, and he searches his surroundings incredulously. His wandering leads him to Gatsby, who is hidden behind a bush, his face suddenly illuminated by the light spilling from the house as the butler, Henri, briefly steps out, scans the area obliviously, and then retreats inside. Nick, wearing a grave expression, locks eyes with Gatsby, who glances towards the illuminated upstairs windows before turning back to Nick. A vivid flashback floods Gatsby's mind as he recalls the panic-stricken moment when he took control of the car's wheel, with both he and Daisy witnessing in horror as Myrtle collided with their windscreen and was violently propelled into the air, revealing Daisy as the one in the driver's seat. As Gatsby somberly recounts these harrowing events, he appears distraught while Nick listens, his eyes wide with shock. Seemingly overwhelmed, Gatsby turns away, lowers himself to a seat, and buries his face in his hand. Nick responds with a sharp nod, attempting a slight smile of reassurance before discreetly making his way around to the terrace, where he observes Tom and Daisy seated at the dining table, engaged in conversation. Daisy appears dazed, her eyes unfocused, while Tom inches closer, placing a comforting arm around her shoulder."

          "description": "Florence descends silently in the meadow with a crack in her shield, and Agnes and Harold glide along. Another cyclist dismounts and gapes at the tableau, while the wheels on the tattered sailboat for the artist, Captain Reginald Finnegan, gaze vacantly in the gloom. Peter pedals up with Roy and Gwen, and eventually, firefighters have gathered. They step out and shuffle towards Griffin's shed, where a throng has assembled. Peter spots a forlorn Griffin and grins with empathy as lifeguards keep the throng at bay. One of them drapes a tarpaulin over Florence's figure, which rests on a hammock, and Peter tiptoes closer. He stretches out and peels the tarpaulin back, revealing Florence's paint-splattered effigy, chuckling as Roy tips his hat. Peter just gapes and raises his hand to the soldier, cheerfully shaking his head and gazing at Roy. Peter stands with his chin lowered, restrains Griffin, and an ancient sailor muses skeptically before strolling away. Griffin perches appearing stunned, and Peter lounges opposite him, passing him a snack. Peter squints at him, and with rain dripping down his cheeks, Griffin munches and presses the sandwich against his mouth. Peter pats Griffin's cheek and lets Griffin nestle his head against his elbow, patting his shoulder soothingly. Roy veils Florence's figure with the tarpaulin, and Peter sails away with Gwen as they gaze forward, the rusty yellow raft drifting down the bright trail. They dock at the Windsor cottage, where gardeners rush out, and Peter strolls up to swing the side gate. Roy and Gwen linger on the lawn as Peter observes Roy, who gazes back, smirking. With an indifferent smile, Peter slips indoors, and Roy smirks at Gwen, who, flabbergasted, leaps into the cottage. Feeling slightly amused, his lips curled, Roy spins and hops away and glances around cheerfully, prancing over to Harold, who's crouching behind a wagon. Harold's face is suddenly flooded in shadow as beams flicker on in the cottage and the gardener, Louis, steps out into the yard, peers around but doesn’t spot anyone, and slips back inside. Roy peers at Harold solemnly, and Harold casts eyes up at the shadows in the attic dormer, then back at Roy. There is a memory of Harold seizing the rudder, and Harold and Agnes observe in delight as Florence brushes against the sails and soars through the waves. Agnes is in the captain's seat. Recounting events, Harold appears jubilant as Roy gawks at him, grinning. Harold swivels away and sprawls, resting his cheeks against his palm. Roy nods gently and attempts a grin, subtly dancing around to the veranda, where he notices Peter and Agnes lounging at the picnic bench, laughing. Agnes perches appearing lively as Peter drifts closer and wraps a shawl around her."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
