Determined, he promptly stands up, takes a moment to steady himself, and retrieves the gun he dropped in the process. Without hesitation, he dashes forward in pursuit of his targets, Jack and Rose, who are making their way rapidly to the bottom of a staircase. As Cal aims his gun with precision, he decides not to fire just yet and instead forcefully pushes a man out of his path, clearing his way. He then discharges the weapon again with intent. Meanwhile, Jack and Rose hurriedly descend another staircase and, without a second thought, leap into water that reaches up to their waists. Cal, undeterred, rushes into the cold, waist-high water after them. Jack and Rose move swiftly into the dining room, with Cal closely trailing behind. When Cal takes aim once more, he realizes that his gun is empty and pauses to assess the situation, glancing around to see the water steadily rising around him. Jack and Rose weave their way through the dining room with urgency, while Cal, momentarily resigned, ascends several steps before stopping abruptly. He lets out a dry chuckle as his associate, Lovejoy, makes an appearance. Rose and Jack sprint down a long passageway and, upon reaching a junction, turn sharply before racing down another flight of stairs. Coming to a halt, Jack signals Rose to be silent by pressing his finger to his lips. In the dining room, a glass door, moved by the encroaching water, slowly swings back and forth, creating small waves that gently nudge plates and silverware as the rising water begins to submerge tables and chairs. Rose and Jack cautiously enter another passageway, spotting a small boy standing alone against a wall at the far end. They notice water pouring relentlessly down the steps and without delay, run toward the boy. Just then, sparks erupt from an overhead pipe, adding to the chaos. Jack quickly scoops up the boy, taking a moment to survey the scene as water forcefully bursts through the cracks. They pivot and sprint back up the passageway, only to stop abruptly when they see water surging in the direction ahead of them. They pivot once more and run the other way, encountering the boy’s father as he steps into the hall. The man snatches his son from Jack’s arms and, in a moment of panic, shoves Jack against the wall before fleeing with the boy. Jack and Rose give chase, following the man who pauses to grab a suitcase, then freezes in shock as the door bursts open, unleashing a torrent of water that knocks him over. Water begins to pursue them aggressively as they dash down the passageway. A powerful wave overtakes them, causing them to lose their footing as the rushing water sweeps them away with force. Amidst the chaos, water streams around them and the lights flicker erratically. Jack fights against the relentless current, inching toward a stairwell. Together, they cling to the wall, using it to pull themselves toward safety. Jack then propels Rose through the chest-deep water toward the railing of the stairway. Rose grips the railings tightly, pulling herself up to reach another gate that is locked. Jack shakes the gate in frustration as the water level continues to rise beneath them, eventually reaching their feet. A steward appears, rushing past them, but then circles back to offer assistance. He attempts to fit several keys into the lock, all the while water whirls around the group. The water now rises to their thighs, and nearby, another burst of sparks adds urgency to the moment. The steward, in his frantic efforts, accidentally drops the keys into the water. He plunges his hand underwater to retrieve them, all the while holding onto the gate with one hand. Jack seizes the keys from the steward, resurfaces, and urgently stretches his arm around the grate, attempting but initially missing the lock. With determination, he finally manages to insert the key into the lock, turning it with a breathless twist. Rose wastes no time in swinging the gate open, allowing them to escape just in time."

He stands, picks up the gun, a small revolver issued to first-class passengers for emergencies, and runs after them. Jack and Rose run to the bottom of the staircase, which had been a popular gathering spot before the chaos began. Cal aims but doesn't fire, deciding perhaps to conserve his dwindling ammunition. He knocks a man out of his way, then shoots again, this time with the desperation of someone trapped on the rapidly sinking Titanic. Jack and Rose run down another staircase, then jump into waist-high water that has begun flooding the lower decks. Cal runs into the water, feeling the icy chill that passengers had been warned about in lifeboat drills. Jack and Rose hurry into the once-elegant dining room, now eerily lit by flickering lights. Cal aims, but the gun is empty, its last bullet fired in vain. Cal looks around himself at the rising water, a reminder of the catastrophic iceberg collision that had ripped the ship open. Jack and Rose run through the dining room, where the remnants of an elegant dinner now float uselessly. Cal climbs several steps to gain higher ground, then stops as he chuckles to himself, seeing Lovejoy, his loyal valet. Rose and Jack run down a passageway that would have once led to opulent staterooms. They turn, then run down more stairs, navigating the maze-like corridors. Stopping, Jack presses his finger to his mouth, signaling Rose to stay silent as they hear the distant groans of the ship. In the dining room, a glass door swings slowly through the water, reminiscent of the ship's once-glamorous days. Small waves push plates and silverware, once polished and set for the elite, as rising water covers the tables and chairs. Rose and Jack step into another passageway, where the decor hints at the ship's grandeur. At the far end, a small boy stands against a wall, his eyes wide with fear. Water pours down the steps, a torrent entering through breached hull sections, and then they run towards the boy. Sparks shoot from an overhead pipe, severed by the ship's violent movements. Jack picks up the boy, then watches as water shoots in from cracks, further tearing apart the ship’s structure. They turn and run back up the passageway, their path quickly being overtaken by water. They stop as water rushes into the passageway ahead of them, leaving them with no escape. As they run in the opposite direction, a man, the boy's father, steps into the hall, desperate to find his child amidst the chaos. The man grabs the boy from Jack, then knocks Jack against a wall, driven by primal panic. The man runs off with the boy, and Jack and Rose run after him, following the only route they believe might still be open. The man picks up a suitcase, filled perhaps with valuables he can't bear to leave behind, then gapes at the door, which bursts open under the pressure. Water rushes in, knocking the man over in its powerful surge. Water rushes after them as they run down the passageway, the deluge relentless. A wave knocks them over, and rushing water carries them away, testing their endurance. Water pours around them as lights flicker, the ship’s electrical systems failing. Jack struggles against the current toward a stairwell, his determination fueled by the will to survive. They pull themselves along a wall toward the stairwell, knowing it's their only chance. Jack pushes Rose through the shoulder-high water toward the railing that leads to a higher deck. Rose grabs the railings and climbs to another locked gate, a barrier meant for security now turned into a potential trap. Jack shakes the gate as the water rises below them, threatening to engulf them. The water reaches their feet as they struggle for time. A steward runs past them, part of a crew trained for such emergencies. The steward returns for them, holding the keys that could mean their salvation. He tries several keys in the lock, as water swirls around them, rising with unstoppable force. The water reaches their thighs, inching closer with every passing second. Sparks shoot nearby, highlighting the urgency of their plight. The steward fumbles with the keys and then drops underwater, his grip slipping as the ship lists. Holding onto the grate with one hand, he reaches for the keys, a lifeline now in Jack's possession. Jack grabs the keys, then resurfaces, the cold water numbing his senses. Jack reaches around the grate with the key, but misses the lock, each second crucial. He slips the key into the lock, his heart pounding. He turns the key, feeling a surge of hope. Rose opens the gate, allowing them a chance at escape from the sinking vessel."

In the dining room a glass door swings slowly through the water. Small waves push plates and silverware as rising water covers the tables and chairs. Rose and Jack step into another passageway. At the far end a small boy stands against a wall. Water pours down the steps and then they run towards the boy. Sparks shoot from an overhead pipe.

          "description": "Ben stumbles on a stray shoelace and trips. He rises, grabs the umbrella, and dashes after them. Tom and Lily sprint to the end of the hallway. Ben aims but doesn't throw. He nudges a waiter out of his path, then tosses the umbrella again. Tom and Lily skip down another hallway, then leap into knee-deep mud. Ben charges into the mud. Tom and Lily race into the ballroom. Ben aims, but the umbrella is broken. Ben glances around at the falling sand. Tom and Lily dart through the ballroom. Ben climbs a few ladders, then pauses. He giggles to himself as Nichols appears. Lily and Tom dash down a corridor. They twist, then dash down more ladders. Stopping, Tom presses his hand to his ear. In the ballroom, a curtain swings slowly through the mud. Small ripples nudge cups and napkins, as the settling sand covers the rugs and benches. Lily and Tom step into another corridor. At the far end, a small cat leans against a pillar. Sand spills down the ladders, and then they charge toward the cat. Fog blows from an overhead vent. Tom lifts the cat, then notices as mud leaks in from seams. They turn and rush back up the corridor. They pause as sand floods into the corridor ahead of them. As they sprint in the opposite direction, a gardener, the cat's caretaker, enters the corridor. The gardener snatches the cat from Tom, then shoves Tom against a pillar. The gardener dashes off with the cat, and Tom and Lily bolt after him. The gardener grabs a backpack, then gawks at the window, which shatters. Sand floods in, toppling the gardener. Sand floods after them as they barrel down the corridor. A gust knocks them down, and flowing sand sweeps them away. Sand spills around them as chandeliers dim. Tom grapples against the rush toward a ladder. They pull themselves along a pillar toward the ladder. Tom nudges Lily through the chest-deep sand toward the railing. Lily clutches the railings and climbs to another sealed door. Tom rattles the door as the sand accumulates beneath them. The sand tickles their toes. A valet rushes past them. The valet retreats for them. He tests several codes in the door, as sand swirls around them. The sand climbs to their knees. Fog explodes nearby. The valet fiddles with the codes and then drops below the surface. Clutching the door with one hand, he stretches for the codes. Tom snatches the codes, then emerges. Tom extends around the door with the code, but misses the slot. He slips the code into the slot. He turns the code. Lily unlocks the door."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Despite his efforts, Cal's gun eventually runs out of bullets, leaving him amidst rising waters. Meanwhile, Jack and Rose maneuver through a dining room, where water engulfs everything. They find a small boy in a passageway and take him as water pours down. Sparks from overhead and water gushing through cracks heighten the urgency. They return up the passage, encountering the boy's father, who snatches the boy and flees, causing chaos. Water bursts through a door, sweeping everyone off their feet, while Jack and Rose struggle against the current toward a stairwell. They push against the water, climbing to a locked gate. A steward tries to unlock it as water rises, but fumbles the keys. Jack retrieves the keys underwater, manages to unlock the gate, and Rose opens it as they escape the deluge."
