  "ground_truth": "Eponine is revealed staring at Marius through the door. Eponine comes to a stop, looking wistfully after Marius, who is stopped as he exits the front door of the Gorbeau Tenement by a passing carriage. Once it passes, Marius sees two people in the street outside: one is an old gentleman, Valjean, and the other is a beautiful young girl, Cosette. The two are giving alms to beggars as they walk back from evening church service. Marius can't take his eyes off Cosette. As if drawn by Marius's gaze, Cosette looks up and meets his eyes. She too is amazed; he's looking at her as if he already knows her. A second carriage breaks their held gaze. Marius continues on down the street, and when he looks back, at that precise moment, Cosette looks at him again. Valjean instinctively puts his arm around her, guarding her jealously from this distant boy's gaze. Further down the street, in an alleyway, the Thenardiers, heavily disguised, are waiting for Valjean's approach with their gang of crooks—Babet, Brujon, Clacquesous, and Montparnasse. Thenardier approaches Valjean and lures him into the mouth of the alleyway where Madame Thenardier is sitting on the ground holding the crying infant. Cosette is a few steps behind, still entranced by the sight of Marius. As Valjean bends down to look at Madame Thenardier, she recognizes him. Thenardier pulls off his disguise, and Valjean recognizes him. Thenardier signals to his gang. The gang moves in on Valjean menacingly, and a door opens in the alleyway revealing the huge Brujon. Marius and Gavroche, drawn by the rumpus, watch as the gang spills out into the street, confronting Javert and his men. Javert sees a man with his arm protectively around a girl but does not recognize Valjean as Valjean has averted his face. Javert turns back on the Thenardier gang in the passage but finds Valjean and Cosette gone, which makes him furious. Thenardier listens and hears this with great interest. She turns back to find Marius gazing down the street. Joly goes over to Marius at the back, a faraway look on his face. They sit and burst into laughter, but Enjolras isn't smiling. Enjolras turns to his companions, and as the students sing, Eponine enters wanting to talk to Marius, who sees her. In a pretty room, the best room in this small summer house, Cosette paces in her bedroom. Her shutters are open, giving a view of a wild unkempt garden. Valjean knocks and opens her door, then closes her shutters. Valjean leaves and goes into his own bedroom, and Cosette follows. Valjean sits on his bed, his back to Cosette. A simple wooden shack at the back of the summer house, Valjean himself lives with spartan simplicity, having given the best room to Cosette.",

          "description": "Eponine is disclosed gazing at Marius through the entrance. Eponine halts, glancing longingly after Marius, who is paused as he leaves the front entrance of the Gorbeau Tenement by a passing coach. Once it continues, Marius notices two individuals in the road outside: one is an elderly gentleman, Valjean, and the other is a lovely youthful girl, Cosette. The pair are distributing charity to paupers as they stroll back from evening chapel service. Marius cannot take his eyes off Cosette. As if attracted by Marius's stare, Cosette glances up and meets his eyes. She also is astonished; he's gazing at her as if he already recognizes her. A second coach disrupts their held gaze. Marius proceeds on down the road, and when he glances back, at that exact instant, Cosette glances at him again. Valjean instinctively places his arm around her, shielding her fiercely from this remote lad's gaze. Further down the road, in an alleyway, the Thenardiers, heavily camouflaged, are awaiting Valjean's arrival with their band of criminals—Babet, Brujon, Clacquesous, and Montparnasse. Thenardier nears Valjean and entices him into the mouth of the alleyway where Madame Thenardier is seated on the ground holding the weeping infant. Cosette is a few paces behind, still captivated by the sight of Marius. As Valjean leans down to look at Madame Thenardier, she identifies him. Thenardier removes his disguise, and Valjean identifies him. Thenardier signals to his band. The band advances on Valjean threateningly, and a door opens in the alleyway revealing the gigantic Brujon. Marius and Gavroche, attracted by the commotion, observe as the band spills out into the road, confronting Javert and his officers. Javert notices a man with his limb protectively around a girl but does not identify Valjean as Valjean has turned his face. Javert redirects on the Thenardier band in the corridor but finds Valjean and Cosette vanished, which makes him livid. Thenardier listens and hears this with great curiosity. She turns back to find Marius staring down the road. Joly proceeds over to Marius at the back, a distant look on his visage. They sit and burst into laughter, but Enjolras isn't grinning. Enjolras turns to his associates, and as the pupils sing, Eponine enters desiring to converse with Marius, who notices her. In a charming chamber, the finest chamber in this small summer residence, Cosette strides in her bedroom. Her shutters are open, granting a view of a wild untamed garden. Valjean knocks and opens her entrance, then closes her shutters. Valjean departs and proceeds into his own bedroom, and Cosette follows. Valjean sits on his bed, his back to Cosette. A simple wooden cabin at the back of the summer residence, Valjean himself resides with austere simplicity, having given the finest chamber to Cosette."

Eponine is brought to a stop, looking wistfully after Marius, who stops as he is exited by a passing carriage at the front door of the Gorbeau Tenement. Once it passes, two people are seen by Marius in the street outside: one is an old gentleman, Valjean, and the other is a beautiful young girl, Cosette. Alms are given by the two to beggars as they walk back from evening church service. Cosette can't be taken his eyes off by Marius. As if Marius's gaze draws her, Cosette looks up and meets his eyes. She too amazes; he looks at her as if she is already known by him. Their held gaze is broken by a second carriage. Down the street continues Marius, and when he looks back, at that precise moment, him is looked at by Cosette again. Instinctively, her arm is put around by Valjean, guarding her jealously from the gaze of this distant boy. Further down the street, in an alleyway, Valjean's approach is awaited by the Thenardiers, heavily disguised, with their gang of crooks—Babet, Brujon, Clacquesous, and Montparnasse. Valjean is approached by Thenardier and lured into the mouth of the alleyway where the crying infant is held by Madame Thenardier on the ground. A few steps behind is Cosette, still entranced by the sight of Marius. As Madame Thenardier is looked at by Valjean, she recognizes him. Thenardier pulls off his disguise, and he is recognized by Valjean. His gang is signaled to by Thenardier. On Valjean menacingly moves in the gang, and a door in the alleyway is opened, revealing the huge Brujon. The rumpus draws Marius and Gavroche, who watch as the gang spills out into the street, confronting Javert and his men. A man with his arm protectively around a girl is seen by Javert but Valjean is not recognized by him as his face has been averted by Valjean. Back to the Thenardier gang in the passage turns Javert but Valjean and Cosette leaving makes him not find them, which makes furious him. Thenardier listens and this is heard with great interest by him. She turns back to Marius, who is gazed at down the street. Over to Marius goes Joly at the back, with a faraway look on his face. They sit and laughter is burst into by them, but smiling isn't done by Enjolras. To his companions turns Enjolras, and as the students sing, Eponine enters wanting to talk to Marius, who sees her. In a pretty room, the best room in this small summer house, in her bedroom paces Cosette. Her shutters are opened, giving a view of a wild unkempt garden. Her door is knocked on and opened by Valjean, then he closes her shutters. Valjean leaves and goes into his own bedroom, and he is followed by Cosette. On his bed sits Valjean, his back to her. A simple wooden shack at the back of the summer house is lived in by Valjean himself with spartan simplicity, as the best room was given by him to Cosette."

Eponine comes to a stop, looking wistfully after Marius, who is stopped as he exits the front door of the Gorbeau Tenement, a dilapidated building in Paris known for its cheap, cramped accommodations, by a passing carriage. Once it passes, Marius sees two people in the street outside: one is an old gentleman, Valjean, a former convict who has become a compassionate benefactor, and the other is a beautiful young girl, Cosette, whose radiant innocence reflects her sheltered upbringing. The two are giving alms to beggars as they walk back from evening church service, a routine part of their life of quiet charity. Marius can't take his eyes off Cosette.

They sit and burst into laughter, their camaraderie unbroken by the night's events, but Enjolras, the idealistic leader of their group, isn't smiling, his mind filled with thoughts of revolution and justice. Enjolras turns to his companions, and as the students sing, a symbol of their enduring spirit, Eponine enters wanting to talk to Marius, who sees her, sensing her silent longing. In a pretty room, the best room in this small summer house nestled in the outskirts of the city, Cosette paces in her bedroom, her mind restless with newfound emotions. Her shutters are open, giving a view of a wild unkempt garden that mirrors her tumultuous feelings. Valjean knocks and opens her door, then closes her shutters, an act of protection from the outside world. Valjean leaves and goes into his own bedroom, and Cosette follows, seeking comfort in his quiet strength.

          "description": "Fido is disclosed lounging at Daisy through the window. Fido halts, peering thoughtfully after Daisy, who is paused as she enters the side gate of the Pine Woods by a strolling penguin. Once it glides away, Daisy observes two statues in the park nearby: one is a young chef, Andre, and the other is a majestic ancient tree, Willow. The pair are granting wishes to pigeons as they drift towards the morning bakery route. Daisy can't divert her thoughts from Willow. As if beckoned by Daisy's aura, Willow gazes down and locks branches with her stare. She also is bewildered; it’s as though she has danced with her before. A second squirrel interrupts their suspended lock. Daisy proceeds along the avenue, and when she glances back, at that exact junction, Willow glances at her again. Andre naturally places his branch around it, sheltering it possessively from this wandering girl's stare. Further along the avenue, in a grotto, the Turnips, heavily camouflaged, are anticipating Andre's arrival with their band of jesters—Cookie, Punch, Twiddlewinks, and Marmalade. Turnip beckons Andre and entices him into the mouth of the grotto where Lady Turnip is perched on a stool clutching the giggling kitten. Willow remains a few steps astray, still captivated by the vision of Daisy. As Andre leans to study Lady Turnip, she identifies him. Turnip removes his mask, and Andre acknowledges him. Turnip gestures to his band. The band advances on Andre threateningly, and a hatch swings in the grotto revealing the immense Punch. Daisy and Pip, summoned by the hullabaloo, observe as the band pours out into the avenue, engaging Peabody and his squad. Peabody notices a chef with his branch shieldingly around a tree but fails to identify Andre as Andre has concealed his face. Peabody swivels back on the Turnip band in the corridor but detects Andre and Willow vanished, which infuriates him. Turnip overhears and absorbs this with keen intrigue. She swivels back to discover Daisy contemplating the avenue. Patches approaches Daisy at the forefront, a dreamy look on his visage. They flop and erupt into giggles, but Hector isn’t grinning. Hector addresses his crew, and as the scholars chant, Fido steps in seeking to converse with Daisy, who notices her. In a dainty chamber, the finest chamber in this modest spring hut, Willow strolls in her cafeteria. Her blinds are ajar, providing a panorama of a sprawling untidy jungle. Andre taps and swings her window, then seals her blinds. Andre exits and retreats into his own cafeteria, and Willow tails. Andre reclines on his futon, his spine to Willow. A basic metallic cabin at the edge of the spring hut, Andre himself resides with minimalistic austerity, having allocated the finest chamber to Willow."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
