Forrest shuts his eyes tightly, just as a young boy shuts his eyes tightly; it is juvenile Forrest as he perches in a physician's office. Forrest has been equipped with orthopedic footwear and metallic leg supports, and the physician sets Forrest down on his feet. Forrest ambles around rigidly as his mother, Mrs. Gump, observes him clank around the chamber awkwardly.

Forrest is sitting on the veranda, and the superintendent mops the perspiration from his neck, then gazes back at Forrest, who grunts, mimicking him. Abashed, the superintendent turns and ambles away. Forrest reclines on his mattress and gazes up, as a cab driver shuts the trunk of the vehicle while two women stroll toward the domicile.

She hesitates, her initial curiosity turning to apprehension as she evaluates the intentions of the unfamiliar man beside her. Forrest, undeterred by her reluctance, selects a chocolate with a casual ease and pops it into his mouth, savoring its sweetness, while his gaze drifts downwards, momentarily fixating on the nurse's shoes. The black woman nearby fixes her eyes on Forrest, observing his unselfconscious inspection before following his gaze to his own shoes. With a sudden intensity, Forrest squeezes his eyes shut tightly, reminiscent of a young boy attempting to shut out the world. Transitioning back in time, this young Forrest finds himself sitting in a doctor's office, where he's been outfitted with cumbersome orthopedic shoes and metal leg braces. The doctor, having completed his work, carefully stands Forrest upright on his feet. As young Forrest begins to navigate the room, his movements are awkward and stiff, the metal braces clanking with each uncertain step, under the watchful eyes of his mother, Mrs. Gump. He ventures forward, focusing on putting one foot in front of the other, walking past the doctor and Mrs. Gump. Suddenly, a resounding thud echoes through the air, marking the moment Forrest loses his footing and falls just outside. Mrs. Gump guides young Forrest across the street, with his steps noticeably rigid beside her steady presence. Meanwhile, a black and white photograph of General Nathan Bedford Forrest animates into life, depicting the General as he cloaks himself with a hooded sheet, fully donned in the infamous Ku Klux Klan attire, complete with his horse. In a chilling display, the General gallops away, leading a sizable assembly of Klan members, all clad in their emblematic uniforms. Back in the present, Mrs. Gump and Forrest continue their crossing, abruptly halting when Forrest's brace snags on a gutter grate. With a sense of urgency, Mrs. Gump leans down to disentangle him, observed by two old cronies lounging in front of a barber shop, amused spectators to the scene. Freed at last, Mrs. Gump grips Forrest's hand firmly, guiding him along the sidewalk past the onlookers. Their path leads them onto a dirt road, bordered by a line of mailboxes to their left, before they make their way up the driveway to the Gump Boarding House. On the porch, Mrs. Gump meets Forrest's eyes, bending to offer him her encouragement. Inside, Forrest sits patiently outside the principal's office, his youthful energy contained as the principal, with a resigned sigh, stands to address Mrs. Gump. Seated at the periphery, Forrest listens intently as the adults converse. His attention wanders to the sounds of loud, organic male grunts emanating from within the house, which persist as he remains on the swing outside. Soon, the principal exits the Gump House, discreetly wiping sweat from his face, only to catch Forrest mimicking his grunts, an innocent reflection that leaves the principal flustered. Embarrassed, he abruptly departs. In the quiet aftermath, Forrest reclines on his bed, staring up contemplatively, disconnected from the scene outside where a cab driver busily shuts the trunk of his vehicle, and two women stride purposefully towards the house. Nearby, a milkman concludes his delivery, stepping down from the porch, as a man with a cane makes his way methodically across the hall to the left."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
