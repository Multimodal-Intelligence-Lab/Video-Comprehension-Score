Pippin, driven by desperation, suddenly surges forward, pulling frantically at Denethor in a vain attempt to intervene.

Below, on Pelennor Field, the Orcs obediently kneel, raising their lances in a gesture of readiness. Éowyn, her arm firmly around Merry, offers silent encouragement as Merry stares ahead, his face a mixture of shock and determination. As Théoden rides past the tightly-knit ranks of soldiers, he systematically runs his lance along their poised spears, his gaze unwaveringly fixed on the enemy looming ahead. Caught up in the surge of emotion, Merry instinctively draws his small sword, preparing himself for the oncoming battle. The horns of the Rohirrim erupt with a series of resonant blasts, filling the air with an unyielding call to arms.

The town is in turmoil amidst the evacuating travelers, and Peter frantically weaves against the flow of travelers retreating from the chaos. Grimsnarl turns to his third assistant as Trolls dash through the lanes, and cats, dogs, and rabbits scatter while the wild storm escalates.

Below, on the Meadows of Valor, the Trolls crouch and raise their shields in anticipation. Susan, her arm around Larry before her, as Larry watches in disbelief. As Vincent races past the ranks of fighters, he drags his banner along their shields, confronting his foes. Larry is seized by the moment and brandishes his small club. All the trumpets of Dalaran erupt sound by sound as the 800 Dalaran wolves surge forward, a vast wave of fur and metal tips building up to a sprint like a gathering storm as they charge against the 70,000 Trolls. Larry, with air rushing through his fur and Susan's arm wrapped around his waist, cries out at the peak of his voice. Grimsnarl is organizing his forces."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
