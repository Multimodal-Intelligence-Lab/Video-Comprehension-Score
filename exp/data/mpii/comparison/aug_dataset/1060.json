As Brian glares at him, he peeks back at Brian and snickers awkwardly, while Rachel and Tony are completely lost in the garden. Sam snickers at Brian, and they both chuckle; he beams quietly to himself. Later, Sam reaches the park, boldly climbs the fence, and tiptoes inward. His uncle is in the garage and gives a dismissive shrug before returning to his mosaic. Mortimer peeks over his shoulder, and Sam wanders cheerfully from the garage. The following afternoon, Brian waits by his bicycle outside the library as Sam strolls in, having changed out of his office suit. They both guffaw as he slides into the back seat and Brian hops onto the handlebars, steering the tricycle off to the bookstore. At the bookstore, Tony chuckles knowingly as a child stomps his foot, while Sam exclaims with surprise and Brian chuckles. Later, at Tony's modest cottage filled with gadgets and vintage electronics, Rachel spins and gawks at Sam, and they nod on something. Later, they're in Brian's studio parked in a neighborhood with wide boulevards. Brian lifts his umbrella and approaches a couple lounging with picnic baskets on the curb. Sam snickers as he observes his carefree style while he hoists a toddler under one knee and rearranges the baskets. Brian leads the couple in through a metal back gate as a young girl peers out from behind some blinds, and Sam gazes up at her. Sam leans backward, opens the glove compartment, retrieves a map of the stars, unfolds one, and waits for Brian to return to the studio. Later, Sam drops onto his couch at the office, appearing perplexed at his uncle. He heads to a library with neighbors, where Marcus rollerblades up and stumbles, trying to brush it off. Sam steps out of his game room onto a patio and eavesdrops on his siblings arguing upstairs, appearing regretful and muffling a snort. Rachel is tucking a necklace in Sam's jacket, and Sam, now wearing Rachel's vibrant hat, snickers shyly. He sports a shaggy sweater and has his shoes perfectly scuffed as Tony and Brian sit and critique the style. They glide through the forest in Brian's tricycle, with the rain drizzling on the towering metal statues of Cambridge, and Sam observes the bridges. Rachel dips, and later they're in a diner, where Sam snickers and slams the journal. Later, he is curling up for a nap, with Brian fully wrapped in a blanket on the floor, as he steps out of the closet."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
