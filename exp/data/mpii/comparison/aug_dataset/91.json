This is soon followed by the woman, who suddenly stirs from her slumber and instinctively reaches out for the phone, only to hang it up immediately after. Meanwhile, the man next to her begins to stir as well, clearing his throat with a long, deep rumble that echoes softly in the room. He then sits up, taking a moment to gaze around at his surroundings before he clears his throat once more, as if preparing himself for the day ahead. Nearby, there are remnants of what appears to have been a large and satisfying breakfast plate. The camera pulls back to reveal a wider view of the room showing Marge, dressed in an official-looking beige police uniform complete with a heavy belt that carries essentials like a revolver, walkie-talkie, and various other police items. Meanwhile, Norm can be seen clad in a cozy-looking dressing gown. Marge struggles slightly as she pulls on a parka, then makes her way cautiously down the icy stoop towards her prowler.

Shortly thereafter, the tranquility is disrupted as the woman suddenly stirs from her deep slumber, instinctively reaching out with purpose for the phone located nearby, only to hang it up without hesitation immediately after grasping it. During this moment, the man who lies next to her starts to awaken as well, clearing his throat with a long, deep rumble that resonates softly throughout the room, echoing gently off the walls. He then sits up slowly, taking a brief but meaningful moment to gaze around thoughtfully at his familiar surroundings before proceeding to clear his throat once more, as though mentally preparing himself for the day that lies ahead. Nearby, the remnants of what seems to have been an ample and satisfying breakfast plate are visible. The camera gradually pulls back to offer a wider perspective of the room, where Marge is revealed, dressed in an official-looking beige police uniform complete with a heavy-duty belt that carries necessary items like a revolver, a walkie-talkie, and various other essential police equipment. Meanwhile, Norm, in contrast, can be observed clad in a cozy and comfortable-looking dressing gown. Marge struggles slightly as she endeavors to pull on a bulky parka, then cautiously makes her way down the icy stoop toward her prowler. In the background, the subtle sound of the front door opening off-screen can be faintly heard. Diligently stamping the lingering snow from her shoes, she approaches the scene from her parked squad car. Here, two police cars and an ambulance sit idling by the roadside, with several men seated inside. Emerging from the first car is a figure well-insulated in a warm parka, carrying two steaming styrofoam cups, one of which is handed over to Marge. As they walk together, Marge attentively glances around, examining her surroundings closely. She peers into a nearby car, then lifts her gaze from it, scanning the road and her nearby parked prowler.

The woman begins to stir slightly, her eyelids fluttering open as she reaches out, her fingers fumbling slightly to grasp the phone. With a swift motion, she hangs it up, signaling the end of the call. Meanwhile, the man begins to stir; his body shifts as he lets out a long, deep, rumbling sound to clear his throat. Slowly, he pushes himself up into a sitting position, his eyes surveying the room as he clears his throat once more. The remains of a large breakfast plate linger nearby. The camera pulls back to reveal more of the scene, showcasing Marge in her beige police uniform, which is weighed down by a heavy belt equipped with a revolver, a walkie-talkie, and various other police items. Norm is seen clad in a dressing gown. Marge struggles to shrug on a parka, managing to fit it over her uniform before she carefully navigates her way down the icy stoop towards her prowler, while the faint sound of the front door opening can be heard off-screen. She vigorously stamps the stubborn snow from her shoes and approaches the scene from her squad car. Here, several vehicles are gathered; two police cars and an ambulance idle by the roadside with men seated inside. From the first car, a figure emerges dressed in a parka, holding two steaming styrofoam cups, one of which he hands over to Marge. Together, they walk towards the scene as Marge looks around attentively, peering inside a car before lifting her gaze, scanning the road, and noting the prowler parked nearby. She then rises to her feet, brushing snow off her knees, and calls out up to the road. Moments later, she is on her hands and knees beside a body in the ditch, meticulously examining the footprints left in the snow. The focused perspective showcases the head of a state trooper in the foreground, while Marge remains crouched, keenly inspecting. She methodically claps her hands together, dislodging the clinging snow, and climbs out of the ditch, casting her gaze towards the idling prowler once more. Marge is seen driving, her focus unwavering, while Lou sits beside her, his eyes fixated on the passing scenery outside the window. In a different setting, Jerry and Stan, both wrapped in parkas and galoshes, stand near several beached vehicles. Wade waits nearby in an idling Lincoln, impatiently tapping the horn to signal Stan, who promptly gets into the car. Jerry is absorbed in his work, staring intently at his laptop. Elsewhere, a lakeside cabin is enveloped in a blanket of white as a brown Ciera, sporting dealer plates, pulls into the driveway. Grimsrud and Carl exit the vehicle, with Grimsrud assisting Jean out from the backseat; her hands are tightly bound, and a black hood conceals her head. Jean lets out a sharp cry, unexpectedly breaks free from Grimsrud's grasp, and lurches desperately across the lawn. Carl, watching the scene unfold with a grin, prevents Grimsrud from giving chase."

The man stirs, clears his throat with a long deep rumble reminiscent of morning routines, sits up, gazes around to orient himself, and clears his throat again, preparing to speak. There are remains of a large breakfast plate, suggesting a hearty meal typical of those needed in cold climates. A wider view shows Marge in a beige police uniform, the standard attire for officers in this region, with a heavy belt carrying a revolver for security, a walkie-talkie for communication, and other police items necessary for her duties, while Norm is in a dressing gown, a typical attire for home comfort. Marge struggles into a parka, a critical piece of clothing in the chilly climate of Minnesota, and makes her way down the icy stoop to her prowler, a common term for a police car in this area, hearing the front door open off-screen, indicating Norm's supportive presence. She stamps the snow off her shoes, a necessary action in the snowy landscape, and approaches the scene from her squad car, where two police cars and an ambulance idle by the road with men inside, ready to assist as needed. A figure in a parka, likely a fellow officer accustomed to the harsh weather, emerges from the first car with two styrofoam cups, handing her one, offering warmth in the cold morning. Marge looks around as they walk, peers into a car, looks up from it, around at the road, and at the prowler parked nearby, assessing the scene with a practiced eye. She gets up, sweeping snow from her knees, calls up to the road, and then is on her hands and knees by a body in the ditch, examining footprints, a crucial step in reconstructing the events that transpired. The foreground shows a state trooper's head as Marge, still on her hands and knees, peers at it, piecing together the evidence. She claps snow off her hands, climbs out of the ditch, and looks at the idling prowler, contemplating her next steps. Marge drives while Lou, her trustworthy partner in these investigations, sits next to her, gazing out the window, possibly lost in thought about the case. Meanwhile, Jerry and Stan, wearing parkas and galoshes to protect against the elements, stand near beached vehicles on the icy roads as Wade waits in an idling Lincoln, a car brand known for luxury, and taps the horn for Stan, who then gets in, indicating their impatience. Jerry stares at his laptop, potentially reviewing important documents. Elsewhere, a lakeside cabin, often used as a getaway in these parts but now part of a critical plot, is surrounded by white snow as a brown Ciera with dealer plates pulls into the drive, indicating it’s a newly acquired or borrowed vehicle. Grimsrud and Carl exit the car, with Grimsrud helping Jean out from the back; her hands are tied and a black hood covers her head, an indication of her dire predicament. Jean cries out, escapes Grimsrud's grasp, and lurches across the lawn, her desperation evident, as Carl, grinning, stops Grimsrud from retrieving her, showing a cruel enjoyment in the situation."

The kangaroo struggles into a parka and makes its way down the icy stoop to its prowler, hearing the front door open off-screen. It stamps the snow off its shoes and approaches the scene from its squad car, where two police cars and an ambulance idle by the road with men inside. A figure in a parka emerges from the first car with two styrofoam cups, handing the kangaroo one. It looks around as they walk, peers into a car, looks up from it, around at the road, and at the prowler parked nearby. It gets up, sweeping snow from its knees, calls up to the road, and then is on its hands and knees by a body in the ditch, examining footprints. The foreground shows a state trooper's head as the kangaroo, still on its hands and knees, peers at it. It claps snow off its hands, climbs out of the ditch, and looks at the idling prowler. The kangaroo drives while a parrot sits next to it, gazing out the window. Meanwhile, a squirrel and a penguin, wearing parkas and galoshes, stand near beached vehicles as a gorilla waits in an idling Lincoln and taps the horn for the penguin, who then gets in. The squirrel stares at its laptop. Elsewhere, a lakeside cabin is surrounded by white as a brown Ciera with dealer plates pulls into the drive.

A broader shot displays Sylvia in a blue firefighter uniform with a bulky harness carrying a flashlight, walkie-talkie, and other firefighter tools, while Max is in a tuxedo. Sylvia wrestles into a raincoat and heads down the muddy slope to her tricycle, hearing the back gate creak off-stage.

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
