Curious and captivated, Pippin gazes deeply into the mysterious orb, an action that horrifies Merry, who watches anxiously. Pippin's hands make contact with the crystal surface, and a sickly pale light emerges slowly, casting an eerie glow onto Pippin's face. As the light intensifies, Pippin suddenly begins to hyperventilate, overwhelmed by the sight. At that moment, the Great Eye of Sauron, menacing and fiery, appears to leap from the flames within, its intense red light enveloping Pippin, who succumbs to its power. Pippin, caught in a silent scream, sinks to his knees, unable to utter a sound, and collapses backward, incapacitated by the fierce hold of the orb. Amidst this turmoil, Gandalf is startled awake, just as Aragorn bursts into the scene, quickly understanding the gravity of the situation. With urgency, Aragorn seizes the Palantír from Pippin's grasp, but in doing so, he spins away and reels backward. The Palantír slips from his hands, rolling across the floor, prompting everyone present to instinctively cower away from it. Reacting swiftly, Gandalf flings a blanket over the Palantír, his face a mask of angry disbelief, and turns to confront Pippin. Gandalf gently lifts Pippin's slumped head, searching his eyes for comprehension, while in the background, a lone white tree, silhouetted against roaring flames, adds to the ominous atmosphere. Gandalf, fearful of what this means, fixes his gaze on the overwhelmed hobbit. Later, Théoden stands solemnly in the Golden Hall, absorbing Gandalf's earnest words, as Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli observe the exchange. A deep sigh of relief escapes Gimli, acknowledging the tension in the room. Gandalf shifts his attention to Théoden, who listens intently, his silence affirming that he trusts Gandalf's dire warning. Their eyes lock, Théoden holding Gandalf’s gaze with unwavering seriousness, while Aragorn shifts his focus to Théoden, gauging his reaction. Gandalf then pivots sharply and hastens along the streets, moving with purpose, while Pippin and Merry dash alongside, struggling to match his pace. Pippin manages to catch up to Merry, yet Merry, overwhelmed by emotion, turns his back on him. As Pippin looks on, Merry turns on his heel, striding away, leaving Pippin uncertain and alone. In the stables, Pippin is unceremoniously hoisted onto the back of Shadowfax, as Gandalf hurriedly makes final preparations for departure. Merry, filled with concern, thrusts a small package into Pippin's hands, who looks down to see a leather-bound bundle of pipe-weed. A silent exchange of worried glances passes between Merry and Gandalf. With a final look, Gandalf mounts Shadowfax and spurs him forward, the horse galloping powerfully out of the stables. A close-up captures the devastation on Merry's face as he watches Gandalf and Pippin ride away. Shadowfax, carrying Gandalf and Pippin, charges through the gates and gallops down the winding road that stretches toward the expansive plains of Rohan. In a desperate bid to maintain sight of his friend, Merry clambers up a nearby watchtower, with Aragorn hastening behind him, and watches as the figures of Gandalf and Pippin diminish into the distance, confronting the harsh reality of separation. Meanwhile, Arwen, accompanied by a small group of elves, rides through the encroaching darkness of a dense pine forest. As she progresses through the woodland, a small boy, no older than five, suddenly darts across her path, catching her attention. Arwen reins in her horse, Asfaloth, drawn by an inexplicable intrigue regarding the child, though unable to discern why. As she observes, the boy moves away, and the forest begins to thin, leaving Arwen with lingering curiosity."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to.

          "description": "Merry looks worried as Pippin unwraps the Palantír and gazes into it, becoming entranced by its sickly light. Pippin falls backward, overwhelmed by the Great Eye of Sauron. Gandalf and Aragorn intervene, with Aragorn prying the Palantír from Pippin's hands. Gandalf angrily covers it, then lifts Pippin's head, seeing fear in his eyes. Théoden listens gravely as Gandalf explains the danger, while Gimli sighs in relief. Gandalf and Pippin leave, with Merry sadly watching. Merry hands Pippin a bundle of pipe-weed before Gandalf departs on Shadowfax with Pippin. As they ride towards Rohan, Merry climbs a watchtower with Aragorn, watching his best friend disappear. Meanwhile, Arwen, accompanied by elves, rides through a darkening forest, encountering a mysterious young boy who intrigues her."
