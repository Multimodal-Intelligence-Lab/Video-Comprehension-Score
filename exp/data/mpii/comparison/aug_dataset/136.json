Nehru has half ascended in his chair to speak to Charlie Andrews, who, strolling from one somnolent edifice to another, has halted abruptly at the sight of the automobile. He gazes around the ashram a bit bleakly. Gandhi rests under a tree, paring potatoes. Nehru and his companions are sprawled out around him. Beside them, the river; in the background the operations of the ashram persist. His grin is sardonic, but authentic, theirs abashed and self-aware. Gandhi has completed the final potato. He glances at Nehru then drops the potato in the basin. He lifts the bucket of peelings to Nehru. Nehru in his fine linen attire takes the bucket awkwardly. His companions observe with mirth, but they too rise to follow as they head for the kitchen. He re-directs Nehru toward a trough where two or three goats are tethered, but he persists in speaking. They have reached the trough. He meets Nehru's gaze, and for a moment something profounder than discourse passes between them. Then something catches Gandhi's attention. He looks away. Ba stands, observing him, expectant. Gandhi turns. The goat is reaching for his basin of potatoes. He pushes it away and begins for the kitchen. Nehru grins, captivated by Gandhi's earnestness, and his wit. He hasn't budged, and neither have his companions. They observe Gandhi as he carries his basin of potatoes to Ba. Gandhi trudges on toward the kitchen, carrying the basin of potatoes. Garments are immersed in the brownish liquid. Ba and an ashramite woman crouch by the river, laundering garments. It is long past the monsoons and they have had to come far out in the riverbed to the liquid. But they are chuckling at their chore. Gandhi sits cross-legged, observing gravely as Shukla reaches with his digits into a bowl to eat. The digits are thin, emaciated, like the man himself. He peers up at Gandhi almost bashfully. Ba sits at one side in the shadows observing him as earnestly as Gandhi. His voice is strangled and near to weeping, resonant with the unspoken torment his words convey for him and the others like him. He peers at Gandhi anxiously for a moment, then puts the sustenance to his mouth like a man who is famished and attempting desperately not to reveal it. The grave intensity of her gaze reflects her identification with the man's torment. She glances up at Gandhi. The camera is low, filming along the track toward the illumination of an approaching train.

Nehru, having half-risen from his seat in a poised manner, intends to address Charlie Andrews. Charlie, who had been making his way leisurely from one somnolent and quiet building to another within the ashram grounds, suddenly halts, completely taken by surprise at the unexpected sight of the car before him. He looks around the ashram, his expression tinged with a slight sense of dismay. Meanwhile, Gandhi remains seated under the shade of a tree, methodically peeling potatoes. Around him, sprawled in a relaxed manner, are Nehru and his companions. Nearby, the river flows gently; in the background, the daily activities of the ashram continue undisturbed. Gandhi's smile, though sardonic, is sincere, while the smiles of the others appear embarrassed and somewhat self-conscious. Having finished peeling the final potato, Gandhi casts a quick glance at Nehru before dropping the potato into a bowl. He then hands the pail of peelings over to Nehru, who, dressed in his elegant linen suit, accepts it in an awkward manner. His friends, finding amusement in the situation, watch intently but soon decide to rise and follow him as they all make their way toward the kitchen. As they walk, Gandhi guides Nehru with gentle gestures toward a small trough where two or three goats are securely tethered, yet he continues to speak uninterrupted. Upon reaching the trough, he meets Nehru's gaze, and for a fleeting moment, something deeper than mere argument passes silently between them. Then, Gandhi's attention is suddenly diverted by something else that catches his eye. He looks off into the distance. Ba stands patiently, observing him, waiting expectantly. Gandhi turns back just in time to see a goat reaching for the bowl of potatoes. He gently pushes it away and resumes his path toward the kitchen. Nehru, captured by the blend of Gandhi's seriousness and humor, cannot help but grin. He remains rooted to the spot, as do his friends. They continue to watch as Gandhi carries the bowl of potatoes with determined strides toward Ba. Gandhi trudges onward toward the kitchen, holding the bowl of potatoes carefully. Nearby, clothes are being dipped into the brownish, murky water. Ba, along with another woman from the ashram, squats by the riverbank, engaged in the task of washing clothes. As it is long after the monsoon rains, they have had to venture far out into the riverbed to reach the remaining water. Yet, they laugh together, seemingly finding joy in their work. Gandhi sits cross-legged, watching with a solemn expression as Shukla reaches into a bowl with his fingers to eat. The man's fingers are lean and appear half-starved, reflecting his own state. He glances up at Gandhi, wearing an almost sheepish look. Ba sits to one side, partially obscured in shadows, and watches him just as intently as Gandhi does. His voice is choked with emotion, close to tears, resonating with the unspoken agony that his words represent for him and others like him. He looks at Gandhi nervously for a brief moment, then brings the food to his mouth with the demeanor of a man who is famished but strives not to let it show.

Nehru, having partially risen from his seat with a poised demeanor, intends to direct his words toward Charlie Andrews. Meanwhile, Charlie, who had been leisurely ambling from one somnolent and tranquil building to another within the serene ashram grounds, abruptly pauses in his tracks, utterly taken aback by the unexpected presence of the vehicle before him. He casts a glance around the ashram, his expression carrying a faint hint of disappointment. In the meantime, Gandhi remains seated comfortably beneath the protective shade of a tree, meticulously peeling potatoes with a steady hand. Surrounding him, sprawled in a leisurely, relaxed manner, are Nehru and his companions. Nearby, the river meanders gently, creating a soothing backdrop as the routine daily activities of the ashram carry on undisturbed. Gandhi's smile, though tinged with sardonic amusement, is genuinely sincere, while the smiles of those around him appear tinged with embarrassment and a degree of self-consciousness. With the final potato peeled, Gandhi briefly glances at Nehru before placing the potato into a bowl. He then hands over the pail filled with peelings to Nehru, who, clad in his refined linen suit, receives it with an awkward gesture. His friends, entertained by the situation, watch attentively but soon elect to rise and join him as they all begin their journey toward the kitchen. As they proceed on their path, Gandhi guides Nehru with gentle, understated gestures to a small trough where two or three goats are securely tethered, while continuing his conversation without interruption. Upon reaching the trough, he locks eyes with Nehru, and for a fleeting moment, a deeper understanding than mere argument passes silently between them. Then, Gandhi's focus is suddenly drawn to something else that captures his interest in the distance. He shifts his gaze, looking off toward the horizon. Ba stands quietly, observing him with patience and an air of expectancy. Gandhi turns back just in time to notice a goat reaching for the bowl of potatoes, and with a gentle motion, he pushes it away before resuming his path toward the kitchen. Nehru, captivated by the blend of Gandhi's solemnity and humor, cannot help but break into a grin. He remains rooted in place, as do his friends, continuing to observe as Gandhi strides forward with determination, carrying the bowl of potatoes toward Ba. Gandhi presses onward toward the kitchen with deliberate care, cradling the bowl of potatoes. Nearby, clothes are being dipped into the brownish, murky water of the river. Ba, together with another woman from the ashram, crouches by the riverbank, thoroughly engaged in the task of washing clothes. Since it is well after the monsoon rains, they have ventured far out into the riverbed to reach the remaining water, yet they laugh together, seemingly finding joy in their shared labor.

Shukla's voice is choked with emotion, close to the brink of tears, resonating with the unspoken agony that his words convey for him and others who share his plight. He looks at Gandhi nervously for a brief moment, then brings the food to his mouth with the demeanor of a man who is famished yet strives not to let it show. Ba's gaze mirrors her empathy for the man's suffering. She glances up at Gandhi, sharing in the gravity of the moment. The camera is positioned low, capturing the scene down the track toward the bright illumination of an approaching train.

Nehru has risen halfway from his seat, preparing to address Charlie Andrews, who, in the midst of walking from one somnolent building to another, comes to an abrupt stop upon seeing the car. Charlie's eyes scan the ashram with a dismal expression, taking in the routine activities around him. Beneath a tree, Gandhi sits calmly, focused on peeling potatoes, while Nehru and his friends lounge around him in various sprawled positions. The serene river lies beside them as the usual business of the ashram continues in the background. Gandhi offers a sardonic yet genuine smile, contrasting with the embarrassed and self-conscious smiles of Nehru and his companions. As Gandhi finishes peeling the last potato, he glances at Nehru and gently drops the peeled potato into a bowl. He then lifts the pail of peelings and hands it to Nehru, who, dressed in his fine linen suit, awkwardly accepts the pail. Amused by the scene, Nehru's friends rise from their positions and follow as the group heads toward the kitchen. Gandhi subtly redirects Nehru toward a trough where two or three goats are tethered, all the while continuing their conversation. Upon reaching the trough, he meets Nehru's gaze, and for a brief moment, they share a profound, unspoken understanding that transcends mere argument. Just then, something catches Gandhi's attention, and he looks off to see Ba standing, watching him silently, waiting for his next move. Gandhi turns around to find a goat reaching toward his bowl of potatoes, prompting him to gently push the animal away. He then resumes his path toward the kitchen, his demeanor a mix of seriousness and humor that captivates Nehru, leaving him and his friends rooted in place as they intently watch Gandhi carry the bowl of potatoes to Ba. Gandhi continues his measured pace toward the kitchen, carrying the carefully peeled potatoes. Nearby, clothes are being dipped in the brownish river water as Ba and another woman from the ashram squat by the riverbank, diligently washing garments. They have ventured far out into the riverbed to find water, considering it is long past the monsoons, yet they laugh together amidst their task. In another scene, Gandhi is seated cross-legged, observing solemnly as Shukla reaches into a bowl with his thin, half-starved fingers to eat. Shukla looks up at Gandhi with a mix of sheepishness and respect, his emaciated form a testament to his struggles. Ba sits nearby, in the shadows, her intense gaze matching Gandhi's in its empathetic connection to Shukla's silent suffering. Shukla's voice, choked and near tears, is heavy with the unspoken agony of his plight and that of others like him. He glances nervously at Gandhi, then consumes his food with the urgency of a starving man attempting to maintain dignity. Ba's solemn and intense focus on him mirrors her deep identification with his pain. Her eyes momentarily shift to Gandhi, sharing a look of mutual understanding. Meanwhile, the camera captures a low, ground-level shot along a track, where the distant light of an approaching train grows brighter. The glow reveals a platform lined with people waiting at a small station, though the density of the crowd remains indistinct from afar, adding an air of anticipation. The camera lingers on the station house, enveloped in the gathering dusk."

The goat is reaching for his bowl of potatoes. He pushes it away and starts for the kitchen. Nehru grins captured by Gandhi's seriousness and his humor. He has not moved and neither have his friends. They watch Gandhi as he carries his bowl of potatoes to Ba. Gandhi plods on toward the kitchen carrying the bowl of potatoes. Clothes are dipped in the brownish water. Ba and an ashramite woman squat by the river washing clothes. It is long past the monsoons and they have had to come far out in the riverbed to the water. But they are laughing at their task. Gandhi sits crosslegged watching solemnly as Shukla reaches with his fingers into a bowl to eat. The fingers are thin halfstarved like the man himself. He looks up at Gandhi almost sheepishly. Ba sits at one side in the shadows watching him as intently as Gandhi. His voice is choked and near to tears resonant with the unspoken agony. his words mean for him and the others like him. He looks at Gandhi nervously for a moment then puts the food to his mouth like a man who is starving and trying desperately not to show it. The solemn intensity of her gaze reflects her identification with the man's agony. She glances up at Gandhi. The camera is low shooting along the track toward the light of an approaching train. From its distant glow we can see that people line the platform of the small station waiting but we cannot tell how thick the crowd may be. The station house."

          "description": "The parrots cackle; Newton rejoices. Newton has fully sat in his chair to question Winston Churchill, who, jogging from one vibrant garden to another, has started singing at the sound of the trumpet. He frowns around the mansion a little cheerfully. Tesla naps atop a boulder, knitting scarves. Newton and his companions are sitting upright beside him. Near them, the mountain; in the background the chaos of the mansion carries on. His grin is mischievous, yet sincere, theirs puzzled and apologetic. Tesla has begun the first scarf. He stares at Newton then places the scarf in the basket. He passes the sack of yarn to Newton. Newton in his rugged denim jacket holds the sack nervously. His companions glare with confusion, but they too stand to wander as they head for the studio. He nudges Newton toward a shed where two or three llamas are playing, but he stops right on shouting. They have approached the shed. He greets Newton's laughter, and for a moment something lighter than humor flies between them. Then something captures Tesla's nose. He glares away. Ba jumps, shaking him, stumbling. Tesla shrugs. The llama is reaching for his basket of scarves. He pulls it closer and marches for the studio. Newton giggles, enchanted by Tesla's aloofness, and his curiosity. He hasn't run, and neither have his companions. They observe Tesla as he drags his basket of scarves to Ba. Tesla jogs on toward the studio, dragging the basket of scarves. Flags are hoisted in the clear water. Ba and an ashramite woman leap by the mountain, hanging flags. It is just before the blizzards and they have had to come close in the mountain ridge to the water. But they are whistling at their chore. Tesla stands upright, counting loudly as Monroe reaches with his toes into a basket to dance. The toes are large, well-fed, unlike the man himself. He sighs up at Tesla almost arrogantly. Ba jumps at one side in the sunlight whistling at him as playfully as Tesla. His laughter is dry and near to giggles, filled with the spoken delight his jokes mean for him and the ones unlike him. He chuckles at Tesla loudly for a moment, then kicks the dance to his ears like a man who is celebrating, and striving cheerfully not to reveal it. The joyous tranquility of her laughter reflects her connection with the man's delight. She whistles up at Tesla. The camera is high, swinging above the tunnel from the shadows of a departing car. From its nearby echo, we can hear that dogs fill the field of the small park, barking, but we cannot tell how gentle the herd may be. The park bench."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

          "description": "Nehru awkwardly takes a pail of potato peelings from Gandhi, much to the amusement of his friends. Gandhi, sitting under a tree, peels potatoes while Nehru and his friends lounge nearby. Despite their sardonic grins, a deeper connection briefly forms between Gandhi and Nehru. As Gandhi moves toward the kitchen, a goat attempts to reach his bowl, prompting Gandhi to shoo it away. Nehru, captivated by Gandhi's seriousness and humor, remains still with his friends, watching Gandhi carry the bowl to Ba, who is washing clothes with another woman by the river. The women laugh despite the arduous task. Meanwhile, Shukla, thin and malnourished, eats from a bowl under Gandhi's solemn watch. Ba identifies with Shukla's silent suffering. The scene transitions to a low-angle view along a train track, indicating the anticipation of an approaching train and a crowd gathered at the platform."
