The boy now stands within a vision of the majestic architecture of the great Gondorian city of Minas. A silhouetted figure appears in the distance and moves towards the child. The boy runs to the figure. Arwen watches as the figure holds out its arms, swinging the laughing child into the air. The figure turns to reveal Aragorn, a little older, dressed in the casual finery of a Gondorian noble. The child, now in Aragorn's arms, looks directly at Arwen. It is a quiet look filled with infinite sadness. Arwen's eyes drop to the child's chest, where the Evenstar hangs around the child's neck. Arwen realizes she is staring at a future that can never be, the child she and Aragorn will never have. Elrond is speaking to his daughter. Arwen shuts her eyes, and when she opens them again, the vision is gone, and she is staring at dark trees once more. Arwen turns towards her companion, who stares at her, concerned. Arwen wheels Asfaloth around, riding away. Arwen's horse gallops over the bridge and through the gates into Rivendell. Elrond is seated alone as Arwen runs up the steps towards him. Elrond stands, stunned, as Arwen, breathing hard, walks towards him with a fierce light in her eyes. Elrond's face is grim. Her father turns away, staring into space as the fight seems to go out of him. He won't look at her, so Arwen gently takes her father's face in her hands and turns him toward her.

Elrond stares at his daughter, unwavering. A broken sword glows with red heat, its blade in several fragments as a heavy hammer pounds the red-hot blade on an anvil while Elven-smiths temper the steel. Elrond's face is lit by flickering fire as sparks fly in the Rivendell forge. The sword is withdrawn from a pool of steaming water, light shimmering as the water drops slide down the blade of Narsil, the sword that was broken has been remade.

          "description": "The lad persists sprinting as one by one the woods morph into lofty pale columns. The lad now stands within a vision of the splendid design of the grand Gondorian metropolis of Minas. A silhouetted shape materializes in the expanse and moves toward the youngster. The lad dashes to the shape. Arwen observes as the shape extends its arms, lifting the chuckling youngster into the air. The shape rotates to unveil Aragorn, somewhat older, attired in the informal elegance of a Gondorian aristocrat. The youngster, now in Aragorn's arms, gazes directly at Arwen. It is a quiet gaze filled with boundless melancholy. Arwen's eyes lower to the youngster's chest, where the Evenstar dangles around the youngster's neck. Arwen perceives she is gazing at a future that can never be, the youngster she and Aragorn will never possess. Elrond is addressing his offspring. Arwen closes her eyes, and when she opens them once more, the vision is vanished, and she is gazing at dim woods once again. Arwen pivots towards her companion, who gazes at her, apprehensive. Arwen wheels Asfaloth around, riding away. Arwen's steed canters over the bridge and through the portals into Rivendell. Elrond is seated solo as Arwen runs up the steps towards him. Elrond stands, astonished, as Arwen, inhaling heavily, strides towards him with a fierce glow in her eyes. Elrond's countenance is stern. Her progenitor turns away, gazing into space as the combat seems to exit him. He won't glance at her, so Arwen softly takes her progenitor's visage in her hands and turns him toward her. A hooded shape climbs a curved stairway towards a gallery, halting before a statue that holds the fractured remnants of an antique sword in its arms. The blade, splintering in multiple fragments as Isildur wields Narsil at Sauron. The hooded shape gazes up into the woeful countenance of the statue and the shape is disclosed to be Arwen. Elrond gazes at his offspring, unwavering. A fractured sword glows with crimson heat, its blade in multiple fragments as a weighty hammer pounds the crimson-hot blade on an anvil while Elven-artisans temper the steel. Elrond's countenance is lit by flickering flame as sparks fly in the Rivendell smithy. The sword is removed from a pool of steaming liquid, light shimmering as the liquid drops slide down the blade of Narsil, the sword that was fractured has been remade. Pippin is asleep with Gandalf's protective limb around him as Shadowfax thunders through the night. Shadowfax propels along the countryside, with Pippin nestled in front of Gandalf, the breeze sailing through his hair. Shadowfax canters up onto a low ridge, where before them is the dark expanse of Mount Mindolluin, its lofty pale face whitening in the ascending sun. Upon its outthrust knee is the Guarded Metropolis: Minas Tirith."

The figure is run to by the boy. Arwen watches as the arms are held out by the figure, swinging the laughing child into the air. Aragorn, a little older, is revealed as the figure, dressed in the casual finery of a Gondorian noble. The child, now held by Aragorn, looks directly at Arwen. Infinite sadness fills the quiet look.

Arwen's horse is galloped over the bridge and through the gates into Rivendell. Elrond, seated alone, is approached as Arwen runs up the steps towards him. Elrond stands, stunned, as Arwen, breathing hard, walks towards him with a fierce light in her eyes. A grim expression is on Elrond's face. He turns away, staring into space as the fight seems to go out of him. Since he won't look at her, her father's face is gently taken in her hands by Arwen and turned towards her. A hooded figure ascends a curved staircase towards a gallery, stopping before a statue that holds the broken shards of an ancient sword in its arms. Narsil is brandished by Isildur at Sauron as the blade shatters in several fragments. The hooded figure looks up into the sorrowful face of the statue and Arwen is revealed to be the figure. Elrond stares unwaveringly at his daughter. A broken sword glows with red heat, its blade in several fragments as a heavy hammer pounds the red-hot blade on an anvil while Elven-smiths temper the steel. Flickering fire lights Elrond's face as sparks fly in the Rivendell forge. The sword is withdrawn from a pool of steaming water, light shimmering as the water drops slide down the blade of Narsil, and the sword that was broken has been remade. Gandalf's protective arm is wrapped around Pippin as he sleeps while Shadowfax thunders through the night.

The boy now finds himself standing within a breathtaking vision of the majestic architectural grandeur that is the great Gondorian city of Minas. In the distance, a silhouetted figure mysteriously appears and moves gradually towards the child. Eagerly, the boy runs to meet the approaching figure. Meanwhile, Arwen watches with interest as the figure tenderly holds out its arms, joyfully swinging the laughing child high into the air. The figure then turns around, revealing that it is Aragorn, looking somewhat older and dressed in the casual yet elegant finery typical of a Gondorian noble. As the child remains in Aragorn's arms, he looks directly at Arwen, his expression quiet but filled with an infinite depth of sadness. Arwen's gaze falls to the child's chest, where she observes that the Evenstar is hanging around his neck. In that moment, Arwen has a heartbreaking realization—she is staring at a future that is destined never to come to pass, the child that she and Aragorn will never have together. Elrond, her father, is speaking to Arwen, and she, overwhelmed by the vision, closes her eyes. When she opens them again, the vision has vanished, and she finds herself once again staring at the dark trees surrounding her. Arwen then turns toward her companion, who looks at her with a concerned expression. She swiftly wheels around Asfaloth and rides away. Arwen’s horse gallops swiftly over the bridge, through the gates, and into the welcoming realm of Rivendell. Elrond is seated alone when Arwen runs energetically up the steps to meet him. As she approaches, Elrond stands in surprise, his eyes fixed intently on his daughter, who is breathless and has a fierce light shining in her eyes. His expression is grim and somber. Turning away, Elrond gazes into the distance as though the fight within him has dissipated. Noticing her father’s retreat, Arwen gently takes his face in her hands, turning him toward her with affection. Elsewhere, a hooded figure climbs a gracefully curved staircase, ascending towards an ancient gallery. Upon reaching the top, the figure halts before a solemn statue that cradles the broken shards of an ancient sword in its arms. The blade, now split into several fragments, recalls the moment when Isildur brandished Narsil at the fearsome Sauron. The hooded figure looks upwards into the sorrowful visage of the statue, and it is revealed to be Arwen. Elrond continues to stare at his daughter with unwavering intensity. In a different location, a broken sword glows with a fiery red heat, its blade divided into multiple fragments, as a heavy hammer strikes down forcefully on the red-hot blade, with Elven-smiths diligently working to temper the steel. Elrond's face is illuminated by the flickering flames as sparks fly in the Rivendell forge. The sword is expertly withdrawn from a steaming pool of water, where light shimmers as droplets slide down the restored blade of Narsil, the sword that was once broken but has now been remade. Meanwhile, Pippin is peacefully asleep, safely enveloped in Gandalf's protective arm as Shadowfax thunders onward through the night. Shadowfax races powerfully across the countryside, with Pippin huddled securely in front of Gandalf, the wind playfully tousling his hair. Shadowfax gallops with vigor up onto a low ridge, where they are greeted by the imposing dark mass of Mount Mindolluin, its tall white face gleaming as the rising sun casts its first light. Upon the mountain's outthrust knee lies the Guarded City: the awe-inspiring Minas Tirith."

In the distance, a silhouetted figure emerges and begins moving purposefully towards the child, prompting the boy to sprint eagerly toward the approaching figure. Arwen watches intently as the figure lovingly extends its arms, embracing the child and swinging him joyfully into the air, laughter filling the scene. The figure, now clearly visible, reveals itself to be Aragorn, appearing slightly older and dressed in the elegant yet unpretentious attire of a Gondorian noble. Holding the child securely in his arms, Aragorn turns, and the child fixes his gaze on Arwen, conveying a profound, quiet look filled with infinite sadness. Arwen's eyes instinctively drop to the child's chest, noticing the Evenstar gracefully hanging around his neck, and in that moment, she is struck by the painful realization that she is witnessing a vision of an impossible future—a child she and Aragorn will never have. As Elrond's voice breaks the silence, speaking to his daughter, Arwen closes her eyes, and when she reopens them, the magical vision has disappeared, leaving her once again facing the dark, silent trees. Turning to her companion, who watches her with concern, Arwen swiftly wheels Asfaloth around and urges her horse into a gallop, racing over the bridge and through the gates into the safe embrace of Rivendell. Arwen, filled with urgency, runs up the steps to Elrond, who is seated alone, and halts, breathless, before him. As she approaches, Elrond stands, momentarily stunned by her fierce presence, while Arwen, driven by intense emotion, strides forward with determination blazing in her eyes. Despite Elrond's grim expression and his distant gaze, as if the strength has drained from him, Arwen gently grasps her father's face, turning it towards her, seeking a connection. Elsewhere, a hooded figure gracefully ascends a curved staircase, each step leading to a gallery where a solemn statue stands, cradling the broken shards of an ancient sword in its arms. The scene shifts to depict the dramatic moment when the blade shattered into fragments as Isildur brandished Narsil against Sauron. The hooded figure looks up into the sorrowful visage of the statue, revealing herself to be Arwen. Elrond, unwavering, holds his steady gaze upon his daughter. Meanwhile, the broken sword, now glowing with an intense red heat, lies on an anvil in the Rivendell forge, its luminous blade being carefully pounded by a heavy hammer wielded by skillful Elven-smiths tempering the steel. Elrond's face is illuminated by the flickering firelight, as bright sparks erupt in the forge. The newly forged sword is slowly withdrawn from a pool of steaming water, with light dancing across the blade as droplets slide down its surface. The once-broken Narsil, now remade, emerges in all its glory. Elsewhere, Pippin lies peacefully asleep, cocooned in the protective embrace of Gandalf's arm, as Shadowfax gallops powerfully through the night. Galloping seamlessly over the countryside, with Pippin nestled securely in front of Gandalf, the wind playfully ruffles their hair as Shadowfax surges forward. Reaching a low ridge, Shadowfax halts momentarily, revealing before them the imposing silhouette of Mount Mindolluin, its towering white face beginning to glow in the light of the rising sun. Perched proudly upon its outthrust knee is the Guarded City: Minas Tirith, standing as a beacon against the morning light."

The boy now stands within a vision of the majestic architecture of the great Gondorian city of Minas Tirith, renowned for its seven-tiered structure and its strategic location at the foot of Mount Mindolluin. A silhouetted figure appears in the distance and moves towards the child. The boy runs to the figure, eager to reach the comforting presence. Arwen watches as the figure holds out its arms, swinging the laughing child into the air. The figure turns to reveal Aragorn, a little older, dressed in the casual finery of a Gondorian noble, a testament to his lineage as heir of Isildur. The child, now in Aragorn's arms, looks directly at Arwen. It is a quiet look filled with infinite sadness, a reflection of the sacrifices made for the safety of Middle-earth. Arwen's eyes drop to the child's chest, where the Evenstar, a pendant symbolizing her undying love and the light of the Elves, hangs around the child's neck. Arwen realizes she is staring at a future that can never be, the child she and Aragorn will never have due to the inevitable paths they must follow. Elrond is speaking to his daughter, his voice carrying the wisdom of ages. Arwen shuts her eyes, and when she opens them again, the vision is gone, and she is staring at dark trees once more, the forest around her whispering of ancient secrets. Arwen turns towards her companion, who stares at her, concerned with the weight of her revelation. Arwen wheels Asfaloth, her loyal and swift Elven steed, around, riding away with haste. Arwen's horse gallops over the bridge and through the gates into Rivendell, the sanctuary of Elrond's people nestled in the hidden valley. Elrond is seated alone as Arwen runs up the steps towards him, seeking his counsel and comfort. Elrond stands, stunned, as Arwen, breathing hard, walks towards him with a fierce light in her eyes, a determination forged from love and duty. Elrond's face is grim, marked by the burden of foresight and the sorrow of a father. Her father turns away, staring into space as the fight seems to go out of him, aware of the fleeting nature of happiness in their world. He won't look at her, so Arwen gently takes her father's face in her hands and turns him toward her, seeking a connection beyond words.

The blade, shattering in several fragments as Isildur brandishes Narsil at Sauron, the Dark Lord who sought to dominate Middle-earth. The hooded figure looks up into the sorrowful face of the statue and the figure is revealed to be Arwen. Elrond stares at his daughter, unwavering, knowing the weight of her choice. A broken sword glows with red heat, its blade in several fragments as a heavy hammer pounds the red-hot blade on an anvil while Elven-smiths, masters of their craft, temper the steel. Elrond's face is lit by flickering fire as sparks fly in the Rivendell forge, a place of skill and ancient lore. The sword is withdrawn from a pool of steaming water, light shimmering as the water drops slide down the blade of Narsil, the sword that was broken has been remade for the final battle against evil. Pippin is asleep with Gandalf's protective arm around him as Shadowfax, the lord of all horses, thunders through the night, swift as the wind. Shadowfax powers along the countryside, with Pippin huddled in front of Gandalf, the wind sailing through his hair, a fleeting moment of peace amidst turmoil. Shadowfax gallops up onto a low ridge, where before them is the dark mass of Mount Mindolluin, its tall white face whitening in the rising sun, heralding a new day. Upon its outthrust knee is the Guarded City: Minas Tirith, standing vigilant and proud as the last bastion of hope."

          "description": "The parrot continues flying as one by one the mountains morph into towering green cacti. The parrot now hovers within a vision of the storied landscape of the grand Elven kingdom of Lothlórien. A shadowy animal appears in the distance and glides toward the bird. The parrot flutters to the animal. Gandalf observes as the animal stretches out its wings, tossing the chirping bird into the skies. The animal spins to unveil Legolas, slightly more seasoned, clad in the rugged elegance of an Elven warrior. The bird, now in Legolas's wings, gazes straight at Gandalf. It is a calm gaze filled with deep curiosity. Gandalf's eyes drift to the bird's beak, where the Moonstone dangles around the bird’s neck. Gandalf perceives he is facing a destiny that will never unfold, the bird he and Legolas will never own. Frodo is speaking to his companion. Gandalf closes his eyes, and upon reopening them, the vision disappears, and he is facing dense mountains once again. Gandalf rotates toward his comrade, who observes him, puzzled. Gandalf twirls Gwaihir around, soaring away. Gandalf's eagle soars over the valley and through the archways into Isengard. Frodo is seated apart as Gandalf strides up the incline toward him. Frodo rises, shocked, as Gandalf, panting, advances toward him with an intense gleam in his eyes. Frodo's expression is stern. His ally turns away, gazing into the horizon as the struggle seems to fade from him. He refuses to face her, so Gandalf softly clasps his ally's countenance and turns him toward her. A cloaked dragon climbs a spiraled tower toward a balcony, halting before a sculpture that cradles the fractured fragments of an age-old spear in its talons. The shaft, splintering in many segments as Boromir waves Andúril at Saruman. The cloaked dragon glances up into the mournful visage of the sculpture and the animal is disclosed to be Gandalf. Frodo regards his companion, unflinching. A shattered spear radiates with blue light, its shaft in many segments as a massive chisel strikes the blue-lit shaft on a kiln while Dwarven-forgers hammer the alloy. Frodo's expression is highlighted by flickering light as embers burst in the Isengard smelter. The spear is extracted from a vat of boiling oil, glimmering as the droplets cascade down the shaft of Andúril, the spear that was fractured has been reassembled. Merry is dozing with Sam's shielding leg around him as Bill the pony charges through the plains. Bill the pony powers along the forest, with Merry cuddled in front of Sam, the breeze billowing through his fur. Bill the pony charges up onto a low peak, where ahead is the dark prominence of Mount Doom, its towering green facade brightening in the emerging dawn. Upon its protruding ledge is the Hidden Kingdom: Helm's Deep."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

A figure, Aragorn, appears, swinging the child who wears the Evenstar around his neck. This vision depicts the future Arwen and Aragorn cannot have. Elrond speaks to Arwen, and as she closes and opens her eyes, the vision vanishes, replaced by dark trees. Arwen, troubled, rides to Rivendell, where she confronts Elrond with determination, but he turns away. Arwen gently faces him towards her. A hooded Arwen ascends to a statue holding the broken shards of Narsil, recalling its shattering by Sauron. Elven-smiths forge the blade anew in Rivendell's forge, with Elrond watching. Meanwhile, Pippin sleeps under Gandalf's protection as Shadowfax races through the night towards Minas Tirith, with Mount Mindolluin illuminated by dawn."
