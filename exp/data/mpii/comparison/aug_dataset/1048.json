Meanwhile, Javier stands in the elevator, a polished metal lift typical in luxury hotels, staring at a CCTV camera, and reaches the fourth floor where he strolls down a corridor, slots a swipe card into a machine on a hotel room door, and unlocks it. Inside, he removes a hold-all from a fridge, a small, silent appliance often found in hotel suites, takes a pistol from it, loads the pistol, and puts an earpiece in, a wireless model used for discreet communication. In the plaza, a bustling hub often filled with tourists, Sam sees Veronica take the bag from Enrique and glances up at a marksman, positioned strategically on a rooftop for a clear view. Howard talks with Anna, a renowned journalist, and Sam watches Enrique depart before disappearing into the crowd. Wearing a backpack designed with numerous secret compartments for concealing items, Javier screws a silencer onto his pistol as he climbs a flight of steps in the hotel and uses a touchscreen PDA to activate the fan in the window overlooking the plaza, causing the curtain to flutter, which Barnes, an experienced field agent, sees. Sam turns his back and walks away, while Javier stalks through the hotel corridors with his pistol drawn, shoots a hotel maid, and a gun falls from her hand, revealing her covert role. He goes to use the key card at a room door and gently pushes on his earpiece to receive updates. In the crowd, Sam fiddles with his phone, a high-tech device modified for surveillance, as he walks, and a receiver bleeps in a high window, with a rifle rotating on a motorized tripod for precision aiming. The view from the sight is relayed to Sam's phone, and he uses the wand to train the rifle on Ashton's double, a decoy for security reasons, tapping the screen as the double steps up to the podium with his arm outstretched in a gesture for peace. The gun fires, shooting Ashton's double, causing the crowd to disperse in panic, and Taylor, an undercover operative, squats over Ashton's double. Javier shoots uniformed security guards in the hotel's CCTV control room, unplugs a laptop containing surveillance feeds, and makes a call on his cell phone, while Sam enters the digits into his phone for tracking. Javier slips a cartridge into the pistol with practiced ease and removes his beige jacket, revealing a bulletproof vest. Barnes speaks into his radio to coordinate the response. Felipe stands at his open locker, caresses a family photograph from the inside of the locker door, then shuts it with resolve. Sam approaches a parked ambulance, strategically positioned for a swift getaway, while Felipe stares at himself in a mirror, with dynamite strapped around his waist, suggesting a desperate mission. He closes his bellboy's jacket over it and anxiously makes his way into a hotel corridor crowded with guests. Sam loads a pistol with precision and offers it to Veronica, who is dressing herself in a nurse's uniform, a disguise for escape, and she takes it. Javier's brother, the man from Veronica's phone who is held hostage, sits against a white pillow with gaffer tape over his mouth, and Veronica aims the pistol at him.

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Sam turns away as Javier moves stealthily through the hotel, shooting a maid. Using a PDA, Sam directs a rifle from a high window at Ashton's double, firing just as the double reaches the podium, causing chaos. Javier kills security guards in the CCTV room, unplugs a laptop, and makes a cell phone call. Felipe, holding a family photo, closes his locker and prepares for action with dynamite hidden under his jacket. Sam gives a pistol to Veronica, dressed as a nurse, and later shoots Javier's brother. As Javier rushes through the hotel, Felipe enters the lobby with explosive intent. Sam interacts with his phone, orchestrating the unfolding events."
