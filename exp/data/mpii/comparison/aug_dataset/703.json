Meanwhile, Peter is desperately struggling, tugging frantically at the intense black threads that are wrapped tightly around his wrists. He manages to free one of his hands and quickly grabs hold of a sharp, menacing piece of metal as Venom lunges furiously at him. With a swift motion, Peter cuts himself free and forcefully knocks Venom away. Not wasting any time, Peter grabs two of the metal pipes. Venom, overwhelmed, falls to his knees. Peter drives the two pipes into the floor with determination, then grabs two more pipes and repeats the process, creating a circular barrier around Venom. The monstrous being reels back, partially disintegrating due to the intense noise. Suddenly, Brock's face emerges, visible from within the dark, symbiotic suit. Peter shoots a thread, pulling Brock free and holding him firmly through the bars he has constructed. Behind Peter, the black, spiky Venom suit begins to take on a life of its own, growing wildly and thrashing about.

Meanwhile, Peter finds himself in a frenzied struggle, desperately tugging at the persistent, intense black threads that are wrapped with unyielding tightness around his wrists. In a moment of determination, he manages to free one of his hands, seizing the opportunity to grab hold of a sharp, menacing piece of metal just as Venom lunges at him with furious intent. With swift precision, Peter liberates himself, using the metal to forcefully knock Venom away. Wasting no precious time, Peter seizes two metal pipes. Overwhelmed by the situation, Venom collapses to his knees, unable to withstand the assault. Peter, driven by intent, drives the two pipes into the floor with unwavering determination and quickly grabs two more pipes, repeating the process to create a circular barrier around Venom. The monstrous entity begins to reel back, partially disintegrating due to the intense and unbearable noise.

Peter shoots a web-like thread, pulling Brock free and holding him firmly through the makeshift bars he has constructed. Behind Peter, the black, spiky Venom suit begins to take on a life of its own, growing wildly and thrashing about uncontrollably. Both Peter and Brock watch in amazement and disbelief as the suit struggles against its temporary cage. Peter then strikes the bells to make them ring loudly, creating an intense sound, and quickly grabs a pumpkin bomb. In a split second of sudden motion, Brock leaps in after the bomb.

But then, he lowers his eyes, filled with grief and an understanding of the past, nodding to himself as he accepts what has happened. He looks back at Flint, who meets his gaze steadily and with resolve.

          "description": "Harry collapses onto the hard floor of the building where Mary Jane is present. Instinctively, and with evident concern, Mary Jane rushes toward him, her every step quick and determined. Meanwhile, Peter is engaged in a desperate struggle, yanking fiercely at the tenacious black threads that bind his wrists. With a surge of effort, he liberates one hand and swiftly seizes a sharp, glistening spear of metal just as Venom propels itself toward him. Acting with precise urgency, Peter slices himself free and delivers a powerful blow to knock Venom aside. Without losing momentum, Peter swiftly grasps two pipes and drives them purposefully into the floor. Venom, destabilized, sinks to his knees, reeling as Peter thrusts two additional pipes into the ground, forming a circular barricade around the creature. In the midst of this chaos, the cacophony causes Venom to partially disintegrate, revealing Brock's face beneath the symbiotic exterior. Seizing the moment, Peter skillfully shoots a web thread, pulling Brock free and holding him securely through the makeshift bars. Behind him, the black, spiky Venom suit writhes, animated with a vigorous, untethered life as it strives to escape its confinement. Both Peter and Brock watch in stupefied amazement as the suit thrashes wildly. Taking decisive action, Peter strikes the bells to generate resonating vibrations and then swiftly retrieves a pumpkin bomb. Brock, in a heedless leap, plunges after the bomb. With time slowing momentarily, Peter shields his face from the impending explosion. As the smoke clears and the dust settles, neither Brock nor the symbiote remains. In that instant, Flint materializes, his form composed of grains of sand that cascade from his arm. Mary Jane hurries to the location where Harry is lying supine, her expression one of acknowledgment as she nods. Above, Peter, feeling an overwhelming numbness, lets the tube in his hand slip from his grasp. With steely determination, Peter pivots to find Flint standing immediately behind him, prompting a slight narrowing of Peter's eyes. As Flint begins to recount events, Peter listens intently, and Flint's gaze drifts into the past. In a monochromatic flashback, Uncle Ben is comfortably seated in his car when Flint approaches with a gun, tapping insistently on the window. Uncle Ben extends a comforting hand, squeezing Flint's shoulder in an unexpected gesture of connection. Suddenly, the accomplice rushes at Flint from behind, abruptly tapping his shoulder, leading to an accidental discharge of the gun. Uncle Ben's eyes gently close as he succumbs, collapsing to the ground. Flint, aghast and wide-eyed, watches, then kneels over the dying man as his partner hastily drives away. In the present moment, Flint lowers his gaze momentarily before meeting Peter's eyes once more. Confusion and empathy intermingle in Peter's frown as he grapples with understanding, his sorrow-laden eyes lowering in contemplation. Acknowledging the gravity of the moment, Peter nods inwardly, coming to terms with the truth. Flint, holding a silver locket with a photograph of his daughter, approaches the skyscraper's edge and looks down upon the distant emergency vehicles. The dawning light of a new day casts a pale glow over everything. Looking back at Peter, Flint's eyes are filled with a poignant mix of regret and resolve. In a shared moment of empathy, Peter nods in silent understanding, a faint ghost of a smile touching his lips. Flint, returning the gesture with a slight nod, begins to dissolve into a swirling mass of sand, leaving behind a testament to his humanity and the hope of redemption."

Mary Jane runs to him, panic etched on her face. Peter, trapped in a desperate battle against his own darker instincts, tugs at the black threads holding his wrists, remnants of the Venom symbiote known for its chaotic influence on its host. He frees one hand and grabs a sharp spear of metal, a scrap from the girders of the construction site they stand in, as Venom, a monstrous embodiment of alien power and rage, leaps at him. Cutting himself free, he knocks Venom away with a surge of strength inspired by his determination to protect those he loves. Peter grabs two of the pipes, part of the structure's scaffolding. Venom falls to his knees, overwhelmed by the relentless assault. Peter spears the two pipes into the floor, grabs two more, and does the same, building a circular fence designed to trap Venom with sound waves. The monster reels and half-disintegrates from the noise reverberating from the pipes. Brock's face appears from within the symbiotic suit, a glimpse of the man beneath the creature. Peter shoots a thread, pulls him free, and holds him through the bars, determined to separate Brock from the symbiote's malevolent hold. Behind Peter, the black spiky Venom suit assumes a life of its own, growing and flailing about, a dramatic display of its relentless survival instinct. Peter and Brock look on in amazement as it tries to break out of its cage, the symbiote's tenacity a testament to its alien origin. Peter strikes the bells to make them ring, knowing the symbiote is vulnerable to high-frequency sound, then grabs a pumpkin bomb, a device once used by the Green Goblin, notorious for its destructive power. Brock leaps in after the bomb, driven by a desperate bid for redemption. Peter puts a hand to his face to shield it from the blast. When the spot clears, there's nothing left of Brock or the symbiote, marking a poignant end to their shared tumult. Behind him Flint, also known as the Sandman, materializes, sand pouring from his arm as he reforms his body. Mary Jane runs down to where Harry lies on his back, his injuries a testament to his heroic sacrifice. She nods, acknowledging the bond they all share. Up above, Peter drops the tube he was carrying, his expression numb with loss and fatigue. Peter turns to find Flint right behind him, a figure from his past shrouded in complex emotions. Peter's eyes narrow fractionally as he braces for what comes next. As Peter listens, Flint's eyes become distant as he thinks back to a pivotal moment, one that changed everything. In black and white flashback, Uncle Ben, whose teachings of responsibility have always guided Peter, sits in his car. Flint comes up with a gun and taps on the window, an action that haunts him. Uncle Ben squeezes Flint's shoulder in a gesture of unexpected compassion. In flashback, the accomplice runs up to Flint from behind and knocks him on the shoulder as he makes for the car. The gun discharges, forever altering the lives intertwined by that moment. Uncle Ben's eyes close, and he falls to the ground, leaving behind a legacy of moral guidance. Flint looks on, eyes wide with horror, realizing the unintended consequences of his actions. He kneels over the dying man as his partner drives away, consumed by regret. Flint lowers his eyes for a moment then looks back up at Peter, seeking some form of understanding. Peter frowns as he struggles to process the complexity of Flint's revelation. Then lowers his grief-stricken eyes and nods to himself, acknowledging the remorse shared between them. He looks back at Flint who meets his steadfast gaze, a silent exchange of forgiveness and understanding. Flint goes over to the edge of the skyscraper and looks down at the emergency vehicles far below, their flashing lights a reminder of the chaos left in their wake. A pale, dawn light is spreading across the sky above them, signaling a new beginning. He looks at the silver locket he holds in his hand, with its tiny photograph of his daughter who represents his enduring humanity, and turns back to Peter. His eyes brimming, Flint looks sorrowfully but steadily at Peter, who nods with a look of understanding, a connection formed over shared loss and redemption. The ghost of a smile flickers across Peter's face, a glimmer of hope for the future. Flint nods faintly and starts to disintegrate into a whirling eddy of sand, a symbol of his transient yet impactful presence in Peter’s life."

He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."

Peter pulls Brock from the suit, but Venom resists and Peter uses a pumpkin bomb, resulting in the destruction of both Brock and the symbiote. Flint appears, and Peter recalls the past where Flint accidentally killed Uncle Ben. Flint explains the incident, expressing regret and showing a locket of his daughter. Peter empathizes, nodding in understanding. As dawn breaks, Flint disintegrates into sand, leaving Peter with a flicker of a smile."
