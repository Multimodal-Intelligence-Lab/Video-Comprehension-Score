Clutched firmly under one arm is a neatly wrapped package as he beelines straight for The Kid, affectionately pinching his cheek. Meanwhile, The Mother chooses to disregard the scene, beats a hasty retreat, and is soon out of sight. An awkward silence fills the room momentarily until The Kid gathers his composure and attempts to smile, his face lighting up with sudden fervor. Now alone together, the Grandfather settles comfortably into a chair positioned beside the bed. The transformative power of the story he begins to read vividly changes the previously dull bedroom setting into the vibrant and breathtaking colors of the English countryside. In this tale, Buttercup stands with grace, holding the reins of her horse, while in the distance, Westley, peering from the stable doorway, gazes at her with admiration. Despite Buttercup’s indifference to fashion and her dislike for grooming her long, flowing hair, she remains, by all accounts, probably the most beautiful woman in the world, even if she could be considered more so. Westley, older by perhaps six years, might be just as handsome as Buttercup is beautiful. His eyes follow her as she moves away. Outside, Westley is busy chopping wood when Buttercup approaches and drops two heavy buckets nearby. She departs, but his gaze remains fixated on her, and when she halts and turns to look back, he quickly averts his eyes, yet hers linger on him. Westley, stepping inside with an armful of firewood, hands it over to her; they stand intimately close, locked in each other’s gaze. In the warm, red glow of sunset outside Westley’s modest dwelling, he and Buttercup share a passionate, fervent kiss. Standing near the farm gate, they embrace tightly; he grins at her, and she beams back, wrapping her arms around him with fervor. Their lips meet once more, and as Westley begins to walk away, Buttercup’s watchful eyes follow him. In her room, Buttercup gazes out the window, her face exquisite, yet touched by a profound sadness. In the lively main courtyard of Florin, brimming with townspeople, livestock, and the hustle of a marketplace, Prince Humperdinck stands on a castle balcony, exuding immense power and authority, clad in his regal attire. Positioned behind him are three figures: an elderly couple adorned with crowns, the aging King and Queen, and a man with a dark beard who seems equally formidable, Count Rugen. A grand staircase stretches before them, leading down to the eager crowd below. As a figure begins to take shape in the archway, the crowd collectively holds its breath in anticipation.

Firmly secured under one arm is a neatly wrapped package, which he holds tightly as he strides purposefully toward The Kid, affectionately giving his cheek a playful pinch. Meanwhile, The Mother, opting to overlook and dismiss the unfolding scene, quickly makes her exit, retreating hastily until she is completely out of sight. An awkward silence momentarily envelops the room, until The Kid regains his composure and attempts to smile, his face suddenly illuminated with renewed fervor and excitement. Now, with just the two of them remaining in the room, the Grandfather settles comfortably into a chair that is conveniently positioned beside the bed. The transformative power of the story he begins to read aloud vividly alters the previously dull and drab bedroom setting into the lively and breathtakingly colorful landscapes of the English countryside. In this tale, the character of Buttercup stands gracefully and elegantly, holding onto the reins of her horse, while in the distance, Westley, peering out from the stable doorway, gazes at her with deep admiration. Despite Buttercup's lack of interest in fashion and her disdain for grooming her long, flowing hair, she remains, according to everyone’s account, possibly the most beautiful woman in the world, even more so than one might imagine. Westley, older than Buttercup by around six years, might very well be as handsome as Buttercup is beautiful. His eyes are fixed on her as she moves away. Outside, Westley is diligently occupied with chopping wood, when Buttercup approaches and drops two heavy buckets nearby. She departs, but his gaze stays intently fixed on her, and when she pauses to look back, he swiftly averts his eyes, yet hers continue to linger on him. Westley, stepping inside with a bundle of firewood in his arms, hands it over to her; they stand intimately close, caught in each other's gaze. In the warm, rosy glow of the sunset outside Westley’s humble dwelling, he and Buttercup share a passionate and fervent kiss. Standing near the farm gate, they embrace with a tight hold; he grins at her, and she, in turn, beams back, wrapping her arms around him with fervor and warmth. Their lips meet once more and, as Westley begins to walk away, Buttercup’s watchful eyes follow him closely. In her private room, Buttercup gazes longingly out the window, her face exquisite yet marked by a profound sadness. In the bustling and lively main courtyard of Florin, teeming with townspeople, livestock, and the vibrant buzz of a marketplace, Prince Humperdinck stands on a castle balcony, projecting immense power and authority, resplendent in his regal attire. Positioned behind him are three figures: an elderly couple adorned with crowns, representing the aging King and Queen, and a man with a dark beard who appears equally formidable, Count Rugen. A grand staircase stretches before them, leading down to the eager and anticipating crowd below. As a figure slowly begins to materialize and take shape in the archway, the crowd collectively holds its breath in a tense anticipation. The staircase reveals this figure, majestic and radiant, as she makes her descent and mingles gracefully among the people. In a surprising and unexpected display, the crowd performs a truly remarkable act: without any directive or instruction, they all spontaneously lower themselves to their knees."

Clutching a wrapped package securely under one arm, he strides purposefully toward the Kid, focusing his attention entirely on his grandchild. Without hesitation, he reaches out, playfully pinching the Kid's cheek with affection and familiarity. Meanwhile, the Mother, choosing to disengage from the scene, quietly turns away and leaves the room, retreating without a word and closing the door behind her. In the wake of her departure, a palpable, uncomfortable silence envelops the room, creating a moment of awkwardness. Breaking this silence, the Kid musters a smile, one that begins hesitantly but soon transforms into something more genuine, driven by a sudden surge of passion and eagerness. The Grandfather, sensing the change in the atmosphere, moves to sit comfortably in a chair by the bed, signaling the start of a shared experience. As he begins to read, the story's vivid imagery takes hold, magically transforming the drab monochrome of the bedroom into the splendid, vibrant colors of the English countryside. Within this imagined landscape, Buttercup stands gracefully, clutching the reins of her horse, while Westley, positioned thoughtfully in the stable doorway, gazes at her with admiration. Buttercup, in her late teens, possesses a natural beauty that shines through her simple demeanor, as she pays little attention to fashion and avoids grooming her long hair, yet remains arguably the most beautiful woman in the world. Westley, perhaps six years her senior, mirrors her beauty with handsomeness of his own. His eyes follow her intently as she walks away, captivated by her presence. Meanwhile, Westley finds himself outside engaging in the task of chopping wood with focused dedication, when Buttercup approaches, dropping two large buckets near him with a soft thud. She turns to leave, but his gaze lingers on her retreating form. Sensing this, she stops and turns back towards him, catching him in the act of looking away, yet now it's her eyes that remain fixed on him. Westley then moves to enter the house, carrying an armload of firewood, which he offers to her as he approaches. As she accepts the bundle, they find themselves standing in close proximity, their eyes locking and holding an intense gaze. The passage of time brings them outside Westley's modest hovel at sunset, where the red glow paints the scene of their passionate kiss. They stand together at the farm gate, ensconced in an embrace filled with warmth and mutual affection; he smiles gently at her, prompting her to respond with her own radiant smile before she throws her arms tightly around him. They kiss once more, savoring the moment, before Westley resumes his path, walking away as Buttercup stays behind, her eyes trailing after him, filled with longing. Alone in her room, Buttercup gazes out the window, her face a picture of perfection tinged with profound sadness. Meanwhile, in the main courtyard of Florin, bustling with townspeople and livestock amidst a lively marketplace, Prince Humperdinck, a man of commanding presence and regal authority, stands elevated on a castle balcony, adorned in his royal robes. Behind him stand three other figures: an elderly couple wearing crowns—the King and Queen in their twilight years—and a dark-bearded man, Count Rugen, whose strength seems to match that of the Prince. A grand staircase descends to the crowd below, and as a new figure begins to materialize at the top, the assembled onlookers collectively hold their breath in anticipation. As the staircase gradually unveils her, she emerges in the archway, descending the stairs with poise and grace, her appearance resplendent. As she moves amongst the people, an unexpected and extraordinary thing happens: with no guidance or directive, the crowd, as one, reverently lowers themselves to their knees, awed by her presence."

He has a wrapped package tucked under one arm as he immediately goes to The Kid, who is lying in bed recovering from a mild illness, and pinches his cheek. The Mother, preoccupied with household duties, ignores it and beats a retreat, and she is gone. There's an uncomfortable silence, then The Kid does his best to smile, suddenly passionate, realizing his Grandfather's visits always bring stories from distant lands and times. The two of them are together as the Grandfather sits in a chair by the bed, and the story he's reading about transforms the monochromatic look of the bedroom into the dazzling color of the English countryside, known for its rolling hills and quaint villages.

They stand near the gate to the farm, locked in an embrace; he smiles at her, a smile that promises tomorrow, she smiles too, and throws her arms tightly around him. They kiss, and then as Westley walks away, Buttercup watches him go, already counting the moments until his return. Buttercup stares out the window of her room, holding on her face, perfect and perfectly sad, reflecting a longing for days gone by. In the main courtyard of Florin, replete with townspeople from every corner of the kingdom, livestock, and a bustling marketplace offering exotic wares, Prince Humperdinck, a man of incredible power and bearing, known for his strategic mind and ambition, stands in his royal robes on a castle balcony. Three others stand behind him: an old couple with crowns, the aging King and Queen, who have ruled justly for decades, and a dark-bearded man who seems the Prince's match in strength: Count Rugen, notorious for his ruthless efficiency. A giant staircase leads to the crowd, and as a figure just begins to become visible, the crowd sees the figure and collectively holds its breath in anticipation. The staircase reveals the figure appearing in the archway, and she is resplendent as she descends the stairs and starts to move amongst the people, a vision of grace and dignity. The crowd does a very strange thing: with no instruction at all, they suddenly go to their knees, a spontaneous act of reverence for their beloved future queen."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
