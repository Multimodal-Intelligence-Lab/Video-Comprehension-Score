As soon as Malbin reaches him, Tuvia swiftly hands over the gun, placing it firmly in Malbin’s grasp before turning away without hesitation. With a sense of purpose, Tuvia takes off, running with determination to investigate, his feet moving swiftly beneath him. Upon reaching the cabin, he expertly whips back the curtain that hangs across the doorway, revealing the interior where Lilka, Bella, and Riva are gathered together with Tamara and her baby. He then strides away, carrying with him the urgency of his earlier actions. Tuvia's gaze lingers on Lilka, and as he looks at her, the tension in his face softens, melting into a more tender expression. In response to his softened demeanor, Lilka leans in and plants a firm kiss on his lips, her boldness catching him off guard. Stunned by her initiative, he looks at her with muted surprise, taking in her unflinching stance before him. Slowly, Tuvia inclines his head and gently moves his mouth towards hers once more, lightly brushing her lips, initiating a more intimate connection. As they engage in a fuller kiss, his lips curve into a smile, and they meet again in a moment of shared affection. Meanwhile, beyond some trees in the distance, a German truck filled with soldiers rumbles across a metal bridge, closely followed by a car. Hidden behind a tree, Aron remains vigilant, watching the vehicles pass with unwavering attention. Back at the camp, Shimon and Malbin are bent over their chess set, focused on their game as a message bag arrives, carried by a German courier. A crowd gathers around the blond-headed German, curiosity piqued by his presence. Tuvia checks Aron's cheek, ensuring his well-being, before sitting down at the table and opening the courier's leather case methodically. He extracts a document from the case and hands it to Shimon, who receives it with intent observation, while Malbin watches the proceedings with anxious anticipation. As the atmosphere around them grows tense, the crowd's anger begins to escalate into violence. With Tuvia’s back turned, a bearded Jew confronts a man, spitting on him in contempt, while Shelman, the man who brought him, delivers a kick to his back. Tuvia and Shimon quickly move towards the commotion, but Tuvia remains at a distance, observing as the mob takes control. The German figure is ultimately felled, succumbing to the crowd's wrath. Aron, his cheek visibly swollen, turns away from the scene. Bella, driven by anger, forcefully slams the man with the butt of her rifle, unleashing her fury. Tuvia casts a glance at Asael, their eyes meeting briefly, before he walks off, distancing himself from the unfolding chaos. Shimon and Malbin, with expressions of discomfort and disbelief, witness the mob brutally beating the man to death, their eyes dulled by the savagery they observe. Tuvia later encounters Aron sitting hunched on a moss-covered bank, his rifle resting on his lap and a hand pressed against his mouth, clearly distressed. Tuvia leans silently against a nearby tree, watching his younger brother's turmoil with a heavy heart. Asael watches the scene from afar, perceiving the gravity of the moment. As night falls, a guard patrols the camp, maintaining vigilance. Inside his cabin, enveloped in the warm glow of golden lamplight, Tuvia is seated upright in bed, bare-chested, with Lilka nestled against him, both covered by a blanket. He pulls her closer, wrapping an arm around her as they settle down to sleep, seeking comfort in each other's presence. As dawn breaks one morning, at the army camp, Zus strides purposefully into Viktor’s tent, his gaze meeting Viktor’s as he turns to acknowledge Zus's entrance. After a brief exchange, Zus turns to leave the commander's hut, maintaining his decisive pace. He strides past Lova, casting a glance skyward at a German plane slicing through the sky. At their camp, Tuvia and Malbin also catch sight of the plane, their focus drawn upwards. People begin to hurriedly pack their belongings, hastily loading guns and grenades into baskets and bags, preparing for what lies ahead. Tuvia continues to peer upward, his eyes following the plane as it changes direction ominously. With a surge of urgency, he dives towards Aron as the bomber roars overhead, a prelude to imminent danger. Panic erupts, and people scatter in all directions as bombs rain down, exploding with destructive force around them. Amidst the chaos, many are struck, and cries of pain fill the air. Tuvia and Lilka assume leadership, guiding women and children through a haze of smoke and flames towards the relative safety of the largest bunker. A woman is struck, her fall a stark reminder of the peril they face. Despite the danger, more and more people are hurriedly bundled into the shelter, seeking refuge from the onslaught."

Zus strides past Lova glancing at a German plane crossing the sky. At the camp Tuvia and Malbin see it too. People pack up their belongings guns and grenades loaded into baskets and bags. Tuvia peers up to the sky at a plane changing direction. He dives towards Aron as the bomber passes overhead. People run in all directions as bombs explode around them. Many are hit.

Lilka Bella and Riva are with Tamara and her baby. He strides away. Tuvia gazes at Lilka and his face softens. She plants a kiss on his lips. He looks at her in mute surprise. She stands in front of him unflinching. Slowly he moves his mouth towards hers lightly brushing her lips. They kiss more fully. He smiles and their lips meet again. Beyond some trees a German truck full of soldiers drives across a metal bridge followed by a car. Aron hiding behind a tree watches faithfully. At the camp Shimon and Malbin are hunched over their chess set. A message bag. a German courier. People crowd round the blond head. German. Tuvia checks Aron's cheek then sits down at the table and opens the courier's leather case. He hands a document to Shimon. Malbin watches anxiously as people's anger turns to violence. Tuvia has his back turned as a bearded Jew spits on a man and Shelman the man who brought him kicks him in the back. Tuvia and Shimon hurry over.

          "description": "Cleo paddles down to greet her. Tossing Cleo the umbrella, Nico skips off to contemplate. She flutters open a window beside the attic of a cottage. Mila, Ava, and Nora are with Clara and her kitten. She twirls away. Nico peers at Mila and his frown vanishes. She sprays a wink on his cheek. He stares at her in quiet puzzlement. She lounges beside him unfazed. Slowly he tilts his ear towards hers, barely grazing her cheek. They hug more heartily. He chuckles and their foreheads touch again. Beyond some hills, a French boat full of carpenters paddles under a stone arch followed by a bicycle. Zane, hiding under a bush, listens cautiously. At the greenhouse, Evan and Cleo are crouched over their checkerboard. A letter box, a French messenger. Creatures gather around the brunette Frenchman. Nico pats Zane’s ear, then crouches by the stove and unseals the messenger's linen pouch. He flips a scroll to Evan. Cleo listens nervously as creatures' excitement shifts to laughter. Nico has his face forward as a masked owl barks at a lady, and Omar, the lady who found him, nudges her in the shin. Nico and Evan scurry over. Nico stays at an intersection observing the group take over. The Frenchman is tripped. Zane, his ear reddened, glances down. Ava harshly taps the lady with her brush tip. Nico glances at Jules and jogs away. Evan and Cleo flinching, observe the crowd wildly brush the lady to silence, with eyes glazed and a passive demeanor. Nico stumbles upon Zane leaning slouched on a snowy mound, his brush on his knee, a glove to his chin. Nico leans beside a statue and observes his young sister's turmoil. Jules notices from afar. At dusk, a cat ambles the site. In her attic, bathed in silver moonlight, Nico is standing by a shelf bare-footed with Mila curled beside him, wrapped by a shawl. He pulls her toward him and they drift off to nap. At dawn, near the navy site, Lars stomps into Hunter's yurt. Hunter turns to Lars. Lars spins to enter the leader's tent. Lars marches past Juno, peeking at a French balloon floating the horizon. By the greenhouse Nico and Cleo spot it as well. Creatures gather up their gadgets, chairs and pans packed into carts and sacks. Nico gazes down to the ground at a balloon shifting path. He leaps towards Zane as the basket floats beneath. Creatures scatter in all paths as firecrackers burst near them. Many are tapped. Nico and Mila steer men and wildlife through the fog and water toward the smallest cave. A man is tapped. More and more creatures are pushed into the alcove."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
