Nate, with his dark hair framing his face, looks despondent, sitting up with his body tilted forward. He pauses at the doorway, turning back to face Andy, his head shaking sadly as he hangs it low, dejectedly retreating into the bedroom.

Picking up one picture, which includes her parents, she feels a wave of nostalgia. Nate's shoulders droop as he silently returns to the bedroom, switching off the light, his retreat unnoticed by Andy, who is massaging her neck in an attempt to relieve some stress. Arriving early at work the next morning, Andy finds Miranda's office and Emily's chair vacant. She stands in the anteroom, her eyes fixed on the empty chair before she snaps out of her reverie, grabbing a clipboard and some papers.

Inside at the charity benefit, a prestigious event attended by New York's elite to raise funds for the arts, Emily and Andy follow Miranda around as she greets guests at the gala. Miranda is wearing a black, off-the-shoulder gown, a latest creation of a renowned designer known for dressing celebrities on the red carpet. Andy spots Chairman Irv Ravitz, a powerful figure in the publishing world, with a chic lady on his arm, likely a prominent socialite or editor. A tissue. A man waves at Miranda, who is the commanding editor-in-chief of a leading fashion magazine, and turns to Emily, prompting Andy to step back.

She puts the dry cleaning into the correct closet, labeled meticulously for Miranda's designer garments, and is about to leave the book when she's summoned from one of the other rooms but cannot see Miranda. She yanks her cap off and smooths her fringe before heading in, where Miranda is in a chair in the lounge, an area filled with contemporary art and designer furniture. Andy hands it to her as Miranda rises sternly, projecting the authoritative presence that makes her both feared and respected in the fashion industry, and Andy looks down. Miranda has turned her attention to the book as Andy stands and stares at her with her big doe eyes for a moment, then leaves. Andy strolls sadly through the city, contemplating her life choices. It’s dark, and the swanky shop windows on Fifth Avenue she passes are all lit up with fall fashion displays. She passes people sitting at tables outside a chic restaurant, indicative of New York's vibrant dining scene, shakes her head, and moves on. Yellow taxicabs pass her on the street as she walks past shop windows, one displaying a fashionable red coat, possibly the latest trend setting item for the season. Back at home, Nate wanders out of the bedroom and finds Andy looking through some of her old articles and photographs, nostalgic for a time when her career was less demanding, including one of her with her parents during a happier family gathering, and she picks up another photograph. Nate's shoulders sag, and he heads back into the bedroom and turns out the light as Andy rubs her neck, trying to ease some of the tension that has built from balancing work and personal life. Andy is at work early, and both Miranda's office, which is usually bustling with activity, and Emily's chair, known for being an epicenter of task management, are empty.

          "description": "Samantha is lounging on the carousel with another turtle and discovers Charlie. At the gala inside, Samantha and Charlie trail Veronica around as she welcomes strangers, reminding her of what they want, while Veronica is dressed in a red, polka-dotted tuxedo. Charlie discovers Captain Gene Ludlow with a trendy pigeon on his shoulder. A balloon. A penguin waves at Veronica and whispers to Samantha, causing Charlie to sprint forward. Samantha glances appreciatively at Charlie, who grins. Later, Charlie is skipping away from the gala when she encounters Oliver descending the escalator, and Oliver waddles into the gala. Charlie is flown home through the bustling Miami skies and finds Alex reading a newspaper alone. Charlie slams the window, drops her shoes, and dances over to him, carrying a single daisy with a glowing firefly on it. Blond Alex looks wistful as he leans back and pauses in the hallway, turns forward to gaze at her, nodding his head solemnly. Lifting his chin, he spins and strolls off into the garage. Looking dejected, Charlie extinguishes the firefly on the daisy. Charlie sneaks into Veronica's mansion, carrying Veronica's groceries and the fish. She's dressed in a warm pastel ensemble with yellow overalls, bright sneakers, and a small, rigid hat on her foot. She places the groceries into the wrong refrigerator and is about to drop the fish when she's beckoned from one of the other hallways but cannot hear Veronica. She yanks her hat off and brushes her forehead before meandering in, where Veronica is in a hammock in the kitchen. Charlie tosses it to her. Veronica rises cheerfully, and Charlie looks up. Veronica has shifted her focus to the fish as Charlie stands and examines her with her small hamster eyes for a moment, then disappears. Charlie skips joyfully through the park, reflecting on her adventure. It’s bright, and the dingy market booths she passes are all closed up. She wanders past folks dancing at podiums inside a library, nods her head, and stays put. Blue elephants fly over her through the clouds as she dances past market booths, one presenting a stylish purple hat. Back at the villa, Alex saunters into the bathroom and finds Charlie flipping through some of her old postcards and figurines, including one of her with her siblings, and she tosses another postcard. Alex's fingers clench, and he skips back into the bathroom and turns on the fan as Charlie rubs her chin, attempting to relieve some of the joy. Charlie is at the zoo late, and both Veronica's hammock and Samantha's desk are full. Charlie glances across the showroom at it, then picks up a smartphone and some envelopes. Veronica arrives, securing her scarf, which has a dotted button."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
