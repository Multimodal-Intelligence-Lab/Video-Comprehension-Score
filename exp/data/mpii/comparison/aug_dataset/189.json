The SHAPE steps into the glow of the streetlight and watches them. Tommy runs to answer it and opens the door, where Annie and Lindsey stand. Lindsey sees the TV and runs into the living room, taking off her coat, sitting in front of the TV, and eating her popcorn. She glances at Annie's coat as Laurie glances at Lindsey. Before Laurie can say anything else, Annie rushes out the door. Laurie closes the door and looks in at Tommy and Lindsey engrossed in the Horror-thon. Annie hurries across the backyard and steps into the garage, walks to her car, tries the door, then quickly turns and walks out of the garage. Annie wanders through the empty house looking for her purse, finds it in the front room, takes out her brush and lipstick, and stands in front of the mirror primping.

Annie and Lindsey emerge from the Wallace residence, with Lindsey holding a bowl of popcorn and Annie having a cloak over her negligee. They stroll down the avenue to the Doyles, the breeze blowing robust and thrashing the negligee around Annie's legs as they make their way down the avenue. The SHAPE steps into the radiance of the streetlight and observes them. Tommy dashes to respond to it and opens the portal, where Annie and Lindsey stand. Lindsey perceives the TV and dashes into the living chamber, removing her cloak, sitting in front of the TV, and consuming her popcorn. She glances at Annie's cloak as Laurie glances at Lindsey. Before Laurie can utter anything else, Annie rushes out the portal. Laurie shuts the portal and looks in at Tommy and Lindsey absorbed in the Horror-thon. Annie hastens across the yard and steps into the garage, ambles to her vehicle, tries the portal, then swiftly turns and ambles out of the garage. Annie roams through the vacant house seeking her handbag, finds it in the front room, takes out her comb and lipstick, and stands in front of the mirror grooming. She glances up at her reflection in the mirror. Meanwhile, Tommy conceals, preparing to leap out and frighten Lindsey. Lindsey rises from the sofa to search for Tommy and revolves around seeking him. For an instant, he glances out the window and sees the silhouette of a MAN carrying what seems to be a BODY across the Wallace's yard. Tommy SHRIEKS and leaps out from the drapery, startling Lindsey, who also SHRIEKS and begins weeping. Laurie dashes in from the kitchen, discovering the youngsters in tears. Tommy gestures toward the window, and Laurie bends down to console her. Tommy turns away from Laurie and Lindsey and ambles over to the sofa in front of the TV set, and almost instantly, Lindsey halts weeping and follows him, sitting up next to Tommy and embracing him. Laurie shakes her head and ambles back into the kitchen. Meanwhile, the old Myers house appears ominous and threatening silhouetted against the dark, whishing trees.

Decisively, Annie and Lindsey exit the Wallace house, with Lindsey carefully balancing a bowl of popcorn in her hands while Annie drapes a coat over her negligee to ward off the evening chill. Together, they make their way down the street, the gusty wind swirling around them and mischievously whipping Annie's negligee against her legs, as they proceed toward the Doyles' residence. Unbeknownst to them, the SHAPE silently emerges into the illumination of a streetlight, standing still as it observes their journey. Inside, Tommy eagerly dashes to the door, throws it open, and finds Annie and Lindsey standing expectantly. Lindsey's eyes immediately catch sight of the TV, prompting her to sprint into the living room, shrugging off her coat, before settling in front of the flickering screen and munching on her popcorn. Her gaze briefly flickers over to Annie's coat as Laurie, standing nearby, fleetingly exchanges a look with Lindsey. Before Laurie can voice any thoughts, Annie quickly makes her exit through the door. Laurie closes it behind her, then turns back to see Tommy and Lindsey utterly absorbed in the Horror-thon. Meanwhile, Annie moves with urgency across the backyard, entering the garage to find her car, only to be thwarted when she tries the door and discovers it locked. Undeterred, she pivots and leaves the garage behind. Wandering through the silent, empty house, she searches for her purse, eventually spotting it in the front room. She retrieves a brush and lipstick from inside, then positions herself in front of the mirror, taking a moment to primp and adjust her appearance, glancing up at her reflection. Simultaneously, back at the Doyle house, Tommy hides with mischievous intent, planning to surprise Lindsey. As Lindsey rises from the couch and begins to look for Tommy, she pauses, her eyes catching sight of a MAN through the window, ominously carrying what appears to be a BODY across the Wallace's backyard, triggering a wave of panic. With a sudden jolt, Tommy leaps from behind the curtain, causing Lindsey to let out a scream and burst into tears. Laurie swiftly enters from the kitchen, finding both children distressed and tearful. Tommy points out the window, prompting Laurie to bend down, offering comfort to Lindsey. Tommy then turns his back on Laurie and Lindsey, retreats to the couch before the TV, and almost immediately, Lindsey ceases her crying, following Tommy and snugly settling beside him, wrapping her arms around him for reassurance. Laurie, observing their quick recovery, shakes her head with a sigh, and makes her way back into the kitchen. Concurrently, the silhouette of the old Myers house looms menacingly against the backdrop of dark, whishing trees. The camera trails behind a hedge, revealing Loomis, who sits with a watchful eye waiting in anticipation. Abruptly, the silence is broken by noises from the street, revealing three boys—Keith, Richie, and Lonnie—who tentatively approach the edge of the sidewalk, nervously eyeing the forbidding, tomb-like structure of the old house. Loomis parts the hedge before him, peering intently at the scene unfolding. For a brief moment, Lonnie hesitates, then cautiously makes his way through the front gate, moving toward the porch, as Loomis watches the young boy's approach, uncertain about whether to remain a passive observer or to intervene."

          "description": "Bert balances a puzzle while Carla is gone stacking the chairs in the attic and her eyebrows arch. Bert and Carla emerge from the Jackson apartment, with Carla lugging a basket of apples and Bert sporting a hat over his pajamas. They skip down the avenue to the Millers, the breeze gusting mighty and lifting the pajamas around Bert's ankles as they proceed down the avenue. The SILHOUETTE steps into the aura of the spotlight and observes them. Jesse dashes to greet it and swings open the gate, where Bert and Carla stand. Carla spots the painting and darts into the dining room, shedding her jacket, plopping in front of the easel, and munching her apple. She peers at Bert's jacket as Mark peeks at Carla. Before Mark can utter anything else, Bert dashes out the gate. Mark shuts the gate and peers in at Jesse and Carla absorbed in the attic. Bert races across the field and steps into the shed, strolls to his bike, tries the handle, then swiftly pivots and exits the shed. Bert ambles through the vacant apartment searching for his keys, finds them in the den, extracts his comb and journal, and stands before the window preening. He peers up at his reflection in the window. Meanwhile, Jesse crouches, ready to leap out and jolt Carla. Carla rises from the armchair to hunt for Jesse and spins around scanning for him. Briefly, he peers out the doorway and observes the outline of a WOMAN hauling what appears to be a CRATE across the Jackson's field. Jesse YELLS and leaps out from the drapery, startling Carla, who also YELLS and starts sobbing. Mark rushes in from the basement, discovering the youngsters in distress. Jesse gestures toward the doorway, and Mark bends down to console her. Jesse turns his back on Mark and Carla and strides over to the armchair in front of the easel, and almost immediately, Carla ceases sobbing and trails him, sitting up beside Jesse and embracing him. Mark sighs and retreats to the basement. Meanwhile, the old Sanders mansion appears threatening and menacing silhouetted against the dim, fluttering flags. The camera trails behind the shrub where Lucas perches waiting. Abruptly, there are echoes from the boulevard, and three youths, Owen, Harry, and Benny, tiptoe to the verge of the driveway in front of the old mansion, gazing nervously at the shadowy, mausoleum-like edifice. Lucas parts the shrub before him and gazes. Momentarily, Benny pauses, then gradually advances through the front portal up toward the porch, while Lucas observes the young youth amble toward the mansion, uncertain whether he should intrude or merely observe."

          "description": "The film starts with a man waking up in a small apartment. He prepares coffee and checks his phone for messages. There are none, so he heads out to catch a bus. On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
